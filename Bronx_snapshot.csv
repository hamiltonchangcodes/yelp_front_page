0,none,none,none,"Ok so imma start with a Thank You to my waitress Cynthia and the Manager Mae for their great recommendations. This was my first time here and I was not disappointed.I'm a very picky eater so for me to go to a Latin Asian Fusion restuarant I was praying the food would be great.I follow you'll on IG and seeing the pictures of the food I was like I have to go there.As soon as I walked in I was greated and seated right away.So to get to my delicious food.To start my meal off i had the Lycheetini, now I've never eaten or drank anything lychee.The mix of the vodka, lychee puree and the coconut puree was just masterful.The creaminess of the purees with the vodka was just .Mae recommended the Eel Roll and Cynthia recommended the Lycheetini.So I went with the Eel Roll and The Shrinp Tempura Roll.The sauce that came on the plates of the rolls was a great balance of sweetness to the rolls, I was ready to lick the plate clean lol.I've never eaten Eel before to for this to be my first time I was not disappointed.I was reaching for another piece and realized it was all gone lolTo close out my meal I got the Cold Sake Bomb.The bomb had a nice sweet creamy but dry fell to it. I actually liked it more then I thought I would.Thank You Shangi Red, Mae and Cynthia for a great experience.P.S. I got the Teriyaki Salmon Bento Box to Go!!","I was really conflicted in writing this review because I wanted to love this place , I was excited to see that a Latin Asian fusion restaurant was coming to the neighborhood. I decided to visit on Sunday with my 2 daughters for dinner . We got a weird vibe even before we got out of the cab because there were a lot of guys in the front , we weren't sure If they were arguing or just hanging out .We make our way around the crowd into the restaurant there was no one there to greet us. We looked around to see if there was a host then all of a sudden, from behind us came this guy which I guess was the manager that was outside with the crowd. He brought us to a table next to the bar where other patrons were smoking hookah. That was a no no for me . They had a DJ it was really loud in there where we couldn't even hold a conversation. We order about 5 appetizers, the waiter comes back to tell us that they ran out of 3 appetizers. - WTH !! I didn't understand how you can run out of so many things . We ordered 2 lychee martinis and the Vivir soñando which took forever to get when we finally receive the drinks I see that they have a really pretty flower in the martinis I guess that's why they charge you $14!!!!!The drinks were not even cold and a really small martini glass not worth the price . Now let's go back to the Appetizers- ordered Thai wings - a lot of breading, Cuban egg rolls, ok but Luke warm Ropa Vieja empanadas,- good. Ribs - we had to return they were undercooked . My daughter ordered a sprite it was flat taste like Alka seltzer !! We returned it opted out for a coke which was also flat no carbonation! The manager comes by and asked what's wrong- I told him the soda issues and the ribs he apologized and said he would check. 10 min later he comes back and says he checked the wells downstairs and they seem to be fine . He's not sure why it taste the way it did . I asked did you taste it for yourself to see ??? He said yes then proceeded to say it must be the gun and that your not going to get a lot of carbonation out of a gun like a can !!! Are you serious ?? I've dined in many places and bars where they use a gun and the sodas are not flat !!! That was not cool at all it's like he didn't believe us . Now we get our food needless to say ok nothing to brag about .  I ordered the coconut chicken with fried rice , mind you on the menu it says Coconut fried chicken i got grilled chicken with a chipotle sauce which was good but not hot , the best thing was the fried rice it was delicious. My daughters ordered Shrimp pad Thai which she did not eat - she said it didn't taste good at all and she didn't have any noodles just some shrimp and a lot of veggies! At this point we didnt even mention it to the manager when he stopped by to ask how our meals were . I was already exhausted from the whole experience. Our bill was $126 which was not worth it at all. I'm very sad to say I will not be returning until they get it together. I'm giving this place 3 stars for the decor , and our waiter Juan was very sweet and informative and the Dj played good tunes even though we thought it was too loud for a Sunday night. This place is very confusing I thought I was coming to a restaurant but it looked like a lounge/ hookah bar / club .","Note: This is a review for delivery, not dining in. The delivery estimate of 45-65 min was accurate, as food arrived in 65 minutes. I'm not too into ""fusion"" food in general, but delivery options in the Bronx are very slim, so we decided to give this place a try. We ordered: Thai Chili Wings ($12) - I was initially impressed that they had not dressed the wings prior to sending them, thinking ""Oh, that's thoughtful. They just put the sauce on the side so the wings can stay nice and crunchy before I dress them."" The salty wings were room temperature and so wet that they were soggy. The sweet Thai sauce tasted like store-bought chili sauce mixed with duck sauce and did not taste Thai-flavored at all. 1/5Pad Thai ($15) - for $15, it was an exceedingly small portion that didn't even fill the takeout container halfway (see picture). It was very veggie-heavy, which I'd be fine with if this was actually pad-thai, which it wasn't. It had soggy cashews mixed in (huh?), a handful of shrimp, and wide, over-cooked soggy noodles lightly stir-fried in a ton of soy sauce that tasted more like Chinese food than Thai. 1.5/5Spicy Salmon Roll ($8) - Typically spicy salmon rolls are about $5-7, so this was on the pricier side, especially when you take into consideration that the amount of salmon in there was VERY light. Also, this was more of an avocado-salmon roll than a spicy salmon roll, because the salmon was not dressed. Also, it was body-temperature from sitting in a bag with once-hot food, and the fish did not taste or smell fresh. I would not say that it had gone bad, but on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being super-duper fresh and 10 being rotten, I'd say this was a 6.5. I don't mess around with not-fresh sushi, so I had to toss this. Also, no soy sauce was included.  0/5Shanghai Burger with Yucca fries ($14). I ordered this burger well-done, because I generally don't trust undercooked ground beef from most restaurants. The burger that came to me was not only not-well-done, but it was bordering on raw. It was so rare, as a matter of fact, that the fat in the ground beef was still white (see picture). Yucca fries were wet and soggy but still hard in the centers. 0/5Overall, I was unhappy with the food I received. Our meal came out to over $60 (!!!!!) with tip plus a $3.50 delivery fee, and there was not a single item that we enjoyed, and the majority of the meal had to be thrown away (we ended up having to order a pizza). Obviously this is just one person's opinion, but at the very least, my two cents is that this restaurant needs to re-think their delivery containers and the timing of their delivery. If their food is sitting in a car for 40 minutes inside unvented plastic containers, there is no way that the sushi isn't getting warm and all their hot meals are turning into mush from the condensation. TBH, not sure how much better the food would be if eaten fresh out of the kitchen, but for sure, I would not personally recommend this restaurant for delivery.",Shanghai Red Asian Latin Bistro
1,none,none,none,"New season, new clubhouse, and new menu from The Waterfront NYC at Trump Golf Links Ferry Point.Right in our own Bronx backyard is a beautiful getaway, whether you play golf or not, overlooking the Whitestone and Throggs Neck bridges.  Enjoy the new clubhouse with inside and outside patio dining, crystal chandelier event hall, and a huge stunning fully stocked bar. We started out with the ""Eggplant Dip"" with plenty of grilled pita bread for dipping. Really nice noshing with our Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling picked from their extraordinary wine list. Our superb server, Fabian, helped us with our selections and was very attentive.  Gorgeously  plated in a deep blue bowl, the ""Avocado Bowl""  was filled with Tabbouleh and a perfectly grilled avocado atop, adorned with spring vegetables and a light and perfect lemon basil vinaigrette.  The favorite dish hands down, was the ""Blackened Snapper"", which was so tender yet had a beautiful, crispy, and blackened skin, accompanied by Kimchi black rice, edamame, baby radishes, and a beautiful honey sesame vinaigrette! They are introducing a more extensive menu next week and will be taking reservations for Mother's Day!  Also, like last year , they will be starting during Summer, their amazing Sunday brunch with live music, and their popular lobster bakes.","This perfect Lobster Roll is brought to you by The Waterfront NYC! I started with a nice ""Ash & Smoke"" cocktail with Altos Blanco, Ginger Beer, Smoked Paprika and Lime. When my ""Lobster Roll"" arrived I was honestly blown away by the amount of Lobster! It was a half a Lobster with delta slaw, corn, heirloom tomatoes and a drizzle of dill oil 21. It was THE BEST LOBSTER ROLL I EVER DEVOURED! Ahem... sorry for yelling but I get very passionate about great food!  Throw in a gorgeous view and top service and it's right here  in our own back yard of Da Bronx! Stop in for lunch one day and take a vacation! Lobster bake Wednesday's and Weekend Brunches also. Call for reservations.","Came here on a September Saturday night. Place wasn't packed and was able to have a nice table outside. Food was amazing. Fish tacos were out of this world. I had the burger and it was massive and cooked to perfection. Highly recommend. My boyfriend had the scallops and I tasted those as well, and they were perfect. Great spot for a date night.",The Waterfront NYC
2,none,"This place has kind of fallen off, IMO. The last time we came here, we brought my hubby's cousin since he was visiting from Florida. We had a good table, the staff was nice and accommodating but the food was horrible compared to my prior visits.They completely messed up our appetizer orders, giving us the wrong proteins with our tostone sliders. They looked pretty but they were not made right.I ordered their oxtail risotto because, that's the dish that had me in love with the place when I first visited. Unfortunately, this time it was far too salty and the risotto was way overdone. Since I was starving, I just ate what I could because, if you know me and my reviews, I never order anything else if I have to send a dish back to the kitchen. I'll sit and starve and then pick up something from somewhere else (don't judge).We've had 50/50 experiences since my vey first visit but I think this will he the last time we give them another shot. From what I've heard, they've changed chefs and that could be the reason for the inconsistency. Either way, Travesias won't be my next stop.",none,"I came here with family, a large group at that. This restaurant served us well. It's based, from what I understand, on the premise that they have traversed many lands and countries, and have fused the foods from those countries onto various dishes. The premise of this restaurant as a result, tends to create very delicious food ideas. Who would've thought a burger with sweet plantain (plátano maduros) would taste great? It did take a while for our food to arrive, given the large size of the party, and a few people that were there besides us. The food was served well on nice plates, and the restaurant was overall clean. I had no issues in general. I'd return again.",none,"My girlfriend called me up and wanted to meet for an early supper at Travesias. Upon entry, we were given a very nice table and I'm assuming it's because she's a regular so they hooked us up. The server came to the table quickly and took our orders. They have some decent specials but we went with a bottle of Tempranillo for the table. We started with the Passion Ceviché, which was very good. The portion was small but it was served in a tiny, cute mini mason jar. I liked the flavor. As we do at most outings together, we ordered a slew of items to share. We had the French Avocados which are basically huge slices of deep-fried avocado and they were crunchy on the outside but creamy inside and flavorful. We also had the Golden Crab which are basically crab wantons. They were ok but the Argentinian Steak Pinchos were tender and wonderful! We also shared an order of the Oxtail Risotto which I would have to say, was an interesting take on risotto. The oxtail meat was tender and full of flavor, as was most everything we had; the risotto was creamy and not too cheesy. I was happy with that selection. The staff very attentive. We had a great meal and I would definitely make a return visit with hubby and my son.",Travesias
3,none,none,none,"on a consistent basisI can ALWAYS say I have a good dining experience. So let me just jump into it with the pros + few cons. PROS - ambiance- music- staff are attentive (when possible) /warm/ considerate-the dinks are ALWAYS mixed well + have just enough liquor to get you right.- the food is good. not great but good for the price. strong 8/10CONS- seating outside is a bit wobbly - food is a Lil pricey -gets really crowed - loud environment  As mentioned in most of the other comments the staff is very sweet. Especially the hostess. Her name is (arcadia / sorry if I butchered that) but she is really accommodating and cares for the customers.The waitress was nice too (i didn't get her name) but she moves really quick so you better know what you want lmao. The food was good. I ordered the lobster tail with the Maduro fried rice + a side of mashed potatoes and beans. The potatoes looked delicious but were so bland and the lobster was a bit overcooked but good nonetheless.my Bf ordered the churrasco and maduro fried rice and he loved it. All in all, I've eaten here 3 different times and I can honestly say I've enjoyed my experience all those times. would recommend","It's quite fitting that this is my 1000th review.I came here with my husband's family to honor my late brother in law on the one year anniversary of his passing. We just came back from visiting his final resting place and wanted to grab something to eat, catch up and turn the day into a more joyous occasion.We were a very large group and despite having reservations, we ended up having to wait for around 25 minutes because of a group that was taking a very long time to exit the premises. When we were finally seated we were able to relax and enjoy ourselves.Our server was really on point. She was able to take care of all of our orders without issue. I had the steak and eggs which I suggest to any and everyone. It was amazeballs and came with the sexiest of white rices, all seasoned and yummy. Hubby had their ropa vieja which sat on top of a sweet arepa and he loved it. Everyone really enjoyed the food and since it was one of the first times in a long time I had some strong drinks, the sangria was hitting hard.The day turned out exactly how everyone would have wanted, with the family together, enjoying a meal, laughing, taking pictures, getting tipsy and having a good time. I need to go back there for some more of that rice. It was too damn good.","Yes, 3 stars for East Tremont!T-bone was well prepped and cooked perfectly. String beans were great, with a lil crisp. Mangu was creamy but lacked flavor. Service was good. We tipped well and then left.So the nit pick? My Tito's and seltzer with a splash of cranberry in a small, rock glass? Should be a highball so I only had one.Anyway, if you're looking for solid Latin food, this spot is an option.",Havana Cafe
4,none,none,none,Love the food in this off Arthur Street spot.  Had chicken sorrentino and Riley had the homemade gnocchi and we shared a cold antipasto.   Tiramisu and NY cheesecake and coffee for dessert. We will be back for,I was in the Bronx area yesterday and was really craving Italian food. I'm not to familiar with the area so I went to yelp for a good suggestion and ended up finding Antonio's Trattoria. This is such a old fashion Italian restaurant that you need to visit while here. The guy who I believe was the owner was out front in the bar and he seems like the man. We got situated and they immediately brought out this warm bread which was amazing with olive oil and crushed red pepper. The menu was actually very reasonable in price because I thought it was going to be insanely expensive. Food was amazing and so classic. Made me feel right at home. If your looking for that authentic NY Italian feel you have to go through Antonio's.,"We came in not knowing what to expect and we were immediately greeted by friendly Joey!We absolutely loved our meals and Joey was the sweetest, happily singing happy birthday, opera style at what seemed like every table.  I had the pasta and pollo.  It was different and tasty with bites of chicken breast, swimming in lemon sauce.My fiancé had the orecchiette with broccoli rabe.  We added sausage and that made the dish perfecto!  On our way out, Joey stopped us to give us warm hugs and complimentary limoncellos.  What an incredibly hospitable man!  Don't forget Viv and Will, Joey!We had a beautiful date night and it was full of laughter and warm people.  We highly recommend!",Antonio's Trattoria
5,none,none,none,"Update:Still my favorite spot in my hood. But they changed their brunch deal from a $9 charge for two hours of unlimited drinks to $20. They do have a $40 brunch option now that includes unlimited drinks and a 3 course meal but if you want to pick your own meal, that's not in the brunch special, and have a boozy brunch you're paying $20. I still really enjoy this place but a reason why I love it is because of the affordability.  The prices are increasing all around and I hope it continues to be as affordable and high quality as it is now Lunch specials every week day for $6- can't be beat. Drinks are always good. My favs are the rum punch and mango mojito. And the service is always great. Great for happy hour,lunch, or dinner with friends if you're into Latin cuisine","Lunch specials every week day for $6- can't be beat. Drinks are always good.

We arrived after 4pm (after brunch had ended) but there were still several brunch parties still wrapping up. The vibe is lively, loud, and ""Sunday Funday""-esque in every sense of the word! (If you're looking for a mellow experience this isn't it.) For our appetizer we shared the mini empanadas, and asked for them to be mixed (with chicken, beef, and spinach with cheese.) Our main courses were the fried lobster tail and seafood paella, both of which were DELICIOUS! The portions were huge and after eating all That I possibly could fit, I took the rest to go. We washed it down with the Top Shelf Mojito (with Hennessy) and the Rum Punch. Both were potent and delicious.I look forward to coming back soon to partake in the brunch (of course!)",Havana Cafe
6,none,none,none,Check in if you're planning to sit in. It's worth the wait and the experience. The food is traditional home cooked Dominican food.  The service is excellent. The food will leave you satisfied and craving your next visit. Definitely try chimi slider !,"I Have Been Wanting To Visit This Place For A While Now , but because they close at 8 I haven't gotten the chance. Decided to Go This Past Friday Since I Got off Work Early. Got There At 625 They Told us The Wait Would Be 45min-1hr, We Didn't Get Seated till a little over 730 , and got My Food at 827 ‍ So Of Course The 2hr Wait is a bit much , I ordered the Camarones Mofongo which was cold and just a tad bit over due in the garlic. The Service isn't too great we had to change tables and thank god we did because the waiter we got was much more accommodating then the first and faster Truly sucks having to deal with sucky service, cold food and extremely long wait time because the food looks amazing , I'll try to go back maybe not on a Friday and not when I'm starving ‍","Will be back again. Great food and flavored to point. Good price. True Dominican restaurant, small narrow but quaint. Meals in small cast iron skillets, drinks in light aluminum cups, completely the humble side to a Dominican touch. The menu varies on days of the week which if you don't know the menu and want berenjena asada which is what I ordered, you would need to know which day of the week they offer it. Menu could be bigger. Restaurant is small for the amount of hype it has. Waiting is long. We went at 1pm and were seated by 2pm. Staff is very laid back. On the slow side to clear tables and get the waitlist moving. The place closes at 8pm so for people looking for a late dinner it's impossible. Must get more backed up the waitlist on the weekends. I enjoyed the dish I had. My husband ordered the mofongo and he said it was ok. He also had concon with guandules en coco which he liked a lot. Concon is the hard part of the rice at the bottom of the pot for those who have no clue. Decor is quite nice, gives you a feeling of being away in the Caribbean. Next time I will put myself in the waitlist on yelp prior to arriving to earn time.",Ajo & Oregano
7,none,none,none,One of the best diners hands down! I would come here often as my school was down the block. Breakfast and lunch this place was my stop! We would take turns making runs over to George's! I found myself thinking about it today as I no longer live in the Bronx and while the diners in LI are great none compare to George's. Everything I've eaten has been amazing! Their seasoned French fries a must! Chicken fingers and their honey mustard yum!!! I love their sandwiches! Their BLT is the best! Fresh and packed full of delicious bacon! I mean the amount they put woozer! Packed full of goodness! They give you plenty of food here so you can easily share a dish! Finally recommend this diner!,The food here is good and the service was swift. I ordered a pizza burger deluxe and my bf ordered a turkey burger deluxe. The portions were larger than I expected. Overall a good dining experience!,Me and my husband hadn't been to a diner in a long time I was in the mood for pancakes saw reviews on yelp about this place and decided to try it. So happy we did!

9,none,"Damn near perfect. The wait time is worth it, the food is seasoned very well, the staff are beyond nice, and they have great variety.My ONLY disappointment is how quickly they run out of some product. The issue is, it is so damn good it's frustrating when you are craving it but the next batch won't be ready for hours or the next DAY. HOWEVER, better that then them going out of business by overspending on product that goes to waste or compromising on quality. My advice, grab a Margherita and some eggplant empanadas because YUMMM. Also, that green sauce on the table is liquid crack.","Delicious Colombia Food! ""Parrillada mixta!

10,none,none,none,"One word to describe this restaurant. FAMILY. The place was packed, we found out half the place was family and friends who were there for the owner's son graduation. Fantastic! I am very happy that we have a good Italian restaurant back in the neighborhood after the one that was there closed down. The owner's wife was our server and she did a wonderful job considering it was the first time she waitressed. Ok, the food.... delicious and generous portions. The chicken parm was cooked perfectly with a light sauce. I am ecstatic that there we have our Italian neighborhood restaurant back. I hope they they get set up with grubhub so I can order online. The only recommendation is to have a worker near the door to greet the customers. With all good stuff going on , you might not see a customer come in. If you are in the Pelham Bay area stop in and give it a chance. It's a new place and family run so forgive any little issues, you'll enjoy the food and people and that's what its all about...right? God bless and good luck!","Taking over the old spot under the El held by Luca's for years the Orrico's have lightened up the decor and put together a nice menu for a solid neighborhood eatery.We started with the Italian Egg Rolls ( Broccoli Rabe , sausage and mozzarella) as an appetizer .Chicken Francese was done well - two full cutlets Cavatelli with Ragu and shaved Ricotta Salada was a great combination of sweet sauce and tart cheeseAnd my Orichiette with Broccoli Rabe and sausage was as good as any I've had.","Orrico's Italian RestaurantWe were saddened at the news that Lucca's Italian restaurant was closing. After it was Joe Nina's, a special lady, Lucia had taken it over and had many loyal customers. But we were hopefully at the prospect of a new owner. I was very excited when I saw how stunning the transformation was both outside and inside! They retained the brick mirrored wall but introduced complimenting brick on the other wall with new flooring, modern sconce lighting and tables with black formal covered chairs! The menus were bound with a nice selection of both Italian classic dishes and new unusual dishes!Our server ""Adele"" was very friendly and attentive and brought our drinks and bread service quickly. The bread was a nice crusty Italian bread with butter. I'm sure if you wanted seasoned oil for your bread they would accommodate you. We started with the ""Dirty Chips"" which sounded interesting but wasn't sure I would like the combination of their homemade potato chips topped with Gorgonzola meat sauce and chopped meatball and tomatoes.  Well let me tell you, this dish was addictive! I could not stop eating it! It was like Italian Nachos on steroids!! You have to try them. It was hard to pick an entree since everything sounded amazing!  We decided on their Chicken Parmignia  and a side portion of pasta and their signature Orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe.  Both entrees were huge portions, plated beautifully and reasonably priced. They were perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious!! Even though we were stuffed, we had to try one of their homemade desserts! They have several flavors of homemade Ice Cream, and several homemade pies and their decadent homemade cheesecake! Other desserts were also available. We had the Cinnamon Smash which was insane! Fresh made, piping hot cinnamon buns with a huge scoop of their rich creamy Cinnamon Ice Cream!!! I think I've found nirvana in the Bronx!I can't wait to go back and try their other menu items such as their stuffed meat and mozzarella rice balls, Clams Posillipo, Meatball Ricotta Parmignia, Rigatoni Orrico, Baked Ziti with Baby Meatballs, Cavatelli with Sunday Gravy, Pork Chops with Vinegar Peppers, boneless Ribeye Steak or Chicken Pilliard! I could go on and on! We met one of the owners and Chef, Robert Orricco who grew up in the neighborhood and has had a lot of experience in the restaurant business and jumped at the chance to open his own restaurant when he heard this location was available!  They are open everyday except Monday and will be having their formal grand opening shortly.

11,none,none,none,"This is definitely the best Thai food that I have had in NYC. Unlike many places, it is actually run by real Thai people, and they know what they are doing. Half my family lives in Thailand, so I'm very familiar with what's real and what's an imitation.

12,none,none,none,"I have to admit that I was super skeptical about eating from a food cart- I am not the type and have questions of hygiene.I had many colleagues at Einstein that recommended their food many times,  but I didn't get to try until lately.It is located in front of Montefiore Weiler hospital and while staying here we got to try it for the first time. They look super organized, clean and friendly. I ate chicken and lamb over rice - it has some salad on the side. It was super delicious and the prices are very reasonable for their huge portions.My criteria with a restaurant to go back or not is  whether if I get stomach ache or not and I have never had a problem with this place after three times of ordering same food.Always tasty, always hot and prepared fresh.Frankly I am a fan now and will definitely keep going back for lunch and dinner I guess!","The best Halal truck in the Bronx. I have ordered from the truck a handful of times. I have never had a bad experience. The lines can be quite long at times, however if you call ahead and have it prepared it will be a 1,2,3 pick up job. The Chicken and/or Lamb lover rice is to die for. The chicken and lamb is well seasoned and cooked to perfection. It is not dry as you would receive on some other trucks. It comes with rice and you can add pita. The white sauce and hot sauce are delicious and are a great compliment to the chicken, lamb over rice. I have also had the gyro as well and it just perfect. The pita bread is soft.The only think that I did not like that I have had there was the burger. It wasn't a flavor issue. It was a texture and the the way that it was assembled. The fries can get soggy if you are traveling a good distance however they are seasoned well. I would definitely recommend this food truck for it's Chicken and Rice dishes.",Walked by this place several times and always wondered was the food good. Received several recommendations to eat here. I was not disappointed. The food was really good. Usually when I pass by the lines are really long. A good sign that the food is good. Came by today and it was empty. Was able to place my order and get it quickly. Food was really good. Food was fresh and the drinks were cold. Would eat here again.,Chicken Vs Lamb
13,"This was my second time coming to Mamajuana in the Bronx this time was for brunch. The brunch is a steal, 29.99 including appetizer, entree(salmon) and unlimited whatever(I chose rum punch)Everything was amazing except for my croquettes. I don't even remember how I scarfed that damn food off my plate. They also serve hookah for brunch and have outside seating on the sidewalk so that was a double plus. Like most restaurants that serve hookah, it's separate from the restaurant and they only take cash. They also did not want our money as they never came back for a refill. Our server was not as attentive as I would've liked but there was a little lady walking around and anything I whispered would magically appear on the table. She was incredible so the 4 stars is for her.","Mama Juana was a complete disaster. Staff is ridiculously slow and unable to communicate well with guests due to their incompetence. We had to wait about 45 minutes for drinks and an additional hour for food. Our waiter never came to check on us, he was mia throughout the night. We gave them 3 debit cards and were returned only two. Had to wait an additional hour to have my card returned. We removed the gratuity from our check and they still charged us a 20% gratuity. Our waiter had the audacity to tell me ""what's up with that?"" regarding removing the gratuity. The environment is horrible, overcrowded with hookahs at every table, crowd is pretty ghetto. Surprisingly food was good but I would never go there again. If you like class and good service go elsewhere. This place is ran by idiots, the manager was unprofessional as well. This is in response to William from mamajuana, our waiters name was Eric (name on the receipt) and I don't recall the name of the woman who assisted us when I asked for the manager. She had several beaded necklaces on and blond hair. We went 9/22 (Thursday) and it was around 11:30pm.","Mama Juana was a complete disaster.

14,none,none,Went there with family expecting some good food well it wasn't we we're very disappointed with the taste the beef stew came in a interesting kettle though it was extremely salty not good or safe for anyone suffering from high blood pressure and the qavapi was bland nothing like what I'm used to eating then came the bill which was a shocker considering how expensive everything was like the beef stew $24 for a small dish like that is insane then we asked for Ajvar because every other place serves that with Qavapi except this place nope they charge extra for a scoop in one of those ketchup cups and at $7 each also insane so my experience here was not good and I wouldn't recommend it because of the so so food and ridiculous prices plenty of better places on author ave and more reasonably priced menus anyways that's my opinion to each is own,"This chef is a professional. The avgolemono (lemon/egg/chicken) soup has a delightful flavor and delicate texture, down to the carefully shredded chicken pieces. The dressing on the Greek salad is tasty, just what you want from a Greek salad, with high-quality feta, cucumbers, and kalamata olives, as well as decent tomatoes. The flavor complexity peak is the Tave Dheu Tironse, a beef stew. It's thick, darkly creamy, maybe chocolate-y, and again, perfectly textured. No boulders of beef floating in a weak brew. Add to this an immaculate dining room with new furniture, a sweet server (Julie), a basket of toothsome homemade break, and a pleasant atmosphere. I'll be back soon and regularly.",It's a such a cute spot in the Bronx and the food is pretty good. My favorite was the melted cheese (obviously you can't go wrong with that lol) and the chicken paidakia. The fries that came on the side were the best I have had in soo long! I also got the chicken creamy sauce dish with vegetables and rice. While the sauce was amazing the chicken was kinda chewy. I wish the chicken was a little more tender and then the meal would have been perfection. The service was great. I definitely recommend checking out this spot. Parking can be tough but we just ended up parking on one of the side streets about 3 minutes away.,none,SOFRA  - Traditional Greek & Albanian cuisine
15,none,none,none,"I just love that there are so many great food places in the Bronx now. The Bronx public is definitely one of them. I go for the food, drinks and great service. There is also music and a fun atmosphere. Different varieties of bar games are available. The restaurant is decorated with Bronx memorabilia, including hip hop facts. I visited The Bronx Public today. My waiter was Lucas. He took our drink orders right away. Our drinks arrived in a matter of a few minutes. Our food order was swift also. He remembered the little details as well. I ordered the garlic chili wings and a basket of fries. The sauce on the wings was definitely more sweet than spicy the way I prefer. The fries were crisp and lightly salted. This is probably my 6th or 7th visit. I will definitely go to the Bronx Public again.","This place isn't bad but it didn't win me over. What I enjoyed the most was the games they have available to play. I came with my girlfriend and we decided to play Giant Uno, which I proceeded to kick her a** in! We went on a Sunday evening and the atmosphere was very chill.As an appetizer, we ordered the nachos. They were good but not great. It tasted very similar to a sloppy Joe. The nachos come with chili, cheese, sour cream, and some jalapenos. If I were to get it again, I would try to substitute the chili for chicken.I ended up getting a cheese burger, which I topped off with a fried egg and bacon. It tasted fresh and cooked to medium (how I like it). The pickle it came with was my favorite, had the perfect crisp bite. I can see this place being fantastic for large groups. The reason I'm giving it three stars is because the place just felt didn't feel very personal. It may have been an off day for the staff and I'm definitely am willing to try the place again with a larger group of friends.","Went here for brunch on Sunday. Although it was empty when I arrived I'm glad I made a reservation, as they made it sound like they were full to capacity. The seating area in the back is pretty tight, so if you are a party of two be prepared to be in the middle and tight. Beyond that the service was quick and nice. Had the unlimited alcoholic drinks for $20 + my meal. The French toast was super sweet and soggy from the toppings. Definitely a sugar overload! Needless to say it wasn't bad but very soggy. The mimosa comes in the same wine glass as the sangria. You definitely get your money's worth with such a bigger cup. Drinks are strong, so that's a plus too! They also had games but with the tight seating, it wasn't conducive for games.",The Bronx Public

It did not really taste like Guava but they were not cheap with the champagne (hence being a little tipsy 2 mimosas in).My partner ordered the house omelette, which came with veggies and mozzarella cheese - her only complaint was that the veggies needed some seasoning. I ordered the steak and eggs, which was a special of the day. I got it medium well and it was PERFECTLY cooked. I enjoyed my meal and the ambiance/music was pretty chill so I was able to catch up and have a conversation.

17,none,none,none,Don't walk RUN to this place! I had the privilege of eating here yesterday. I had the Patacon Chimi and the Yaroa. Both were AMAZING...very flavorful...didn't even miss eating meat. They also give you plenty of food for the price. Food took about 30 mins to get but the young lady at the counter apologized for the slow down in the kitchen. Next time I'll be sure to try one of their desserts as well. Wish they were open more days during the week! Keep up the delicious food ladies!,"The owner thought it was party time but for me it was supposed to be dinner time.I understand it was the owner's birthday and the place was decorated with cute fruit themed decor but it's making me wonder if service is usually over 40 minutes. I was excited to try a Vegan Restaurant in the Bronx and the live Dj is cool but I wish they'd focus more on the service. At the counter to order we waited a while to place our order, even tho we were the only ones up there.And someone came from the back/kitchen area (I'm guessing), he was handed the same dish I order, it's a slap in the face being hungry and seeing someone come from the back with the same dish you ordered. Also there's so many people in the back, I just wanna know why our food took so long. On top of this, I wasn't impressed with the food. The jackfruit pulled pork had way too much black pepper, and although I don't remember what pork taste like, I don't think this was it. I've had better jackfruit pulled pork sandwiches...But in the end I'm just happy no animals were harmed and veganism is being spread to the Bronx. ‍ (FYI I have been vegetarian for 5.5 years and I usually cook my own food so...take that as you may)","I'll start off by saying WOW! This is exactly what the Bronx needed. The food here is so delicious that even if you are not vegan you will enjoy their food. I stopped by with my husband and 3 month old baby. My husband is not vegan, but he loved the food! The staff is amazing and I loved that the owner came out and interacted with everyone that was there and ensured that we were happy with our food. I will definitely be stopping by again and I can't wait until my baby is old enough to enjoy the yummy food. (PS my hubby loved their yaroa pastelitos and I love their mofonguitos)",Next Stop Vegan

Here they still have a little skin on them so you know they fresh,"Hubby and I came here to get his mom a huge burger for her birthday. I know what you're thinking, I mean, who gets someone a birthday burger? Well, it was her one wish, to have something decadent and nutritionally bad, because it would be her last meal before undergoing extensive surgery and a lengthy hospital stay during her birthday and entire birthday month.Disclaimer: everything went fine and she's doing great.I ordered her burger on the drive there; we got her a classic beef burger with cheese and BLT. When we got to the hospital, we put two candles in the container and sang her a very rapid version of, ""Happy Birthday"", before we caused the fire alarms went off. It was great. She appreciated it and she devoured that burger. She said it was a very good burger.I've been perusing their menu and I think it may be time to head over there again. I've got my eye on their chimi burger with steak, fried cheese, housemade chimichurri and fried plantain buns. That just sounds too damn good to not eat.","First, there is nothing like a local business owner that actually cares about making a difference.Second, the attentiveness was on point; this place wants our business and they show it.Real burger by real people!!Last, the meat was well seasoned, flavorful, juicy and nicely presented.Fries made of  not the frozen type.Well done Dave, thank you for your hospitality!!",Bronx Burger Bistro

I came across Nana's kitchen under Mediterranean category and realized that it has mainly Albanian cuisine which is apparently very close to Turkish cuisine. They have Quofte like we have kofte, their suxhuk is same as our sucuk, they serve feta cheese along the salad,  their bread is like our pide, their rice pudding is like our sutlac, list goes on and on. So You get the picture of how similar it is.I was wondering if they could satisfy our high expectations, and ordered kofte plate for my husband with a combination plate( kofte and sucuk) for me. The delivery arrived within the time window.Wow and the kofte tasted amazing. It was well cooked, juicy and has very fulling portions. I didn't like the sucuk a lot- mainly it is me being picky here with the need for particular spices that I want to taste in the sucuk. I ordered baklava and rice pudding as a dessert. Baklava had pecans/chestnuts which I am kind of allergic but my husband liked it. (I like more the pistachio filled baklava- which I can try if they ever put in the menu) I tried the rice pudding: it was very mildly sweet and fresh. I am not a sweet tooth and it satisfied my need for something semi- sweet very well. Overall , The portions were just right. We felt full -not being overfull.Today we ordered again- kofte and quesdia with chicken this time. Again everything was delicious and very timely delivered.So I have all the reasons to love this place- good food, timely delivery and reasonable prices. I definitely recommend Nana's kitchen for those who want to taste good, authentic Albanian/Turkish food in the Bronx.",Nana's Kitchen
20,none,none,none,"This is an updated review.  I first came here during their soft opening.  I usually give a place the benefit of the doubt during soft openings and I initially gave Flame a burning hot 5 stars.  I am very happy to say Flame is even better now, 6 out of 5 stars if I could.  Tonight, I brought my mom who is in town for her birthday.  My mom is a picky eater.  She accidentally ordered the miso soup with her entree (entrees come with tons of stuff) but actually wanted the beef onion soup and they fixed her order in less than 30 seconds.  The service here is second to none!  She also ordered the lobster and loved it taste-wise.  In terms of the hibachi style chef-at table cooking my mom had so much fun that she said ""this is a once in a life-time experience!!!"" which is very high praise, coming from her.  I also brought my mother-in-law who had to be talked into coming because she does not like hibachi restaurants due a bad experience she encountered at Benihana's a long time ago.  I think she is a convert now because but she absolutely loved the Salmon and fried riceThe main reason I come here is because my 6 year old daughter loves it.  The General Manager David treats her like family and takes her by the hand and walks her around the restaurant each time we come!  Also, the kids meal Filet Mignon is one of her favorite dishes in NYC.  The chefs sing and let her ""cook""a bit with the chefs hat.  see pictures :) Flame is one of the best kids restaurants you will go to and very reasonably priced for NYC!Personally, I love the scallops and the shrimp.  so freaking good!  You really can't go wrong here especially if you are coming for a birthday or some other type of celebration.  It is always crowded on the weekends so I would recommend booking online.  All in all, Flame is one of my favorite places to eat.","This place is fun and the food is really tasty.  I brought my six year old daughter and she had a blast.  The hibachi guys sing and dance and use their spatulas to make a beat, which makes the whole experience amazing.  They also shot gingerale into my daughters mouth from a plastic bottle, which made her night. I will definitely be back, and I recommend the scallops.","We had been excited to try this new place since it's opening a few weeks ago.. we went today to celebrate my mother's birthday and wow!

It was a late night with terrible weather, snow and slush covering everything in a rather short amount of time. We all rushed to get to the restaurant before they closed. They were very nice to have accommodated us, as we were a rather large group and hubby and I had a big stroller and baby in tow. The staff was very attentive and patient with us.I ordered their lobster bisque to start and was very disappointed. It was very thin, not as all like a thick bisque should be in consistency which made it unappetizing. It was also quite bland and I had to use a few salt shakes and pepper grinds to make it palatable.Hubby and I decided to order pizzas. I had a classic margherita and hubby had their piccante, with spicy salami, which neither of us enjoyed. The salami did not taste good at all. We mostly shared my pizze and took his home.In my opinion, the food was not really that great but the service was excellent and how they accommodated us earned them an extra star.","Authentic Italian food in the Bronx. This is kinda an odd thing to review but I really love the olive oil that is served with the bread to start. It has tons of garlic and other spices and it is so delicious! The entrées portion sizes are HUGE and you will likely not be able to finish your food, so don't go overboard. I've had a few of the specials and I would probably order exclusively from there.

23,none,none,none,"This is a classic spot to hit up when in City Island. It's not the cleanest place but it's still a great spot to socialize. I typically come here after my meal to chill and enjoy the area outside while snacking on fried seafood and drinks.They serve a good variety of fried seafood, raw seafood, and drinks for cheap! The fried seafood would be around $20 but it's a big portion and it comes with fries. It's also not really seasoned but they give you salt and pepper on the side. The fries kind of suck cause it's on the soggier side but they are pretty thick pieces. If you're craving clam chowder or corn on the cob, they got that too! The drinks are less than $10 and good for sitting outside in the summer and enjoying it with friends.","Meeehhh.  All hype... and nothing else. I love a good basic spot with amazing food, but this ain't it.  I think they are just living off the hype from decades of being in business.  The food was basic. I'm from the southern city on the water so I know goooood fried seafood and again.... this aint it. We had the shrimp $16, fish (whitening) $17, and the crab legs $25. They get points for portions of the fish and the crab legs.  The fish (1) was massive. Its not filleted so be prepared to chew on small bones- two ppl can definitely share it. The crab legs....so much to the point where it's questionable, you get a massive foil tray for only $25. There has to be at least 6-7 clusters of legs (Alaskan). You get melted butter, but go ahead and schedule your next dentist appointment if your snap game isn't good because there are no tools for the shell, its' not stone crab so you should be ok. You get maybe 10 shrimp in the baskets. Limp sad fries come with everything so be prepared to push that to the side. For me personally theres no flavor or seasoning in the batter so its just plain seafood...its not bad its just nothing to get excited over imo.The eating area inside is basic and the outside....... a mess. Pigeons hovering like vultures ready to snatch a free shrimp from your plate or hand and then fly off while pooping on someone else....yuck. They have some covered seating so if you are dying to sit outside - fight someone for a table.  They non seafood like burgers and have a 'bar' that sells premixed drinks like piña coladas.Parking is free, and theres an attendant to help direct you.....but its still a crowded littered mess, if possible, park elsewhere and just walk down to the restaurant.  Its cash only, but they have an ATM onsite....Good luck.","Johnny's is a very unique blend of New England and The Bronx. The seafood skews heavily toward baskets of fried whatever (shrimp, calamari, haddock, what have you) and recalls the food stalls down at Coney Island. Eschewing the fried foods (with a tiny bit of food FoMo) I went with my tried-and-true New England Claim Chowder and Lobster Roll (x2 for the wife). The LR comes with fries that exceed expectations. There's a handful of beers on the cheap, too.Pay for your food/drinks at each station with cash money (come prepared), then sit down at one of the many metal picnic tables and enjoy the show: (1) weekend warriors doing tricks on jets skis for attention and (2) families happily ignoring the sign not to feed the seagulls, creating bird mayhem.Pro Tip: Don't wait pointlessly at one of the first stations when you enter.

I came with my mother on an early Friday evening. We told our waiter that we needed a bit more time to decide on what we wanted, fine. However, he never returned. He served the guests next to us, and pretty much ignored us. We had our menus closed and he never came to check on us. It was interesting because it wasn't very busy and he posted up across from us and kind of just stared in our direction, but never came to take our order. I admit some fault in this as we could have said something as well, but the situation was...awkward. It wasn't until my mom finally waved him over and asked why he never came back. He says he was waiting for us to be done. We clearly were, but ok.. We ordered fish and chips and empanadas. I've noticed that the price in food had went up, yet the quality was something to be desired. The fish and chips came out too fast to be deemed fresh, and it clearly tasted as though it was microwaved quickly and brought right out. The empanadas confused me as they came with soy sauce and had the consistency of dumplings? Yeah..they were dumplings. I noticed too late and it was confirmed when we got our bill and it said 'dumplings.' How they got dumplings from empanadas is beyond me. I also ordered a margarita. Could have saved money buying a virgin as I did not taste alcohol at all. Overall not a pleasant dining experience. Might return for drinks, who knows. But I'll  be sure to get it on the rocks next time so I can taste some alcohol.","The food is never disappointing...

I guess our time was up. 4 when we asked to split checks he said he couldn't...5- waiter never checked up on us to refill water 6- when the part arrived the people were HOVERING over my friends and I, and EVERYONE WORKER THERE had nothing to say. Needless to say, I'm disappointed. Had it not been for my friends, I don't think it was worth paying the full bill and would've refused to do so. I hope someone from the staff gets to read this.

My husband also ordered vegetable samosa which I was able to try.their portions are huge. I ate my food in lunch and dinner and felt full. I was able to find many chicken chunks and plenty of sauce- which is pleasant fact as the last time we ate a chicken tikka masala outside I was fishing for chicken...Anyways the portions are big and delicious. Vegetable Samosa was also tasty- but a bit on the spicy side for me.I also tried their dessert - indian rice pudding. It was very delicious, mildly sweet and refreshing.

27,none,none,none,"This is a great place to get burgers and milkshakes. I highly recommend getting the Smokehouse burger. It is very trendy compared to other restaurants in the neighborhood. Prices are very fair.One of my gripes with Novelty Eats is that it can be inconsistent, especially when it comes to the milkshakes. You often have to ask them to make the shake thick or else it gets a little watery in terms of consistency. When they do get it right, no other shake can compare. Additionally, wait times can be excessive when the place is packed at night. A friend and I had to wait at least a half hour to get our order of milkshakes and mozzarella sticks.Some of the other food I have ordered at Novelty has been pretty average including the fries, mozzarella sticks, and the wraps. I ordered the Jasper Jones wrap once while with family. The wrap was so hot that I could not start eating it until everyone else had finished eating their meal. Nonetheless, I'll still be coming back for the burgers.","I placed a delivery order with them on Saturday through Grubhub, after eyeing them for quite a bit on Yelp (I'm new to the area and have been stalking a lot of restaurants on Yelp). I was torn between the chicken and the turkey burger, but after a few minutes of internal struggle settled on the chicken. I had 2 gripes with the burger, one of which was that the patty itself didn't have a ton of flavor, the other was that I had a few bites that included cartilage of sorts (think really unexpected bites into a hard piece of something). I also ordered the angel fries that were slightly mushy for me, but were on point flavor wise - which helped me look past the texture. Rounding out my order was the Oreo milkshake, which was solid but somehow they forgot to pack a straw. Separate from them, I  had an issue with Grubhub that didn't allow me to redeem an active offer they had,  $7 off of orders for new customers only. I mentioned it in my comments on the Grubhub order but never heard from anyone. I will be ordering from them again, still want to check out that Turkey burger, I'll update my review accordingly.PS the customer service here is phenomenal, shortly after I uploaded my review Steve reached out to me, thanking me and trying to make up for Grubhub's mistake. Thoroughly appreciate it.","According to Jason M. and Pat F.- both had very nice experiences here. So it was just natural to continue this domino effect- and now, it's a party.For Pelham Bay......this is unique alright! Oh-by the way...Crosby Ave. is packed like a muvah- especially Saturday afternoon- so parking on side streets is best. Once you step inside, Novelty's modern design welcomes you- not to mention a subtle scent of food in the air. Speaking of which, ventilation system is very, very good. It's ""sit yourself"" kinda place- and I liked it- plus service was nice and attentive during our Lunch. Using fresh ingredients and plenty of love, Novelty just looks like heart and soul were put into their menu- because our two meals were tasty. As petite as my Mom is, she packed that 'Shroomalicious Burger' real good. My Veggie Burger with Avocado Cream, Lettuce & Tomato- on Brioche was excellent- (So tasty, I didn't even take a picture). Plus I couldn't resist an 'Extra Chocolate Chocolate Shake' which was creamy and thick. Taking Style and the unique menu into account, I was all in. Plus the instrumental Chill-style Music selection- tied everything together. I seriously feel Novelty upped the ante up in here. Our meals were good and wouldn't mind returning.",Novelty Eats

Pancakes were outrageous and the huevos rancheros haunt me in my dreams. The tap beer was fresh and tasty, too! Looking forward to our next visit.","I really enjoyed Archie's Tap and Table. We decided to try it out on a Sunday afternoon but was worried about City Island traffic. For those who aren't from the area, City Island is very busy during the summer. Traffic can sometimes be really horrible on a nice day. Surprisingly, no traffic! The inside decor is modern and clean. It's not very large so if you're a large party I would suggest reservations just in case. Even though we dined during brunch we decided not to have any drinks. Because the prices seemed a little steep - I wasn't not expecting City prices. For entrees, we ordered the chicken and waffle and shrimp omelette with avocado. The chicken was tender but could have used more seasoning. The shrimp omelette wasn't great because the shrimp wasn't seasoned at all. I think adding even a little bit of salt and pepper would have gone a long way. The good part about the omelette was it did have a decent amount of shrimp wrapped inside. The service was good and I would visit again. Hopefully, next visit they add some seasoning.","This was an excellent find on City Island. Everything was fresh and nicely prepared. If you are looking for something beside fried fish, this place delivers!!Interesting menu selections with additional specials.  Very friendly and knowledgeable service.

We used the event space on the second floor. The service was polite and attentive throughout all 4 courses of the meal. The food was delicious, fresh and came out quickly. They even set us up to be able to play our Apple Music playlist from their speakers. The only issue I had was the broken elevator and the out of service bathroom on the second floor. Part of the reason we chose the space was for the elevator because my mom was recovering from a knee injury and there were several seniors with mobility issues in my party. We told them that in advance. It ended up being really hard for those people in the party to move around. But all in all, I'd definitely go back. Order the ribs!!","Excellent Local Date Restaurant I've been coming to the Pine Bar & Grill for years and I love it!!! The food, drinks and service are always Very Good. I particularly enjoy the lasagne and the mixed grill trio with skirt steak, pork chop and sausage. But the tastiest item on the menu is really the mashed potatoes. I'm not a huge fan of potatoes but their Mashed Potatoes are the best I've ever had. They're deliciously buttery and whipped to perfection. It's worth it to travel to the Bronx for this restaurant plus it's handicap friendly--no stairs to enter and there's a small secret elevator in the restaurant. My only complaint is that the portions have gotten considerably smaller over the years while the prices have gone up but I guess that's probably happening everywhere.",Pine Bar & Grill
30,none,none,none,Food was yummy. Tiger roll was great. Williamsbridge roll was not really my style. Service could be improved but overall better than other places nearby. Worth checking out!,"Very disappointed with the recent experience. I've been to the place several times before and in general had a good impression. This was the first take-out. I spent $15-25 per dish, but the quality felt like a cheap take-out order averaging $5-8. All the dishes tasted the same. Only the ingredients were different. Have the chefs changed, or is it just take-out orders? Very disappointed. Side note: this doesn't apply to Sushi, which we didn't order this time. Previously, we've enjoyed the Sushi very much.","I wish I can rate them a 0 start.The salt amount on their food is ridiculously high; we ordered some wings which by the way they were not your typical fried wings, they were in some sauce. This wings could had spike up anyone's blood pressure.

No wonder it is always so hard to get a table. After spending these past four years living in the area, I make this claim with confidence, and I can say that Roberto's is by far one of my favorite Italian restaurants.While on a special date with the woman I love, I was honestly shocked by how amazing the food was. The lamb she had practically fell off the bone. The ribeye I ordered was not only cooked to perfection, but was also paired with the most delicious sauce I may have ever had. Half was through the main course we asked for more bread to help us practically lick our plates clean. The food simple cannot be beat, and I am sure whatever you order will make you feel the same way.The only small caveat that keeps this restaurant from the 5-star review it likely deserves are the prices. The food was worth every penny, but when it comes to drinks, they quite frankly rip you off. After taking a look at he wine list, nothing is priced below $48. When attempting to order a bottle I know was good, they informed me it was out of stock so the waiter recommended the house cabernet. When it came to the table I was very happy as it was one of me and my girlfriend's favorite budget wines($10/bottle retail). When I received the check they charged a whopping $48 for it. I was expecting a decent markup, but to me, close to 500% seemed far too unreasonable.Nevertheless, I highly recommend Roberto's for some of the best food you will ever eat. Just watch out when ordering drinks!",Roberto's
33,none,none,"Although they've made improvements in leaps and bounds regarding the food and service staff, their reservation staff is subpar. Ive made lunch reservations and dinner reservations twice this year, only to be told that we could not be accommodated after all.  The first time, they flat out lost my reservation after having made it two weeks prior via internet with a follow up on the phone just to be sure. The second was for this past Saturday evening at 5pm prior to a NYBG evening event. Yep, lost it again- even though I made it in person over a month ago.  Having misspelled my name (after having spelled it twice at the time), they finally acknowledged that an error had been made. So, ""no harm-no foul"", right? Not quite.They still couldn't accommodate my party at 5!They had another event coming in and- ""sorry, you need to be in and out. Can you make it at 4:30?""I don't think so...You people need to get your act together. Oh, and how about staying open a bit later for people attending garden events?

The open kitchen by the entrance is a great feature.Wish the bread could either be lighter or warm. We've three appetizers - the portions are pretty big.

They never greet you when you walk in, they dont pay much attention and never come back to check if we need anything else. How do you expect someone to tip you when all you do is drop food on the table? McDonalds is better even though they dont have table service!!!! And what is the deal with rushing people with the food? They drop the entrees before we finished the apps.What caught my eye today is that the server prioritized taking pictures of some patrons rather than taking our order(we were waiting for like 15min) she could have simply told them to wait a bit.If the owner will allow the service to be this bad he should just turn the restaurant into an all you can wat or self service.",none,"Cka Ka Qellu is an excellent Albanian restaurant in The Bronx.

35,none,none,none,"This is an old school Italian joint with quality food. Came here with large parties twice in the past couple of months. One time for dinner with about 7 of us and we sat in the main dining room. Had lots of apps, drinks and dinner, all of which was delicious and big portions. Everything was delicious! Then we came for the mother's day brunch which you need a reservation and pay for ahead of time and was very nice. This place is huge. After being here the first time, I thought it was just the main dining room plus bar area you could see, but then we learned there are multiple party rooms. Our brunch was in one of those rooms. We were a party of about 12 and we got our own table which was great. It was bottomless mimosas brought about by the waiters. Since there were so many people, it took them a little while, but our table was right next to the mimosa station which was perfect, so we were able to help yourself. They were very  sweet!! For food, it was all buffet style and included typical breakfast items as well as Italian classics like chicken and pasta. There was carving stations, omelet stations as well ass fruit and cheese platters. It was all very good. They also then allowed everyone to take to go platters and pack food up to go home. After that there was dessert which was also good. They handed out gifts to all the mothers which we gift cards to come back, which was a very nice touch. Definitely recommend this place for dinner or an event like mothers day!","Established in 1969 and I'm just now coming to this spot? I need to get out more. From the bar lounge to our entertaining and friendly waiter, Maximino, the service was great and on point with our minor requests. We didn't truly advertise that it was my birthday weekend, but our waiter picked up on that fact and made sure I got a surprise candlestick sparkler added to my apple caramel crumble and a birthday song. Be still my child like heart.  It's the little things in life ya' know. Prior to dessert, seated in the Bronx-Italian styled main dining room, to start we ordered Hot and Cold apps for the table. Hot apps included standards of Fried Calamari, Fried Ravioli, Grilled Shrimp and Clams Oreganata. As my title describes, all were standard. Our salad served family style came out drenched in dressing. We all would've preferred the dressing served on the side. A few of the mains were Chicken Parm, for the non-adventurous. Pasta with Sausage, Meatballs and something else and my go to Lamb Chops. I'm always in search of the best Lamb dish. Everyone enjoyed their choices, though my Lamb Chops were, womp womp, over cooked... and so the search continues. Despite my underwhelming food choice, I still enjoyed the festivities of the evening, laughing and joking with my fam.  I would still come back for the friendly atmosphere and hangout at the marbled topped bar with their comfortable seats and catch a game with my peeps.  Solid three and a half stars for longevity, service, decor and atmosphere.  Tips:Reservations recommended for parties 6+Valet or Street Parking Sunday Brunch Large Party Rooms available","Not sure why this place gets unfavorable reviews. Frankie and Johnnies has been around for quite a long time and is one the favorite go to places in the Bronx. The ambience and decor is very rustic and homely. They sure love the New York Yankees. Pictures of the team is lettered everywhere. My favorite dish of all time is the linguine with white clam sauce. I admit, it's not as authentic as it should be but, it makes my day always to eat my favorite dish and they do it well. My only critique would be is to add fresh clams and more fresh herbs. An authentic dish like that should come out steaming hot with the clams opening in front of you. Overall, my family and I enjoy the restaurant. It certainly works for us including the amazing fresh cannolis for dessert and espresso demitasse.",F & J Pine Restaurant
36,none,none,none,"This place has ruined other Mexican restaurants for me. The ambiance isn't the most chic or modern, but when the food comes out you're not looking around. The dishes are so fresh and delicious. The flavor is really something that nothing else beats. Their happy hour is mediocre. Just get the regular drinks (they're bigger) and the price difference isn't huge.","We decided to go here for a ""business"" dinner. Listen, this was one of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to. It was so authentic, our waitress didn't speak English. Lolll the food was simply amazing! The service was excellent and the sangria was great. I can not wait to go back. And the birthday song made we want to celebrate mine too! It was a very nice experience. We talked about how good the food was everyday!","Estrellita Poblana is one of those places that has always been in my peripheral vision. This is mainly due to the fact that there are at least four of them in the Bronx and whenever I'm out and about I seem to stumble upon one of them. Besides eating at their location near Arthur Ave years ago, I really had no experience with Estrellita's offerings. My brothers and I were in the mood for Mexican the other night so we decided to head over here for some dinner. Located in the heart of Westchester Square, this Estrellita is decently sized. Walking in there's a small dining area as well as the kitchen and pick-up counter for takeout orders. There's another dining room to the right with more tables which makes it relatively spacious compared to their Arthur Ave spot. The aesthetics are casual - it's not divey but also not as ""polished"" as a typical Mexican restaurant you would think of. It works though - and the Mexican music they have playing in the background adds to the feel. We were started with the obligatory chips and salsa - the chips were the thick kind which I appreciated and the salsa had the right amount of chunk. I went basic and chose tacos - they had a number of varieties and I noticed they had a deal where you can choose three for a fixed price. This seemed like the best bet - so I chose chicken, chorizo, and spicy pork. The tacos were good - nicely sized (3 of them were perfect for a dinner) and they didn't skimp on the proteins. The spicy pork was my favorite, it had just the right amount of heat. The chicken was probably my least favorite - it had the least flavor and was a tad dry. I don't fully blame Estrellita though, it was made with white meat chicken and I've had these types of tacos from other restaurants with similar experiences. Service was good, everyone was friendly and the food was served at a good pace. Overall, for a local Mexican spot Estrellita dishes out the goods. You won't find a grand presence or mainstream things like strolling Mariachi players and sombreros here, but you will find friendly service and good, honest food. I would have no qualms about returning to this or any other of their locations.",Estrellita Poblana IV

The atmosphere is lively and cozy with a true Italian vibe and decor. Perfect stop for date night! Please note, there is typically a wait during peak hours (dinner time). Join the waitlist on your YELP app before you arrive! The longest I've waited is 30 minutes and that's the perfect amount of time to sit and have a drink at the bar. I recommend any of their daily specials and fresh pasta. They source their mozzarella from a local shop and it's INCREDIBLE. The last time we went one special was a veal risotto which was made to perfection! I am always blown away by the fresh ingredients.The service is fast, but friendly.

Prices are typical 20-25 for pasta and 25+ for meat. Went here after the botanic gardens. About a 20 min walk from there. We split the pear salad and the goat cheese on that was incredible. So rich and creamy.My friend got the butternut squash rigatoni. Which I tried, it was good though not as a strong squash flavor as we thought. The squid ink linguini with calamari and cuttlefish was a huge portion. And there were so many calamari and cuddle fish, like a pound- it was great! The flavor was so good. Very messy and ink stains so make sure to put napkins on your clothes!They bring bread straight to the table. Though the wait service while didn't rush us seemed very rushed themselves and would barely give us the time of day. The waiter was so impatient when I asked for my food to be boxed up. I was literally in mid sentance with him asking for a double box because I got the squid ink pasta and didnt want it going through and dripping everywhere. And he just walked away as I was talking to him. Really rude. So thats why they get 4 stars.

We were seated at a long table which was fines except for waiters continually bumping the folks at each end, and in a very loud area. The portions were huge (bordering ridiculous), but unfortunately, the food and service were super disappointing. It took over 35 minutes for our drinks to arrive after we ordered and even longer for food. When the food came, a steak ordered medium-rare came well done, and one ordered medium came as inedible overcooked. Lobster was overdone and not juicy and other shellfish was dried out.

But poor execution probably will keep me from returning, unless I want to continue to lose my hearing. I was here for brunch. The DJ, while providing a great playlist mixing up old and new school Hip Hop/R&B, was way too loud for a restaurant setting. More like, a club or party volume level. It was impossible to have a conversation with your date/dining partner, let alone order food and drinks with your server without shouting and miming. Why? You can have music and a festive atmosphere at reasonable volume levels. Other reviews said the music was too low. Guess they fixed that!Brunch for 2, including unlimited mimosas, came to nearly $130 with gratuity included.  I guess they unfairly judged their potential clientele as bad or non tippers and figured let's just force everyone's hand, regardless if the service was good. Granted, we had avocado toast (bland and cold avocado spread) to start, and a shared side of Bacon (too greasy and very little hint of the candied flavor), but the food fell below expectations for the price paid. The rum cake french toast is really just a very dense rum cake browned in a pan. Not bad, but no need to get it again. Steak and Eggs were OK and tasty but cooked past the requested Medium doneness. Mimosas were kept topped off every time a staff member walked past us, so no complaints there. I might come back and give them a second chance. I do love supporting a small business but NYC has way too many established brunch choices to settle on mediocre food.

There was also a generous amount given. I was able to share and still have leftovers to take for lunch the next day. The oxtails were very tender.

The only base option for the salads is a mixed green. They don't have kale, spinach, or anything else. The salad was ok but everything was cold. That is not a terrible thing but eating ice cold veggies gets redundant.  Nothing popped with flavor. Seemed like it was pre-cut and that is never good.As for the juices and smoothies, they don't have many green options.  They have the fruit selections but need more green options. It would help expand the customer base. We also tried the hummus which the guy said was homemade. It is definitely homemade but the recipe needs some work. It was the texture of play-dough and had no seasoning. It was probably healthy but it needed a kick of seasoning. Back to the drawing board on this one.Overall, I do like what they are doing here. They are bringing a healthy lunch option to the area. Some things need a little work but I did enjoy my experience.  Come check it out.",The Healthy Kitchen
43,none,none,none,Me and my boyfriend went here and it was on a busy Friday night. We were seated near the DJ booth which was really loud but again it was 9pm on Friday night. So we understood. The hostess was really helpful and nice. Our waitress was busy and did take some time to come around towards the end of our meal. I loved my scallops great flavor the mash was decent the small shrimps were off putting I thought they were going to chop them up with the mashed but it's fine. My boyfriend got a pork shoulder w rice. I tasted his food the rice was good and the pork fell off the bone wish it had more flavor though. He loved it. The music was great and the hookah was amazing too. Prices are pretty  normal 8-12 appetizer and 16-30 for entrees depending on what you want. Drinks were pretty good. I would say the sangrias were a bit more sugary then usual. And not really strong. The vodka sodas were strong.What put me off was prob the drinks and overall quality of everything,"So I drive pass here all the time and have been thinking of going in and I finally did.First off when coming here if you are driving I recommend parking in the mall lot because street parking is very minimal.So I went in and asked to be seated for 3. My mom, grandmother and myself.I was the first one there, I informed the waiter that I was gonna wait to order but every few seconds I saw him hovering around.As my mother and grandma came in the waiter continued to hover coming over every 2 minutes asking if we was ready to order a drink or food, at this point I was starting to get annoyed. After we finally decided what we wanted and ordered we didn't see the waiter again until the check came.What I will say is that food was really good.We went in for luncha and the lunch portion and the same size as if you order a main course dish.We ordered the Pernil, Sangria Chopped Salad (needed more then 4 shrimp for the save of salad), the Pollo Al Mojo and the Beef Empanadas (3 to order filled to the brim and juicy).","HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! PLUS THEY CHARGE A 20% GRATUITY EVEN IF YOU'RE A PARTY OF 2 PEOPLE!Now that I have mentioned those key points I can begin with my detailed summary of my experience at the Sangria Cafe...We were seated by a nice greeter. However, after that it took a very long time for a waiter to greet us and take our order. Countless waiters would pass by our table and nobody paid attention to us. Finally, a server tended to us, but he was lousy. He did the bare minimum the entire time my husband and I were at the restaurant. He served us warm water without ice on a 90 degree day. And on top of that he accidentally poured a decent amount of that water on the floor and wet my foot, but he couldn't be bothered to mop it up creating a safety hazard for anyone who would walk by. We ordered the Churrasco with a side of sweet plantains and the Lomo Saltado dishes. The wait for the food was astronomical. In the meantime we ordered a lemonade. It tasted like a really cheap lemonade you get from the corner store or something. It was a horrible tasting lemonade. As we waited, 3 waiters bumped into me and my bag. If they aren't going to have hooks for the patron's purse (at the tables), then they should expect us to hang it off of our chair, and if that's the case they shouldn't bump into the bag! This was obviously very annoying. I eventually had to ask to be moved to one of the tables where one seat was part of a bench, that way I can put my purse on the bench and I could avoid this issue.Our food then finally came after God only knows how long (it felt like forever), my husband's food was cold (he got the Lomo Saltado) and mediocre tasting and looking. My food however, was not cold and tasted pretty good. But, my side of sweet plantains did not come along with my food. I had to ask for them twice after receiving my meal in order to get them to eat them along with the rest of my food. My sweet plantains were kind of cold and overpriced. I paid $5 for literally 5 tiny pieces of plantains. At other restaurants a side order of sweet plantains is $5, but I either get a little more than 5 pieces or they are decently sized and warm!Out of 3 sauces that came along with my steak, only one tasted good and that was the pico de gallo. The green chimichurri sauce had no flavor and the brown mystery sauce just tasted weird and bad.After eating what we could from our meals, all I wanted was a doggy bag (since my food wasn't bad tasting) and the check and even those things took a while for the employees to gather for us. When we finally saw the check, apparently although we were just a party of 2 the establishment charged a 20% gratuity fee, something that to me is unheard of for a party of 2 that consumed less than $100! I guess that this is how they ensure that their mediocre waiters get a tip despite the shoddy service!I would never go to this restaurant again. The wait to have our orders taken and for the fulfillment of our orders felt eternal and the staff did the bare minimum. Besides the fact that my husband couldn't enjoy his meal because it was cold and not very flavorful. I thought that this place could be a cool new and enjoyable restaurant because from the outside it looked attractive, but boy was I wrong.",Sangria Cafe
44,none,none,none,"As soon as you find this almost hard to find gem in The Bronx, you're greeted by a unique experience. There's a doorman that asks you if you're here to meet someone and the name of the patron then they ask for your ID.... they direct you to an elevator that takes you up to the rooftop. The elevator door opens and you're greeted by beautiful flowers and perfect photo ops worthy of any of your social media platforms. The hostesses are so inviting and are beautiful. I can't describe how over the top the decor is and the live band adds a touch that is indescribable. I truly felt like I was somewhere international. The food was great too - I highly recommend the appetizer EL FUFU RELLENO and my entree was a grilled chicken and rice and beans so good as well. Me and my friend got full just off the appetizers. However, the drinks could be a bit better - My sangria tasted a little watered down. Overall, I would definitely return.","What an amazing find!!!!!! I've been following them on Instagram since the beginning of summer and now that I live in Jersey (24 mins away) I decided to visit. They have Valet parking which is super convenient. Be prepared to pay $20 on the weekends and $10 during the weekdays. It's totally worth the price. They text you your valet information and when you are ready to leave you text back "" retrieve my car"" and your car will be waiting for you outside. I suggest you make a reservation for dinner, it's gets crowded on the weekend.We did not have a reservation for Friday night, but the hostess was so amazing she hooked us up with a table with no wait time.Here's where it gets good. Not only do they have a DJ on Friday nights but also a Live Salsa Band!!!!!!!! They were INSANELY AMAZING!!!!! Had the crowd litt, people were dancing everywhere. If you love this type of atmosphere, you won't be disappointed here.Next is the amazing service and Food. Our waitress was so sweet. It was my birthday and she gave us 2 complementary glasses of champagne to start off with. The food was reasonably priced and it was delicious.It's a rooftop with half indoor/half outdoor seating. We were seated outside, it was very chilly. I'm hoping they tent it and put heaters out there for the colder weather. The decor is beautiful, makes you feel like you are in Cuba. Go check it out.... thank me later","I've been here for brunch (better experience) & last night for dinner. The decor is spectacular bc it makes you feel like you're on a tropical vacation. It's a little pricey but the food is good & the drinks are ok. Love that they have a live salsa band. Not sure if this happens every night but it's definitely nice. I had the cazuela cubana, which is a seafood dish served w/ crispy tostones...tasty! The dish on top was lindas pechugas (chicken breasts) served w/ black beans, white rice, sweet plantains & avocado...yum! The other dish was el rabo (oxtail) served w/ pigeon pea rice. The oxtail was nicely seasoned! I only have 2 cons. One, they definitely need more waiters. Tracking our waiter, Victor who was very nice, seemed like mission impossible. Two, they need a better hostess with less attitude & who is more personable. Angela was very rude & nasty. She has NO people skills what so ever. Even the table next to me agreed.",Zona De Cuba

We saw this location had opened recently haven't explored many of the Asian food options in Pelham Bay. The sweet potato roll was very flavorful, had just the rich amount of crunch and natural sweet potato flavor. For my meal the heavenly roll really stood out as the winner. Scallion pancakes have always been a go to side dish for me, but I had never seen it incorporated in sushi before. It went nicely as a background flavor and added crunch to the eel and smoked salmon on top.

It is now 430 I am leaving because there is still no one here and no telling when the place will actually open. Very disappointing.",none,"This is a pretty nice place. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. A man (probably the owner or manager) checked in on my table throughout the evening to make sure that our meal was okay and that our drinks were good. Our waitress (a blonde) was super friendly and very attentive to us. We happened to be there an evening while there was a children's birthday party going on which wasn't ideal. I wish they had a private area for the party so it wouldn't disturb the rest of the patrons because there was quite a bit of kids running around. In regards to the food, it was great. We went during brunch and I had the Brunch platter, which came with two hugeeee pancakes.

The steak fries were hot and fresh as well. I went to the back and played some pool with my co-worker. They have plenty of pool sticks, chalk and the miniature pool table accepts quarters. It was a timely treat because the old-school game is a rare find. If you don't have any quarters the bartender will gladly hook you up. After a few breaks, sunken shots and some bites in between, my beer glass was empty. We both were satisfied with the service and the classic pub friendly atmosphere. They also do buybacks here, cause Dominick served us some shots of Jameson on the house. Cheers to a great neighborhood joint that had every detail on point.","The greatest part about this bar was probably the prices. I was able to get a Sex on the beach for five dollars which is unheard of at the bars that I've frequented. This is the go to bar for when you want a chill night with the gals or the bros where you don't have to break the bank to have a good time. Although, it's not the first bar that comes to mind when I think of a night of entertainment and fun, it is definitely an option for if I want to spend a quiet evening getting wasted for cheap.","Exactly what a neighborhood bar/pub should be! A place where the neighborhood congregates after a long day at work. Excellent service, the servers remember you, and the food/drinks are great and at a reasonable price!

It didn't disappoint. We ordered drinks immediately upon settling into the cozy intimate dining room that faces the street. I tried their Frose, which was refreshing and delicious. My husband ordered a glass of wine along with some others ordering wine as well as more potent drinks like bourbon and scotch.  We started our meal with 2 appetizers, calamari and clams casino. Both were served hot and tasted delicious. The entrees come with a house salad, served cold. We were three couples and we ordered the same meal... Zuppe de Pesce!

We ordered it with the white wine sauce. It was huge and delicious! We took a good amount home! For dessert we shared a crime brûlée and some coffees. Wonderful dinner all around. We will be back and would like to explore the menu and try other items!","So, one weekend we decided to come back to this restaurant. We came here few years ago on a date and had a great dinner for two. We were thinking of getting the same dish but just couldn't find from the menu but saw it after we took our orders. That's ok because our lunch this time was great! Yes, they open for lunch!Our waitress, Patty, was sweet and professional. They all seemed like very professional handling a big tray on the shoulder and walking without tripping. First, we ordered mussels appetizer. Mussels was fantastic! Order this if you like mussels appetizer. The garlic mixed with the sauce was to die for (I live!). After that Hubby ordered Fruitti di Mare, and I had linguine with shrimp and lobster. They removed the lobster shell prior to serving. Both my husband's dish and mine were flawless. It was served with a side salad. I tried Hubby's dish and that was perfect too. Definitely the homemade tomato sauce has its own secret recipe. Food wise, this place got it right. Now let's go to the ambience. The place is a house-like restaurant. They offer a parking space and it's not hard to get it at lunch time. Inside decor is superb and romantic. This place can handle big and small groups. I'm sure they can hold a party here too. We had a booth table. Super fine experience. Will come back!",Pros: Service was great. Easy to get to. Valet parking. Also wide variety of wines.

There is seating though, about 5 tables against the wall opposite the deli counter, each with 2 seats. I can't think of many times when I would think of a deli as deserving of 5 stars, but their service behind the counter today put my experience over the top, and the food was above par.I got a Turkey Club Panini with a side salad. The fellow taking the order asked if I wanted chips or side salad... I asked if the salad has cucumbers. ""Yes, it has cucumbers, lettuce, pepper--"" I cut him off and said ""Chips are fine.""  He goes, ""Well, if you don't like cucumbers, I'll make you a salad from scratch without them.""PERFECT ANSWER!I got a Snapple, the bill came to a little over $12, and the cashier told me that I was entitled to a free soda or water.The food was totally fresh and yummy.The only advice I can give management, if they want to be more than perfect, is the following:- have the person taking the order notify the customer when the meal they're ordering entitles them to a free soda. This way they don't feel like they wasted money on the Snapple.- have someone clean the wall adjacent to the tables at least once, daily. Dried-up little spots of food on the wall can give a bad impression.- keep up the great service with a smile.",none,Healthy Fresh
50,none,none,"I wanted to love this place. Based off the pictures and reviews I was excited to try. Food was terrible!!! I ordered shrimp ""scampi"" w/ 2 sides - mashed potatoes and spinach. First, the food took forever! My shrimp ""scampi"" were disgusting. They were not scampi at all but in a weird tomato based sauce that were drowning the shrimp. No taste and definitely not scampi. My spinach was super salty. Basically inedible. And no mashed potatoes. They apparently ran out and I was given Mac and cheese instead. I was not told before hand, I would have chosen a different side. My friend ordered bbq chicken  and shrimp. She said her food was terrible. Like my food, drowned in a nasty sauce. She ate a few bites and completely stopped eating. I'm so disappointed and I will never, ever be back. Total waste of money.",What a nice surprise.

52,none,none,none,"This is my favorite Italian spot. Highly recommend anything with burrata on it, it's probably from next door at Casa Della Mozzarella. I feel like they do a really good job of sourcing really fresh ingredients. For example, I had some lettuce (arugula maybe) with burrata and sliced tomato and it was incredible. I think their bread also comes from a local bakery, it's really great; their olive oil is delicious too. Their fresh pasta is made in house, it's all really high quality and cooked al dente. As good as the pasta is, their sauces are all outstanding. Even pasta that doesn't have ""sauce"" is amazing too (note the burrata on top of ravioli, and the cacio e pepe). They also make their own desserts! Their tiramisu was intensely creamy and by far the best I've ever had. The Nutella pie was amazing too, the crust was cookie-ish (like a madeline) and it has a nice thick layer of Nutella.","OMG.  Pasta heaven.  Went to the NYBG Holiday Train Show.  7 of us worked up an appetite.  Based on previous reviews I chose this place.  First the service.  Greeted by an Italian speaking young woman who was also fluent in English.  She immediately arranged our seating pattern.

My rum punch was the best rum punch I ever had in the Bronx. Not too sweet and you can taste the Wray & Nephew rum.

While the placement of the restaurant is quite odd (it's located on a block of car dealerships), you feel like you have escaped the Bronx once you walk in the establishment particularly on the back patio area which has a fresh Caribbean vibe. Friendly staff also added to the experience!I ordered Brown Stew Red Snapper which was yummy! I really wanted to substitute the Rice & Peas for Mac & Cheese which was of equal value however, the staff was not budging on the substitution since they said the sides were viewed as free and I'd have to pay menu price for the Mac & Cheese. Considering, this meant that the Red Snapper was essentially $22 on its own, which is very pricey for a piece of fish. Be prepared for a bit of a wait since the food is 90% made to order.","My friend brought me here. The area is sketchy and next to a dealership. The entrance to the restaurant is unappealing but we entered and made our way outside towards the patio. The patio spot is gorgeous. I could def see it as a place to hang out during the summer months. I believe I had the oxtail rasta pasta. It was okay. There was SO much sauce which I did not expect. It made the dish unappetizing. Imagine oxtail sauce mixed with the cream from the pasta. Yuck! Also I ordered the calaloo spring rolls which were nice and different. I've never seen that before. My friend ordered the sweet and sour chicken which she did not like. We ordered a side order of plantain and only got 4 pieces for like $5. Ridiculous! Our waitress was also the bartender.

Pasta tossed in sauce is covered by some mozzarella and it is melted over it. The meat sauce was hearty and tasty.  The pasta with meatballs was also good.  The meatballs (2 in the order) are huge and I was able to take one home.Once the meal is done the waiter comes by and tells you your total, you will not see a check.  Simplifies things I suppose.All in all it was a good experience, with some decent food.","It depends on what you seek and how you approach Arthur Avenue... perfection is subjective to your expectations and attitude toward people who were not born in America or from your side of town. #truthIf you're looking for something on your terms that doesn't  disrupt your need for familiarity... just go to Eataly or Carbone.If you are interested in travel, other cultures, history and have an open and adventurous attitude, please go to Dominick's.... because the people, food, history and culture are beautiful, interesting and rich.

This is an amazing coffee shop (and full of community) in the heart of the South Bronx. It's a very short walk from the Hunts Point stop and is right on the corner, so very easy to find. The coffee shop itself has tons of character (lots of great Bronx photos of the area adorning the walls, Christmas lights and neon signs). There are big windows that let in lots of light and there is a nice seating area in the front with pillows and is very comfortable. There are also bar stools towards the back of the shop to sit at and enjoy your coffee/tea. They have a library of books and magazines you can read, free WiFi and a very clean bathroom. The staff and owner are super friendly, and you can tell really care about their business and the community. I would absolutely come back here again! Please support this small business in the Bronx!","I am happy to see a local, non-Starbucks coffee shop in the Bronx, especially in Hunts Point. It's a small intimate space with a lending library of books. Definitely a nice surprise.",The Boogie Down Grind Café
57,none,"Maybe I had an off dish, but the pork and the quiche was a bit sour, tasted like the meat was old.  I know the taste, if you leave marinated meat in the fridge too long it gets this sour taste to it.  So I didn't even finish the dish.  The iced coffee and the service was good.  Hate bashing Vietnamese restaurants, but I don't think I will be coming back.","We were in the area and looking for a quick lunch knowing we would be having a big dinner that night. Looked on Yelp and discovered Com Tam Ninh Kieu. It was definitely a good find! The service was friendly and quick.I had the steak bahn mi. For some stupid reason I added pate to the sandwich. I do this where ever I go, never see the pate on the sandwich and never know if it really makes a difference. At least here they didn't charge extra. The sandwich was very good. The meat was tasty and tender - not at all chewy. The vegetables had a good crunch and seemed home pickled and not from a can. Only down side, and I could be wrong, but the bahn mi seemed to be served on Italian bread, not French, and had sesame seeds and a different texture. All in all, still a very good bahn mi.The biggest downside to this restaurant is their health grading of ""pending"" which means BAD. Sitting down, I could see the chairs were visually dirty (picture included) and made me a little nervous. Luckily, nothing else seemed too off, but I'd like the place cleaned up!","This local restaurant really surprised me. The service was amazing, our waiter was super friendly. He explained the menu and made really good suggestions.  Thai tea was refreshing! Crispy spring rolls is a must try! Delicious! Make sure you wrap it on the lettuce and mint leaves!

They said the delivery was going to take around 55 minutes, I've got my food in less than 25 minutes. Definitely I'm ordering again. 5 stars","After running with my girlfriend in her neighborhood, I hung out in her home with her and her husband since hubby was going out with his coworkers after work. We were all hungry and they suggested we order food from EZ. I love Mediterranean food so I was definitely, ""in"".My girlfriend's husband had their lamb gyro which has french fries in it and is a pretty decent portion for the price. I had their Qofte platter, which came with a choice of side (I got their rice), salad, tzatziki and pita. I wanted to try their lamb kebab also and was happy to see that they offer a lamb skewer appetizer which is a pretty large skewer, on top of a huge, fluffy with tzatziki and a lemon wedge. Definitely worth it. My girlfriend had their chicken skewer platter and opted for their lemon taters. We also ordered their mix dip which has all four of their dips together in one container, separated by slices of tomato. Babaganoush, Hummus, Tzatziki and Spicy Cheese, all of which are really good.The food takes some time for delivery and take away because it's freshly made and surely worth the wait. I came back yesterday, after another run with my girlfriend, and ordered the same thing to bring home for hubby since we're without gas at the moment. I'm sick of delivery but willing to settle for something that was not heavy and greasy. EZ Grill is one of the best because I can eat so much without feeling like a stuffed pig.","We have ordered from Ez Grill twice for dinner.They have a huge menu with a lot of meat, skewers, gyro and platters. They do have nice Mediterranean selections, mainly meat. I tried their lamb gyro with sweet potato on the side. My husband got the gyro too for the first time, then the chicken platter. Their portions are really big and I felt full with the gyro and only able to eat half of sweet potatoes side. The gyro has tzatziki sauce inside. I do liked their sauce, it has garlicky taste and goes really well inside the lamb gyro.The chicken platter was absolutely huge (4big pieces of chicken) with vegetables on the side, my husband was not able to finish all in the end.I also ordered their rice pudding to try and I liked it. Compared to another rice pudding we used to eat from an Albanian place, it has a thicker consistency but still mildly sweet. They also serve it with cinnamon on top. Overall, we both enjoyed our meal  from EZ grill.The best thing was that Their delivery was on time for our both orders, I just don't like the fact that they have a delivery fee. I really do prefer to tip the driver rather than paying a delivery fee.",Ez Grill NYC

Never coming back...that for me is a steal and disrespectful.P.s. almost forgot to say my margarita was served on a broken and dirty glass...I pointed it out to the sever and after looking at me like a crazy person I asked to please change the glass. He changed it and not even said sorry or anything to make it better. Awful.,"I've been coming here for the past four years. No complaints. I do prefer weekdays due to the crowd for brunch. I'd suggest brunch for those who enjoy the more lively setting with a band or music. Their food and sangria are phenomenal. I do think the prices are decent considering their portions you always end up taking a plate home. The service and ambiance is a good vibe. I've tried their seafood, salads, deserts and other appetizers/entrees. I can't decide which is my favorite but if I had to vote. I'd say their coconut mojito, yuca alcapurrias and their flan is simply lovely A must go. I'm very glad the area is transitioning and bringing good food suitable for all taste and age groups","I came here for a birthday. We were immediately seated on time for our reservation. The place was very cute they had a lot of dining tables, booths and a bar. We did a prefix for $35 talk about bang for your buck. The Pre fix included appetizers for the table , your choice of entree and desert. We also got a pitcher of mojito for $40 it was a strong mojito so I'm not complaining I know some of the girls I came with did wanted it to be sweeter. The entree portions are huge! My friends got a paella and it was a sharing plate for 2-3 people lol. No one finish that paella they took most of it home it was very good but very filling. The pernil was very well seasoned and very moist my fiancé loved that it was also a huge piece no complains here. I ordered the churrasco and it taste very delicious it was cooked how I liked it and it brought a side of my choice I picked rice and beans. I would definitely come back here. Around 9pm it turns to like a lounge where they play better music and they even have hookah at the bar i enjoyed myself a lot here. The service was also on point.

Would I say it's a better place to grab a slice then 95%. I like the tomato slices a nice touch.,If you sit down and order a pie you will prob eat the best pizza you ever had.

So as I ran a 5k runner earlier in the morning I was very hungry and I must say this places delivers!!!! First off, they have a garlic bottle squeezer  and that already put me into my fatboy zone! Plus also has a duck sauce bottle squeezer. I'm telling you I was in heaven! I've ordered a chicharon de pollo sin jueso and a order of avocado and a order of toastones. So you know I literally destroyed all of this  overall tho the experience was great, food was cooked well, served fast and tasted great. I didn't get a chance to check the rest room but the overall dinning area was cleaning and this was during a early lunch time so please wasn't to busy but do hear it gets slammed as it's a great place to eat with the family. So I gave this place a 5 star. Check out the pictures and I hope you enjoy it as well.","One of the very best latino restaurant I've ordered from. Haven't dined in, would be nice to check it out.

Really well deserved. I've been meaning to check it out for some time now. So glad I did today. The food is AMAZING and so fresh. My partner and I got the shrimp mofongitos, chicken alfredo pasta, and chicken and waffles. Everything was on point! I think this is my new favorite spot in the neighborhood. Keep up the great work!","This was a last minute take out decision for our group. If the staff and the patrons are any indication, this place is as authentic as they come. We got:Roasted chicken legs and thighs - The flavor was fine and I liked the crisp on the chicken skin but the meat was way too dry. I could only eat it after pouring a lot of the bean water on it.  2/5Braised oxtail with roasted eggplant - This was great. The eggplant is stewed into the oxtail sauce and gives it a unique flavor. 4/5Shredded skirt steak - I guess this is their version of carne ripiada (aka ropa vieja in Cuba). They went a bit overboard with the salt but eating it with the rice helps balance it a bit and brings out the flavor of the dish better.  3/5I would come back here again to try some of their other stuff.  While I waited for my takeout, I noticed that the staff was pretty friendly and very accommodating. Seems like a good place to come with the family.",none,Leche Y Miel Restaurant
64,none,none,none,"We ordered appetizers (chicken quesadillas) entrees I got scrimp scampi linguini and my boyfriend ordered steak. His came with two sides he could choose from vegetables (asparagus and broccoli) or salad, mashed potato, baked potato. He opted for a loaded baked potato (they accommodated it for him) and mac and cheese. For dessert we ordered a hot lava molten cake it came with ice cream. I ordered a Oreo cake. We did sample sangria (white and red) I got the red and he got the white. Our server was great They do have more beer and draft selections. I didn't check for signature cocktails since it was early in the day. I love the food and service East Tremont, Bronx has a lot of newer spots.","This place has a nice interior and a decent vibe. I went for lunch so I wasn't expecting anything extra special (and there wasn't) but there is something to be said about a clean, nice looking, handsome restaurant. If felt like a great place to not only get a bite to eat but to meet up with friends for a few drinks and good conversation. I had the house burger (HK Burger) and fries and mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks were pretty tasty, above average, I'd say. The burger wasn't as good. It looked pretty but it was a little dry -- the bread, the patty, and the extra brittle bacon served with it. Even a healthy douse of ketchup didn't right the wrong. The fries that came with the burger were crispy and had good flavor but were a little cold and the portion was stingy. That made me sad. Fortunately, the price was reasonable but I'm not sure I would have been any less satisfied with a cheaper McDonald's meal from across the street.Oh, parking is kinda problematic. It's only street parking with a two-hour time limit and very aggressive parking enforcement. I almost got a ticket... No, this restaurant didn't thrill me but, under the right circumstances, I'd give it another chance.","HK caught my eye sometime last year while driving down East Tremont Ave. Its modern, brick facade and large floor-to-ceiling windows in the front is not typical of businesses in this area of the Bronx, so I was instantly intrigued. Even though I heard mixed things from my friends, I wanted to experience it for myself. One of my brothers and I were looking for lunch today so I thought it was a good opportunity to check it out. The aesthetics of HK is very modern and trendy. Walking in there's a large, round bar in the center and a combination of high-tops and regular tables around it. It has that industrial look to it - they're advertising themselves as a draft house so that kind of fits.  We were there on a Sunday around 2pm, as such they were offering brunch. I'm not sure what it included but I saw something in the ballpark of $34.95 which I wasn't looking to spend and thought I could do better off the traditional menu; we were looking for lunch anyway so it worked out. There was a DJ blasting music (I assume because of brunch) - lots of old stuff from the late 90s/early 2000s; I was instantly brought back to middle school dances.  Because we opted out of brunch, we were given a bar menu which only had some finger foods, a burger, and a sandwich. I know there's a more expansive menu since I've seen it online but there was enough for us on this menu so we just went with it. The menu had typical pub food - we both eyed the grilled chicken sandwich and decided to go with that. The sandwich was pretty good - in addition to the chicken there was lettuce, avocado, cheese, and an aioli on a club roll. The sandwich was pretty good - they were generous on the bacon which I appreciated, but the chicken breast was way too thin. The sandwich came with fries which were nice and crispy.Our server was super nice and the food came out at a good pace, and overall I enjoyed experience at HK. The restaurant lands at a 3.5 for me, but I'm rounding down because I didn't order off their full menu or try their beer. I was also a little surprised to see the place close to empty for brunch service since it's a pretty competitive meal these days. In any case, I didn't find any outstanding qualities that sets HK apart from its competitors, but I'll need to return before making a final assessment.",HK Kitchen & Draft House
65,none,none,"last time ordering dinner take out. Two weeks ago we ordered an amazing anchovy pizza. This pizza had the best crust ever.  Today we decided to order dinner entrees  - one chicken, one veal. The only part of the meal that was edible were the veggies that accompanied the meat. I don't know if the meat was cooked from frozen or boiled then prepared for our order but the texture was rubbery. Not at all what you would expect from a restaurant with 4+ star rating on yelp.  To make matter worse when we called the hostess said she was too busy to handle this call, placed us on hold and after 5 or 6 minutes the line disconnected. It's really disappointing","The service here lacks but I've come back multiple times. I also have take out delivered quite a number of times as well. The food is good. My family and I tend to keep to the same items. For apps I've had: mussels, baked clams, coconut shrimp and calamari. So delish. Ive also had the stuffed mushrooms and I wouldnt get it again - water and lacked flavor. The bread and marinara oil is great  - they give it complimentary. We tend to ask for more. The pear salad is yummy. They use to GIVE you complimentary salad with  your entrees and they have stopped doing this. For both dine in and take out. I hate that. We usually get the spaghetti bolognese and penne al la vodka with shrimp or alone. Thats my GO to. I've tried a few other entrees as well. I tried the calms with linguine and it had sand in the clams and little pieces of shell, complete turn off. My husband has gotten the rib eye steak and it's a hit or miss. Sometimes lacks salt. I've gotta the Michelangelo's Alfredo Cream Sauce pasta and it's really good but doesnt heat up well. I've also gotten the Michaelangelo Seafood Special and it's really good as well. Overall I'll keep coming back. This place is in the neighborhood and the food is good.","Amazing atmosphere the back patio is really the allure. surrounded by tropical plants and small lights really creates an ideal ambiance. food was all great. service good, but nothing to rave about. pear salad is absolutely a must!! the house salad was also pretty good for a house, chicken was a bit meh. balsamic dressing is extremely special and flavorful. mussels with red sauce were incredibly fresh and plump, tons of fresh basil and garlic were great additions. complimentary bread and sauce is also included. the personal pizza is definitely enough for 2- we build our own, mushrooms, eggplant and broccoli rabe. the pizza was divine, however the toppings are a bit skimpy- for example i'm a mushroom fanatic and the mushrooms were diced and practically raw which was a huge disappointment. the eggplant was also diced into small pieces (I prefer large slices for a more eggplant parm vibe) the broccoli rabe was also diced. in total the pizza was $21 which felt a bit high for the product, definitely was tasty but would maybe request it a bit more well done and pass on the shrooms unfortunately. when it comes to dessert this was an upset. it was only 7:20pm on a saturday and they told us they were out of napoleons?!?!! how??? literally what. nothing else appealed to us so we decided to leave it at that. would definitely return!",none,Michaelangelo's Little Italy

We ordered this through Uber Eats when we had some friends over and they were blown away. So everytime they come back they always ask for the buffalo shrimp at Pepe's. Other notable dishes include the lamb platter - the lamb strips are always so soft, and the mac and cheese.","Visited for an early takeout dinner on an August Saturday. If you plan to eat there, there are about six bar stools by a counter, but not tables. Two shorter stools accommodate people waiting for their takeout. I'd suggest phoning ahead, that's what the locals seem to do.We decided to share an order of Thai Chili shrimp for an appetizer, and then we ordered two fried chicken dinners for the main course. Each of these dinners came with a choice of  two sides.My only gripe was with the wait - we were told 30, but it was more like 45 minutes, plan your parking accordingly. And yes the food was worth it. Heard Mingus' Goodbye Pork Pie Hat and some Coltrane while I waited, so that helped pass the time.The shrimp, seven in all, were of good size and the coating and heat level were quite similar to those coming from a good Thai restaurant. Underneath the shrimp, yellow rice - closest to an Indian pullao or maybe something Caribbean, and a lettuce salad. The shrimp did not make it home, devoured in our parking spot. A little tub of cole slaw as a lagniappe.The chicken portion comprised a drumstick and a split thigh. These must have come from a very large chicken - it was a big portion - but it was tender and well seasoned - crisp coating --just great fried chicken. Mustard greens were tender and savory, mac and cheese very rich, very tasty, and yams overly sweet for La Portena, but spot on for me. Vanilla scented. Dinner for 2 - $45 without beverages, with plenty left for another day. Great food, great value great music. The five star rating is spot on.","Pepe's definitely ace top notch hospitality down. We walked in and the man named Evan behind the counter offered to run down the entire menu with us after asking if this was our first time there. The man was training a new staff and was explaining to the new cashier the responsibilities. She was alright but forgot to give us utensils twice when she bagged our food. He was very patience and polite with her infront of everyone. The food was delicious and the man was open to feedback. He made sure to check up on how we were doing.I see a lot of potential for the business to grow if they can maintain this type of service and quality. From their detailed explanation most of their dishes are made in house and that's when you know they put heart into the food they make. I ordered the grilled chicken S. Indian bbq platter but tried my boyfriend's mixed one. Definitely get the grilled chicken and lamb platter because the lamb added an extra element to the dish. I also got the mac & cheese but I don't see what the hype was about. I do taste the sharpness of the cheddar but I've had better. I really wanted to try the fried chicken but it takes 30 mins because they make it fresh. They also ran out of homemade mustard green. My friends and I only stumbled upon this place because we were only passing through. If I am ever in the area again, I will definitely get the fried chicken and mustard greens. Better yet try one item from every category and taste test the whole menu. What caught me off guard was the homemade fruit punch. It was yellow instead of red and it tasted like pina colada! Those thai chili shrimps are finger licking good. I never expected this type of service and delicious food from this small joint. Boy did it prove my expectations wrong.",Pepe's Place

However, you are better off getting the parrillada de carne for two people, which gives you the option to choose two sides as well. The parrillada de carne was amazing! The plate is huge and brings enough meat to feed you for two days, for sure! I am actually heating up my leftovers as I write this review! :)Oh, and their empanadas de pollo are amazing.

The waitress kept it real and said that they only have cheesecake, which is not made fresh at the restaurant; it is purchased somewhere else.

Wait.....I don't mean come to Fordham and stroll amongst the mixed bag crowd...I mean come visit The Bronx Night Market with about 30+ (maybe more?) Bronx restaurant/vendors showcasing their goods. I remember well when this plaza got filled up with kiosks selling inexpensive what-have-you back in the day. But Night Market was so badly needed!!! When I heard about The Bronx Night Market back in 2018 from my friend Jason M., I wanted to jump on the bandwagon too and see The BX's well-known and only bustling Food market. It's filled with stalls selling all sorts of eats, Body Oils, Custom Jewelry and a few other things from almost all over the borough- (there was one NJ vendor though). Maybe it was towards the tail end of their season, but I had my sights on Mott Haven's Empanology- but they didn't participate the Saturday night we visited- I'll catch up to them in their restaurant. You'll find lots of vendors serving it up with a little bit of everything. Night Market has the Jerk spot, the Korean spot with Twisted Potato, Tacos and more- even a Vegan Bakery!!! Plus a table selling 'Bronx Night Market' merchandise which I picked up a $20 logo T-shirt. I'm digging what the Bronx Night Market founders created! So if your destination is to only come to Fordham- for The Botanical Garden and The Bronx Zoo, try also coming to Bronx Night Market between May-October on any given Saturday to have a chill time. The BX never ceases to amaze me. Kudos to you guys!",none,Great spot.So many venders.M most favorite was Sam's Fried Ice-cream. Unbelievably delicious. I wish I eat there 1st. Do yummy!!.,none,"You can see from all my pictures I posted, that this lil Night Out is so good for the Bronx. I've known about this since last year but never bothered to go check it out. Then I got a notice from Yelp, and so I began my adventures. I decided to go by myself to check it out because I didn't know what to expect. I needed to make a run to Old Navy that is on Fordham Road and is not listed on Yelp, (don't know why that is) but anyway decided to go check out the festival.Its a hit Yelpers! Oh my, there were all kinds of different venues. Its funny though that not alot of them were located in the BX., that being said it still was alot happening here. They had music playing, they had many variety of food options, they had sweet treats, they had different drinks and even accessories, from jewelry, to T-shirts, and skin care. It was nice to see that every one there was just enjoying the beautiful weather and nice vibes happening in the area. I saw families just sitting around lounging, (They had some tables and benches to sit at) eating their food or just talking and enjoying the music. Some people were getting up from their tables to dance to the good music they had playing for the event. It was just all good times happening on a nice summer night in The Bronx. If your in the area, or are a native of the Bx, I definitely say for you to go check it out. F.Y.I. - some venues do take cards, but I say just bring cash and a nice amount, cause you are bound to try more than one thing. - This night out runs from every Saturday (now) until October from 4p.m.-10p.m. -Come early, because some venues do sell out of their food/items.",Bronx Night Market

Close to the 6. friendly. Small and not overly busy. Shared fried plantains with the garlic sauce. I suggest you all start right with that as your appetizers. sooo for brunch I had the 3 Golpes.... why not have 2,000 calories in just one sitting. Can't go wrong fried cheese, salami, eggs and mangu and just the right amount of onions. I've gone during the week on Wednesdays for their ladies night specials with $3 empanadas and drink specials. My only complaint is that usually they seem understaffed.",Escape Latino
76,none,"I picked up my order and noticed the restaurant was hot on a very humid Sunday afternoon. There was either no AC or it was broken. I ordered vegetable steamed dumplings and chicken Drunken Noodles. Both dishes were mushy and lacked flavor. The dumplings were wet and very soggy with no flavor. The soy sauce that came with the dumplings was watered down. The Drunken Noodles were better than the dumplings, but both with equally bad in flavor. I would never eat here again.",none,"Excellent restaurant. i brought my wife and three kids here after a day at the bronx zoo. parking isn't the greatest. we luckily found a spot right across the street (on the street). there is a starbucks and dunkin' donuts right next door. fyinot much room inside but we turned a four top into a five top. call ahead of time if you have a bigger group. the food was perfect. delicious thai. we loved it all, vegetable dumplings, pad thai, panang curry. noodles for the kids. good beers. our server was excellent. the mood was great too. good jazz for dinner, colorful lights on the ceiling. just like the pictures. very clean too. we will go back next time we are in the area.",none,"I love Thai food. I evaluate every restaurant based on their pad Thai and veggie spring rolls. I have to say the level of culinary arts at this restaurant is inconsistent at best. I've ordered from them About a handful of times. Each time, the quality is worse than the last. This time, I ordered pad Thai-of course with a Thai tea. The noodles were almost white, clearly not coated well in any spice that would resemble Thai seasonings. It was tasteless. And they have the nerve to charge more than other Thai restaurants in manhattan. I also asked for my tea without ice. And guess what folks... ding ding ding... the cup is full of ice. I'm glad I was able to experience at least one time where they were performing optimally. I'm not ordering from here again. If you're reading this would advise you not to start ordering from them. It's a waste of money. Your taste buds deserve better.",Tana Thai
77,none,none,none,Cozy spot in the south east section of the Bronx. Been coming here since a kid in the 70's. Still return on ocassion when I visit my family.  Great service great comfort food and really  clean bathroom. (That's a good sign.)   Hasn't really changed much through the years. Kind of a hometown fixture. Home fries and eggs are delicious. Hamburgers and other sandwiches are killer!   Good to see they're still rocking and rolling after so many years.,Food is classic delicious diner food and the vibe and decor inside seemed like a traditional small diner from the 50s. Very classic feel in the Bronx and the food was really fresh and service was good.,"Yo!!! I went to visit the city for my birthday weekend & we ate here EVERYDAY! It was small & cozy but don't let that fool you. It's definitely a busy diner with amazing fresh food. The first day I was a bit hungover so didn't get to finish my food. However I ordered the exact same thing the second day and I can assure you there was not a single crumb left on my plate. Their omelette and house potatoes are everything!!! Our last day there, I had to test out the pastrami croissants of course! Needless to say, I was a happy camper with a full belly & a cream cheese puff to go! What's up?! Can't get better than that. I will eat here every time I go back to the Bronx! So In Love with this place! I was wishing I could bring it back to Houston with me! Unfortunate, no pix because I was too busy honestly just stuffing the hell out of my face.",Cosmo's Restaurant
78,none,none,none,"After already booking my Birthday Brunch for the following week, my Partner and I decided to have dinner and drinks prior with in-laws just to check it out and try the food. I reached out to them via Instagram just to make sure that the restaurant was ""newborn"" friendly since I've just given birth. After some convo they were nice enough to situate us in the backroom where it would be more kid friendly since the first half of the restaurant a lot of customers were ordering hookah. From then on the service was on point. The management was awesome and super friendly (Thanks Jeanie), the wait staff was attentive, always checking in on us, the food was amazing! (We had wings, the empanada trip as our apps and the mixed green avocado salad and salmon as the entrees) and the drinks were delicioso! (HAPPY HOUR!!! lol).Overall I was very pleased and I am looking forward to celebrating my birthday this coming Sunday!!!","With all of the positive reviews CASA has I didn't think I would have a bad experience BUT I was wrong....Came here on a Friday evening. Apparently our waitress was taking care of the entire restaurant. She came over to take our drink orders... my friend asked her what a Bombay Ginito is *a drink on their HH menu* and she replies ""ummmm I really don't know"". So we all go with the Malibu Mojito (whewww the drink taste like carbonated water with lemon juice & no alcohol). When another person came over to check on us we mentioned the lack of alcohol and he was nice enough to bring us shots to add to the drinks).  For apps we had guava bbq wings & sweet chili wings. A server brought out the wings without plates so we ask our waitress for them and she says to tell the server (I've never heard of such nonsense, it must of been written all over my face because she quickly said she'll tell him). The wings were equally good, the sweet chili having a serious kick. Our waitress comes back to take the rest of our orders. We had Salmon *overcooked*, Tequila Lime Shrimp *flavors were off*, Calamari *salty*, Lobster & Crab Mac & cheese *imitation crab, no flavor*, Mofongo *just ok*. In the midst of eating another person came over to check on us so I asked him what the Bombay Ginito & Martell Sidecar are and he didn't know either. But he was nice enough to check with someone else who did. The waitstaffs lack of knowledge is really a reflection of management so I do not blame the waitstaff. That plus the lack luster food and automatic gratuity will keep me from returning here.","This is a local place, where if you are ok with subpar food AND VERY LOUD MUSIC, then you will like it. I ordered skirt steak with lime rice - the steak was fine, the rice was gross. My daughter ordered a shrimp dish, and while she loves shrimp - she ate 3 of them and left the rest of the food. The waiter asked us if we wanted to take the rest home, she told him ""no thank you"". The music was great!! The drinks are so watered down, not even funny. I ordered a pitcher of mojitos, no sugar cane and I couldn't taste the rum or mint or quite frankly anything AT ALL, the entire drink was meh, and they give you plastic cups and plastic straws  - WHY? Everyone else had glass drinks. I would go back, sit at the bar, listen to great music and drink water.Also keep in mind that they automatically add a 20% gratuity, no matter how people are at a table. Usually that is reserved for a large group - but not here. If you order hookah- you have to pay cash and if you expecting change from the hookah man - forget it - he keeps it as his ""tip"" whether or not you wanted to give him one.If you want decent food and do not want to go to Havana Cafe, go next door to HK Restaurant.",Casa Restaurant & Lounge
79,none,none,none,"This was my first time here. I was undecided, on what to get. Saw someone eating the fried chicken w biscuits and gravy, so I went with that. My husband had the lobster roll and Mac n cheese. I ordered a customized burger to go, and my son ate it a while later, said it was so good! Service was excellent. Fast!","I went to the Wooden Spoon because I wanted to make everyone happy. My friend is vegan, my boyfriend is very anti-new American but the portions looked good, and I really wanted a lobster roll. I thought this menu would make everyone happy. So we sit down and we order and notice there's no utensils. That's fine, we haven't even ordered. I ordered a lobster roll with a side of Mac and cheese, my friend ordered a veggie burger and my boyfriend got a Mac and cheese. A few minutes later the waitress comes out and tells me they were out of Lobster. Okay, sucks but alright. So I ask for my side to be my entree. We're waiting for a while and food comes out. I have two Mac and cheeses, my friend's burger has cheese, and we have no utensils. I think perhaps I was wrong. The waitress apologized and offered to comp the Mac and cheese and the street corn. Awesome! I didn't even say anything about comping the order. I was a lot more concerned about my friend, especially because the waitress had read back exactly what they ordered. At this point we were debating about leaving but the food was already on the table. The big reason we stayed was because of the comped food. We also still had no utensils. Overall the food was solidly meh. But the service could use an improvement. To be clear they tried but no utensils and no condiments on the table is just basic service. My friend had to ask for napkins three times, ask for their initial order of Pepsi three times, and when I asked for hot sauce, my waitress asked ""other hot sauce?"" When we didn't have hot sauce on the table. I answered ""there is no hot sauce here"" Honestly I wouldn't come back. My boyfriend is now gloating that he was right about New American restaurants the whole time.","It's no wonder this place has SO many reviews and great ratings. This spot felt homey from the moment my party and I walked in half an hour before closing. The two guys working the front were extremely friendly and welcoming from the start. My party ordered two sandwiches, the chicken viona and pork Milanese, fries and the small burrito salad. I looooved the chicken viona sandwich, probably the best chicken sandwich I've had in a very long time. The fries are great, too.What I appreciated most about this place is how rustic and relaxed the ambiance was. I loved the little details of decoration all around and how they served drinks in plastic cups but had mason jars to hold your silverware and flowers, it just worked. Lastly, I appreciated how friendly they were to our party due to it being almost closing time. My party ate quickly because we understood but also we did not feel rushed whatsoever. Great place. I can't wait to come back and try more food :)",The Wooden Spoon
80,none,none,none,"This is my favorite local bar in Riverdale! They offer a variety of flavors for wings which is always a plus. Additionally, they have vegetarian/vegan options which is amazing and not something you see at small bars. They also have brunch on Saturdays and Sundays where you and friends can partake in bottomless mimosas (they have other options too) because who doesn't love a boozy brunch?!My boyfriend and I try to come here at least once a week because not only is their food great, but the service is extraordinary. From the staff to the owner, Anthony, they are all kind, respectful, and make you feel welcomed. Anthony caters to everyone who walks into his restaurant which once again is amazing and I wish you could see this more at other local bars.If you have not checked out this place, what are you waiting for because you are FOR SURE missing out!!!","Had another great happy hour stint with our good friends, sort of a second birthday celebration for my girlfriend's husband. Anthony was the bartender on staff today and he was awesome!! He took really good care of us and was very attentive. He was awesome.My new favourite dish is their mac and cheese with their curry gravy....sooo friggin good! I got some waffle fries for good measure as well. I tried their spinach dip dumplings which were ok but very dependent upon being eaten right away.This is definitely a new favourite haunt. My friends and I love coming here. It may be putting me St a disadvantage but please patronize this business and help them stay relevant.","T&H is a great addition to this neighborhood. It's located right across the street from Van Cortlandt Park so you can make a full family day of it. I've visited twice, the first time with girlfriends after a run in the park. It was happy hour and we all shared some guac, shrimp tacos which were AWESOME and a couple reasonably priced drinks. My second time was a few days later when I treated hubby to a boozy brunch for his birthday. AYCD is an extra $20 which gives you 2 hours of your choice of brunch beverage. Their brunch menu is nice. We started off with their Korean BBQ wings which were sooo tasty, and we also tried their French Onion Soup Dumplings which were cute little dumplings filled with onion soup and covered in a blanket of melted cheese. My son and I both ordered their Salmon Benedict which I didn't too much care for, only because I didn't taste the smoked salmon that much but my sine liked it. Hubby had their breakfast burger and he loved it. I definitely want to come back for happy hour again. It's great because I often jog down to the park with my daughter for a workout and some park play so stopping by for a quick bite and a drink before heading home would be super convenient. On both occasions, the staff has been so very pleasant and helpful, even when baby girl put the kung fu grip on hubby's drink and caused a cascade all over our table. For brunch, we tried their French Onion Soup Dumplings,",Tortoise & Hare
81,none,none,none,"I came here for dinner on a Sunday night and despite the crowded waiting area, I was seated within 15 minutes. There's lots of seats inside but it's still definitely busy. The service was decent. I feel like our server barely checked up on us so it took a while to order extra things or just to get refills on drinks. I also don't think we got all of our side orders with our entrees. It was only when I asked the server if it comes with corn, for example, that he would bring it over.For appetizers, I usually get new england clam chowder and fried calamari. The clam chowder isn't the best but still tasty. The fried calamari is definitely different than other places. It has a breading that is similar to the breading of mozzarella sticks. I got fried shrimp and a whole red snapper which came with fries. The fries were realllyyyy good. It was crispy, seasoned well and pretty thick. The red snapper was fishier than I had liked and wasn't seasoned that well. The fried shrimp was also decent so I didn't really find that entree worth it.I always go for the ""feasts for 2"" and the portions are HUGE! They definitely serve more than 2 people. The staff says that it is good for 4-5 people, but I think it can feed up 8 people! They also serve bread and cold veggies which are alright. I have tried the Italian Feast and the Paella from the feasts for 2 and they take a while to come to the table but they are soooo filling. It's stuffed with all types of seafood and definitely a hands on meal so expect to get messy. The seafood in the Italian feast actually wasn't as good as I liked. The crab legs were really hard to break apart; the shells were already softened but it just wouldn't break. The mussels and lobster was also kind of small and didn't have a lot of meat.Overall, I think that the Sammy's chain is great for big parties and sharing the feasts! It's super filling and almost guaranteed to have leftovers.","Giving three starts to be generous. They teeter totter between a 2 and a 3. I came with a large group and was surprisingly sat in at  table in a reasonable amount of time. Our server was polite, but could have been more attentive. Water often went without being refilled and the table could've been cleaned off faster (salads and appetizer plates).Food was bland and was not seasoned well. If it wasn't for the tartar sauce or sauce tray my fish and shrimp would have been lifeless. Fiancés salmon seemed to be seared in straight butter or grease but no other flavor at all. Drinks were good, they have a tasty sangria mix.I'm going to stick with my tried and true JPs which is located right when you get off the bridge.","LOVE SAMMY'S!!!!! I've been coming here since I was a kid. I still love this place the same way. My family and I come here often and now my child requests to come here for her birthday dinners. I've gotten so many items from the menu.I LOVE the Feast for 2. I've gotten The Crab & Lobster one. I also got The Italian Feast. So good and ALOT of food. The twin lobster special is SO good. I've had it stuffed with crab meat and its WORTH IT. I highly recommend it. The crab legs are great. I've gotten it with broiled shrimp.All the entrees come with salad. Corn bread. Roll. Butter and cheese. A cold veggie platter (they should stop serving it because that's not really good). They also give you rice and corn which I never really eat, i always forget to ask them not to give me this, I feel like they should ask the customers if they want it. Saturdays they have free face painting for the kids. I think that's a sweet touch. It gets JAMMED pack here. I've learned to make a reservation and I try to stay clear of this place during busy times (Saturdays from 5pm to 10pm. Sundays from 3pm to 7pm). During the winters it isnt as crowded as the summer time. Mothers day is CRAZY here. I learned my lesson and only come on Mothers Day between 11am and 12pm plus I make a reservation. Take out here is great. You get all of the same items you would as the sit down dinner. It's fast and the gentlemen behind the counter knows how to keep the flow going. I hate their website.

The service horrible. They took over 15 minutes to even say hi or acknowledge us once we sat. Then we get our order taken and it took awhile to come out. When we got our food it was typical and nothing special. They forgot the cheese for the cheese fries and we asked them for some and they said we don't have anymore. Even though this was part of our order. We asked for other items which they forgot to give us and the young boy looked at us crazy and just kept walking.

It's in a great location, with a decent amount of foot traffic, close to Castle Hill Avenue. I was greeted by one of the waitresses there, as other customers were eating their meals. The setting and decor was simple; old-school but clean. It has a good number of sitting booths, as well as the usual variety of tables and chairs. I ordered a cup of coffee; which I found it that it tasted odd. I also ordered the Hungry Woman breakfast special. It consisted of French toast, ham, sausage, bacon and eggs any style. I requested turkey ham, sausage and bacon. The eggs were fried, sunny side up. Each egg had a slice of cooked ham underneath. I noticed that the yolks were a little undercooked. Sadly, that was the first turnoff moment I had. I said to myself, no problem. I simply scraped the raw egg yolks off to the edge of the plate. However, the meat products were extremely salty to my taste. The ham was the saltiest of all. I tried eating a piece of French toast with maple syrup, along with a piece of the meat products. The combination was too much. I simply took two bites of each item. I ended up eating the cooked portions of the eggs, and most of the French toast. That was the best thing I had out of the breakfast combo. I regret not having some cinnamon to sprinkle on top. I would definitely come back to this restaurant, maybe for some pancakes with a fresh fruit topping. Overall, the decor and service were amazing.",National Diner

The presentation and service was very nice. The ciabatta roll on my chicken sandwich tasted like an average grocery store roll, I enjoyed everything else. The fries are served in a metal cup with paper. They are the type that seem to have a coating, medium style not steak, not fast food style.

Must say both tasted great and also felt the customer service was pretty fast. Please those tho it was a early dinner and this may effect services due to later times as I hear it is a popular eatery.

Service is good and food is priced well.","We came on a weekend night and it was busy. There were a lot of people waiting to take out and we were able to get a table immediately. Food were delicious and they were big portion at affordable price. We ordered the whole rotisserie chicken for 10 dollars, pernil with a side for 12 dollars and little appetizers for 1.5 dollars each. Their dishes were not as greasy as others Dominican restaurants. Portions were huge and we saw majority of people taking doggie bags home. The rotisserie chicken was a little dry on the white meat side, but it was fresh. The pernil was really good and it is highly recommended. They served actual meat and not fat like some others restaurant- we were glad about that too. We ordered flan too-it had a strong vanilla taste and it was semi-solid texture, which we believed they over baked; it was a little small in comparison with the meal and price. It was not our favorite and probably we liked more softer texture. Service was a little slow and it was hard to get a waitress to order or get the bill. Once you get her attention, everything was fine. It is not fancy place, but a great to hang out if you are searching for a great meal without breaking the bank.","We came on a weekend night and it was busy.

What makes me come back is the owner. She is the sweetest woman! Once I saw her give a neighborhood kid some cookies from the display case because he came to say hello to her. Another time, a man who probably did not have money to pay just ran out of the shop with his food without paying. She did not say a bad word or got upset. I respect her for doing that because no one knows another man's  problem unless one walks in his shoes. If he could run away without paying, he must be going through something in his life. Onward with the food, the food is very tasty. I do expect that from a Trinie. She looks like a Guyanese though.  My favorite is their rotis...any one of them. The doubles are very good as well. I sometimes would get the buss up shut to go so I could have them with my own curry at home. I wish her longevity!","I've been going to this spot for years. I found it when I lived in the Bronx and continued to go even after I moved to Westchester. Now I live in Long Island and still, no where else compares. Authentic Trini cuisine at it's best. I've been to the other Ali's in Brooklyn and Queens and this place blows them out of the water. From the roti to the doubles, the stew chicken to the curry goat, you can't go wrong. The staff is as friendly as family. Just ask, they will make it however you like it.",none,Ali's Roti Shop

My wife and I were having the ""all you can eat"" menu, and the other couple were having something else. The owners gave us a choice for the whole table to eat ""all you can eat"" or choose separate menu. All this to insure that the other couple would not eat off our plate. That was ridiculous. I will never come back here again. To insinuate that grown adults cannot share a table and pay their own bills is absolutely absurd.At the end of the day, I really believe they must have new management because this has never happened to us before.",none,"Great AYCE sushi spot. Salmon tartar is one of the best I've ever had. All of the rolls I have ever ordered were always fresh and delicious. Worth the price if your a sushi  lover.

A star quality restaurant consists of all five points of your dining experience to be excellent.  I have found this in the newly opened Macelleria Italian Steakhouse on 5th Avenue in Pelham where the old Jordan house use to be. We actually were referred by my salon across the street after a visit and decided to try them. Upon entering, you know they have gone to extremes to make this the ultimate dining venue with crimson leather menus,  chandeliers, elegant music streaming in, a stunning bar area, every table dressed in linen whites with gleaming stemware, stunning mirrors adorning the walls and above all a team of impeccably dressed servers waiting to seat you and coddle you! Our waiter Val was very professional and charming helping us with our selections on a moderately sized menu. Along with menu choices, they had specials of the day and can also  appease many special requests. We started with the meatballs with a nice dollop of mascarpone and basil. Very nice sauce and the meatballs were delicious! Also, we ordered the fresh made creamy burrata with juicy  heirloom tomatoes over arugula which was complimented with an aged balsamic! Onto our entrees of braised short ribs which were superb with a braising sauce over a sumptuous mushroom risotto! A gorgeous dish! My cavatelli was perfect with strips of sausage and broccoli rabe in a nice light garlic and extra virgin oil toss.  Simple yet so satisfying! Since we were so full we decided not to order one of their home made desserts of Italian Cheese cake, Tiramisu Cake or a number of other decadent treats, so we ordered the dark chocolate pistachio gelato and the tartuffo gelato. One of the owners Tony checked on us numerous times and also gave us complimentary cordials of Lemoncello at the end. I am very excited to return to try one of their steaks with an array of sauces or one of their fish dishes such as their Branzino or Chilean Sea Bass! Bravo!!",I am writing this update for two reasons:1) After my first visit a few weeks ago I had some leftovers the next day and the food was better than I remembered it the night before (I was also three sheets to wind by the tine I got much of my food that night so that had something to do with it.)2) Had our return visit and the place hits the elusive 5-stars on so many fronts it really deserves it.  We kept it a bit light last night but my branzino was as good as I've EVER had it!  Tony the the owner is such a consummate professional that I can't begin describe.  Please go try it for yourself!Tony!  Save me a seat because you won't be able to get in there pretty soon!,Macelleria Italian Steakhouse

The staff was super friendly even though there was a bunch of customers coming in at different directions since there wasn't a clear cut line (every man for themselves in this case). There is no sitting area but there is a little ""table"" connected to the truck to just stuff down your tacos really quickly. I thought the taste of the tacos were superb to be honest, but my friend didn't like it because he said it was too spicy. I usually don't like large pieces of scallions but the way the grilled it made me eat my friend's scallion too. For $2, the tacos are the way to go if you are near the bronx zoo and want a quick little snack. I'd go back even if I'm not near by just because I thought it was delicious.","$2 a taco ain't shabby at all.You can place your order over the phone. I had a quick and easy pick up myself. The tacos are a good size - I tried the beef tongue and spicy pork. I liked the grilled leek that came in one the tacos, which added a nice taste to it. Definitely one of the better tacos that have come out of a NY food truck.","After work treat. Really good!!!! We love the chorizo and carnitas. And the vegetables... And the sauces.

Something is totally off. He also ordered the short rib, which he has ordered numerous times... but had the send it back. Not sure what changed but somethings is definitely different. Not to mention, currently, as we sit here, there is a semi private event at the bar from a local politician.. who wants to dine while this politician is talking on the microphone? We came to eat! I suggest next semi private event should be held upstairs in their private event or just shut down the place. **Below is my old review**Love this place. My husband and I have visited Suyo a few times and the consistency of the service, the food flavor and drinks are always exceptional. Once you walk into this place you forget you are in the Bronx. The waiter, Gonzalo, is amazing, great customer service, super friendly, and very professional. We love the fried veggie rice w- egg and avocado. My husband loved the short rib and and pork chop.

We were in the Bronx and I'm like, okay let's just do it. Bagels on Bartow was it, we found parking at a meter out front and walked in. Super hole in the wall joint and right up our alley. We asked all the questions and the girl behind the counter was So helpful. We picked our two breakfast sandwiches and got a free bagel for checking in with Yelp, yay! My total came to like $8 or $9 and that made me jump for joy! Such a cheap breakfast and I was so full after. I went with the pumpernickel bagel and boy was that a win. Guys, I wish I could eat that bagel every day but I live in Ohio! This was such a wonderful find, if we head that way again, I'm stopping and getting a dozen for the road!","Twice in 1 week I was very disappointed with my experience here.. The first thing was a dish called the ASCH loop. It is described as: seasoned potatoes, sausage, egg and cheese. Sounded good. When I got to work I opened up the container and found mostly potatoes mixed with pieces of sausage, browned ( over cooked ) egg pieces and some cheese that obviously melted into the entire mess. Nothing but the potatoes was really recognizable and the entire visual presentation was  like someone dumped all of this food mush into a container and closed the lid quickly. The next day I figured I would just go back to a sesame bagel with vegetable cream cheese. Well, that's what I ordered. When I got to work I opened up my bag to a plain bagel with butter. I paid $5.50 for a large coffee and  this?Called Bagels on Bartow and  staff did say that the kitchen incorrectly labeled the bag.  So someone that wanted a plain bagel with butter got my toasted sesame with veggie cream cheese ?After traveling to work ( about an hour later) the plain bagel was tasteless and the butter did nothing to help the matter. I was told that I could get back the price difference  of this order and what I ordered. Thanks, and I will do this. However for 2 days in a row my breakfast was ruined and not at a cheap price.Like I said, bagels are good,but they gotta do better with the orders, and I don't even know what the solution is to that ""ASCH loop"" thing.","I'm not really a breakfast person but if I'm having a local breakfast it is here. The service is awesome! The bagels are delicious, they have just enough chewiness. I love them! Their white fish salad is some of the best. If they get an order wrong they are happy to correct it for you, sounds like a given but someplaces will argue with the customer for their wrong.

Their mojito are amazing and the passion fruit sangria is strong and will sneak up on you.Wait staff is fun and attentive. However one day the water boy was refiling water glasses like he was paying for the water himself (barely half filing the glass). The live dj on Friday nights is cool.

My God is the food terrible. My boyfriend ordered the Churrasco mofongo and the Churrasco tasted awful it was not seasoned whatsoever and just had a nasty taste to it. The mofongo itself was very dry it came with some sauce but that didn't even save it. The rest of us ordered the ropa vieja and there was just nothing special to it. The rice was hard the beans tasted like they had no seasoning. Looking at all the pictures I was really excited to eat here but it was a complete disappointment. Our waiter was very nice and tried to accommodate us the best he could but it seemed like he was the only waiter working tonight. We waited about 10-15 minutes just so he could bring out a birthday dessert. Then when they brought the check out it had to be reprinted because the charged us for an order they got wrong; yeah that happened too; so that was another 10 minutes. I just hope the food and service get better.

I also asked if they had salmon red curry and they confirmed this as well. However when we arrived we found out that they don't use salmon to make the red curry. Therefore we had to go with the chicken instead. ( that's the only reason why I dropped a star, I do like accuracy.

I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking but definitely not the best.I found the pork to be quite bland and left me with one note. I wish that the pork was seasoned better because it would have taken it to new heights. Had to add a bunch of garlic and homemade hot sauce to mine.

I could see the trestles when I saw unfortunately I saw the locomotive pull into the station. I knew I was going to miss it and that meant I had to hunker down for at least an hour. Fortunately, I saw the light on at a small establishment on the side of the road, Tremont Diner. I ordered an omelet with jalapenos and silver dollar pancakes with strawberries. The food was quite savory and sweet respectively. The patron and staff treated me well and moved with efficiency. The respite rejuvenated me and I felt ready to continue my journey home. Belly filled, I once again ventured out into the night to catch the next locomotive hoping not to run into any hostiles. Luck was on my side and I made it back to Brooklyn by sunrise. I write to you to let you know that I am safe and will soon be in your arms. I've told my comrades about Tremont Diner with the hopes that they can find it if ever they find themselves in that territory. Love,Your favorite Brookynite","I came here today with my girlfriend after our morning run. We made up for all our burned calories with a couple omelets, turkey sausage and pancakes that we shared. She had the Mexican omelet with tomatoes, onions and jalapeños. It was tasty and spicy but I would have liked some monterrey jack cheese in it. I had the spinach and feta omelet and added some mushrooms. It was nice and the feta was not too overpowering. Each of our omelets came with hash browns and toast, which we both subbed for English muffins. We also shared an order of pancakes with turkey sausage. That dish was not the best that I've had at a diner, as simple as it is. The pancakes are good but whatever syrup they use tastes wrong, like it was sugar-free or something. It completely ruined my pancake so I left it alone. The turkey sausages were a little too watery and the hash browns with my omelet were seasoned well but dry AF ans could have used some chopped onion and peppers like I've had at other places.On the upside, the service is really good. As soon as we sat our server came to offer drinks and take our order. They came often to refill my tea and my girlfriend's coffee and to see if we needed anything.I ordered some sandos for the boys, a Philly cheesesteak with curly fries for my son and a turkey triple decker with classic fries for hubby. Hubby liked his sandwich but my son gave a 3/5 for his. Both meals came with a choice of soup which was nice but the price tag for just the sandwiches was over 30 bucks; kind of insane for a diner.I came here a long time ago with my husband and never reviewed but we don't come often because it's very out of the way from where we live. We were likely visit his family who lives in the area. I don't really care for diners unless I or someone I'm with has gone to one before and can vouch for it. I likely won't be back here.",Tremont Diner

I was starving so my girlfriend and I split an omelet, has browns, an English muffin and French toast. She had bacon on the side and I ordered turkey bacon for myself on the side.The service is very good. Our server was a nice lady. The place is pretty cozy. It's small but there's plenty of seating.

I even ordered some food to go for hubby.I love eating at diners like this, where the food is really good and simple. I would definitely go back for breakfast.","Fantastic food, breakfast all day long. My baked stuffed shells were e trembly good and the cost was very fair.

Richie wasn't there , so I got the baked ziti and omg it was delicious. Wasn't sure what to order , but that was good. Also got a slice of cake and being that I asked for Richie and he wasn't there and gentleman asked me why and I said I had a bad experience last time , he gave me the cake on the house.  Thanks so much, and can't wait to try another dish","What else can I say other then everything is delicious!!

I also have a favorite sandwich that I order its grilled chicken with mozzarella, roasted peppers & a drizzle of balsamic  The staff & owner are just the best!!Hey Rich u already know me The ""Liz"" Hero lolYou have actually known me for many years now!","One of the best pizza's that I have ever had. I love there bacon,pepperoni, and chicken vodka slices. I have never had a more flavorful pizza dough. You can see that there is another level of attention to detail that they put into there pies. The thoughtfulness of using quality ingredients and quantity of those ingredients that are put onto every slice. They have the only pizza shop that I have been to where the toppings are coming out of the oven dehydrated. It is a mystery to me how it is that they can get there chicken on there slices so juicy.It is always packed in here so you know its good and the turnover of the pies.They are far from the cheapest slices and pies. It will cost you a pretty penny, but it is worth it. This is one of those places where the mantra ""You get what you pay for for is true.""The staff is always nice and accommodating. Your best bet is to order it online and come in to pick it up. Parking sucks in the area.I would definitely recommend this pizza to end one looking to get the good stuff.P.S. Because of the price it may always work out to order a whole pie for the best value.P.S. (again) Largest drink selection that I have seen at a pizza place in a while.",none,Emilio's of Morris Park

I sent the order via email and Anthony, in minutes, sent me an invoice via email to review and confirm. Unlike the first time, we ordered the catering package for 20ppl, which included 5 half trays of hot food, salad w/ dressing (which can easily feed 20ppl as well) and a loaf of bread, already sliced!Our menu consisted of: Baked Ziti, Penne alla Vodka, Sautéed Shrimp, Chicken Parmigiana, and Meatballs. Our order was delivered on time! I asked for the food to be delivered at 12:15 (our meeting was at 1pm). The food came at 11:52! Hot and nicely packaged!

I was hosting a graduation party at my agency and needed a place that would cater, deliver, and was inexpensive. I used google as my go to and stumbled upon Joe's Italian Deli. They had just what we needed: a package for 30 people: which included 7 half trays of hot food, salad, and an entire loaf of bread. Now, originally we were skeptical about the half trays and salad and bread because often times places will say ""included salad and bread"" and both will be extra small portions and we were unsure of how much food would go into the half trays. We were greatly surprised!We placed the order for 3pm, the food was here at 3pm on the dot! Neatly packaged and HOT!

Room for improvement? Ah, for sure! Especially on the pricey side. Let's talk about a basic meal costing over $50. Let's talk about not making it a cheap but fair price. Let's about democracy! You dig? The buñuelos, Colombian cheeseballs, are but a hard pillow that desperately seeks death. It wants to drown in chocolate or café because on its own, it's dried like a 90-year-old. Let it get wet! You dig?Pandebonos are pretty good. They tend to get hard quickly, though. Enjoy them warm, however, and you're in for a ride of viscosity textures melting in your mouth. Let it melt! You dig?Watch out!!! Yes, watch out for old, greasy morcillas. Do not get them in the afternoon... Break this rule and you'll face a hard, greasy and nasty piece of pigskin stuck to the blood that makes the well-known blood sausage. No! Get them no later than 1pm instead. You'll find yourself biting into juicy blood sausage - just how you like it. You dig?","Came here with friends on a Sunday evening. Was pretty busy and we were seated right away. The menu is pretty extensive but there's pictures of everything so you know exactly what you're getting if you're not familiar with Colombian cuisine.We ordered apps and drinks. Unfortunately, had to ask 2 times for water. But that was pretty much the only con. The food was super filling we ended up taking half home. Pretty affordable as well",Colombian House

It lacked taste, I got the chicken parm with penne, service was decent with attentive waiters.","I live in Manhattan, but I travel to Bronx for great Italian food at Pasta-Pasta. The chef must be complimented. Though everything is tasty, I would have to say their eggplant parm is outstanding & delicious.(I get it to go-and I prefer it without cheese) In most restaurants eggplant is tough and hard. But the eggplant here is tender and the tomato sauce is fantastic. Nobody makes eggplant like Pasta-Pasta! I also LOVE their potato croquettes. (I always order an extra croquette) The service is great! Fantastic place!","Pasta Pasta has been in the neighborhood for years - I remember as a kid walking down Williamsbridge Rd and seeing its sign colored like the Italian flag popping out from its neighboring businesses. Despite this, I have seldom dined here besides the occasional holiday meal. That's what bought me to my latest dining experience, when my family decided to grab dinner here for Easter. Pasta Pasta is situated in a small strip mall on Williamsbridge Rd, but since it's in the corner unit it has a decent entryway and a good amount of space on the inside. It's not the largest restaurant but they have an open dining area with a small private room to the side. The decor is a bit dated and tired, but there are huge windows that line the front of the restaurant that makes the entire space bright.The menu is typical of other neighborhood Italian restaurants, though they have a pretty big selection which was nice to see. For the Easter holiday they had a number of specials in addition to giving us the option to order from the menu. We started with some hot and cold antipasto, fried calamari, and fried zucchini. Everything was pretty good - it wasn't the best antipasto I've had, but I did enjoy the fried calamari; I applaud them for having rings *and* legs. For my main I had the lasagna. The dish looked substantial and amazing, but unfortunately the flavor fell short for me. The meat and sauce were a little bland, and the pasta was over-cooked. Service was good, holidays are rough but they were super attentive. Overall, I feel that Pasta Pasta kind of suffers from being a warm body - it's been around for many years and it doesn't seem like much has changed. The food wasn't awful, just know there are better Italian restaurants in the area.",none,Pasta-Pasta

It was a great, chill experience, with good vibes. As soon as I walked in, the employees were very welcoming and friendly. The servers each greeted my husband and I. So we definitely started on the right foot. And the great part was that this behavior was consistent throughout our time in the establishment. The servers were very attentive and were willing to answer any and all our questions about items on the menu.I ordered the Sambal Twist Chicken and Waffles and a Virgin Orange Sherbet Mimosa. The Chicken and Waffles were absolutely delicious and unique! I would've never imagined that curry sauce and jalapeños would taste good with chicken and waffles, but it definitely did! The chicken was fried perfectly, both pieces were juicy and had plenty of meat. Although the description of the dish initially was a little intimidating, the flavors all complimented each other well and was enjoyable. As for my drink, despite it not having alcohol I thought that it was good. I also was able to taste the Frosé Lemonade and I really enjoyed that as well. It was a nice and light drink. I was worried that it would pretty much be a slushee, but it wasn't and that is why I liked it.I ended up being glad that I couldn't get into Beatstro, because I doubt that I would've had such a lovely time there as I did at iNINE Bistro.","Came here for brunch on a Sunday and to their Thursday comedy show. For brunch i had their burger and with fries(be warned that their fries are seasoned and spicy l, which I loved). For the comedy show I had two appetizers (the mozzarella sticks and curly) which was pretty good.For the comedy night they had several comedians a few were good, a few were mediocre and a few I just didn't find funny. But overall it was a good night with good vibes and good laughs. I definitely would go again to their comedy show, as it is a great way to spend a Thursday night.",This is a cute little spot for brunch on weekends. I was craving French toast and found this place on yelp because they offered Nutella stuffed French toast.

120,none,none,none,"Happy Anniversary to us! My hubby decided to take me out for breakfast instead of dinner this year. After 11yrs, it was fine by me, as long as we were together. I decided to choose something local, not to far from where we live, we even found street parking with no issues in such a crazy busy area. We are New Yorkers so we knew what to expect and what to do if we didn't find any street parking and thats to pay for a garage. It wouldn't have been for long anyway. Now to Terravita.It's not really a huge place, but just the right size for some intimate dining. The decor of the place is beautiful, and still very stylish for it to also be a casual spot as well. We were greeted by warm smiles and was told we could sit anywhere we like, (of course my hubby wanted to stay in front so he could see his car from up close.) We were offer water and right away my husband ordered some coffee. We decided to go with an appetizer while we waited for our food. That turned out to be an excellent idea, because the crab cakes we order were BOOM! The Bomb! They were so meaty and crisp on the outside served with a lil light refreshing salad of cucumber and fennel. They didn't have a fishy taste to them, or tasted as if they were frozen or came from a can. They were really a mouth full of flaky goodness. Then we got the French Toast served with fresh fruits and a side of creme fraiche, and my husband found that to be so good he wanted to ask the chef for the recipe so I could cook it on a daily basis lol. That bread was moist and super tasty, I couldn't even finish mines because of the large amount it was. My husband took that right off my hands to eat it himself. The bacon we ordered with it was also delicious. I was so pleased to receive complimentary bellinis on the house because we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, and on top of that such excellent service altogether we decided we would definitely have to do another return. My husband just couldn't stop talking about the Toast. Terravita definitely has found a new happy customer, and I can't wait to return for their Happy Hour and Brunch options. Our waiter let me know they have Jazz and wine tasting on Thursday evening, so look out for that review as well.

Peeps we moved back to da mother land and instead of it taking 4 hours by plane, it was a 30 minute train ride uptown on the 1 train. Folks we officially in Inwood. Transition was brutal AF but we love the neighborhood whole heartily. If ya know me the first thing I did when I moved in was scope out good eats. So far, so good...We visited Terra Vita , Dominican - American restaurant on the edge of the heights, by the GWB. You won't get a tres golpes fix but the restaurant specializes in a fusion of Dominican and American cuisine all with trendy, modern flare. I ordered the Terra Vita burger, medium rare which came between two large tostones, cheese, caramelized onions and lettuce with a side of yucca fries. So good. A lot of people ask me where can they find good Dominican food and I would always respond my mom's place up until today. Even though it's less traditional than your average Dominican joint, it's still authentic, genuine and worth visiting.","Not much to eat around this area and I was happy to see this new addition to the neighborhood. It has a nice clean feel to it and although it is a small place there is usually open tables. It wasn't overally busy for lunch which is troubling considering it is new and there is a lot of foot traffic outside. For lunch I ordered the beet trio salad. It is light and delicious but also a small portion so I left a little hungry honestly. If you dont order it with protein it may not be enough for lunch. My partner ordered the quinoa salad with salmon and enjoyed it too. It is a little on the pricier side than other restaurants in the neighborhood but that doesn't take away from the fact you get good quality food here.  Service is pretty good too and they have wifi which is always a positive.

The fries were okay but the burger itself made up for it. I did not like how overdone the bacon was though. It was too crunchy, it left a burnt feeling on my tongue. Jerk BBQ Ribs:I think the server mentioned you get six ribs and it comes with a sweet potato mash. The ribs were really good, fall off the bone type of deal. Be aware that they are VERY spicy! Which adds a nice kick. Its topped off with some vegetable that I forgot. The Sweet Potato Mash was okay but it was too creamy for my girl friend.Onion Rings:You get a generous amount of fresh onion rings. Very crunchy and some are huge pieces. $1 Oysters:They had $1 oyster deals going on and we have a few dozens to go around. The oysters are fresh and most importantly they were a good decent size. The chefs shucked then fairly fast too.Overall, Charlies was one of the best spots while we were in NY for the weekend. Very accommodating, nice and the food was delicious.","So I've been here before. Ambiance is nice. Good band on a Sunday. French toast was good. Today tables seated after us got their food before us. Then one person's food was over cooked. So he   asked for something else and it never came.  Then when talking about the order server walked away as we were talking, ignoring us. Needless to say this is not how any customer should be treated!  I'll never be back again.",Charlie's Bar & Kitchen

This place has yet to disappoint me, and all the staff here is super cool, very patient and know how to cook!! I recommend to anyone getting food in this area to skip everywhere and come here..","Hubby was in the area and asked if I wanted anything from Top Choice for dinner. I checked out their menu and asked him to get me a large fried chicken dinner w/white rice and veg and curry goat gravy on my rice (my usual). I also asked that he bring back a few pieces of fried whiting with some pickled pepper and onions.The chicken was OK. I've definitely had better tasting, better seasoned fried chicken at other West Indian spots. The vegetables were the usual Cabbage, peas, corn and carrots but I was bummed that they used curry chicken gravy and not goat. Also, they gave my husband fried porgy instead of fried whiting. I'm unsure why they did that but he doesn't know how those pieces of fish differentiate from one another so he would not have known they were giving him the wrong thing.I wouldn't be opposed from going back there but I would have to order my food in person to ensure I'm getting what I want.","Hubby went out for after work drinks with a friend in the area and brought back some take out for me. I asked for a large fried chicken dinner which is OK. The chicken is flavorful and they gave a lot of rice. I would have wanted a bit more of the veggies over the rice. I only eat my mother's rice and peas so I got white rice with what was supposed to be curry goat gravy but they gave curry chicken gravy instead. Firstly, the flavor is a lot more muted than goat and secondly, there was a huge piece of curry chicken mixed in. I also asked for a few pieces of fried whiting but they're whole and they have A LOT of bones. I honestly think these are porgy but aside from that, every tasted ok.Hubby also brought back some bun and cheese but I think that's for him. He got me a ginger beer so I'm happy for that.",Top Choice Jamaican Restaurant

There is a full Desi menu but we wanted chinese food so ordered the lollipop chicken / sesame chicken / beef with broccoli / Szechuan beef / fried rice. Everything tasted good .. freshly made .. szech beef was spicy / beef with broccoli was not .. lollipop chicken is not like sagar in queens but our kids liked it .. The reason to not give 5 stars is main course took over half hour to get.

The flavor of the food was definetly amazing I cannot complain about it but the fact that it took 45 min to get served a plate full of oranges was pretty wild.

We called our orders in so it was ready when we went to pick up. It was pretty crowded and it's only a bar area to sit and eat your breakfast.

It's a black owned establishment. The customer service can improve, but it's not the worst. You're greeted when you walk in. It looks like a family owned business, and it's always busy so it wasn't the worst. Just not the best. All in all, i would recommend this place for breakfast (that's all i ever had here) but my sister lives around here so they come here faithfully. (Every weekend) they love it. The portion sizes were huge. Be careful that you don't eat and have somewhere to go after. This is definitely a heavy meal that can put you to sleep if you're being lazy. The best part also, they have an A on the window. Best thing to see walking in the morning.

The drinks were really goid too, the sangrias were strong!The only reason why I am giving them 4 stars is because of the drinks; if you decide to have mimosa as your 1st drink, that is all you can have, you can not switch to another drink.  Also, although the service was good, It would have been nice to know what was actually part of the bruch drinks; it was not until we were about to leave that I looked at the menu from another table and saw they had beer as part of the brunch drinks, which is what my dad wanted (we had no nenu of what brunch consisted of and a drinks menu at our table). Overall, it is a great bruch spot with a nice view.","I have been to this restaurant many times and always order the pulpo (octopus) salad and it has been one of the best I've had in the Bronx.

Can't say enough good things ! Love icehouse,"Came here on a Sunday evening, the place was about half full so we sat outside to soak in the beautiful night. The view was fantastic, but unfortunately the service was far from it. It took us quite a while to even get menus and then even as our food was served it would take a few minutes after for our waitress to bring utensils out after. I figured the wait times would be kind of long given the disclaimer on the menu that it was possible since everything is made from scratch, but even given that the wait times felt excessive. As for the food we started with the clams oreganata, which tasted very good. It had the perfect amount of bread crumbs and the lemon went well with the clams. As for my entree the salmon was okay, not particularly flavorful and the size was reasonable. The lemony garlic sauce salvaged the meal and tasted great. Overall, I think there are much better seafood options within a short drive of similar if not stronger quality in terms of service and food.",Valentina rocks and the clams and shrimp are slamming.Sandy makes you laugh and Terry is not a absentee owner.

The restaurant is very small and not ideal for groups, but there are a couple of seats available if you'd like to get a quick bite to eat. I'm not sure of the name of the meal that I ordered, but was excited to try it - the food smelled amazing! I made sure to add the garlic sauce on top. I didn't have the opportunity to sit down and enjoy my meal since I had a flight to catch, so I had to carry my meal in a plastic bag. I regret not holding my meal upright because I believe this caused the garlic sauce to leak from the container. Once I finally got to the airport, I had the opportunity to try the food. It was decent, definitely not mind blowing.  I'd say it was somewhat bland in nature, and some of the pork had of inedible fat. I think it would have been more satisfying with some sauce n' seasoning. I think the leakage definitely contributed to the lack of flavor/ extra oomph. Overall, very filling meal and pretty good with the addition of seasoning and hot sauce. I'd like to sit down and enjoy my meal the next time I visit this restaurant for a more accurate review. Stay tuned for updates!","I came at 6 pm and most of the stuffs were sold out. They only had pernil, pastelitos, and few pieces of chicken. I ordered a rice beans pernil combo and extra side of pernil. Pernil was tender, flavorful and moist.

Their menu has something for everyone. I also loved the decor and our waitress was friendly and helpful. My issues are that there were multiple menu items they ran out of. They are cash only but have an ATM in the restaurant. The wait was about 30 minutes and we were seated at a high table so the chairs were cutting off our circulation. We were extremely uncomfortable.

Surprisingly this place has excellent food for a hole-in-the-wall type place. I've passed here a million times and never thought to go in.

I've been looking for great falafel in the area, and this is definitely the place.The bamya (lamb and okra in a red sauce) is excellent as well, great flavor and tender. The pita is hot, fresh and fluffy, and went great with the hummus and foal (spelling?) which was filling and bursting with flavor as well.

140,none,"I was very disappointed with this establishment. From beginning to end. Me and my friend were sat down and it took quite sometime before we were attended to by a waiter/waitress. In between waiting for our food it always took 20-25 minutes to get another drink or ask for things.I asked personally for the owner because my friend told me such high things and to mention him when he came to the table. Ultimately the owner never came, which was a huge disappointment when the staff said he would stop by. The food itself was extremely overpriced, lacked flavor, and was subpar quality. The ""seafood combo for two"" is more of a seafood combo for five people (very misleading). The rice was absolutely terrible. It was well overcooked and tasted like it just sat in warm water for hours. I personally will not be returning to this establishment on City Island nor do I recommend them.","Wish I could give this no stars. We (7 adults  4 kids) were all excited and ready to enjoy a great seafood feast but such would not be the case. While the 1st person in the group was there and seated before the end of the posted lunch hours we were not allowed to order off the lunch menu. I asked to speak with the owner/manager because it would have be been a task to move all the kids. Again we were refused, so we left. Now while policy is policy and I respect that. What I was disappointed in was the owner managers response to us on the way out. We (each adult) was mocked and chastised on the way out the door. He said ""you're going to regret leaving "" ""you're going to get junk any where else on the island, "" ""you're making a mistake,"" and ""your loss""I probably would have returned another day minus kids had he not behaved so poorly.

I did tell the manager what was wrong and it was addressed - the waiter was not handling his business at all and the food lacked flavor and the presentation was bad - like the food was thrown on the plate - we had to remind the waiter several times to bring ketchup or other things - even when the manager was addressing our concerns he had to remind the waiter to take care of our order again! after being told before.

That's all cute and dandy, but the shellfish was now cold while His Slowness crawled to the kitchen to pick up the rest of the meal, and then bring it to our table.  The shellfish initially came out warm, and now it was just cold...not good!For $80, the king crab legs were a bit too few.  They were large and meaty, and cooked well, but there just wasn't that many of them.  The lobster was also cooked well, but could've used more seasoning throughout the whole thing instead of just in the middle.  The baked potatoes were not good AT ALL.  They were cooked in too hot an over for too short a time causing the skin to burn and the inside to stay hard in the middle.  That was really disappointing.  Not only do I really enjoy a good baked potato with butter, but they are so incredibly easy to make and we like to eat the skin.  The linguine in white sauce was really good although the missing grated cheese would've made it that much better, but it was a very nice surprise indeed.  I would venture to say it was the best part of this overpriced and very disheartening meal.  For all that money, I really wanted to love it and that just didn't happen :(",Sammy's Shrimp Box Restaurant

I love this place but the service has gone down. My mom is too disgusted to go back. George needs to talk to her about treating customers better.","The food they serve here is really good and the waiters are very nice to you. The service is fast and if you like grilled cheese sandwiches then come here because it's really good here. The variety of menu options are great and well balanced. Sometimes it may be crowded but you'll only be waiting for around 5-10mins. Anyways, if you live around this place, definitely check",Lydig Coffee House
144,none,none,"Truly disappointed at the service. We waited extremely long to be seated despite us having a reservation and the place being empty. We asked several times to be seated yet we were told to wait. Unfortunately, no one even came to greet us. The entire service took over 3 hours as we had to wait for everything from the food , the check , and everything in between. We watched all of the White customers come and go quickly while also getting their orders prior to us despite us being there well before them. We asked for the manager to no avail. We explained our dissatisfaction and he offered no remorse nor did he apologize or try to be accommodating in any way.","Went here for a late Saturday lunch, and while not too busy, (the whole island wasnt that packed) The place had some people.  If you are looking for good food, great prices and good service, this place has it.  No cafeteria style fried food here like next door. Good clean food.we had the Calamari appetizer which was good, but I wish they used the tentacles. King crab and snow crab were delicious! Steamed just right.Wife's shrimp platter was hot and had the perfect flavor. Not drowned in butter. the kids had the fish and chips  and chicken fingers which were good.  overall, clean place, good food, not too busy will be back for Fathers day!","Food - 2Cost - 1Service - 3Company - 10I had this review drafted forever. Ha, what else is new? It's a bad review and I hate giving low stars, but this was my experience. We came here for nostalgic reasons, hoping to relive those yummy food experiences from years past...shoulda known better.  They certainly aren't worth that, yay we MUST go to Lobster Box, whoohoo!....NOT!! Granted, we ourselves had a great time cause you know, half decent wine and good company always covers up all the dumb, dumb flaws. Shrimp Dynamite? Trying to jump on the played out Bang, Bang Shrimp wagon you say? Bangin'? Dynamite? They certainly were neither. What they should be named is Fried Shrimp. Geez! We didn't feel like fiddling with lobster crackers and bibs and working for our food. So the broiled, tad over fired tails had no choice but to do the job and sufferingly, satiated our lobster cravings. Yeah, I know gluttons for punishment. Won't be making that mistake again.  The Crab Lobster Stuffing, what I really came for was nothing at all how I remembered it. The cuts on the veggies were big chunks and not even sautéed through, creating a chunky veggie stuffing with soft breaded texture and hardly any crab or lobster. What a disappointment!Our server on the other hand, was very attentive and was a plus, adding a plus to this our last experience at Lobster Box.  I get the, 'if it ain't broke don't fix it', and some people still love this place. But come on CI, stop it with the exorbitant prices, lack luster food and one note restaurants. Every restaurant on the strip, with the exception of a very small few are a Johnny's Reef under a different name. You all have one of the best views in the Bronx, up your game a bit to match for goodness sake. Rant over.",none,Lobster Box Restaurant
145,none,none,Nothing special as far as the quality of the food goesNice laid-back atmosphere sitting outsideHad a broiled seafood combo,"Looking for quick, tasty seafood with a beautiful scenery? Tony's Pier is it! The only restaurant I know of in City Island is Sammy's so, when my boyfriend offered to take me out to another restaurant in the area, I was excited. We visited Tony's Pier on a Saturday, early evening. Its located at the very end of the strip overlooking the pier. Parking isn't too bad and there is both indoor and outdoor seating. This is a casual dining restaurant (think of mcdonald's), so do not expect anything fancy. The menu is basic and features seafood (mostly fish, shrimp, lobster tails, etc.), chicken, and sides (e.g., fries, onion rings, etc.). They offer both fried and steamed options. Alcohol also available for purchase. Pricing is reasonable given that its all fresh seafood however, its CASH ONLY. Upon entering, we were a little confused as there are multiple lines. One line is for fried, another for steamed, then another for drinks. Overkill. There was someone to direct you at times but its still a lot of lines, almost as if you in a theme park. The wait time thankfully, was not long. We ordered the fried shrimp with a side of french fries and a side of whiting fish. The shrimp and fries were pretty good, needed a little more seasoning but still edible. The tartar sauce  also could've used a little pizzaz, but it did the job. The whiting fish however, was bland. It tasted as if they just cleaned it and fried it, no salt or anything for taste, so disappointing. Overall, its a nice place to visit for a casual date or family night out, keep your expectations calm. I would return in the future.","Amazing seafood!Not many choices as expected but what I ended up choosing was my favorite. We went early Sunday, as soon as they opened so it was as busy but in an hour or so it became busy. We got lucky to not wait too long for food.The side options are limited. Most dinners all come with French fries so if you want something else you'll need to order it. My broil lobster was so juicy it was totally worth the extra few minute wait. More waiting would be required if it is super busy.Seating is available between inside and outside as well as parking.It is cash only.",none,Tony's Pier Restaurant

Yeah....I guess I can get by with Cod Fish, Yuca or other Root Vegetable Side dish- but between the steam, meat and pork smells all around, poor ventilation system all Cuchifrito's have- plus me smelling like food after, it's enough for me to seriously keep out. But hubby is Puerto Rican and grew up eating at cuchifritos. He decided on a Lunch pickup for us and eat in the car while we waited for our names to be called to do our taxes. Really don't know what the place looks like- but hubby went all in for a Morcilla (Blood Sausage), 2 Alcapurrias (made of Green Plantains & Yautia Stuffed W/ Meat then fried- which he liked) and a Bacalaito (Cod Fish Fritter). I just settled on Yuca with Onions. Honestly, I'm so damn picky about Cod Fish Fritters- I can't eat them from just anybody. Plus Puerto Rican and Dominican ways of Cooking and Seasonings- differ quite a bit. According to hubby, one bite of the Morcilla- threw him off and trashed the entire thing, the Cod Fish Fritter- was just like I imagined and still drenching in oil- ewwww. Yuca? Well...you can't mess up boiled Root Vegetables with Onions in Vinegar and Oil (can you?). Even my Passion Fruit Juice was watered down. Why??? Good try. But nahhh. Hubby hasn't eaten at a cuchifritos in ages and not even sure if he needs to back off from the stuff he grew up on.

It's literally touching and everything is home made and what's another for fresh? Hmm whatever that is it's 100% better than that. The fiancée and myself don't eat pork so Nook has it clearly posted that they don't use pork in any of their dishes.

I was so nervous that I was eating pork bc my Spidey senses was completely loving the bacon. I wish I could have taken more back to the hotel.

148,none,none,none,We had beautiful day at Wave Hill with friends. The personal is not friendly but after one of my friends spoke with the manager the issue was addressed and we were welcomed. I'm giving five stars because of the exceptional management and the beautiful garden. Food was OK!,"Few places in the city are set in a more beautiful setting. The Wave Hill Gardens are gorgeous, and although from the outside space of the cafe you can't see the Hudson River, it's still a great place to have food. I have only eaten here once, but what I ordered was surprisingly well prepared. In these places restaurants are usually mediocre and overpriced. They know you really don't have a choice, and take advantage of it. Not here. Their chicken panini was delicious. Perfectly toasted and thoughtfully prepared. In addition, prices are not outrageous, considering where u are. Next time I go I'll make sure I stop by again.","A wonderful oasis in the middle of a city jungle. Once you step on the grounds it will take much convincing to believe that you are still in NYC. A slightly hidden gem, I say slightly because it's well known by those whom had the opportunity to visit but not by everyone else. They are also on the park department's website and have their own site. So Wave Hill is not exactly hiding. Lol. I must admit I've learned of this beautiful gem some time ago and just never ventured over. Unless you leave in the vicinity of the Riverdale area I must forewarn you it can be quite a bit of a trek, especially if you don't drive. However, I will go as far to say that is part of this park's beauty, romance and allure. Perfect for families (even the little ones), friends and couples. WaveHill feels like the door to a portal, where everything is green, lush, and peaceful. With amazing views of the river, the bridge and wonderfully blooming flowers in Spring & Summer and great changes of foliage colors in the Fall. Wave Hill is of course is on a smaller scale then the famed Central Park or the notable Botanical Gardens but by no means do you miss out on any of nature's wonder. This park offers visitors, a green house, garden house and a plethora activities and events for everyone. On the day of my visit there were a group of yogis in their bliss on one of the main lawns. There is also seating throughout the grounds, gray wood crafted seats for you to just relax and enjoy your own personal serenity if you so choose. You can become a member or pay as you go, however there are many things you can access for free. The park has a parking lot which I believe is at a cost of $8 dollars and be aware it is small so it fills up quickly. As alternative there is a shuttle you can take to avoid the congestion or the search for a spot. I strongly recommend you visit their site to see and learn all of what Wave Hill has to offer.Just A Note: You are allowed to bring food & snacks but signs say no picnicking. So be modest and don't bring Boo Boo and your picnic baskets.",The Cafe at Wave Hill
149,none,none,none,HANDS DOWN THE BEST PROSCIUTTO and FRESH MOZZARELLA Sandwich I have ever had. The prosciutto was sliced so perfectly thin and the fresh mozz was delicious. Unfortunately I live in California and can't eat these sandwiches every day.,"I pass G&R regularly since it's on one of my walking routes, but it's not exactly in my neighborhood so I usually patron other Italian delis. That's not taking away from G&R though, because I've always heard good things. The other day I was feeling a little change from the norm, so I decided to head over to G&R to pick up some lunch.G&R offers most everything you would want out of an Italian deli: cold cuts, hot dishes to go, specialty items, as well as offering catering. I was just looking for a sandwich, but decided to get a little creative and get turkey with mayo, mustard, roasted red peppers, Meunster, lettuce, tomato, and onion...on a club roll =). The sandwich was tasty; all the components were fresh and the sandwich didn't fall apart when I bit into it - though judging by how much stuff I crammed into there, it was begging to be.Overall, I had a great first experience at G&R - it's nice to know places like this are still around. I would be totally open to coming back for another sandwich and to try some of their hot food.","I like the chicken cutlet sandwich, but it didn't taste particularly special. I liked how the mozzarella was gooey and made fresh, and I liked the simple combination of ingredients, but it's definitely comfort food rather than a memorable experience for the taste buds.I've also tried the Italian combo sandwich, which was too salty for my taste.",G & R Deli

This was my first time trying Thai food and I will definitely order again ! #vegeterianlover,"Love thai food but First time and Never had can opened veggie ingredients (definitely some), frozen white pale shrimps, uncut cherry tomatoes like really. how lazy can you be? This restaurant acts like they have no space in the kitchen to prepare your food. they will never be happy to serve you here. It's obvious, asked for extra peanut sauce, my take out order? Half the small 1 oz container was HALF full. I had to sparingly eat my chicken and sauce. The chicken had white strips of unprocessed rubbery juices stuck on it. What in the open grill? chicken tasted like it was cooked in a closed container in the microwave with nowhere to breathe. White juice spilling all over. The chicken was dry so much that it cut the roof of my mouth when the meat teared apart as I was chewing. NEVER AGAIN. My $20 will never serve a restaurant like this in the long run.Waiter takes about a a few seconds to stare at you before they proceed to get your request if you ask for more. I assume they're waiting to make you uncomfortable so that you're minded to give a tip. Nasty, salty. In the HELL never will take a look at the restaurant if I ever come across it again. I'm soaring at the way the food was treated to feed someone. Obtrusive! Trust the sad reviews you see because trust the operations of business.

152,none,none,none,"TLDR: ***THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY!!!*** My group of four really enjoyed this brunch and we are definitely looking forward to coming back here again soon. Highly recommended! Great food and good service. Good times! Overall rating: A++***THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY!!!*** Three friends and I came here on Sunday at 12:30pm for brunch. Many free parking spots on the street that day. My friend called and made us a reservation for brunch a few weeks in advance. Brunch is served as an all-you-can-eat buffet. Brunch also comes with unlimited coffee for just $22.95 plus tax and tip! What a bargain! Mimosas are $5 each extra. There is a staffed omelet station in the back sometimes but I didn't use it. We sat in the back patio and it was very nice. I wish there were more umbrellas and some of the chairs were more comfortable though. It seems like most of the customers were sitting on the patio. So come early if you want to get a nice shady spot out on the patio. I barely saw any people inside unless they were waiting on the line to get food from the buffet. Service was very good they came by to check on us often. The problem is you need to make sure you don't overeat. When I was there at the hot stations, I saw they had bacon, sausage, kind of dry and burned French toast, bread pudding(?) with raspberry sauce, slightly burned pancakes, scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, gross corned beef hash(?), and weirdly sweet and hot sausages and peppers. Later on they replaced the sausage and peppers with fried chicken, which was a much better option. At the cold station they had various fruits, yogurts, grilled vegetables, mini creme brulees, flan, cinnamon buns, and bagels. My favorites were the bacon, pancakes, fried chicken, bread pudding, and watermelon. I'm sure I'm forgetting a bunch of items since there was such a big variety! It ended up being about $34 per person (including brunch and one mimosa for each person) after tax and tip.I really like that this place is nice and cozy without being too noisy/crowded. It is a great place to come and catch up with friends! There are two unisex bathrooms right before you get to the patio. They're very small though. All in all everyone had a great time. We had our fill of delicious foods as well as tasty mimosas. I would definitely return here in the future for brunch! I have not come here during other times of the day yet. ***THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY!!!***Pro Tip: Orchard Beach is nearby if you're interested in stopping by after brunch. Parking at the beach is $10 per car on the weekends unfortunately.",Chose to escape the madness of Fordham Parent's Weekend and eat on City Island. Excellent decision.

We stumbled upon this hidden gem on a Saturday night and let me tell you it did not disappoint!! The food was really good! Not the nasty chain restaurant type food that is available in the area. The wait staff was okay for the most part. Only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because our water was not filled until I asked for it, also they never came by to ask if everything was okay, our waiter disappeared after taking our orders and we had to ask other wait staff for napkins, water etc but overall liked the place.",The Black Whale

155,none,"It makes me sad to write a negative review of this popular City Island institution. It's part of the community's fabric and I know that so many Bronx locals and tourists come here for special occasions and family gatherings. HOWEVER, for as much as this restaurant overcharges for mediocre, frozen--and I might even go as far as saying imitation--seafood, it deserves to be called out. (Note: This review does not reflect the service. I was very happy with the service we received.) Here's my experience in a nutshell if you don't feel like reading the full review: We finished only half of the appetizer (couldn't stomach the imitation or frozen calamari), then, after taking a few bites of our equally imitation or frozen main course (conch salads), politely sent the dishes back and asked for the check. Yes, it was that bad. (I've never sent food back at a restaurant.)The full experience:My hubby and I went on a Sunday afternoon and ordered the Fried Calamari appetizer ($17.95) and Cold Scungilli (conch) Salads ($21.95 each). Let's first talk about the calamari. At $17.95, one would expect crispy, FRESH, well-seasoned squid with an equally delicious (and special) sauce. What we got was either frozen or (more likely) imitation squid. How do I know? Every ring was the same shape and size (natural squid varies in size when cut up), there were no tentacle pieces and the consistency was that of crabstick, which is a totally processed imitation crab made of leftover pressed fish parts. The crazy thing is, even the worst food can taste good when given a good fry, right? Not in this case. The fry was soggy, not well seasoned (Red Lobster probably seasons its fried food better), and the red dipping sauce was like a basic, straight-out-of-a-jar variety.Also, here's some context on price for quality. Oceana, one of Manhattan's top seafood restaurants, charges $19 for a fried calamari appetizer. Read: ""Manhattan's TOP seafood restaurants.""Their calamari is fresh, flavorful, crispy and comes with a very special dipping sauce (not what tastes like straight out of a can). The Scungilli (conch) Salads at $21.95. The salad itself was large and the amount of conch on it was very generous. The conch itself, I'm guessing was also frozen, though, because it had that watery consistency that comes from being defrosted. Also, it lacked that certain crunch and meatiness that fresh conch has. Lastly, similar to the squid, every piece was identical.It was seasoned with oil and Italian herbs and had no taste otherwise. The dressing was served in a plastic cup on the side. My hubby and I both took a few bites and honestly couldn't bare to eat the rest. It looked fake. It tasted fake. And as sad as I am to say it, we were just grossed out.We're not food snobs. We're not ""foodies."" And we certainly don't discriminate when it comes to food or restaurants. 2 hours before visiting Sea Shore, my hubby was at Orchard Beach eating a hamburger from the Food Shack there. No complaints there. This review is about one thing: Price for quality. I 'get' that this is a tourist trap-type of place that inflates its prices because of its location. But for such inflated prices, AT LEAST serve up fresh (and at the very least, REAL) seafood and put a little more effort into 'taste' itself.P.S. We gave our server a hefty tip for the trouble and apologized for the inconvenience.",none,"I had visitors from California and they love to eat on City Island while they are here.On a rainy Tuesday we drove to City Island to find a restaurant for lunch and the first one we spotted coming over the bridge was Sea Shore Restaurant and Marina.We were the first ones there and our waiter Manny2 brought us menus and asked us for our drink order,We then saw the lunch menu on the back of the menu and could not believe what a good deal we were about to get.    The menu included either a soup or salad,   main entry of fresh fish or many choices of pasta, etc. and coffee and dessert,My friends had the scrod and I had the whole flounder.Manny came with a tray of appetizers of mushrooms,  olives, canoli beans, etc and warm delicious bread.The service was excellent and the food plentiful and delicious.Manny talks to us about experiences in Mexico which my friends had also experienced way back in the 1960's and we had the most wonderful experiences vowing to return next year when my California friends will return.",none,"Dinner at Sea Shore was my worse experience at any City Island location.  First let start with our waiter Victor, he was unattentive to ours and any one else's table he was assigned to,,as he spent all his time at one table holding an extensive conversation with this one family across from my table.  i almost felt like they were his family or friends, we had to wave him over from their table, just to take our order. My friend who doesn't like calamari asked for it to be subbed with extra scallop instead, which he informed us they may only give you 2 extra, which was fine since she's gonna eat zero calamari.  Her order comes to the table with a mound of calamari,  Victor then tried to explain how they likely just left the calamari also (really Victor??) I don't believe he requested any substitute.  The food was all bland, no seasoning. My stuffed filet of sole, blah!! , served with no butter sauce, reduction,  nor a drop of any sauce drizzled atop, fettuccine a little sticky, basic steamed veggies. And the crabcake, worst ever, one side totally overcooked, had to return it. The manager tried to explain they were pan fried, looked like that were slapped right on top of a griddle and left to fry. The best thing on the table was the complimentary cornbread. And the reason for the 1 star...is Salmen, who i believe is a table busser. Was excellent where Victor was not, he continually came to refill our water, asked if everything was okay or if we needed anything. Funny thing, once we msde complaints,  Victor was all over our table,  but by then I was so over Victor.  So glad gratuity was not automatically added, or that would have been another issue. I believe in paying for the service I receive.  Which means Victor would've been left with $0, from the service we received my nicer than me friend left $5. FYI..slipped Salmen a little something on my way out the restaurant, as well as my friend.  I like my $ to go to who deserves it, wish he was our waiter.  He could've done anything about the food , but at least the service would've been an improvement.

Wow, were we very surprised and happy at how great his place was.  Everything from our server Francesco (who is a very friendly and animated Italian man) to the appetizers and the main course to the desserts, they were outstanding, incredibly authentic and tasty.  The chef also came out and mingled with us which was lovely.  We will most definitely be returning!","My family came here on a beautiful Saturday night. This is one of the few restaurants on Arthur Ave. with sidewalk dining. The place is small and inviting with the feeling of a small bistro in Italy. We'll get down to it. The place was a borderline 2 star experience overall, but I boosted it for it's large portions and fair prices. Appetizers: Baked clams were very good and fresh. We also ordered the fried artichokes. They came out crispy, but were under seasoned. The only accompaniment for them was an odd choice of Russian Dressing smeared on the plate. Just a drizzle of olive oil and sprinkle of sea salt would have been perfect, Russian Dressing..ah no. We also ordered a flatbread with Arugala, Buffalo Mozzarella and Proscutto. It was very tasty, but the crust was store bought pita bread cut into rectangles and toasted. A bit odd for an Italian restaurant in the heart of Arthur Ave.Main Courses: My wife had Eggplant Parmesan, which she said was tasty and a good sized portion. My daughter had Chicken Parmesan which she enjoyed, And I had a special Veal Milanese, which was a whole bone-in Veal chop pounded and breaded and fried topped with fresh salad. It was huge and good, although similar to the artichokes under seasoned. It definitely needed salt.My other daughter's dish was an issue, She ordered an Italian Dumpling dish that was on the special's menu. We know this was the correct dish ordered because we had questions about it which the waiter answered before confirming the order. Somehow her dish came out and was Rigatoni and Shrimp. Fair enough, mistakes are made. The waiter came over and insisted that was what we ordered - - even after reminding him of the conversation about how the ""Dumplings"" are made. He then told us it would take time to make another dish, as if we were supposed to accept their mistake. After having to insist on the correct dish, which a customer should never have to do, we were told that the owner was going to get the dumplings for dinner but they will make it for us instead. I'm sorry, the owner? Am I supposed to feel some sort of gratitude that the customer comes first? Well after only 5 minutes the dish came out. And she enjoyed it. He should have simply said ""I'm sorry, let me get you the right dish.""We decided to order some desserts. We ordered 3 items to share, A Pistachio Tartufo of sorts, profiteroles and Panna Cotta. the waiter came back and said they were out of Panna Cotta, so we didn't have that, but then when the bill came they charged us for the Panna Cotta  -- AND THE WRONG RIGATONI DISH. The waiter didn't return and instead we had to flag down the food runner. They removed the charges, but why did we have to sit there trying to get someone's attention (there were only 2 occupied tables in the entire place)?While these issues irked us, at the end of the day it was a nice setting, the food overall was good, the prices reasonable and the portions were large. Just wish the service and seasoning were as on point.",Went on Mother's Day weekend and the menu was adjusted from what we saw online and more expensive as well. Food was deliciousHouse made gluten free ravioli was fantastic (although portion could have been much larger for $24). They lost a star since we ordered 3 gin and tonics and we were delivered vodka sodas without them saying anything... and charged us for them even though 2 out of 3 weren't consumed.,San Gennaro Trattoria Restaurant Bar

I felt it was more ""lunch"" than brunch though as there were hardly any breakfast items. My mimosa was continuously refilled, and I never saw the bottom of the glass until we were being ushered out the door because another party was coming in. The entire time was nice and casual.... until they wanted us to leave and then we felt as if we were being rushed and pushed out. Still, I'd come back.

I am the type of person to take very small amount no more that 2 bites so I can determine if I like the flavor or not. I tried about 5 options and was shocked when I was told at register my food was $51 with my drink. I asked the cashier why she said it's not recommended to put gravy or salad dressing on food.

It was so worth the wait and I was so glad we went.  I had been craving it for a while and got my fix.  Definitely recommend it. They have lots of options for the waffles and other food as well.  Just don't get discouraged by the wait, it's worth every minute.  The waffles and chicken are made to order.","OXTAILS Don't bother getting the oxtails. I just got off my late shift. I always see a crowd of people go to this establishment so I was curious to come and order something. The oxtails was a 3/10. They were so focused on the spice that they didn't care much for the oxtail flavor. The rice and peas tasted so PLAIN that I just gave the rest of my food to the homeless.Btw when I asked for extra gravy for my rice, all I got was LITTLE gravy on the oxtails while my rice was dry as my lips after tasting this dish",My sister was raving about their chicken and waffles. We decided to order for breakfast and it was a solid meal. I would rate Lash West a 3.5 it's not a 4 but it isn't a 3. The portion size was decent and prices were reasonable. I was discontent with their waffles a little too soft for my liking. The chicken was delicious though. It beats IHOP's chicken and waffles for the convenience I would definitively eat here again.,Lash West Indian And American Cuisine
164,none,"This is a recap on a not so pleasurable experience my friends and I had at Krave. Let me say, I have been to the establishment before and the food and customer service have been good. This could've been an extremely off day. We decided to go to the restaurant for their Rum Punch Brunch (basically a brunch/day party) My friends showed up at 2:20 and were seated at 2:50 by the host, initially they asked if they could be served mimosas (while they waited) since unlimited drinks were included in the price. They were told that they could not, because they needed to be seated. Why would that make a difference if the unlimited drinks were going to be stopped at 4 PM, and you paid upon entry ? When we sat at the table she said "" well, we about to stop serving drinks now anyway, it ends at 3PM"". Why wouldn't you communicate that upfront, shows a lack of customer service ? Also, this was totally conflicting to what was posted online by the owner, the flyer said 4 PM. (there were two flyers on his page, one said 3 PM and the other 4 PM). Whose error is that? Making the best of the situation we processed to get food from the buffet. The host was still in the vicinity, our table was then taken by three gentlemen. When we called the host over to rectify, her response was ""somebody should've left their bag there to hold the seat"". Why would someone leave their purse unattended in a restaurant? What was the purpose of the host seating you ? At that point we decided to leave and requested a refund. We also asked to speak to a manager regarding there being two different ending times posted online. The response was ""he posted the  wrong flyer"". Again no effort to rectify the situation.Another thing, if someone ask a speak to a supervisor/manager it would be nice if they acknowledge the patron when they arrive to ""address to concerns"", and not talk about you in front of your face like you don't exist. That is very rude and unprofessional. I believe everyone is entitled to fixing their mistakes. This was our experience on this specific day. Hopefully no one else has to go through this lackluster service.",none,"Let's get into ""KRAVE""! Ambiance is very nice I must say they did good with this location.

OKAY now this food! For apps I order the pepper shrimp I love there pepper shrimp it's exactly what pepper shrimp should taste like very spicy and flavorful! I also order there chicken soup(keep in mind they serve different soups on different days) the soup is VERY GOOD! the broth is not to thick enough chicken and carrots are served in your dish. For entree I order the broiled salmon w/ sautéed spinach on the side, now I must say the salmon is very fresh tasteful and seasoned right the spinach is good but to watery.

166,none,none,none,"Roy's Top 5 Things to Know:1. One of the best NY Pizza spots in NYC. Lived here for over 35 years and discovered this place while I attended Fordham University 18 years ago. Now I travel all the way from Washington Heights to get a pizza pie from Pugsleys. 2. You can park here. It's limited and tight but it's a plus since it's right by Fordham road.3. This place is super divey, definitely has a college feel to it when you walk in. But there's plenty of space to sit with benches and tables.4. If you get water bottles from here just note that it's not Poland Spring, Dasani, nothing like that...it's super local like bottled themselves.5. It's on a hidden street by Fordham road so just find the gates to Fordham University, make a right and it's on that street.","If you're looking for a hole in the wall place, this is literally the exact definition of that. The only entrance is located on a side street between East Fordham Road and Fordham University, making it a staple for all Fordham kids in the area. The coolest thing about this place is that they have a giant Dong that they hit every time an order for a pie is placed. The decorations are also really unique and designed by many of the students themselves. Not only that, but the staff is the coolest and most down to earth people I have ever met anywhere. If you're ever in the Little Italy area, do yourself a favor and stop by here for some pizza. Absolutely nothing bad to say about it. One of the best things about this place is the hours of operation. Anytime I'm out with friends at a nearby bar or house party, we always always make sure to stop by for a late night meal here, along with loads of other people. But that doesn't mean they can't handle it because I've never had to wait very long to place and receive my order. A lot of people talk about Full Moon's pizzeria in the same neighborhood and although that's not a bad choice, this restaurant definitely comes up on top. If nothing else, stop by here and see for yourself!!!!","Pugsleys is the spot I recommend when people ask me for a ""hidden gem"" in NYC. You won't find this place advertised, you simply have to know about it.This is my favorite pizza in the whole city. It's conveniently located right next to the Fordham gates and it stays open LATE. 3am on weekdays and 5 AM on the weekends. I can't tell you how many times Pugsleys has saved my life at 3am.I personally love the classic cheese slice but their chicken roll is great as well. Another favorite of mine is the pene alla vodka slice. It's incredibly filling but incredibly tasty.Sal, the owner, is a classic italian pizza shop owner you might see in a movie...he's great. It always feels nice to be there because you always feel welcome.The place is old and isn't very pleasing on the eye but it doesn't take a single thing away from this pizza place.",Pugsley's Pizza

169,none,none,none,"This review is long overdue. I have been a customer for a long time and tried almost everything on the menu so decided to post my thoughts.First of all Vaya is one the most reliable restaurant in this neighborhood. I always order delivery from Seamless and they are almost always on time. The delivery guy is very friendly. Second, it's a very small place, so if you want to dine-in it's probably not a good idea. It's good for take outs or deliveries. Like I said before I tasted almost everything on the menu and here are my thoughts:- The Vaquero quesadilla was very oily, I don't know if it's because of the meat or the cheese but it felt a little heavy.- Tipico quesadilla was much better, I guess it was because of the shredded chicken breast. The heaviness is much more bearable.- I only had Puerqito tacos. Overall taste was good but there was too much stuff on the tortilla so it was a little hard to eat.- Enchilada Rojas is my favorite, it's super delicious, you should try it!- Tinga Bowl was very good too, very filling and a little bit of everything. Overall it's a great 4-star place and if you live in this neighborhood, you should really try Vaya!","It seems like the passion is lost. I ordered from this restaurant twice for a food pickup and was underwhelmed twice. I wanted it to be great. The food photographs well it cat fished me. I have ordered the Tinga Bowl,Vaquero Quesadilla, Flan, Grilled Churassco Bowl, Chipotle Ketchup, Jalapeno Sour Cream,and the Lime Zest Sour Cream.Everything lacked flavor. You guys really need to go back to the drawing board. The portions are very scant for the price that you pay. They are charging higher prices which you would think that the quality of the ingredients would he high but its not. Its either going to be bigger portions for the price or better ingredients.The location is very small with limited seating. The Tinga bowl which was supposed to be chicken in a tomato sauce tasted like raw tomato paste without any seasoning. It was a dollop of chicken and whole container of rice and a splash of Pico de Gallo that lacked brightness and and dollop of sad guacamole. The Churassco Bowel offered up non seasoned chewy steak (felt like a chew toy) The only saving grace was with that meal was that I had ordered the the green sauce which helped that dish tremendously. The Quesadilla was as tough as a brick and very unpleasant to eat It did not bring anything to the table. The cheese in the Quesadilla was similar to Play Dough.I hate to give a bad review to a restaurant especially a mom and pop style restaurant but It looks like you guys lost your soul/identity. I was hoping to come here and experience what some people have in your older reviews but I did not. I did not taste any love in the meals that were prepared. I was so taken back the first time that I ordered again just to see if it was a fluke based on the reviews. Ladies and gentleman it was not. It seems you guys have lost that passion.","We have ordered a couple of times from here, as it is very close to our home. We had two tikka bowls today and chips with guac. The order was on time-even earlier than they promised! I liked the bowl with chicken, beans, guac and salsa.  Even the taste is fine, still for me it is a little bit too much of a mix...

I overheard our waiter tell the runner that the 3 dishes will be shared and should be coursed out, ""which sucks, but..."".

173,none,"I can say I honestly will never come here again and I recommend you do the same. I came here in my lunch break and to get some food and it was below par to say the least. I'll start with what I ate ...Jerk chicken wings with Mac and cheese, corn bread, and corn on the cob. Sounds delicious yes.... well it wasn't. I was highly disappointed when I opened my plate and saw my Mac and cheese had burnt pieces of macaroni and was tasteless. I looked beyond that and went to the wings ... the wings still had the chicken feathers still on it but I continued the chicken had literally tasted as if it was a dry rub with only salt and pepper. The corn o the cob also too burnt with a dry rub that didn't taste too good. So time for my dessert the corn bread, and that tasted nothing like corn bread. It was bland, it lacked the texture. Nothing about this meal said soul food. The reception wasn't well either the young lady who was taking orders was annoyed with the customers, when I asked for butter for the cornbread she looked annoyed and didn't even answer me.the staff that was cooking the meal seemed to be teenagers not the prestigious chef that was suppose to be in the kitchen. Not to mention they have no menu, only the board, so those of us who have trouble seeing bring glasses. They do offer beverages but the cashier didn't seem to know exactly what they were. The overall area is small there's a picnic table and a few stools by the window where you can order to eat. My overall guess is that this business won't be here for long.And if the owner is reading I would like to request a refund because i couldn't even eat my meal how bad it was.  My best advice is save your $10","The pick up order sevice is horrible, we ordered  over the phone for pick up, the young lady told us the candy yams would take 20 minutes, we said no problem,  we wait 30 minutes to go and pick up the order to find out the order became non existent and no one knew what the order was or who took the order, and on top of that we originally ordered chicken wings and Waffles and they never said they didnt have chicken wings  when they accepted the order the first time and when arriving they didnt have chicken wings..Finally recieved the food and I must say..horrible presentation. The oxtails were pure chopped bones, the mash potatoes are HORRIBLE,,,, Def wouldn't go back","At first I was excited to see this place. My first meal there was good. I have gone back to try various items on the menu and each return brings more disappointment. First, the food is barely hot, even right out of the food warming pans. If you have to take your food back to work or home it will be like warm or cold when it gets there. I ordered the corn on the cob and it was almost frozen. After waiting almost 20 min for the food the corn was cold and I was supposedly waiting on the ""corn"" to be done so it should have been the hottest thing on my plate.

Our server was very pleasant and the manager kept stopping by, making sure that we were content with everything.We had both, their guacamole and quesadilla to start, which was OK. To be perfectly honest, the quesadilla could have used more oaxaca cheese and the guacamole could have been a larger serving for the price. I ordered a Fuego y Agua cocktail which was bomb, and their steak and eggs which was a bit scant. The price tag of everything seems a bit of a reach. I think they feel like their in an upcoming neighborhood and because the area code is 212, they can justify those prices. The amount of steak included in my $19 dish was laughable.The food tasted ok, nothing to write home about and certainly not warranting their prices but their in a great location so I guess you're paying for NYC adjacent?I gave four stars because they have some great drinks and the service was wonderful. I hope they do better with their portion size and pricing because 4 oz or less of skirt steak with some scrambled egg and fingerling taters is not worth 20 bucks.",Cañave
175,none,none,none,I've been coming here for 20 years and never had a bad meal.  The food is consistently good and flavorful.  The staff is friendly and always ensures that you leave with what you ordered.,"My family has been coming to Feroza since I could chew. No exaggeration. I do not eat roti, Palau or pholourie anywhere else but here. The food is so flavorful you would want it every weekend. That used to be the ritual, Feroza on Saturdays. I just started eating the acra balls and i love them now. They have many different types of roti like shrimp and beef. Sometimes you can call ahead but I've noticed lately that they do not answer calls on Saturdays i guess because they are so busy. Parking is a little difficult sometimes so you may want to bring someone with you. But trust me if you want Trini food this is the place to go. Prices are reasonable as well. Don't forget your tamarind sauce!!",Best roti in NY hands down! My favorite is the oxtail roti. Soooo good I can not describe it any other way. I would recommend you allow them to put pepper on the roti because it gives it a extra kick to activate your taste buds. I dont like when they make it for you but if they put my oxtail in a container and i can eat the roti as i please without it getting soggy. I heard about this place and had my 1st roti when I was about 10 years old but never knew the address. A friend took me there 5 years ago and I've been hooked ever since. Usually there is a line but it is worth the wait.,Feroza's Restaurant Roti

179,none,none,none,"Nestled on a small corner in East Harlem with many years of history, not only is dinner at Rao's a good meal, it's an evening out that chalks up to a great, and memorable experience.This little gem has only 10 tables in addition to the bar area and the pictures that cover the walls speak volumes about the history of this place.The food is served family style and personally reminds me of the Sunday dinners at my grandmother's when I was a kid.Some of my favorites are the seafood salad, the meatballs, the orecchiette with sausage & broccoli rabe, the baked clams and the grilled lamb chops.As difficult as it is to get a table, you can have drinks at the bar which is always a fun time as well.","Amazing food, probably the best Italian food I have eaten in a long time. If you go, you MUST try the meatballs, seafood salad, and the lamb chops. Great food, great atmosphere, I just wish Frank Pellegrino was still around.","I think back to the line in the movie Planes, Trains and Automobiles where after a flight gets cancelled, Del Griffith says to Neil Paige, ""We have a better chance of playing pickup sticks with our butt cheeks than finding a flight out tonight."" The same holds true for getting a table at Rao's. It's almost unfair to write this recommendation because once I tell you how amazing the meals are there, the fact that you might not be able to get a table will sting all the more.I won't go into everything that's already been written on the internet about the table system ... the tables are basically 'owned' by people and they can give them away to friends, etc. if they aren't using them. So essentially, this is a private club. Knowing someone who knows someone is probably the only way to get a table. There are some other little hacks you can employ, which I won't go into here because they don't always work.I have traveled all over Italy and eaten so many great authentic meals in my friend's homes over the years ... usually cooked by an older Sicilian grandmother ... so I think I qualify as somewhat of an expert on good, authentic Italian cuisine. I am also not scared to spend all day laboring over a simmering pot of homemade sauce while pounding chicken cutlets in a hot kitchen. Let me just say that beyond the amazement of actually getting a table ... Rao's served the most authentic and best tasting Italian food I think I've ever had.If you don't have an Italian 'nona' (grandmother) who still prepares her cooking the old way ... Rao's will give you that type of experience. It is clear that all the ingredients are as fresh as you can get and the dishes are absolutely made with love. Sounds corny but what that means is respect for ingredients, made using a time honored recipe and tremendous quality control.The atmosphere is fantastic and there is an electric 'buzz' in the restaurant. Everyone is happy here. Everyone. The staff here from the owners to the waiters seem like they are thrilled to be here and even though I am not a regular, they treated me with respect, humor and graciousness. I had a terrible experience at another restaurant slash private club in Paris called Chez Louis Amor which was considered one of the hardest reservations to get there ... the staff was rude, condescending and arrogant to 'outsiders'. (and the food was average) Thankfully, Rao's was the complete opposite. They made me feel I was dining in their home and the food was among the best I've ever had.Should you get a table here there is no menu. Someone in a suit will come and sit down at your table and ask you what you want. If it's your first time, he will go through all the options for you. As is the case with most Italian meals at someone's house ... there will be lots of courses. You are expected to try a lot of things ... don't come here and think you'll just get a salad and bread ... or an entrée. Just an example of what we (two people) had ... fried mozzarella cheese, calamari, pene with Vodka sauce, the famous meatballs and veal parmesan. We really wanted to try the lemon chicken but already we were worried about being too full. It was hard to resist the fresh bread and olive oil as well. You order wine by the glass or the bottle and the house red is fantastic, just like it usually is in Italy. All of the fried food was done perfectly. Lightly fried, accompanied with homemade sauce and cooked perfectly. Everything came out with perfect timing. One plate left, another arrived, etc. etc. There were two of us and the portions were perfect each time.The star of the show was the meatballs. You have to try these at Rao's. They are hand made, pan fried and then baked so they are so juicy and flavorful. I've never had a better meatball. Another interesting dish was the Pene Vodka. As a huge fan of Rao's sauce from the supermarket (I normally make my own sauce from a recipe I was given in Rome while helping an older women carry her bags at the grocery store) but when I don't have all day to create a sauce, Rao's jar sauce really is as good as anything you'd get at most restaurants. However, it was almost surreal to be eating the sauce in Rao's vs. my own dining room. It is made fresh from scratch at the restaurant, but the taste is still remarkably similar to the home version. Trippy.Overall, I think you can tell that I'm a huge fan of Rao's. I know I likely won't get the opportunity to dine here often. However, I do hope to head back at some point and I am sure that follow up experiences will be as great as the first. Very rarely do you come across a restaurant where literally everything is perfect. Rao's is that place ... you find yourself able to laugh louder, converse better and smile more when all the other details (food quality, service, atmosphere, etc.) are up to snuff. Anyone who leaves a 1 star review is someone who likely felt entitled to a seat here and could not get it. Once you're in ... you're in.",Rao's

182,none,none,none,"While hubby was in the area, paying respects to the lost loved one of an old friend, he stopped by Millie's to pick me up some soul food as I had been craving it for white some time; juicy fried chicken, fried fish and macaroni and cheese.Since I knew it would be some time before my cravings would be met again, I went all out and ordered, quite possibly, half of their entire menu.I asked for (and received) orders or fried wings, fried shrimp, a fried whiting sando, corn bread, candied yams and mac & cheese. I had quite a bounty of deep fried goodies and I enjoyed every last bit.Hubby mentioned that there were a lot of young people working in the restaurant and that they were very nice and understood that he was fulfilling the order of a very hungry and very pregnant woman. They were patient and helpful which I appreciate because I was a bit of a tyrant back then.","So I've had opportunity to patron  this establishment again. Unfortunately, this visit was not as enjoyable I did an all whiting, all shrimp, collards and Mac n cheese since it just came out the oven......I'm a gal if southern decent. So I know a good fish fry and can whip up a cheesey Mac with a side of righteous greens in my sleep.Having only done the fish only in the pass, this batch of whiting had the taste of just starting to go bad and in the state of consistency the seasoning was bland. The shrimp however was seasoned well but not crispy enough.As for the sides, well the greens were under seasoned and the Mac required more cheese and some cream.Oh well to the levels of inconsistency I suppose my fish fry well be relegated to home cooking or Saturdays in Harlem or to Fordham Fish without southern comfort food sides.","So my preliminary thoughts are this place is decent and allows for me to get my fried fish cravings on close to home without having to run to my old hoods of Harlem.The crispiness on deck, the portions enough for a day two possibly a day 3 if I ain't being a fatass #DontJudgeMeNow having grown up and maintaining my expectations of a good southern fish fry A Taste of Seafood and Famous Fish are main staples and the bar to which I judge a new spot.I'll admit the seasoning at Millie's was a little understated then what I was expecting but decent and my thoughts may have or will change if use the sauces, but for the most part I do my fish sauceless most of the time. I can't unfortunately speak on the sides because I was too afraid to try them and I didn't have the time in my run of errands.So overall the fish fry was good enough to warrant another visit especially since they open on Sundays.",Millie Peartree
183,none,"First time at this establishment.  I arrived at 7pm on a Tuesday & was informed there was a 30 min wait. After a long wait I realized that 5 parties larger than mine had arrived and been seated before me so I went to speak to the manager. He informed me that he didn't sit us because our party of 4 included 2 children and people don't like sitting with children. I peeked inside and was able to see that every table had children and we weren't the only ones. At this point we've waited 90 minutes, after I say it's unacceptable he finally sits us at a table where we had to wait another hour until we got a cook. The manager is incompetent and doesn't know how to handle a busy establishment. Avoid this business at all cost and just go to Little Buddha in Ridge Hill.

We arrived on time and were told to sit down and wait 15 minutes for tables to be cleared. We waited 20 minutes before getting up to ask about our reservation again. The two girls in charge of seating told us to wait another 15 minutes or so because tables had not cleared yet and that there were other parties ahead of us. They were very impolite and made snide remarks as we turned away. We made reservations ahead of time and ended up having half an hour of our time wasted before getting up and leaving.,"Beni-who?!?

These types of places are deceiving because they may not look busy but people generally are accustomed to order takeout from here. We went with the shrimp tempura and veggie tempura to start. The shrimp tempura had 3 shrimp on it. Not sure if that was a full order but they mixed them in with the veggies. For sushi I always like to keep it simple. I went with the spicy tuna and spicy salmon.  Both solid.

Overall, my friend and I enjoyed our meal. However, please note that the food is not authentic Japanese food, and is more of the california roll and teriyaki variety.

If you come during lunch time, they have a teriyaki bento box that comes with a california roll and rice and salad. Or, you can go for the hibachi special with your choice of protein with rice. Both come with a small soup as well and are only around $10-$11. We ending up having one of each. This is definitely a great deal for the amount and quality of food that you get.",Kiraku Sushi

I don't quite remember which ramen I ordered the first time, but this time around I ordered The Jerk Chicken Ramen. He ordered The Mega Oxtail Ramen.

The veggie ramen was soooooo goooood!!  There was a creaminess to it.  We asked our server Nicholas, who by the way is knowledgeable, friendly and amazing, about the creamy flavor.  He said it's the rice noodles that give off the flavor.  I couldn't get enough.  It was YUMMY!  The ramen was PERFECT!  the miso stock wasn't salty or fishy.  Oh, and the fried tofu was not saturated and weighed down in grease, like some of the other places I've been to.  The tofu was light and crispy. The noodles were the perfect consistency.  Everything was just right.  I mean I can go on and on, but you're getting the point right... This is by far the BEST ramen restaurant I have ever been to!  We'll be back.  I can't wait!!",Roc N Ramen

187,none,"I came from Queens to see my sister in Jacobi hospital and she wanted Shrimp Ceviche. I didn't see any on the meñu, so I asked for a small shrimp salad instead. I was told there was only one size and it cost $20. Because I wanted to please my sister, I decided to get it anyway. When I got to the hospital, I was outraged. I paid $20 for an onion and pepper salad, with 5 shrimp. FIVE. I'm truly disappointed in this place and will Be going elsewhere in the future.","I'm so tired, y'all.The ADA is a federal law, and it's older than I am. The wording surrounding service animals is not ambiguous: ""privately owned businesses that serve the public, such as restaurants,"" must ""allow people with disabilities to bring their service animals onto business premises in whatever areas customers are generally allowed."" If another customer has a dog allergy, both customers must be accommodated. If it is unclear whether an animal is a service animal, restaurant staff can ask the handler, but cannot demand paperwork or proof. It's simple... So why on earth did the rude, condescending man at the front of this restaurant tell me that, despite having been trained on the ADA recently, none of that is the case? Why is he under the impression that I need to ""look disabled"" or be blind in order to be allowed to being my service dog with me? Why did he fell the need to smugly tell me that he would deign to let us in, but just this once, and that he didn't need to read the law when I offered it, because he already knows it better than I, an actually disabled person, do? And why on earth did the entire staff completely ignore me after I was seated, even going so far as to say ""its coming!"" and keep on walking despite my not having had a chance to order due to no one so much as looking at me?Not sure what kind of ""training"" this staff got or how ""recent"" it was, but I can tell you one thing for sure: it wasn't enough.","I hate to write this review, as the food was oh so excellent at this spot, but nonetheless it must be done. I am new to the neighborhood, but coming from Queens, I am quite familiar with various types of Latin cuisine. That said, I consistently pressed my significant other to take me to this spot and we finally made it this past Friday evening. My first concern was not being greeted upon entering the establishment, okay, I can deal with that, as I know how local neighborhood eateries can be on a Friday night. Once, we were sat it took a few, a few meaning 15 minutes for a server to greet us, okay, I see what type of spot this is, but it stays packed, so I can let it go. But the following I cannot.Ultimately, like many other reviewers, our experience was similiar, great food, sub par service. Honestly, I can look past the service, if I can determine the amount of gratuity to give. However, upon paying the bill, my boyfriend noticed the number of guests totaled 6, (it was only he and I), which it seems allowed for automatic gratuity. Now we frequently eat at all types of restaurants, so are very familiar with gratuity expectations. Ultimately, we were disappointed in what appears to be a method to charge automatic gratuity to unsuspecting patrons. Interestingly enough, the table next to us was noticeably upset gratuity was automatically charged, but this was before we received our bill, so thinking back, the same could have been done to them. Unfortunately, the server(s) hurt themselves, as my boyfriend was prepared to leave more than the 15% automatic gratuity, mainly because of the food quality.My suggestion if going to this place: don't expect a 5 star service experience and be sure to CHECK YOUR BILL FOR THE AMOUNT OF GUESTS TO ENSURE ACCURACY!!! As long as you set expectations, you will not be disappointed.",none,none,Cafe Colonial Restaurant
188,none,none,none,"More like 4.5 !This little Hot Pot Noodle Soup place caught my attention and decided to make a visit to the island. Was little skeptical but was really satisfying at the end as compare to most of the noodle soup place in Manhattan, this place does win! Braised Beef Noodle Soup: wasn't going to order this as I've tried so many times in the city but nothing was really satisfying.   Still tried as their menu is not so big, luckily we tried. The soup was very flavorful, the meat was very tender, and the noodle was right in texture. Fish Filet & Tomato Noodle Soup: my least favorite among what we ordered as it's little weird for my taste. It's too thick as Asian soup dish for me I guess. Pickled Cabbage & Fatty Beef Mini Hot Pot: the main reason made me visit here, you don't see many good ones in the city. Really tasty and lots of ingredients! Love it! But it's the best when you eat there, I had the rest to go and the pickled cabbage did make everything taste very strong and salty as expected. Beef Tripe Mini Hot Pot: the lady warned us it's very spicy, usually I can handle the ""very spicy"" in Manhattan. But this was truly truly very spicy... way too spicy for me to eat but it's good spice as long as you can handle it. Skewers - Potato, Broccoli, Seaweed: pre-made it's cold but very good in flavor. Bingfen: interesting mixture of ingredient I'd say it's a solid hot pot noodle soup place and quite jealous that it's not in Manhattan!","I came here on a weekday evening.I think it's very prompt and good for if you're looking for something spicy while being ""on the go"".The price point is very fair and I specifically thought 3 skewers for $2.99 is a great deal. They have a wide variety of flavorful drinks, such as herbal tea, plum juice, and pear juice. I loved the flavor of the pear drink. For the skewers, my favorites were the fish ball, quail egg, and tofu puff. I liked the spicy hot pot flavor of the skewers as well and I would recommend them overall. They were cold though and I would have preferred them served hot. I also think if they had more meat skewers added to the menu, that would be great.For the entree, I had the braised beef noodle. The best part of this dish would be the soft, tender, and juicy chunks of meat. I absolutely loved the spiciness of the broth as well. I think I would have preferred if we had a choice of noodle as I typically prefer a thicker one. I also liked that the dish came with a boiled egg.I tried the zha Jiang noodle as well. I got a sense of the creamy and peanut undertones in the sauce, which I enjoyed. However, it was actually hard for me to pick up on the nuance of the flavor palette for this dish as I believe my senses may have been slightly numbed from the spicy skewers and soup. Overall, I had a pleasant experience and I would recommend this spot for a quick bite or a nice lunch spot. Its rapid service definitely is appealing.  One thing I'd also like to note is the name seems to have changed to Chongqing Hot Pot Noodle and I believed the name should be changed to that on yelp as well.","First thing I want to point out is how hard it was for me to find this place. I was excited to try this restaurant out but was super confused by their name change. All the signs inside and out state that they're called ""Chongqing Hot Pot Noodle,"" which threw me off a bit. The restaurant is more of a to-go type place, you order and pay at the register. There's some seating along the window, in case you wanted to eat there. There wasn't a huge variety of options for noodles so I ended up choosing the zha jiang mian or bean noodles which is my favorite. We ordered a bunch of different skewers as appetizers. My favorites were the fish balls and fish tofu and my least favorite was the potato. I just wasn't a fan of the crunch of the potato. All of the skewers were the same spicy marinade and were served cold, which was a bit unusual. I also wish there were more traditional skewer options like chicken, beef or lamb. The zha jiang mian was a very unique flavor, definitely not like any I've had in the past. It was very nutty and a little spicy as well. I don't really feel like it fits the flavor profile for zha jiang mian but I thought it was delicious, nonetheless. My friend ordered the spicy beef noodles and that was good as well, but I didn't like it as much as my dish. The highlight of the dish was the beef - it was extremely tender and absorbed all the flavors of the broth. I was just sad that it didn't come with more. Overall, I would say that the dishes served here are pretty good. Only thing I would change would be to have more options. A more expansive menu, or even just additional noodle options would've been great a great addition.",Liukoushui Hot Pot Noodle

It's a beautiful classy restaurant and much brighter than most of the photos on here make it look. I even tried a few things I've never had before. I'm sad that I forgot to take pictures of the appetizers as they were amazing! We shared a bunch for the table; the polenta appetizer, arancini, calamari - not my thing but the calamari fans amongst us loved them, lightly battered crispy and flavorful, octopus salad (one of the new things I tried and liked - surprised myself but it was really tender and melted in the mouth), stuffed clams too ... the olive bread is to die for! Everyone rated their entree a 9 or 10/10; Raviolis were delicious and sauce perfect, Penne a la vodka, gnocchi light and fluffy, my husband and I had specials - mine was the Lobster Ravioli with shrimp and asparagus - the sauce was perfectly seasoned and not too thick and the asparagus just al dente! My husbands dish was a pork rollatini with pork, prosciutto, and mozzarella and was delicious with a little caramelization; his side of cavatelli was the best he's had, locally freshly made and not thick and stodgy like most. Despite the generous portions we found room for dessert!! Coffees and cappuccinos, tartufo, cannoli, chocolate mousse cake (omgosh - so light and fluffy - the cake was as light as the mousse!), and the kids had the Nutella pizza - warm crisp pizza crust with Nutella and strawberries - easily enough for three!

Keep doing what you're doing!!!","Enzos is a delicious throwback to red sauce, Southern Italian restaurants.  Their menu is so difficult to find outside of cities with large Italian populations.  The classical dishes sang to me, but the Veal Parmesan reached to my very soul.  It was gigantic and delicious, served with a side of spaghetti.  This ain't diet food.I started with a scrumptious Caesar Salad, just to pretend to eat healthy.  Dishes were served with Italian care and graciousness.  Enzos is Italy with a New York accent.  I loved my lunch and it surpassed my expectations.","Our semi-annual trip to the New York Botanical Garden always winds up with a trip to nearby Arthur Ave for lunch.  We like try a different restaurant each time and this time we selected Enzo's.  We arrived right at the noon opening time on a Sunday.  I was impressed by the elegant surroundings as we were escorted down the hallway, pass the front bar and brick pizza oven, which opened up into a spacious backroom dining area.  Our group of 8 were seated comfortably and our waiter read off a long list of specials of the day, as we were munching sliced Italian bread and olive loaf.To start, I wanted baked clams, so we got a dozen Littlenecks along with Fried Calamari and the Mixed Hot Antipasto Special of the Day, all to share.  I might have had more than my fair share of the clams, though.  Wife, brother, sisters and friends all ordered something different, which looks really good for pics, so here goes.  Plates soon came flowing out from the kitchen and I could barely keep up.  Eggplant Parmigiana and Sunday Lasagna were on the list of Specials, so my wife and sister went with those.  Around the table, the Margherita Pizza, Shrimp & Asparagus Spaghetti and Chicken Parmigiana all looked so good.  After annoyingly taking pictures of everybody's meals, I was able to sit down to my Pork Braciole & Cavatelli.  The pork roll was perfectly seasoned and cooked, while the cavatelli had that perfect chew that only fresh-made pasta has.Finishing up with some cappuccino and Affogato was the warm capstone on an otherwise chilly, rainy day.   Enzo's was the perfect ending though and I'm sure we'll be back for more of that fresh pasta.",Enzos of Arthur Avenue

Great neighborhood spot !,Doesn't look like much from the outside but the chicken is pretty damn good. Fast service decent prices and friendly staff. Great neighborhood spot.,"One of those local neighborhood spots where you just accept them for who they are. Small location, hard to park, not much seating, weird decor, questionable customer service at times, long lines, and you may even witness peculiar food prep once in a while. However, as long as you don't see anything out right gross you disregard it all... You Bless your food and enjoy the reason you even tolerated it all in the first place... the Charcoal Grilled Chicken cooked on the open grill as soon as you entered. Mouthwatering, juicy, flavorful, and tender are some of the great reasons that made you tolerate the hiccups in the first place. I don't eat red meat so I only order their tasty chicken which comes with warm grilled pita bread. I've tried the mashed potatoes and side salad once, they did the job. Anything else on the menu I didn't come here for so I really can't give an opinion.Side note: Always wondered if they had any association with the chirping chickens in the city... probably not bc menus are so different.",Chirping Chicken

My sandwich was delicious and my dad's burger was cooked perfectly. Good beer selection with a good amount of NY beers. Not only was the food and beer really good, service was great! Both servers were very attentive and made sure we had whatever we needed. I highly recommend as a great spot near Yankee Stadium.","The running club I belong to hit this place up after conquering the NYRR New Balance Bronx 10 Mile race on Sunday.It a nice spot to hang out after an event such as this or a Yankees game. As the weather was perfect out they had the whole front opened up. Very airy with plenty of seating for a bar this size.Huge beer list and more than enough craft brews on tap. Of those in our group who ordered food they said it was really good. Typical bar eats, so no one complained. Service was terrific even though the place was mobbed after the race, so I have no clue what previous reviewers here are complaining about with regards to that. The staff were quick and helpful.  Prices were typical of any NY area bar, especially one near the Stadium. Other reviewers whining about this need to question if they really have the money to be going out drinking and not receiving happy hour deals. Will that couple of bucks break your bank account? LOL!","Bronx Draft House is a solid bar by Yankee Stadium.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The only downside is that happy hour prices are not happy hour prices during Yankees games.  So when I come with some coworkers the prices were all regular, and it's not a cheap bar, I'm sure due to its proximity to the stadium.",Bronx Drafthouse
192,none,none,"This is a review of the Governor's Island outpost.I first went to Fauzia's food truck on Governors Island wayyy back in 2013 and was so impressed--it was tasty, good quality and a lot of food. It left such an impression that five years later, I was hoping to find it again and glad to see it had expanded. But this experience was disappointing. The food still tastes good but my family felt shortchanged on the amount of food they got for the price ($12, curry chicken platter). I got a veggie gyro so I was fine but I have to say, looking at their food, I felt disappointed for them too. I know vendors have back-end costs but my guests did not feel they got their money's worth (compared to what you'd get for $12 at most Caribbean spots).","***Governor's Island outpost review***Hot summer day on the island, this particular food stand only had a moderate line as well as refreshing drinks and enticing food to boot. Started off with the coconut kiosk from the man with a machete. Each coconut is priced based on size; got a couple of $5 ones that had a moderate amount of juice in it. Plus side is that he cuts open the shell after you're finished so you can eat the filling inside (delicious). For the main course, ordered the jerk chicken on pita bread with mixed veggie toppings and hot sauce ($7). Jerk chicken is SUPER juicy, bursting with flavor that complimented very well by the marinated veggies. Pita is soft, so it didn't last too long trying to hold all the ingredients together, but altogether amazing bite.Line moves here pretty well and the guys are all nice despite the crowds/heat. They also sell fresh-pressed juices that looked good as well.","My boyfriend heard about this place on YouTube. We came all the way from queens to try it out. He got the grilled chicken with seasoned rice and a veggie side with white sauce. I got the curry chicken with seasoned rice and plantain and carrot cake for desert. BOYFRIEND REVIEW: I thought it was pretty good, the food was great, carrot cake was amazing but only change I would recommend would be to up the portion size. They have 3 different sizes you can choose from, S, M and L. I ended up getting a medium, which came out to $8. Overall, 4/5 for me. Would have given it a 5/5 if they gave a better portion. GIRLFRIEND REVIEW: My curry chicken with rice was okay. My favorite thing about it was that it was boneless. The flavor could've been better though. The plantains were made fresh, but they were also burnt. The portion sizes could definitely be better, the medium plate is like a small plate at an average Jamaican restaurant. The carrot cake was the best carrot cake I've had. They give a big slice and it's nice and moist. Overall I would give it a 3.5/5.If we're ever in that area, we would go again but wouldn't drive out the way for it.",none,Fauzia's Heavenly Delights

However, this one had fine food. The homemade bread is very good, the lamb and rice fine, even the falafel (which is not a Yemeni dish) was solid. My complaints are that the restaurant is dirty.

I ordered shrimp with cashew combination and there was 4 shrimps & maybe five cashews and the rest was celery and carrots and the fried rice taste like they took rice put it in butter and that was the extent of the flavor. No flavor in anything, oh and let me not forget the eggroll was also disgusting. Worst Chinese food I ever had in my entire life. I only ordered from them because most Chinese takeout do not accept credit cards & I didn't have any cash on me. I guess it's an easy way to hide their money to send back to their countries! Just for the record I only order shrimp from them because I don't know what kind of meat we are really eating... Does anyone?",none,"This isn't some fancy restaurant. Just your standard Chinese take out~ But as far as Chinese take out goes they are reliable and consistent.

Golden chef is on buhre ave and they have amazing customer service and a beautiful place to sit down and eat and state of the art kitchen !! And still aren't charging $7.25 for some damn fried dumplings !! They are doing because they are taking advantage of being in a white neighborhood , they know they can price their food at whatever price because people from that area will end up spending their money their eventually. Don't let these businesses treat you unfairly and upcharge you just because they want to make a profit off of your lack of knowledge with normal Chinese good prices. Paying high quality prices to a place you can't even take your family and eat because it's so broken down and dingy and dirty.

195,none,none,none,"I never would have thought a place that looks so unassuming that you could literally walk right past it would have such good food.Met my girlfriend there for their Wednesday night happy hour.  I had never heard of the place and drove right past it before I realized that was the restaurant as it looks like a hole in the wall.  The first thing I noticed is that it was pretty crowded in there so I started thinking that maybe it's more to this place than I originally thought.They have an outdoor eating area but unfortunately it was closed as it's still pretty cool here in the evenings.  I definitely would like to go back when that area is open as I love eating outdoors.  We were seated and decided to order off the happy hour menu.  We started with mango passion margarita's.  I'm not a margarita person and when I do drink them I would prefer the frozen ones which they didn't have.  To be honest, it was good and fruity but that's all it was - fruity.  I didn't taste the least bit of alcohol in it so that was a downer but I continued on.We each ordered the tacos - you get three in a serving and you have a choice of jerk steak and fish (tilapia).  I think there is another choice but at the moment I can't remember it.  I was hesitant about the jerk steak as the one and only time I had jerk it was so hot I couldn't taste anything for a week!  The waitress insisted that it wasn't too hot so I ordered two fish and one steak.  We also ordered the Cuban Plaintain Boat to share but we never received it.  Can I tell you that steak taco was absolutely delicious!!  It was so good I ordered three more of just the steak - it was really good.  The fish tacos were good as well - the toppings on the tacos were fresh and the fish was cooked perfectly (some places overcook the fish and it tastes dry). I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this little place but I definitely look forward to going back again.  One thing to note, this is a cash only establishment so be prepared when you go.","The place looks like a broken down shack inside, and I think they are severely understaffed. We arrived when the place was somewhat empty but were told it was a 25 minute wait even though there was an empty Table in the dining area. We waited at the bar (lucky to have seats) my stool was very wobbly, and ordered 4  drinks. We waited at least 20 mins to get drinks, 2 of them non-alcoholic but the bill was$35 ....and they only accept cash!! (In this day and age really????). When we got called to be seated...guess where we sat?  The table that was empty when we arrived! That table was also wobbly. We ordered and got our food that we ate with the drinks we got at the bar. The food was tasty but the service extremely slow!! There were several empty tables in the dining area and one woman who sat at a table for 4 for at least 30 mins after her meal was done. Meanwhile the bar area was packed!!!! I think this is a tactic to make the place look busy and make you buy their overpriced drinks.   I had to wait for the server to pass to ask for a glass of water which she must have gotten from the bar because that took long as well. When we were done eating we had to squeeze our way past the people waiting to be seated when they clearly had space to seat at least 14 people!  The food was not worth the headache of all the waiting and i seriously don't think i will ever go again!  The bathroom looked nicer than the dining area!","Absolutely loved it here!  It was on my list of places to eat for a long time and I finally went and took my girl with me.  It doesn't look like much from the outside but felt right once inside.  We had an awesome time just drinking, eating and being our silly selves.  We sat at the bar for their happy hour and we were not disappointed.  The drinks were strong and the food was delicious.  Donna our bartender, Kerrian the waitress/hostess and Courtney the waitress/whatever else were such great hosts and made us feel like family.  We had the curry goat (a bit too spicy but still good), fish tacos (major highlight/must order), jerk chicken quesadilla, mango and passion margaritas and the bedroom bully.    I definitely felt like I was in the Caribbean here & I really loved that vibe. It's a small place that seems to draw a fun & hip crowd & I can't wait to go back.",Ripe Kitchen & Bar

There are so many better Indian and Pakistani restaurants in the NYC area so I would avoid going here.","I ordered take out from these guys and was highly disappointed. The butter chicken was probably the worst I've ever had in my life. The curry was thick, and paste like. It was soooo bland!!! Didn't taste like Anything. The chicken was so tough and stringy. Had to throw it out immediately. Naan was OK. Wouldn't order from here again but decent prices.","This is by far my favorite restaurant in the Bronx. Food is SO delicious.

I notice, as with most bars, there are regulars, some of whom are like a family to the workers there. It's quite admirable to witness just how many of those ""family"" members frequent this bar. The bartenders are typically friendly and there are some faces that I recognize after coming here through the years. This spot has got to be the only place that makes such a delicious Jack Daniels burger that I feel like their burger is the one that other restaurants try to emulate! There is just no other like it around! Their pretzel bun always tastes like it was just made, the burger hot and juicy, the American cheese perfectly melted, and the sauce tangy and sweet. The fries that come with it are of a thicker cut than I typically prefer, but they are always made to order. I don't mind waiting 20-25 min on a busy night just to take this burger to go!

199,none,none,"My wife had been to the steakhouse many years ago and she said it was a great place to go for an amazing steak and good atmosphere. When we arrived we liked the fact that it was casual and not too stuffy. We ordered a French onion soup side of bacon and a Caesar salad. The Caesar salad was overdressed and the lettuce wasn't cleaned. The bacon wasn't crispy on the edges and it said it was a bourbon flavored bacon but didn't taste anything like it, The chefs failed attempt at putting greens on the plate was exactly that a failed attempt there was arugula undressed and wilted underneath the bacon. Onto the main course we ordered the porter house for two, Asparagus in the frizzy the onions. The steak arrived on a cold plate the juices were cold the steak was cold (no sizzle) there were four pieces of asparagus on the plate for the side and the frizzy onions were not appetizing at all, oily and not Crisp. I motioned to the waitress that our meal was cold, if you're going to attempt to be a New York City steakhouse then take away all of the sides and the steak and redo it. She left our sides which were already cold by the time this new steak arrived and it wasn't a new steak all they did was heat up our original steak. We ordered A medium rare steak, it was medium rare when It first arrive cold, however it was medium wellwhen I came out of the oven the second time. For $98 I would never go back to your restaurant. After sending back our food the waitress had an attitude and there was no reason to have one. It was not her fault that the food came out cold, however her attitude was a complete turn off to the rest of our meal we skipped the carrot cake and went home very very disappointed, I do not recommend the steakhouse. The pure fact that your manager did not come to my table to apologize for a cold hundred dollar steak, and then sent up a overdone steak in place of it which was basically just my steak reheated is completely amateur when it comes to the world of steak! To top it off we never met the manager and he didn't even buy us a round of drinks or a glass of wine. Unbelievably disappointed!!","Had the french dip and fries.

West african restaurant owners are so cheap that they under supply themselves to prevent having excess food--which in turn causes even more loss of $$$ (not the rational bunch). Unfortunately, there are not 100 options of where to get ghanian food in the bronx. I have to stick with these beings here.Also, if you like tender meat....do not order meat from here. Unless you are Zorro or have strong teeth.",Papaye
207,none,none,none,"Now THIS...THIS is a diner!Hadn't been in years and the menu has changed a bit,  but the food is still good. The staff is friendly as ever and even more attentive than I remember. All the servers were young, and they were all amazing. Every table had smiling faces and appeared to be really enjoying their food. Other diners could learn something from this place. The servers all seemed to be working cohesively, another waiter saw I had completed my meal and removed my dinnerware unprompted. As I sit here the smell of something so delicious is wafting out of the kitchen. These are smells you expect from mama's kitchen, not a diner.(Lol)If you're in the area you should definitely stop by for a meal.","This is probably my favorite diner to come to. The staff is attentive and friendly, they always have smiles on their faces. The food is amazing, really good portion for the price ! I usually always get steak , I like mine medium well and it was really beautiful sadly didn't take a picture the last time I went. I had the chicken Alfredo pasta and my boyfriend had the Texas burger. We definitely will continue coming here for the amazing food and service.","I live near by this establishment haven't been inside in ages. I recieved a menu that they now have deliveries, so what's a hungry girl do do on a friday? Order in!! I ordered the California panini char-grilled chicken comes  with avocado, red onions, baby greens, tomatoes, and bacon so good! It also comes with fried crispy plantains. I also wanted a chicken ceaser salad I ask for extra dressing and it came with extra packets of mayo and guldens mustard which was nice. The wait was about twenty minutes, since the place was a jump and a hop skip away.  I was satisfied with the meal the only reason I'm giving it four stars is that their pricesare astronomical for a diner. You definitely can get half the price at diners in westchester county.",Royal Coach Diner
208,none,none,none,"This is the best Indian food in the neighborhood.They have vegan options, too!!Get the garlic naan.","We ordered 3 lunch specials. Chicken biryani , chicken tandoori and chicken tikka massala.Both chicken platters were well seasoned. The chicken tandoori was the show plate. Sizzling hot plate 2 portions of chicken on a bed of onions and sweet green peppers; for sure wort ordering. The tandori chicken was moust and very succult and the bed of onions and peppers was a nice touch.  2nd best was the chicken tikka massala, the sauce was creamy. Nice seasoning not overpowering but you can still taste cumin, coriander and the garan masala. So while the sauce was on point, your lunch portion will be about 4 to 5 ounce container with lots of sauce and just 4 pieces of chicken.  No way you call that a lunch. I get it, making indian food is expensive due to the high cost of the spices. However, they could charge a bit more and give you more chicken. This portion was ridiculously small, plus i was still hungry in the end. If anything this portion should be for an appetizer instead of a main course meal.  The disappointment came about when we saw the chicken biryani. No raisins or any kind of fruit at all.  Usually the chicken  is cooked in the rice but this one the rice was made separate and the chicken was poured on top,  the rice lacked flavor and depth.  I felt like i should have just order white rice with a side of curry chicken. I do like the fact that you can bring your own wine and they do have nice glassware for the wine and water service; that is a plus for sure. Personally, i can appreciate that.  The place was clean, decor was not intrusive and best of all the smell of the  kitchen stayed in the kitchen. Sometimes you go have indian food and you cone out smelling like curry..lol The naan was tasty and made to order but could have benefited from a brushing of butter. However it was tasty, soft and we had a good portion order for the table of 3 ppl. They do have home made mango chutney $4 extra and well worth it.","Riverdale Indian Cuisine is a new spot that's opened up in not really Riverdale but pretty close to it in Kingsbridge (no, I'm not interested in getting into an argument with you on the social construction of neighborhoods, so just go with me on this.) It gives you more options beyond Cumin and other Wash Height staples, though prepare for a trek even if you're coming from Inwood, since it's about a 10 min walk from the subway station up there.We had chicken korma, curry, and samosas. Good stuff and without canola oil excess that you sometimes see. Will definitely go again.",Riverdale Indian Cuisine

I notified the manager of what she did, not sure if anything was done but apparently I am not the first victim.","I went with 2 friends to dine at Applebees at the Bay Plaza location at it was such a waste of time!!! We are seated and left there waiting for 15 minutes for  a waitress to acknowledge us. When she finally arrives, at no time does she make eye contact or introduce herself. She takes our order and another 15 minutes later the manager shows up with our drinks which BTW tasted nasty, just syrup and rum; so sweet we couldn't finish it. A couple arrived after us and got their appetizer and we're still waiting for ours. The 3 of us are losing our patience and ready to walk out but because we are so hungry we continue to wait. As soon as we checked our silverware and noticed how dirty it was with food still stuck on a forks we collectively gathered our things and walked out!!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I STEP FOOT IN ANY APPLEBEES! NOT THE FIRST TIME BUT DEFINITELY THE LAST!!! No stars from me. Oh and the place was practically empty too so there's no excuse!","I am being quite generous with the three stars, but must be honest with my assessment of this particular Applebee's. The three-star rating is due to the abnormally long wait times for: 1) ordering drinks, and 2) receiving our meals once they were ordered. There was only two of us for lunch, yet once we were seated, it seems we were literally forgotten about. I had to physically get up from the booth and look for help. The strange thing about the long wait was that this place was almost empty of customers (after 2 p.m.), and I counted no less than five Applebee's employees in uniform walking around. Once the attendant came to our table, she was very courteous and took our drink orders. It then took another 15-minutes to receive our drinks. The female bartender seemed to by pretty occupied with a discussion with a customer at the bar, thus probably the reason for the delay with our simple drinks. After ordering our food, receiving it turned into another wait in excess of 15(+)-minutes. The food itself was well prepared, but the frustration from excess waiting cut into my being able to fully enjoy the meal. One final point is that there is no Wi-Fi at this establishment. I was given three different reasons from three different employees as to why there was no Wi-Fi for customer use. I cannot envision ever going back to eat at this particular location.",none,none,Applebee's Grill + Bar

I hadn't had Ethiopian food in a good while and Benyam did not disappoint! Me and my partner weren't too hungry and weren't in the position to take leftovers, so we just got the vegetarian platter for 1 to share. It was the perfect amount of food, and a great combination of flavors. Gomen and yemiser wat were my ultimate favorites. I will be back soon! Super friendly staff, it's dreamy in here.","This is a new entrant in the uptown Ethiopian food scene (Zoma, Abyssinia, the place on Amsterdam Ave on the UWS whose name momentarily escapes me). And WOW, it is DYNO-MITE as Jimmie JJ. Walker would say, and it gets the #MerlinFive!I would definitely just go for one of the combos. P2P (price to portions) ratio is incredible, and they rolled their eyes when we asked for injera bread, preemptively thinking we'd need more (NO). Biggest difference with the other places is Benyam seems a little more mild, as opposed to some of the others where someone like me with a lot of sweat glands starts dripping with anything spicy. So if you'd like to avoid that, Benyam might be a good bet. Or if you live off the end of the 3 line.Best,Merlin.","The reviews were spot on to the experience my friend and I had. This was the first time for my friend, so I wanted it to be special for her and thanks to Benyam & owner my friend is sold on Ethiopian food‼ she kept on asking what the flavors were and saying how tasty it was.

214,none,none,none,This is a difficult one in that many areas of rating are mixed. The service however was exceptional so I bumped a 3 to a 4ENTRANCE- we were greeted promptly and quickly seated for lunch. We were the first diners but a small stream of patrons came within the hour. AMBIANCE - very rustic decor with many oil paintings of Italian landscapes. Very traditional looking. Old school but niceMENU - traditional fare with specials enough variety for everyoneSERVICE- this was a 5 star item. Our waiter was quite congenial and had many amusing stories to share. FOOD - things were very mixed in this regard. The bread served was more like the kind you would get if you ordered a sandwich in a local deli. I mean they are next to one of the best bread stores on Arthur Avenue. For appetizers we had the octopus salad which had great oil and dressing but was slightly over cooked and a tad rubbery. Tried the mozzarella and tomato slices that were dressed well with balsamic and oil but the mozzarella was only ok. Again around the corner is Casa Mozzarella that has the best cheeses.ENTREES- I ordered the calamari fra diabolo that had a fantastic sauce but the calamari was also a tad over cooked. Wife had a a very delicious pasta dish with sausage and broccoli rabe. So overall I'm mixed on food rating. VINO - decent but nothing exceptional. They do pour a really full glass thoughPRICE - for the Bronx pretty reasonable. Two people a few drinks the bill was $120 ish.

My boyfriend and I went here on a Sunday around 3pm. There were several tables, but nothing that made us experience any kind of wait. The bread brought to the table was standard Italian fare bread, if not a bit tastier than average. We ordered Peroni's because ""when in Rome"". To start, we split the Mario Salad, which was just your average salad with a dressing a bit heavy on the vinegar factor. Now I do not like raviolis, but when I was younger I worked at a place that used to take a van down to Arthur Ave once a month and load it up with as much frozen raviolis as could fit. After that, I realized that I only liked Arthur Avenue's raviolis. I tested it out here and I was not disappointed in the slightest. Mario's red sauce is to die for and I would go back in a heartbeat. I am going to be sure to check out if Mario's sell their sauce in any stores because it's so good I would bathe in it.",Mario's Restaurant

This place is not like any other, there's so many varieties of foods to choose from i can bet that you can come here for a year straight and not have gotten everything on the menu. I tried to get a different thing every time i come, today i decided to get the chopped cheese on a roll and it was delicious! I've never had a chopped cheese so i don't know what to compare it to, i just know this one was good. There's not only sandwiches but also a juice bar and a salad bar. If a specific drink is what you're looking for, they have over 100 options to choose from. Honestly, i don't know how they fit so much in such a tiny place.  If you're coming here during lunch time, expect to wait at least 15-20 min for your food because this places gets PACKED!

The rest of the place has quite a lot of snack and/or drink options along with some basic grocery items. They pack a lot into the small space, so be sure to look around as you might find something you like or would want. I have yet to try a shake, but I will one of these days. They have a lot of choices for that and I've seen people order them. This is across the street from a large Montefiore hospital in the middle of Montefiore country (meaning they have a lot of offices in the area) and just off that alone, it gets busy inside.

Good job!!!,"Tons of Latin food around the area and this place is one to consider visiting. Parking was easy for us since we went around noon time, not too sure how it would be during the night. We got seated really quick and the waitress was pretty attentive. He got the chicken chunks with the tostones as an additional side and I got the steak mofongo. Both dishes were absolutely delicious. The chicken chunks were so juicy; I just didn't understand how it tasted that good when to me it had looked like boneless wings (without the sauce). Usually, if chicken is that juicy, it wouldn't be white meat but surprisingly it was all white meat! The mofongo was abosolutely to die for. I think it was the fact that they had chicharron in the mix that made it divine. The crispy pork skin was an added bonus to the flavors. I didn't understand what was happening in my mouth after each bite but I liked it! The steak, however, could've been better only because it was thinly sliced and over cooked. If I had known, I would've gotten the chicken. But it's okay, you live and you learn. Overall, the food was excellent and I would recommend trying this restaurant if you are looking for some Latin food. They do have a Mexican menu as well but I've heard that it's not something you should order there lol. The only downfall about this place that it was just kind of hard to flag down someone towards the end of our meal because it started getting more busy. So, when I had read the other reviews, I could see where that could become an issue. I will be back to try their other menu options.",Caridad and Louie's Restaurant

Upon walking in and  was a patron eating outside food (hmmm isn't this against some health code). No hostess to be found. After 3 mins of an annoying beeping the patron who I guess is somewhat connected to the staff turns the ringing off which I later learned was for Uber eats. He then went to get the hostess who clearly was annoyed that I was there along with the phones ringing and now the beeping going off again. The positives are the music was great and the take out area is very clean and has tables and chairs where you can actually dine. Great for Uber eats not so great for those of us that just want a take out order.,IHOP

They specialize in sustainable, organic, biodynamic, natural wines and farm-to-table produce that is sourced from the Hudson Valley. They bar is run by a husband and wife team (Will & Sarah) and a small staff (including awesome bartenders Helen and Renee). The space is really intimate and beautiful, and feels like a little local family where everyone knows your name. It seats approximately 30 people, including bar seating and tables.Tannat offers a changing selection of wines by glass and bottle, but old favorites tend to reappear. They also have orange wines, which I'd not encountered before. The staff will let you sample before you order and suggest new wines for you to try. You can also purchase a half splash (half glass) of wine.The food menu changes daily and typically includes a selection of cheese plates and rotating meals and snacks. During the evenings they also offer a chef's 3 course tasting menu, and there is always an omnivore, vegetarian and vegan option. On the weekends they offer brunch, and vegan/gluten free an always be accommodated. Some of our go to items so far are the Tannat red wine, Two Block Rock cabinet and truffle cheese from the Hudson.The bar also hosts a number of community events, including poetry readings every third Sunday, wine master classes and live music. The team and bar are really lovely - and very unique in upper Manhattan. Definitely check them out when you're in the area.","This wine bar opened a few months ago, and since we really enjoy a good glass (or bottle) of wine, we went to check it out. They offer natural wine and genuinely seasonal dining, hence, their menu for both wine and food changes throughout the year, on monthly or even daily bases sometimes. I love that you can get something new every time you visit!The inside is small, covered with wood from the floor, walls, and furniture, creating cozy and welcoming atmosphere. It has a nice big open door/window at the entrance, looking out to the beautiful greenery. They are across from Fort Tryon Park, and only a short walk from the MET Cloisters museum. Most of the wines are available by the splash (half the glass), glass, or bottle. They have sparkling, White, Rosé, Red, and Orange. I love the idea of splash, this way, we get to try more wines without too much commitment. Since there were three of us, we each got to try two different kinds of wine, total of 6 splash of different wines. They were all very good, and the staff was very knowledgeable of the wines, so he gave really good recommendations as well.When you are having good wines, you have to pair it with a good food companions. They offer farm-to-table, working with small Hudson Valley farms. We got Basil Duck Rillettes, Jacuterie Black Truffle Salami, Persian Cucumber, Smoked Trout Toast, and Wild Mushroom Pate. They were all good high quality, tasty and went great with the wines. The atmosphere was very comfortable, relaxing, cozy and welcoming. They have great wine (and beer) selections from all over the world. It is a great place to try out new wines that you never had opportunity or even heard of.

Fine, we waited ONE HOUR...then another ten min and still nothing (mind you it's not like this place is 20 miles away, it's less than a mile away) so we called them...they said the food was out for delivery and when my husband complained about us receiving cold food whoever he was talking to said not to worry, they put it in a food warmer.

The oxtails were fall off the bone and gravy was good I put extra on the mealThe Mac was cheesssyyy but not over the top. Only reason a 4 stars was because of last of jerk sauce for the chicken, and I asked for extra gravy when i ordered and had to ask for it again.

Ordered a large plate ($11) of Jerk chicken, rice & pea and veggies. The large was with the expectation of left over food for the following snow day. This large didn't stretch like other Caribbean spots, where I can get 2/3 servings. The chicken was most and juicy and the skin had some good crisp/char, very flavorful with some heat and spice but not enough to meet my expectations. I was expecting a punch, a slap in the face with the power of the heat, not so much. The rice & pea were lite & fluffy and not dry which was great. I could taste the flavors of the coconut milk. The veggies were standard, raw cabbage, nothing wrong with that.

I enjoyed the dish but I couldn't finish it. 3/5Milk fish: Crispy and fried just right! It was sweet with a touch of tanginess. 5/5Lechon kawali: this was an appetizer but I think portion wise it could have been served as an entree. It comes with rice and pickled vegetables. The pork wasn't too fatty and had just the right amount of crunch to it. 5/5Chicken adobo: I enjoyed this dish but I thought the chicken was a little tough/overcooked. 4/5Halo Halo: I wish they had a bigger scoop of ube ice cream and more flan. This was a bigger portion than expected and there were plenty of jackfruit, jellies and beans. 5/5Service: We finished up around 9pm and in no way did they rush us or make us feel like we had to leave.

231,none,none,none,"Finally had a chance to stop by during Harlem Restaurant Week. The Row was one of the businesses on the list with the better deals and the food was quite delicious that I will be going back! Like so delicious that I left and was actually raving about brussel sprouts! The green apples and golden raisins give the normally bitter veggies a sweet complex without drowning them in a sauce. The almonds made for a nice crunch texture along with the flaky crispy leaves that made you keep digging for another bite.  Even though everyone raves about the jerk mac & cheese let me start a fire by saying it wasn't my favorite of the night. It was amazing as a mac & cheese. The combination of cheeses were great on their own, but I didn't get much of that ""jerk"" taste. It was almost like I was eating a plain mac with chicken chunks. For entrees I had the pork chop and my friend had the pan/oven roasted chicken. Even though I was craving a thin greasy carribean piece of pork chop and felt disappointed when I saw this thick slab of porkchop presented to me, my disappointment ended there. The cut is a du-roc as the menu says, I thought it was porterhouse, but happy to be schooled on the different cuts of pork. Anyway for such a thick piece of pork loin, it was not dry and the peach ginger glaze was so good I wanted more. I was able to take a large amount home that my boyfriend enjoyed more than the lobster mac he asked for. The potatoes and the corn were perfect sides for this dish. For dessert I was able to order old fashioned peach cobbler and wow. I was happy I left some room for dessert because this was sooo good! It's a thin layer of peaches on a hot cast iron pan giving you some crunch caramelized bits to enjoy. It felt light and not doughy so I didn't feel gluttonous after. My only caveat is that the cast iron and pastry are so hot that my ice cream was half melted when it reached me. I love ice cream and the cold/hot variation of the dish was perfect for me. It was a Wednesday and they also have Jamaican nights on Wednesday in the fall with a live DJ. The specials are actually really good and though the music was loud I see myself coming back. May give the jerk mac another try as it's a part of the specials. Finally, the staff was wonderful! I know there wasn't many tables there when we arrived, but they were patient enough to let my gf and I catch-up before we decided on food.","I came here on a Sunday around 1:30 pm for brunch.The atmosphere was pretty pleasant, not too loud, a little bit of a mood lighting or dimmed but it was not overly so. I ordered the Brussel sprouts ($10) and the Jerk Mac n' Cheese ($15). I really enjoyed both items, especially the Mac n' cheese. The top layer of crunchy jerk flavored crumbs appealed to me. There was a combination of complex or different flavors to the Mac n' cheese so I liked how it wasn't ""one level"". The Brussel sprouts were just right but didn't stand out to me as much as the Mac n' cheese.The only slight negative aspect I would say is I feel like there was no bus boy? My water glass was empty for like 20 minutes until I flagged down the waiter for more.","I'm not sure how to rate this restaurant.  It wasn't bad but I wasn't impressed either.My girlfriend and I decided to try this place for Harlem Restaurant Week. I wasn't crazy about the price fixed menu but decided to give it a try. When we arrived the place was empty but they did have a dj playing Reggae. The place is small but cute which I liked. We sat down and I ordered a sangria from their happy hour menu. It was ok sweet but no real kick to it. For appetizers your only options are brussel sprouts and jerk chicken macaroni and cheese. We ordered them both after they told me I couldn't separate the chicken from the Mac as I'm not a fan of jerk seasoning.  They came in a small pan so its a lot. Needless to say I didn't really care for the sprouts but the Mac and cheese was good but very spicy. For entrees you have a choice of chicken, salmon and pork chops. I was disappointed that for this to be a Caribbean restaurant you would think they would have more dishes with an island flair ( oxtails, curry, stewed) but they didn't. We both order the salmon it came on top of black rice and had some steamed baby asparagus. It was ok....more plate than food.  For dessert your options are peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream and chocolate molten cake with vanilla ice cream. We ordered both and they were ok.  The service was very good our waitress was very attentive. Again it was just ok. Maybe I'll go back for drinks and appetizers.",The Row Harlem

Its on a nice quaint street, and suburban. My faves of course is the Pastrami! It was seasoned and made so well, tender and juicy! Very fresh. Second the Nova Lox. Omg this was heavenly, the fish was very tender, cured well. Not overly salty, just right. Service 10/10, nice staff and a comfortable seating arrangement. We travelled from Toronto, Canada for this! So needless to say we are dreaming about eating it again !","Preface: my family ordered takeout, so we did not eat the food fresh in the restaurant. We got brisket, corned beef, stuffed cabbage, and two knishes. We asked for first cut brisket (extra lean) and there was fat on every piece. The corned beef we ordered normal but it was a terrible cut of corned beef. It was a little bit of second cut (normal) and mostly inedible third cut. The corned beef was very fatty and grainy and just difficult to bite into and chew. The knishes were average. Nothing great and didn't have much flavor. Lastly and least was the stuffed cabbage. I've honestly never had such bad stuffed cabbage. I eat it every time I go to kosher delis as it's my favorite dish. The meat inside was tasteless and just very weak. Also small which was probably for the best. The cabbage wrapping was I don't even know how to describe. Weird texture, bad taste. And the sauce was very thin and didn't taste like normal sweet and sour sauce. I'd say the only thing that was truly decent was the coleslaw. Oh and the pickles. But we all know you can coleslaw and pickles at the supermarket and it will be good. There's a good chance this place doesn't provide as good quality and service for takeout orders versus in-dining. I felt a little sick in the stomach after the meal into the morning and my father said he didn't feel great.

It did not disappoint. The decor is cozy and inviting. They even have plugs available for charging your devices while you eat at some of the bench seats along the wall.The food is good so far that I've tried. I can tell by the way they make the food that it's already better than the other options available here. Their version of rice paper rolls are refreshing and light. The pad woon sen although stir fried was also pretty light and had a decent amount of vegetables. The only negative I found was that they are a bit stingy with the meats, including tofu. Otherwise it's a tasty meal and a bonus for this neighborhood which can lack diversity of food options aside from the fast ones.","Welcome to fabulous Thai served in a stylish setting with a smile. So happy we finally have a downtown style Thai place uptown. I went with a small group and we tried 3 appetizers including fish cakes - all were outstanding. The papaya salad was as good as any I've had in Thailand. Tasty!  My friend had massaman curry with shrimp and I had Thai fried rice with squid. Both were outstanding. My mate had pad Si yu with beef and he loved that too. The Thai iced teas were perfect- too sweet for me as usual but well done and ""good if you like it"". There is no liquor served here as the place is owned by the folks at the halal Indian place right next door.

The first thing I do is order a Thai Tea because in my experiences I have noticed if the Thai Tea is premixed or not prepared properly then the food is typically bad. I guess the reason being is that if they don't take time with the Thai Tea which is t the food then they may not take much care with the food either. The Thai Tea here IS GREAT. Not premixed, separates, smoky flavor, not too sweet, just sweet enough. Admittedly I like it sweet and with a little less crime but that's just my preference.

Staff has been friendly.The only issue can be when it's overcrowded - there needs to be a system where the next person in line is actually next and not the person who cuts them off or can talk the loudest. It's not this place's fault really and more about the rudeness of customers, but there needs to be some order when there's chaotic times. So while there are plenty of similar options in the area, this has become a step above with freshness and taste. I will be coming here a lot more.",none,"Great food, prepared how you want it. Friendly staff that make it a point to know you if you go there more than once.",none,"Ok, average deli.Not sure where the ""famous"" part of their name came from, but I've never heard of this place before. I work in the area sometimes and decided to try them a few times. To me, really they are no different than any of the other numerous delis in the area that serve the same items and stock the same. The deli layout seems clean enough and they try not to waste any space - though at times it's hard to see who's asking for next and there are times where there is no rhyme or reason as far as who's actually next. Just about every time I've been here, I was skipped over (I've been there more than the Yelp check ins indicate) - unintentionally I'm sure, but there should be a little more control at the same time. The sandwiches I ordered were average really, nothing special. A place with ""famous"" on the moniker I would expect more from, but it's not the case here. The prices are about on par with the other businesses in the area. The staff have been hit or miss in my experience. The cashier has always been fine. The drink and snack selection isn't bad.Inside is small and during a crowded time, it can be annoying as people are all over the place. The best part about this place is the outside store front - it does stand out over the rest of the businesses in the area.All in all, it's a place that is no different than the other delis in the area. I respect other Yelpers experiences here, but I can only comment on my own - and they haven't been any more than average at best. I may or may not return as it doesn't really offer anything that I really need or want and that I can get from all within 2 blocks from their competitors just the same.",Anthony's Famous Gourmet Deli

My coworkers are still talking about the decor, delicious food and service they received at Escape Latino. Thank you to Nathan for everything you did for us!",I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a while. It's a cute cozy small restaurant. But the food to me was not freshly cooked. It felt like leftovers from the night before. The mojitos were not bad but had way better mojitos with the right amount of everything. There was another couple sitting next to us that walked out. I guess one of the main course they asked for was not available or not done when they brought one out. SoThat did not spoke well of the restaurant. Not a super bad experience but I don't think I will go back or recommend it. Sorry Latin Escape when I go out to a Latin restaurant I expect they will do better than my cooking.,"What can I say? I have an uncanny knack for picking awesome new spots. Well, in this case it was a ""new to me"" spot. From what I know now, Escape Latino has a well established reputation for good food and good times in the past. Let's get to my experience. This was my third visit. My boyfriend and I went there for lunch the first time. We ordered pretty basic meals. They were tasty, but the last two times we were more adventurous with our dinner orders. We had chicken stuffed with plantain and branzino filet over cilantro mashed potatoes. Maybe adventurous isn't the right word, but you get my drift. I planned on saving some for lunch. That plan didn't work out too well. My boyfriend finished his meal as well. Luckily we had ordered the large appetizer combo that could feed a family of four easily. We had already wrapped some of that up anyway. On top of it all, the service was amazing. We learned about upcoming events and specials. We will definitely return.",Escape Latino

The space is sparkling clean, bright and airy with high ceilings and comfy chairs and places to lounge with your furry friend. There are clips to hold leashes so you can anchor your furry friend and get a drink without worrying. Of course there are water bowls for the dogs, and the staff looooves dogs and loves on every pup who comes in. There are also ample power outlets, so this is actually a good place to sit and get work done. And pet dogs. What more could you want?",I love this place and for sure you'll do as well.

This place is convenient since it's close to home and has a good happy hour but it truly has horrible service. I repeatedly had to wave down the waitress. She was sitting at another table smoking hookah and seemed to forgotten we were there. Asking for the check was another hassle since she was too busy talking to friends. When I ask for the manager shes at the bar smoking hookah as well. I get the tip is included in the bill so they tend not to work as hard but it's really getting out of hand.They really need to fix their service if they want customers to return.,none,Boca Restaurant and Lounge

Booking the function was complicated as I had difficulty speaking with the right person. Other than that, they did an outstanding job. My guests all loved the food and servings were extremely large: no one left hungry. There were no hidden charges and the staff was extremely attentive. They served a cake we brought in for dessert, which was great. Parking on Morris Park Ave is always tough but find a legal spot or there is a high probability of a ticket waiting for you when you go back to your car. I recommend their dinning area for family gatherings but likewise, encourage the establishment to make booking a little easier.","Food is good, wait service is family-friendly and make the experience enjoyable.","Friends who live locally to Captain's Pizzeria suggested we meet here for dinner. To be honest, I don't remember anything we ate here and it wasn't long ago we went. It just didn't stand out to me. And as for the service, I found it to be uncomfortable, missing warmth. When we walked in, there was no acknowledgement and they just seemed salty, almost obligated to serve.

249,none,none,none,"As a Vegan in the Bronx Riverdale area, I'm faced with limited options for delivery. Moss Cafe is an excellent option and I order via Uber Eats regularly. The avocado toast is great. Although I do wish there were tomatoes and maybe some sprouts or greens on the toast as well. Their chimichurri tofu is delish and I can't get enough of the chia pudding. I've also had their rice bowl which was also a wonderful choice. While I have never been to the actual cafe, I'm inspired to visit in person based on my experience with delivery.","Moss Cafe screams chic like no other! Place is decked out in whites, creams and natural light up front. Plus it feels beachy, clean, but earthy all at once. There isn't much space to waltz around- but great use of the space, makes it cozy. With that being the case, Moss created a style all their own in Riverdale. I've had Moss mentally Bookmarked for a while- as I'm rarely on this side of The Bronx. But since I was in the nabe, couldn't skip it.  By the way, you can't kill too many hours on your laptop here- but there's a designated time slot if you wanna power up. This is such an awesome cafe for many reasons. I mean...not only is style intact- but food is equally gorgeous to look at. FYI, there's no Poultry and Beef on the menu. And no pork either- as Moss Café is kosher. I'm happy with all that!!! At least 98% of their Menu is Vegetarian, with a couple of Fish dishes. However I'm sure you can customize any dish and make it Vegan. Weekday Menu is broken from 8am-3pm/3-5pm, Dinner 5-9pm, with Sunday Brunch and Drinks. Walk right to the counter and order up. Hot or Iced Beverages are listed on large butcher paper and menus are on clipboards. Menu looks fabulous and decided on the Sourdough open-faced sandwich with Ricotta, Strawberry Jam, topped with Pistachios and a dusting of Cinnamon. Simple and Beautiful! Afhgani Chai to start was what I needed at the moment. And when I saw a Hot Chocolate on the menu, it just took those 7 little words, ""how do you make your Hot Chocolate?"" When Tess said, ""...Chocolate Ganache""......I was sold. Plus- I can never pass up on an opportunity to taste Hot Chocolate. I knew I had to hit Moss when I was in the area. Attention to detail goes above and beyond - plus service was so nice. I enjoyed both my light meal and hot Beverages. Owners here have everything down to a Science- even with the soft 'Chill' Music in the background. One thing's for sure......there's no shortage of endless bites and charming style.",I have been smitten by Moss. Split pea soup was so good one bowl wasn't adequate. Server was polite and attentive. Prices were fair and nothing we ordered was left uneaten. Came back two days later and just as good. Traveled to NY from Dallas and so highly recommend this kosher restaurant. Will come back.,Moss Cafe
250,none,none,none,"What can I say a my friend just from our running group suggested this place as a after run meet up grab a quick bite and just have everyone get a chance to chat and spark up new friendships. So as mention I found out about this place after the run and from when you first enter the place the vibe is super chill, great music, and looks clean. They have a Taco Tuesday Special which was great as our group was about 13 people who all enjoyed the dollar tacos some sangria and also a bit of hookah which everything was priced very reasonably. I would say if it's a party of 10 or more they ask that you pay cash which possibly seem as people may have pulled a stunt with credit card fraud but they do have an atm onsite to withdraw money. Now I also grab some photos of the evening and it went swell. Hope this review was helpful. PS: they do have valet parking Incase if you drive in and it's very easy to find as its on a main intersection on the corner.","Came here on a Sunday afternoon. I was with 2 other guys (my boyfriend & his cousin). Apparently if they see a woman with men they expect them to buy bottles and do the whole nine. I would not buy a bottle in this place nor was that in our plans anyway. We made clear we were only there for a drink & hookah. Even though there were PLENTY of tables available during a Sunday afternoon (tables were apparently only for eating, yet many people only had a hookah and drink on their table) she made us go to the bar which was full already.SO not only was there no space for a hookah at the bar but we had already ordered a disgusting sangria and had to drink it awkwardly standing around in the lower level. We left right after that one drink. I'm sure they're used to servicing the same local crowds and you have to ""know"" people to get better service or what you want. My money is still green like theirs and I will spend it where I'm appreciated as a customer. Never returning to this dumpster again.","Gave this place the 5 stars for the great vibes I came across when there... as for the food..delicious.

You won't regret it!","My sisters and I were craving mofongo all week long so I decided to take a look at Yelp for a good spot. Caribe on Crosby Ave was the best decision. Their menu says ""Best Mofongo In Town"" and they are correct! Best Mofongo EVAH!! We'll be back real soon.","Without any delay, there are ongoing negative reviews, aiming at Caribe's ""inadequate"" or ""rude"" service but that didn't stop one of my sisters from making Mother's Day reservations. On the contrary, service was excellent. In the middle of this predominantly Italian neighborhood, there's Caribe Restaurant.  Stone facade exterior stands out from the few businesses on the strip. But I have to give Caribe some props for getting all fancy and stuff and trying to hook up their restaurant with a so-called rustic interior: exposed ceiling pipes- (not sure if this is intentional or not---but hey, I think they wanna do like folks in NYC), metal accents here and there and a 'pot rack' ceiling lamp. But what really threw me off, was the freaking head of a cow as soon as you walk in with big as* horns and a reindeer head (in the back dining space) behind me. That sight, really wasn't my bag of chips. At. All. And since when did Dominicans get on this freaking taxidermy craziness? I honestly thought I was in a hunting lodge. Anyhow, service was great for my party of 8. By the way, if you don't know the get-up in some Dominican restaurants don't take offense-  if waitresses don't engage in non-stop chitchatter with you or have an ear-to-ear smile, it's just how they do. However, our server was spot on- girl didn't even take orders down on paper,- she just memorized everyone's orders by heart and didn't skip a beat when dishes were brought to the table. Offerings here are typical Dominican: Mangú, Fried White Cheese, Fried Eggs for Breakfast and Moro with your choice of stewed meats for Lunch or Dinner. Martinis? Nope. Forget it about it. Not the spot. Maybe a Sangria otherwise keep it straight up and nothing fancy. Portions? Ridiculously large. Prices are reasonable for typical, down-home food.

253,There once was an eating tree on nostrands and Lincoln in Brooklyn. Ohh how I loved that place. They served some of the best oxtails I ever had. Big pots always on the stove cooking  Mac and cheese always cheesy and bubbling.  But then they closed and I was sad  I missed the eating tree so bad.  But then they opened another one on Fulton street in Brooklyn  it wasn't as good as  nostrand but it was close enough. Then I moved from Brooklyn  so no more eating tree for me.  Now I'm in the Bronx and I have eaten at this tree more then once. Where as no eating tree to me is comparable to nostrand ave  this spot is def not bad and worth it too.,"I've been hearing good things about this place for years since when it was known as Feeding Tree. Either it was heavily hyped or things changed quite a bit. I came hungry one evening with my fiancé (who happens to be West Indian) and was excited to get what I thought would be some good jerk chicken.The first clue that something wasn't right should have been when my order came to $28 for a large order of jerk chicken and two cans of Diet Coke. When the cashier told me the cost, I must have seemed stunned, and asked, ""How much??"" I shouldn't have paid and should have just cancelled the order, but by then I was starving. The cashier explained that they charged per pound ($12/lb.) and it was 2 lbs. Already feeling cheated, I came to discover that the ""jerk"" chicken was...barbecued, burnt chicken with sauce that they passed off as jerk that we figured out was likely a mixture of ketchup, vinegar, and pepper. I've had good jerk, great jerk even, and I've also had much better chicken for much less. After finishing my $28 meal, I not only felt cheated, but I felt angry. If you haven't had the pleasure of having eaten good jerk chicken or pork, you can do so and a large order should cost you around $14, nearly half as much as this mediocre meal. Some places try to cut corners by purposefully burning the chicken and pouring cheap hot sauce over it, then passing it off as ""jerk."" Verdict: if I want good jerk, I'll go to Gun Hill or Flatbush Ave. or eat my friend's amazing jerk pork. Eating Tree is trash food by people who try to rip you off.Bonus: one of the employees chased this guy outside to yell at him because of the trash he left on the table. One problem: he didn't leave the trash there and it was there way before him. So not only are they con artists with bad food, they also have no customer service.","Ordered from Uber eats and bone heads decided to wait close to an hour to call me to tell me they didn't have any of what I ordered available.

The grilled octopus was the worst. Waaaay overcooked and so charred it was bitter. We sent it back and the next one was better but still awful. The chef does NOT know how to grill octopus. The sliders had nice sauce, but the buns were dry and stale and the meat was overcooked to ultra well done and mealy. Looking for something mediocre to finish with, we tried the gnocchi... dear lord, how can you screw up cheese gnocchi this bad?

The restaurant is BSquared so their drink menu is very appropriately presented as a table of elements! There are other small and quirky aspects of the decor but I won't spoil it all for you.Coconut Lime pancakes are deliciously fluffy, moist and have great flavor without being at all overpowering or too sweet.

I ordered what I thought would be a ribeye and for the price, I expected a legit, sizeable ribeye. Instead, I received something else. What they tried to pawn off to me as an almost 40 dollar rib eye looked more like a poorly sliced, thin NY Strip that they attempted butchering to stretch their inventory, but I digress. I didn't make a big stink about it. The temperature was way off in some spots because it was so unevenly cut and cooked that I just sent it back. I ordered medium temp and most of it was well-done/medium-well.If you know me by know, you know I don't reorder food once my order has been messed up. I'd rather grab something from elsewhere on the way home if I'm still hungry and maybe come back to the establishment another day, if it pleases me to do so. Luckily, the apps filled me sufficiently so another stop was not necessary.The most important thing is that my girlfriend enjoyed her meal. We shared some beignets with dipping sauces for dessert. The server overhead us talking about it being my girlfriend's birthday and he gave her a little candle to blow out which was nice.To the credit of the manager, he came by to check on us after I sent back my steak. He offered to make me something else but I refused and thanked him. Like I said, I'm not opposed to a return visit but I would probably only order drinks and apps. To slap on a hefty $38 price tag on an entrée item and to send out what was given to me definitely has me on high alert when it comes to the integrity of their kitchen. You be the judge (check the picture of my main). The steak was only accompanied by one hasselback potato and a few matcha onion rings; very unique sides but you know you're paying for that protein. I expected much better.To end on a high note, they also have a speakeasy called, Room 623, located below the dining area, with live music. I wouldn't mind coming back for a date night with the hubbs and maybe even dress up for the evening. I would definitely return.",B2 Harlem

261,none,"Lets begin by saying this place is not the greatest!  To begin with, there was no AC! We decided to take the risk of eating here without AC... we sat ordered water and the waiter brought us some bread. The bread was really nice and warm. My father in law asked for napkins and the waiter said they didn't have any.  I couldn't believe my ears! Napkins really? Anyways....We all ordered our food, I ordered the shrimp. I was disappointed because I asked for tartar Sauce... they didnt have any, I must say why even have shrimp on the menu? Rolls eyes! My mother in law ordered steak and requested special garlic sauce.. the steak arrived... ask me where the garlic sauce was at???? Yea, it arrived 15 mins later. The floor was slippery, the cleanliness of the floors were of concern! As well as the bathroom was poorly kept! The picture attached to this review of the toilet was upon my entrance! I was like wtf is this!!!!!!This alllllll counts to the experience! Wouldn't recommend it! Pricey for poor experience. The food was okay. The waitress were okay. Proceed with caution! Don't slip and fall.","The food was okay but the service was below par.We had waited several minutes before being greeted. After being greeted and sat down, the waitress came promptly.  The drink distribution was piecemeal.  We had provided the order and the appetizer came promptly.We had to wait about 45 minutes for the main meal to be served.  After 20 minutes I had asked if the children's food could have been brought out and theirs wasn't available yet.They didn't provide us with the updates as we had to initiate the inquiry of the delays which they did not provide a justified response even while the restaurant was 70% empty.  They did provide a minimum compensation for the delay.","The hostesses were smiling and greeted us inmediately upon entry. We were seated a few minutes before our reservation. Our waiter Garis was also very kind and professional. The food was hot, and cooked to perfection. Excellent dining experience.

262,none,none,none,Great service and delicious food.Valentine was amazing. Wonderful service.Very glad to have such a great restaurant close by.,"It's a really cute spot not too big or small.  The drinks were good. The appetizer with calamari and  shrimp  alongside  what tasted like tartar sauce and  some tomatoey spicy sauce was pretty decent. (Can't mess that up) When it boiled down to the entree I remember getting the seafood bouilabaisse. Really nice presentation, surprised me a bit. It came in an edible fried bowl (just picture that because I go no picture) filled with muscles, scallops, shrimp calamari ad some fresh greens. HOWEVER, when I say Salty, I mean SALT-AY. At that first bite I realized that the appetizer could hold me down. Me and my date decided to leave because I started  getting some weird vibes(the hurry up and leave so we can close up vibes from  staff ) as we were the ONLY ONES there late night 12:00 AM.  So we left, because I felt uncomfortable. The host was also a bit off. Overall, three stars is my review.  Would I go again? Maybe.","I went to Renaissance with a group of 5 women. I had the lobster BLT with truffle fries & a lemonade. The food was good, the menu had great options. However, I did not care for the service. 40 minutes passed between the time our order was taken & the food was served. Also, we had to remind our waitress about drinks. Our waitress was inattentive & a bit unkind but other wait staff tended to their tables somewhat promptly. I'm not sure if our waitress was new or just having a bad day but I did not appreciate our service. We even had to ask the manager for water & for our check. I would like to go to Renaissance again because the food was great & I'd like to experience their dinner menu but I'd hope the service is better.",Renaissance Harlem

264,none,none,none,"I've been eating Dyre Fish Market for years. You can't go wrong with steamed seafood. They have a large selection of entrees for you to choose from. Whether you're in the mood for crab legs, shrimp, clams, salmon, scallops, porgie fish, whiting fish, red snapper fish, or even king fish, this place has it all. You can pair your steamed fish entree with either veggies (they have; broccoli, carrots, potato, okra, pumpkin, spinach, corn, string beans, and mushrooms to choose from all bagged up) or yellow rice. Other side orders includes: French fries, crab sticks, crab cake, fruit salad, calamari, veggie salad, or seafood salad. Even if you're not in the mood for steamed seafood, they also have a fried fish option which is served with either yellow rice or French fries. So how it works is that you pick up a basket and select what type of seafood you would like to either be steamed or fried along with any combination of vegetables. After, you hand your basket to one of the workers that will begin to first, 1. Wash your seafood and vegetables and then 2. season your food. I usually tell them to put all of their seasonings and make it EXTRA spicy. Please let them know of any known allergies! Next, they will put it in a steamer and give you your ticket number (do not lose it). This process takes about 25-30 minutes depending on how busy it is inside and what type of seafood you selected. They also accepts EBT and has an ATM available. However, you may use a card as a form of payment. Pros: 1. Great location and reasonable price 2. Food is always tasty and consistent 3. They have a large selection of seafood 4. They have somewhere where you can sit and wait for your food if you choose to do that5. You select your own seafood and vegetables 6. You can always call ahead and place a order for pick up. Cons:1. When it is busy, it is busy and the wait time is usually longer 2. Most times there are no street parking 3. They are not open 24hrsTip: *Tell them to leave the juice and add butter* just like that!",So you go in there and it's like an assembly line. You pick up the tray and put the vegetables and seafood you want in it. They season it any way you like and then steam the food. The prices are reasonable and it taste out of this world. As long as I have lived uptown in NY I have never been here and I'm going to keep going back.,"This is a small little fish market on the corner of Dyre Ave aka a little hole in the wall of seafood goodness. Food is cooked how you like it: either fried or steamed. All the seafood is out on Ice for you to put in a container to hand to the guys by the steamer so that they can season your food in-front of you. Don't forget to pick your side items!I was with four people and we all ordered the following to share: shrimp, snow crab legs, and steamed salmon with sweet plantains, potatoes, corn on the cob, broccoli, onions, and peppers. We also ordered fried shrimp and a fried red snapper. Both the fried fish and the fried red snapper came with a side of yellow rice, which we chose as opposed to a side of fries.All of our sides except the rice were way too over cooked. Maybe they can figure out a way to throw in the veggie sides in a little after the fish is in the steamer because they almost all turned into mush. Not sure if this is the texture they are going for, but we all agreed the sides were way too soft (still tasty because of all the seasoning). Overall, super delicious, a bit of a wait for your food to cook, sides a bit too soft, employees all super friendly!",Dyre Fish Market

I prefer the bbq burger, my husband usually try different combinations his preferred is the one with peanut butter. The service is great, super attentive. You gotta try the onion rings!","This is the second time we ordered take out from here. The first time was nothing to write about but definitely better than what we just got.We ordered a cheeseburger, volcano burger and tater tots. The cheeseburger was decent. I ordered it medium well but probably should have got medium. The volcano burger was ordered well done but was burnt. It's basically a cheeseburger but with a mound of cheese. We were excited to trying it being such cheese lovers. The cheese melted so it was like a pancake of cheese which was fine but it was burnt. You could taste the burnt flavor in it. The bun was grilled but the lines were pretty charred. So all together it was pretty bad. We called to get a refund and what made matters worse was the owners attitude. He said it was ordered well done. As to imply we should have expected it that way. Also tried to say it's a hard burger for take out. If that is the case then train your staff to educate the guests so they know what they're getting into. We didn't care that the cheese melted, just didn't want it burned. We ended up taking everything back since we still needed to buy food for dinner and didn't want them thinking we ate it. He seemed pretty upset we brought everything back, but still gave us a refund. Well actually he didn't want to be bothered, the young lady who was behind the counter assisted us. She was probably the most professional in there. The bill was only $26, it wasn't about that. The volcano burger was so bad it was not edible. Then the owner (or whoever the gentleman was) had a nasty attitude which didn't help the matter. We won't be trying it for a third time, we'll stick to Patricia's, which is right next door. We were actually debating between the two, guess we made the wrong decision.",I wanted to love this place. Could be so much better. Burgers were good fried pickle spears were very good except the batter really didn't stick too well. With a limited menu should have been better. Loved the decor and theme inside with the graffiti on the walls but it kind of looked dirty. I get what there going for but a good cleaning is necessary,Burger Time

Got the pizza and I am pleased. 3.8/5Loved the mushroom and grilled zucchinis on top, and the crust is so scrumptious! Best for a pizza craving with less guilt. This is a great vegan option just remind them to put no cheese!","Ordered delivery from this spot - a large cheese pie, garlic knots, and a chicken roll. Out of the three, the garlic knots were the best - chewy but still fluffy and flavorful. A win! However, the cheese pie was, unfortunately, nondescript and didn't stand out from any corner pizzeria. It was edible, but it wasn't spectacular in any way that it made me want to order from here again in the future. Chicken roll was giant and reminded me of a calzone more than anything, and it was mediocre as well. FYI, it had sesame seeds sprinkled heavily all over the top, which is the first time I've seen such a thing on chicken rolls. I had no issue with delivery, and the food was still pretty warm when it arrived. Overall, no giant issue with the place, but also no real giant reason to return.","I don't understand how you can go wrong with chicken tenders & fries but this pizza shop did!! This looked like someone's leftover a total of 10 fries with 5 pieces of chicken with no sauce....... chicken tenders w fries is close to $8 here and I was so disappointed when I saw what was delivered to me... never coming here again!

I went with bacon and egg on a roll for lunch and the Yankee pot roast sandwich (gravy on the side) for dinner, and they did not disappoint. Comfort food of the highest order! And I've ordered again and stopped in a few times since.

Today however, my brothers and I were looking for some lunch, so we decided to grab a bite and rediscover Crosstown.Like many diners, Crosstown is bright and open. Even though the space is semi-compartmentalized, it flows nicely and has all the components one would expect to find in a diner. Because it's located at the corner of Tremont and the Bruckner Expressway, street parking can be difficult. However, they have a small parking lot that I've always been able to find a spot in. The menu is huge - both in selection and physical size. Like really - pages and pages, I thought I was at the Cheesecake Factory for a minute. I was in the mood for a wrap, so I turned to chapter 6 where they were listed. The southwestern wrap looked good, so I went with that. The wrap contained grilled chicken breast, guac, and cheddar jack cheese -  it also came with a side of fries. I wasn't too impressed with the wrap; the contents weren't really defined - it kind of all melded into one, and the flavors weren't big. The fries were average - I would have liked to have seen more on the plate. Overall, I find Crosstown to be an average diner. While I would normally give a place like this a 3, after looking at the prices on the menu I'm giving them a 2. A forgettable wrap with a few fries cost $14?

Premium Sweets is located in the Parkchester area of the Bronx and is in a primarily Bangladeshi community. Parking can be a bit of a pain but eventually you will find street parking. There is meter parking available (.25 for 15 minutes until 7pm). The area is very reminiscent of Jackson heights. The venue is very modest and has a simple set up with a few small tables and chairs in the back. The venue is clean and manned by multiple staff. The owner Mr. Khan is so NICE! He immediately greeted my family and I and asked us to stay for dinner (I've never met this gentleman before but I immediately felt and was treated like family). I asked Mr. Khan what he could suggest for a meal as there were a huge variety of items available because of Ramadan. Shortly after being seated, staff began to bring over a variety of dishes. We shared the chicken and beef biryani, various iftar fritters, & salad. The tamarind sauce served on the side was so sweet, sour and mildly spicy, and complimented the fried items. The beef biryani was delicious! The meat was so tender and melted away as you ate it. The salad was crisp and the green chilies on the side were fresh and fiery hot [just the way I like em]! After finishing our meal, Mr. Khan brought us dessert! The variety included jalebis, gulab jamun & kala jamun. All of the sweets were perfection! Fresh, soft, & sweet. The restaurant sells traditional Indian sweets for $7.99 a pound which are available in a refrigerated case in the front of the store. Next to the register is a buffet style variety of Indian/Bangladeshi dishes. Because of Ramadan, there were also trays of fried goodness available for very reasonable prices, varying from 3 items for a dollar to one dollar each item. We also tried the chicken samosas which were crispy and packed full of well seasoned mildly spicy filling. The chicken tikki were delicious too! The restaurant has a cooler with typical drinks, soda, bottled water, etc. Tea is also readily available. I will definitely be returning to this restaurant for the sweets, the food and most importantly the amazing customer service and the ever so wonderful Mr. Khan.",none,"The food was a-m-a-z-i-n-g!

As for food, if you're a newbie you have to ask for Cevapi. You might not see on the menu but its the best and my personal favorite.

My friends and I started a little tradition to come here when we want to treat ourselves to a nice dinner. The first time we went I didn't really know what to expect but one of my friends had been there before and she highly recommended it. Make sure you start with the cuttlefish risotto! It's so so good and I wish I could eat this as an appetizer all the time. I was a little skeptical I would like it, but now I crave this dish! As for dinner, I always end up ordering off the specials list but the chicken dish, Cornish hen, and filet mignon are all winners, too. I'm always up for trying new things so I try and order something different each time I come. As for drinks, they don't hand you a cocktail menu, but they have a full bar. We always opt for wine, but close out with one of their dessert martinis. My go-to is the espresso, but the chocolate one is good, too. For dessert, we always got for the Croatian style crepes with Nutella and ice cream. Maybe next time we'll go for a different dessert. One star off because the first time I went, I left a cash tip and they charged my card as if I didn't leave a cash tip. Luckily my bank fixed it, but an annoying and bad practice mistake to make. Overall, the food is A+. Definitely check it out!","Started coming here after we did a family bike trip to the Dalmatian coast.  We loved the food there - simple, fresh and delicious.  You don't hear much in the US about Croatian food - or wine or beer, for that matter.  (You can't even find Croatian wine or beer in Total Wines).  You can probably count the number of Croatian restaurants in the New York area  on one hand.  Thankfully, we have this one.  We have been here several times, usually in the warm weather when you can sit out on their excellent patio overlooking their vegetable garden.  The salads and veggies are fabulous (and they come from their garden), and if there is a better restaurant for grilled fish, I haven't found it yet.  Brings back a lot of fond memories of Croatia but Dubrovnik stands on its own merits anyway.",Dubrovnik Restaurant

Feels like a simple cafe with a few honey touches like houseplants, good music from the kitchen and motherly wait staff.

We were greeted by a little girl and her mom who turned out to be our waitress. She recommended we try the pork, cheese and bean pupusas; we also ordered a lunch special of tostones, salad and grilled chicken, a corn tamale and a limonata. The pupusas came with a tomato based sauce and spicy coleslaw and the tamale came with sour cream. Honestly - it was the best meal I've had in the neighborhood in a very long time. The chicken was well seasoned and tender, the tamale was sweet and perfect with the sour cream, and the pupusas were like eating a savory pancake. It was so good that we went back the next day and got palomilla steak, maduros and beans, and more pupusas.Service was friendly and we didn't have any issues with it being slow as mentioned in other reviews; however we went there at an off hour so that could play a role.We also felt that the food they served left a homemade, satisfying and warm feeling that went beyond a typical restaurant experience.

Some cooked well done, some cooked rare, and all the others in between. He grabs a plate and asks what you want, then he'll grab the slab, cut a small price to ask you if you agree with the temperature of the meat or if you'd like to go more rare or more well done. After you choose he asks how many slices you'd like and if you want it cut up or not. He serves you your plate, puts a dash of salt on the end he cut from and hooks it back onto the big fire pit.

They gave us complimentary champagne.Food was amazing and views over the Hudson river -- terrific.Seafood was excellent, especially scallops.It is a little pricey but well worth it.",I came here for dinner one night with my husband. The restaurant itself is very beautiful. They have a ton of people running the food and constantly walking around and refilling water and drinks. There seem to only be two or three waiters taking orders but it was a smooth operation. The menu is DIFFERENT. Some items don't seem like they pair up well but what I ordered was fairly good. I got the soft shell crab special. It comes with a sauce and potatoes and vegetables. The sauce was sort of soupy but it was still tasty. My husband got the steak with potatoes and vegetables. The steak was cooked to the correct temperature but it was dry. Overall the experience here was good. I'll be back but will order different items.,X20 on the Hudson

Their pasta dishes are so flavorful and filling you will want more but you'll be stuffed.Order at the counter and pay then they will cook your food fresh and bring your food to you over at their seating area.  Also great is the fact that their dishes are priced fair not like the cost of some overpriced restaurant in Manhattan.Do yourself and your life a favor and come here.  Next time you will be the one recommending this place.,none,"Review is for the Tough Guy hero ($9.25), which has made my day both times I've had it.Delectable, wafer-thin slices of prosciutto and salami envelop fabulously oily sun-dried tomatoes, a sheet of silky fresh mozzarella and two planks of crispy fried eggplant.

301,none,none,none,"I noticed a new lunch special and decided to treat my mom and sister for a Sunday lunch to get a change from our usual brunch spot (Vista Mar). Once seated (we requested the outdoor patio) we inquired about the special and were told it was a Mon-Fri deal disappointed but we decided to stay. The menu is limited and pricey so many others entering asked about the special after being seated and got up and left. We opted for the calamari, seafood salad, seafood linguini chefs special, penne a la vodka and lobster ravioli. I must say the appetizers had the freshest seafood I have ever tasted. The calamari nice and soft, the mussels in the salad the cleanest, not one grain of sand and the smoothest slivers of oysters. My sister ordered the penne, it's her usual when she finds it on any menu and she was impressed. My ravioli was a generous serving and deliciously creamy, my mom said her special was so delicious her only regret was not wanting to get dirty tearing into her lobster. Sorry I have no photos on this meal as we were enjoying it all to well. I gave 4 stars over 5 because I didn't expect to spend $166 on lunch for 3 when many other places on the island have a Sunday brunch menu. Especially since we only had water with our meals.","It was date night and we decided to use good ole' Groupon for a surf and turf deal as my cravings for lobster come often. I haven't been to City Island in years so going to Portofino on a school night (Wednesday) seemed perfect. I imagine the weekends are pretty crowded and I wanted to have nice quiet time. As you walk in you'll notice a very traditional sit-down Italian restaurant decor. This place is huge and I can definitely see huge parties held here. Since we decided to go on a Wednesday evening there was absolutely no crowd (there were maybe a total of 6-8 other people besides us) and plenty of parking.  The staff (waitress and server/hostess) were really friendly and welcoming. They checked in on us a few times and made sure everything was to our liking. Our Groupon included: 1 bottle of wine, 2 appetizers, 2 surf and turf entrees (a lobster tail and steak), and 2 desserts. The Cabernet Sauvignon we selected was delicious (photo attached). We decided to go with a shared appetizer for an extra cost. It was the Hot AntiPasto for 2: Shrimp, Fried Calamari, Stuffed Mushrooms, Eggplant, Rollatini, and Baked Clams.If you are starving I would suggest this. The sizing was pretty large for us as I started to get full after eating this. The shrimp, calamari and baked clams were delicious. Everything else was just friend mush. Our surf and turf entrees consisted of a large lobster tail and steak. I asked for Medium-well (don't judge me) and ended up getting a well-well done steak. I did not need to use the butter sauce as the lobster tail was extra seasoned. The veggies (carrots and string-beans) were cooked in some buttery garlic sauce I loved it. So I ate the lobster tail and veggies for most of my entree. Our deal also included 2 desserts. By this time we were so stuffed we did not even want to see the dessert menu so the waiter offered to give us the desserts to go. This was so kind and I'm glad we did not have to ask for it be wrapped up. The waiter offered this before we even know what was being offered. I asked and he named several cheesecake flavors.I am not a fan of any type of cheesecake so my date was about to have the bomb late night snack. We ordered a raspberry cheese cake and a chocolate cheesecake to go. Before leaving the waiter offered us some homemade sambuca (fig and raisin). It was the bomb. It was so sweet and strong at the same time - I loved it! Our night was lovely, we had a great dinner and all is well. Fast forward to the unwrapping of the desserts. We open the first container of the ""raspberry"" cheese cake. We notice there are no raspberries there are actually strawberries on top. Ok that's fine. We wouldn't have complained about that but as we go to get a fork (I was willing to try it)we notice some mold on one of the strawberries. We both took a better look at this and quickly threw the slice of cheese cake away. My date did inspect and try the chocolate cheese cake but didn't feel comfortable eating it. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the wine, the amount of food for the price and I can so see this being such a great outdoor dinner spot during the summer but I'm not sure I'll return because mold on food is not really a good look. It made me think about everything else I ate and I was a bit turned off.",Great place to get lunch! Friendly staff and delicious food. Large portions too! The lobster linguisa was amazing. The fish of the day Dover fish was cleaned and filleted at the table. The Blackstone wine was very tasty too. Probably my new favorite American wine.,Portofino Restaurant

Thank you Gabrielle's!!","We came here many times when the establishment was a different restaurant. I wanted to try out Grabielle's since learning that they opened here. Hubby, babes and I were out and about, getting last minute necessaries and running errands, when we found ourselves in the vicinity and decided stop by for lunch.We didn't have to wait long for a table. Our server was very nice. They seated us at a table with enough room for our stroller. Hubby and I shared some Jerk Chicken Mac & Cheese which was OK. Hubby ordered their burger and I had the Oxtail Wrap. Hubby really enjoyed his burger jut I did not care for my wrap at all. Calling it a rice wrap with some oxtail shavings would be more accurate. For the price, I would have expected to have a good amount of meat but you could hardly even see where the meat was, other than by the dark color of it. It looked more like oxtail gravy and rice in my wrap. I immediately regretted my order upon receiving it.I ate half of it and gave the other to my son. It was all rice! I'm still amazed they even serve it like that. I enjoyed their sorrel with some Jamaican rum and as I said, the service was very good although the wait for food was a bit long.I doubt we'll be back. They're pretty pricey but I don't feel like, for the West Indian food, you're getting much bang for your buck. In that area, there are plenty of other places to go to for a better deal on that kind of cuisine, just traveling a little ways south on Boston Rd.","Nope, nope, nope. Went here on a Saturday for breakfast with a friend and her year-old son. Do you know when you have a feeling that a place is just not going to be right? That's the feeling is soon as I walked in this place. We asked for a child seat. The waiter brought over one of the wooden seats, but the strap was broken. When we mentioned to him that we can't put the child in with a broken strap, he said he would look for a Nother seat. He came back about 10 minutes later, and said that all of the other seats were in use. But a quick scan of the restaurant, show that there were no other children in the place, who were using a child seat. So I guess the real answer is that they only had one seat, and it was broken. Straight line.Next, we placed our orders, and I asked for coffee. It showed up about five minutes later, and a very small cup, and it was tepid. Not even warm. My friend ordered the steak and eggs (even though I warned her that this was probably going to be a disaster), and she asked for cheese in her scrambled eggs. I ordered an omelette with tomato, spinach, turkey bacon, and cheddar cheese. My friend asked for an order of fried plantains for her son.The waiter was diligently writing down the order on iPad, but I had a feeling he was getting it wrong, because he was not listening closely to what we were asking him.It took quite some time for food to arrive, but when it did, it was just bad. My friend's steak, which (I warned her against getting) was truly like the sole of someone's  shoe. She had requested the steak be cooked medium, and it truly resembled a piece of leather. The eggs that she asked to include cheese, came cheeseless. And the fried plantains for her son were like potatoes: they were not at all ripe. The home fries that were served with it were quite dry. I requested ketchup, twice, and it never appeared. My tepid coffee was finished, so I asked for water. Instead. No one ever offered to refill my coffee cup, nor did anyone come to refill our water glasses. Then, the waiter appeared halfway through our meal with a plate of eggs with cheese on them. My friend was no longer interested in them, as they were not hot, Undercooked (salmonella, anyone?) and had a few dots of cheese here and there.When country kitchen was at this location, it was such a wonderful restaurant. This place seems to be focused on drinks, and witty repartee, but not so much on providing good food. At least not at breakfast. I think I will pass on it, forever.",Gabrielle's NY

When we finally got to our table, they took us to the back where there were PLENTY of empty tables. Makes you wonder why in the world it took so long for us to get seated. After we were seated, we didn't see our waiter for over 20 minutes until I flagged someone down and asked where our waiter was. She eventually came to take our drink/food orders but after that we never saw her again. I had to flag someone else down to get our bill.

310,none,none,none,"A good find. I'd passed by this strip of mostly fast food chains (Checkers, Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Chipotle) and thought it was more of the same. It described itself as ""Jamaican style,"" thinking it was like Chipotle being ""Mexican cuisine."" I'm doing jury duty and took a chance on it last Friday got lunch. The set up is a small buffet-style restaurant charging $7.99/lb. or $11.99/lb. if you opt for their seafood options. I tried to go as close to 1 pound as possible to see what you get for that price. Friday I had some rice and peas, a few pieces of curry chicken, string beans, and some jerk pork. Today I tried the jerk chicken wings, provisions (callaloo), sweet plantains, okra, and Rasta pasta.The chicken was well seasoned. I liked the different layout of vegetable options to balance things, so I guess it's theoretically possible to eat here as a vegetarian. I've never had Rasta pasta before, and am not a huge pasta fan, but the spiciness/heat of it was an interesting juxtaposition. I saw that served ackee and saltfish, as well as things like cheese and bun, carrot cake, Irish seamoss, peanut punch, and some fresh juices. I also saw roti on the menu, which I haven't yet tried. I know a good roti when I eat one, so I'm a tough critic. All in all, this is probably the best option for lunch around here if you like variety and aren't afraid of spice. That being said, this is definitely not your Chipotle-style take on Jamaican food- it's the real thing, so give it a shot.","This is another one of my spots around my hood love ordering  food here. So I decided to treat myself to a veggie plate. And the fresh cucumber ginger juice, which I always get. I love how they cook up there callalou, for those of u who don't know callalou is like Caribbean  collard greens and spinach its has its soft  stringy qualities and also its crunchier ones. Although it most likely comes out a can (I only know a few markets in nyc the actually sell fresh callalou) it's spruced up nicely  great for any time a day especially breakfast.  By the way I love there spin on  Rasta pasta.","I rarely by food by the pound, but I heard from two people I know that they enjoyed the food here, but neither of them are Caribbean.

Thought I'd memorialize the moment here. Bottom line: I'm sick to my stomach. This order was a significant waste of money. 95% of it went directly into the garbage chute. I couldn't even bother to grace my fridge with the leftover sweet plantains.

You can really get a feel for the venue atmosphere if you go to UTUBE and watch the clips of the performances from this night. Look up January 19, 2019 Jeremy Bar-Ilan Band at An Beal Bocht Cafe. This local restaurant, cafe, pub, sports bar, music venue is unique in my eyes. At the same time it's typical. Music variety and schedule is posted on their website. They serve food that looks delicious. Our party didn't eat. The band performed 9pm so we ate before we went. Hats off to the service staff that maneuvered the small space between the bar and the band. Yes it's a small dim lighting type venue. The crowd consisted of fans of the band and the cafe regulars. People come to drink, eat, socialize and enjoy the music. I believe if you live in the neighborhood or want to feel a city vibe you will have fun. I would like to eat here in the future. I doubt I will have the opportunity unless I'm invited to a band performance in the future. I'm giving it four stars just because, that's my gut feeling. It's a good time. You judge for yourself......","Great beers, atmosphere and their chicken tortilla soup is phenomenal!",An Beal Bocht Cafe
316,none,none,none,"I went here for a special dinner on my wife's birthday in May 2019. We encountered great service, as you would expect in a spot with less than 20 seats. Small wine list,  but front of house (1 person) will find you something wonderful and not too costly to complement the chef's selections that evening. Not cheap, but unlike many NYC higher-end restaurants, I saw more of my money in the plate. Expect generous, expertly prepared, and restrained preparations and executions. Overall great cooking; the chef, who cooks 2 or 3 feet away from you with a sous chef, is quite adept at preparing vegetables and animal proteins. In my opinion, this is a must-visit stop for either the Harlem-based gourmand as well as members the global travelling set.","Absolutely exceptional​!Husband and Wife duo Melissa and Darryl are going for a dinner party vibe with their 12-seat fine dining​ experience and that's exactly what you get. Melissa is a fabulous host who makes you feel like your catching up with an old friend, an old friend who has handpicked​​ their entire wine collection. I showed up a bit before my reservation and was let inside before opening which I was very thankful for. Be sure you pay close attention to their cancellation policy. It $75 per person for no-shows and those who miss their 15 minute grace period. So be on ​time!I was immediately shown a beautifully​ curated​ wine menu and Darryl wasted no time preparing our small plate orders. My boyfriend and I ordered two small plates to share; the Macaroni​ Spring Rolls and the Lobster Salad. Both were divine​. With perfect timing,​ our large entree plates were placed as soon as our small plates were carried away. We ordered the Black Sea Bass and Australian Wagyu Filet Mignon. That was the best piece of fish I've ever tasted and I'm not being dramatic. All of the flavors of this dish paired wonderfully​ and the freshly made pasta was a magnificent touch. I truly enjoyed and savored every bite of my food. It was my boyfriend's birthday and since I forgot the candle, Melissa played happy birthday over the speaker instead which I really appreciated. The hospitality was insane. If you're​ looking for quality food that speaks to the soul (and stomach), a warmatmosphere​r, and great hosts then you may want to check this place out. Belle Harlem was a last-minute​ find, but I'm so grateful that I stumbled upon it. I will be back.","An amazing experience! On a high after leaving Belle. Went with my boyfriend and my parents. We got the Mac and cheese spring rolls to start, duck breast, sea bass, and filet mignon. Then, we got the lemon and peanut butter desserts. Everyone loved their food, and the ambience is so special (only about ten seats in there). Including a bottle of wine, entrees for four, an appetizer, and two desserts, it came out to $330ish. Prices include gratuity. We can't wait to return!",Belle Harlem
317,none,none,"We arrived at the restaurant  when there was  no one seating in the first floor, and we asked to be seated in the first floor; the person in charge of seating told us the first floor  was reserved for people with ""physical disabilities"".... So we sort of agreed to be seated  in  the basement  area, but given the size of the first floor we  inquired once  again if we could be seated there  as we were being escorted down to  the basement...But the  same line was repeated to  us. The basement felt  crowded and claustrophobic.The restaurant was strangely NonBlack. In fact  there was only one black person in the  restaurant, and she was some sort of waiter; the rest of the waiters and clientele were all  white including the  Hispanic  waiter who took care of us. Needless to say, my partner and I felt rather odd dining in an all White restaurant in the center of Harlem, a  predominantly African American neighborhood with higher than average unemployment rates for the city,  but we sort of dismissed  the issue and  proceeded to order some drinks as we looked   through  the menu. Most of the listings  in the menu were rather meat oriented and entirely out of touch with modern vegan trends, and decidedly on the  pricey range for a restaurant in a neighborhood where rents are significantly cheaper than downtown; but  we sort of dismissed the price issue.   Accompanying us were two wine conosours with a worldly slant; my partner and I are both Gay  Manhattanites, worldly, philanthropists.As we settled in our seats, something all 4 of us found extremely annoying was the constant pestering by the staff inquiring if we were ready to order. So annoying were these constant visitations that my partner, a rather softspoken man of understated elegance, asked one of the waiters to give us some time to breathe... But even as we hastened the pace at which   we  consumed  our aperitives and appetizers our table was visited perhaps another 4  times by varying levels  of waiters asking if we were ready to order our  main course.   We had only been at the restaurant perhaps 15 minutes, but somehow the service felt we had to be gulping down our  food already. We proceeded to order two rather expensive bottles of wine.  And finally had our main courses.  Sadly, the food was subpar but edible, nothing really intelligently concocted, and if I may add,  severely lacking in cullinary imagination and subtlety. The wines  were  an interesting exercise.  I don't even recall if we had dessert. The whole experience was so creepy and  vulgar that we kind of ran out of the place. Over 600 dollars later, and in less that one hour after  arrival. We were processed out of the place. But our shock was yet to come.  We proceed to climb up the steep flight of stairs  from the basement area  where we had been hastily railroaded to by the service ""because the first floor of the restaurant is  reserved for people with disabilities"".  As we looked around the first floor, we noticed a crowd of perfectly able people, most of them in their 30s. I snapped two pictures and informed one of the waiters who sat us  that she  had lied and pushed us to the basement because  according to her only people with disabilities  could sit upstairs. Her reply, ""I didn't say that"". I accused her of lying again.  It has taken me  over a month to write about our  horrid experience in this creepy  all White restaurant in the middle of a Black neighborhood.  Never again! And we are making sure our hundreds of friends hear about it.My final words to the owner of this processing trap is, have you no shame? And how low can you go? How can you justify hiring so very  few AA at your joint when the unemployment rate in Harlem is at least 2% higher than it is downtown, and the income Per Capita  way below the NYC's  average?  Shame on you again, and we will definitely be talking about this!","I'm a big fan of Clay, and each time i've been, it's been a wonderful dining experience. To start the service is great -- went on a Saturday evening, and the staff was very helpful in finding us a table even though we didn't have a reservation and the restaurant was quite busy. I started with the Traveling Light cocktail, which was very refreshing. I enjoyed the honey and egg white combination. For dinner, my girlfriend and I shared the bucatini with short rib ragu and the red snapper. The pasta was perfectly al dente and seasoned very nicely. My only recommendation is that there could have been more short rib in the dish. Our second dish, the red snapper, was also very good, and I appreciated the delicious parsnip and dill garnish that complemented, but did not overpower, the fish. All in all -- would definitely recommend Clay and go again.","This has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants. The food is always outstanding, the cocktails are delicious and creative (without being gimmicky), and the wine is always top notch.I think my favorite part about Clay is that everyone has always made me feel at home there. Especially the wine manager, Andrea (who is all around awesome, btw). The staff is knowledgeable, and they're all clearly passionate about what they do.It's slightly on the pricy side, so my fiancé and I usually go for special occasions.

Also the girl didn't even know we were the ones who ordered food and put it on someone's table and walked away only to come back minutes later and figure out it was the wrong table and just picked up the food and handed it to us.

The first visit, we sat outside for dinner on a Tuesday night. We sat on ""The Heritage"" side if that makes a difference. The waitress took our order.... we asked for a medium rare burger and a fajita salad. We got a very well done burger, and the fajita salad was literally fajitas and a pile of lettuce.... the chicken was extremely over cooked and I barely ate it. Waitress barely checked on us. The second visit was a Friday morning (today!), and we sat outside again but on the Eileen's side. We had the SAME waitress. We ordered iced coffees, pancake deluxe and Belgian waffle deluxe ( comes with sides of eggs and meat). Iced coffees came out, she brought milk but no sugar. Food came out with a different waitress and didn't bring any of the sides we asked for- eggs, meat, fruit for my boyfriend and eggs for myself. The bacon I got was cold like it had been sitting. We finally got the rest of our food- and had to ask 3 times for the side of bananas which we never got. At this point we are not sure if it's the kitchen staff or waitress being incompetent since every single order we had came out wrong the first time. After we ate we waited about 15 minutes waiting for someone to check on us and nothing - my boyfriend went inside and paid and said it was busy. We are very understanding BUT you have customers outside who are being ignored. We won't be returning.

The uniforms of the staff fits the build because the wear similar uniform to diner staff of the black and white movies. Literally, the uniforms are black and white lol.My suggestion would be to put a pop of colors in there. Something like a red table or an accent wall. As of right now, the only pop of color are the sad looking cakes they offer in the fridge behind the counter. I don't think they would make that investment unless people stopped buying food.I mostly bought egg and cheese sandwiches but today I bought an oatmeal. Don't think you could mess up that order if you tried.","Today is September 9, 2018 and I've had the worst experience ordering food from here.I placed my order and received a delivery about 40 minutes later.After noticing that my order was incomplete, I called the restaurant to rectify the issue. The owner wasted no time in saying that he will not be sending anyone with the remainder of the food because they were too, ""busy"" over the phone and proceeded to put the phone down and leave me waiting for his return. When he did, he just said hello and hung up. I called again and he told me that there's nothing he can do, where I let him know that if that's the case, then he can have his food back and I can get my money back. He nonchalantly said, ""I'll be here"" and hung up the phone.I realized my only option forward was to settle for whatever I was given in the delivery, although I had already paid for the entire order, or go in person and handle this matter.I went to the restaurant where the older gentleman who takes the orders told me he wasn't going to give me any money back because he ""would have to put the food in the fridge and sell it again to make money from it""I ran out of patience at that point and demanded my money back and he can have the food. He proceeded to call the police department in an attempt to maybe dissuade me from pursuing my money back.The police ended up mediating the situation by asking the older gentleman with the glasses to return my money, since I was offering the food right back to him (mind you, I ordered a delivery, and had to make my way to the restaurant with the food for this to happen)It was terrible and disgusting to see the business owner handling things like that. Even the police officer remarked that he's going to lose a lot of business because of this. It's clear that this restaurant is not the place to order from again from me, and I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE order from there!! Order from any of the other good diners around the area!

Guac and salsa are good, not better than Refried Beans though.

Adding another waiter would help.3. Drinks - They're strict with Happy Hour drinks. I was brought my second drink 5 minutes before Happy Hour ended (after waiting 10 minutes to get the waiter's attention) and wanted to order another but was denied, even when I chugged the drink I just received in the front of the waiter.

I had my sister try one and she said her samosa was also spoiled. Since I don't live in the same neighborhood as the restaurant, I called them and said, I was just at your store and you sold me samosas with spoiled potatoes, I'd like a replacement batch (I didn't even ask for a refund because I knew they would refuse that). After 5 minutes of talking with the guy who at first didn't get what I was saying (no I didn't order anything from Grubhub, no I don't want to order anything now, I was just there and had ordered in person), he said, okay you can bring it back. When I return with the samosas, the one I had spoken with now says, ""I talked with the owner who says we cannot do anything, once it leaves the store we cannot replace the food."" I said, ""You sold me spoiled samosas, you can see and smell when potatoes are spoiling yet sold them anyway."" He says, ""They're not spoiled, as you remember, they made them fresh.""

I flung the bag of samosas on the counter and left.Afterwards, I realized I should have spoken with the owner directly. I called and spoke with him saying how wrong it was for them to take my money and not even replace the samosas I brought back after they originally told me I could replace them. He says, come back at 5pm and they will make a new batch because he said he wouldn't be there for a few hours. At 5pm, I call again and speak with the owner and remind him that he said a new batch would be made if I come by. He now says, ""uhhhhh, I don't know I have to speak with my son, blah blah blah."" Basically, saying, they have no plans whatsoever of replacing them. Horrendous customer service. They already have a bunch of violations. It's time they get another inspection. I'm calling the Board of Health on them.",none,"This place is like a hidden gem in the neighborhood. Delicious, flavorful cuisine at affordable prices. You can grab a semosa or two as a quick snack for under 5 bucks! There is seating available but the place is small so it is best for maybe grabbing your food to carry out. I eat here at least a few times a week because I really enjoy how delicious the food is. Don't forget to try the green sauce!",none,"It seems like a very nice establishment, I did not however get to try the Chicken Somosa. I guess in that sense, gives a person a reason to come back. Lamb Curry actually turned out to be a really good dish. It was just the right spice, not too much but enough. It probably could have just used more lamb added to the dish. Mango Lassi was a good addition to the overall order, next time can try the different varieties of the Naan bread. Overall, not somewhere would go too frequently. Bottom line is I would go back just to try a different dish than what I had in this particular visit.",Curry & Kebab

Also had their homemade lemonade and coconut and pineapple cake. The oxtail was sweet and tender. I'd have it again.Coconut and pineapple cake was not overly sweet. It had (I think) a little bit of rum. I'm not a fan of rum but the rest of the cake was delicious!Friends had the curry chicken and rice. Another had the chicken roti with veggies. We all cleaned off our plates.They ran out of a few things, like the callalou, red velvet cake, and some other sides. I guess I'll have to come back to try again. Yes, they take cards.","I came here with 5 friends last week.. the food tasted disgusting.. I'm not sure if the chef was having a bad day or something but the chicken was undercooked, oxtail had sugar and was over the top. Rice was dry...Listen ..

Today, after checking into a nearby hotel, exhausted from a red eye flight from the west coast with a layover, we were so excited to find Pop's within walking distance! This eclectic, trendy, yet traditional cafe is such a gem! The staff is friendly, there are plenty of tables both in and outside, and the food is oh so delicious. As a vegan, I ordered the avocado toast (no egg or cheese), a fruit salad, and an iced coffee (and found out after that they carry oat milk!!) - all BOMB - and my boyfriend was in love with his pork belly Cubano sandwich. Pop's also has a large selection of cookies, pastries, coffee, and other sandwiches. It's worth noting that there is no public bathroom, but other than that, I have no complaints. Do yourself a favor and stop by pop's!","Update:I am updating my review after my last visit here. I have eaten here 5times , tiramisu and coffee past 4times, and nothing bad happened. But Last time here, I ate kale Cesar salad with avocado- and my husband same salad with chicken. We both had Terrible stomaches , a terrible day afterwards (you can guess what happens after a food poisoning event...) - I think We were both food poisoned from the salad, maybe not washed well... I disappointed with them even though I really liked the tiramisu here, I will really think about coming here again.-We loved Pop's. I was looking for a casual, Sunday coffee spot with an outdoor seating area. As the weather is so nice and breezy, stuffing ourselves to dark, small coffee shops is no justice. Then we came across Pop's on yelp with great reviews and small outdoor seating area.  It is super nice, sun shaded , quiet couple of tables. We had two iced coffee first. After chilling a bit, we saw the vast dessert and sweets section in the shop, which I think no one can resist easily.My husband surprised me with a tiramisu which was very fluffy, fresh and tasty. It was not too sweet and we shared one two of us. It was just right.Overall, I just loved Pop's. It has everything I was looking for, a c spot with outdoor seating, good coffee and vast menu with good food options.

Lukewarm. Kids Mac and cheese. Bland. Both adults got endless shrimp. They should've named it wait endlessly for shrimp. Had to flag down our server to get the next set of shrimp after first order and then wait another 20 min for it to come. The shrimp Alfredo was dry as all hell and the server tried to say it would be extra for more sauce. Like how?!?!Then, the nerve to get an order of shrimp scampi and 2 of the shrimp were still practically completely raw. Lucky for them my sister found a manager before I could take a picture. But even he said yes it was clear they were raw. But no comps to meal, adjustments, free item, nada. And that's on top of having to wait another 15 min for food. We only ordered our initial and 2 replacements during endless shrimp because it was just too slow and the toddler was beyond ready to go.

The food was delicious and the drinks are great! I got the jalapeño margarita and it was so good I had to get another one. Good place to go for birthday celebration, they have a bulldog drinks in different flavors.","Came here on Tuesday 6/25/19. There was a graduation party going on in the back and they had a nice live singer with a DJ which I found pretty cool. We were seated at a table and the girl came a few moments later. We started ordering drinks and as soon as she went to take our orders she spoke in Spanish which wasn't a problem because in most places in the Bronx waitresses will speak to me in Spanish but usually just see what we are pointing to. My boyfriend ordered his drink and said out loud bulldog and pointed to it and I the same. The drinks came and she only gave me a bulldog and him a reg margarita. So we did not want to make a big deal we switched and thats when he noticed a rather large crack on the glass we made her aware of it and she asked "" do you want me to replace it "" . YES WE DO. The glass looked like if you held it to long it would shatter in your hand. then proceeded to order food and my boyfriend are tacos 3 steak and 3 chorizos and she looked him in his eyes and acknowledge him. and took my order. We get our food it was really good. But his chorizos tacos never came out. then when we told her she looked back at her paper like you only said 3 and I only wrote that. And I'm like no we told you. Finally she put the order in, around 10 mins later it came and there was a hair in the tacos. We immediately were turned off we returned them to management and all the manager kept saying was he can make new ones. I also asked another waitress for a napkin and she had no idea what I was saying until I pointed to one. The only person who could understand English was the manager And we also let him know about the broken glass. We ended up paying the bill and leaving.

I mean...there's one close to Mom's, but it lacks majorly and doesn't do much for me. So when Fratilli's popped up in my local Yelp search, in I went. Hunts Point isn't far from Soundview, in fact- it's really the next section of The Bronx heading south. These guys are alone in the deeper side of all the Auto Body Shops in the Hunts Point hub. And from what I noticed driving by, didn't see any other Pizza shop in the area. Place is big with woods, lots of seating, refrigerators off to the left, a smaller glass ice cream freezer on right and front counter- with Pies waiting...just waiting to be heated- as soon as you head in. Really simple menu overhead: small and large Pies, square, white, Veggie slice or ""special"" pies with standard toppings, Salads and a few other things. Plain slice for me, Pepperoni for Mom and a Snapple to share. That's it! Mom's pepperoni slice gets props according to her, but if you're making a trip to Hunts Point or swerving off the Bruckner Expressway to hit it, you're grabbing a plain slice (in my opinion)--it wasn't too greasy, it was crispy but still bendable, surprisingly thin and that classic (kind of) bright orange you get when that sauce-and-cheese marriage happens. Service was very nice by the way. Fratilli's isn't artisanal or anything like that, but our slices were good.",none,Fratilli's Pizza
343,none,none,none,"My son and I found this small, friendly place on Yelp and are so glad we did. My son had a goat and okra stew and I had a fish stew with spicey peanut sauce. Both were served with fofou. You can eat this wonderful food with silverware or with your hand as West Africans do. This is a small storefront with just a few tables. There is a parking lot across the street. I will definitely return to try other dishes.","This is a welcome addition to the east side of the Bronx as most African restaurants are on the west side. The food was good but there are a few things to consider.·They have opening times listed as early as 10am. I thought I could pick up something early to take to work but it wasn't to be. Their doors open at 10, but I was told food wouldn't be ready until about 11:30.·I ordered jollof rice with chofi (turkey tail). It was good, but their version of chofi wasn't turkey tail. It was most likely legs and wings cut into smaller pieces across the bone. It was good, but if turkey tail is what you're after, that's not what you may get. Also, be sure to specify what you want in your plate. Some places will ask what you want in your plate. This place didn't at the time so I ended up with a bit more shito (a spicy sauce) than I wanted.So to sum it up, tell them exactly what you want and don't expect lunch plates when they first open. Still a great place with good food at a good price.","Ordered the number 2, the fufuo & abe nkwan with goat meat.  The place wasn't busy when I came midday and several menu items weren't ready yet (I wanted to try some sides).  The fufuo was interesting, a viscous spheroid of a nondescript and doughy taste.  Per Wikipedia, it is usually made by mixing cassava and green plantain flour.  Dipped in the accompanying meat and somewhat spicy sauce, it tasted pretty good.  The goat was well cooked and tender, without any appreciable gamey-ness.",Bognan International West African Restaurant

So I'm kind of stuck. Hope that they cut a better deal with grubhub or otherwise figure out a way to order online that works.Best souvlaki I've ever tasted.

Everything fresh and homemade.The shawarma, pork, and chicken are all real stacked rotisserie meats - not premade cones or loafs. We've had all three and can't pick a favorite because their all so good.Falafels - first rateHummus - first rateGreek Deserts - Mindblowingly delicious. I can't pronounce the names of the cookies but we tried a new one last night that's our new favorite.Delivery all the way to Inwood has been consistently on time, hot and friendly.Alex and his family/team are great people and they make great food!Thanks Taste and Sabor!","When they opened I was pretty skeptical. The whole idea of Greek/Mexican in one place sounded odd - even though lots of Mexican food (Al Pastor) is influenced by foods from Mediterranean. Also, T&S was taking over the location of another place with a strange menu.So even though I love Greek food and shawarma more than most stuff I waited and waited for some reviews to come in. Finally today I was in the area and tried it.Pork gyro platter - Excellent! This is REAL gyro/shawarma - actual slabs of meat stacked on a rotisserie and slow cooked. Most mass manufactured gyro are cones of chopped meat pressed together. In diners usually premade strips. But the gyro/shawarma at Taste and Sabor is totally homemade. Even my favorite Greek place up the hill (Greek Express) uses premade cones - which in their case are excellent - but the T&S meat is special.The pork is melt in your mouth tender and deliciously seasoned. The chicken is just as good.The rest of the platter ingredients were also excellent - fries, pita, and a really great Greek Salad with lots of vegetables and what tastes to me like REAL feta.Their tsatsiki sauce and the Greek salad dressing were also great.The deserts are really special here - all homemade and first rate.  The melomakarona cookies and bourghatsa (sp?) are new to me but so good! Baklava also excellent.Establishment and food all clean and fresh.And best of all - the people who own this place are great! Really friendly and helpful. Hope they have great success.All in all a great find. Sorry I waited so long to try it but will be back very soon. Don't miss out on this place - it's sooooo good!",Taste & Sabor

Previous version: Clean and new location. I was so glad to see upstairs seating. Lots of room for lines while waiting to order. Space to wait for pick up. Lots of Managers on hand today for the Grand Opening, I met a few. Employees provided fast friendly service. I'm hoping it remains this way. There's the usual breakfast options for reasonable prices. I took a bunch of menus. My friends in the  hood will be so excited. We can meet for lunch! If you're a fan of Chick fil A and live or work in the hood, check it out. Especially while it's clean and new.","Clean and new location. I was so glad to see upstairs seating. Lots of room for lines while waiting to order. Space to wait for pick up.

Wish they were open later though!",none,"This place has the best kfc (Korean Fried Chicken) in the whole city. I honestly don't understand how there are one star reviews and it is actually what motivated me to write this review. Please ignore them, as these people are actively keeping you and others from experiencing authentic tasting Korean dishes. 3 star review for an off day? Fine. 1 star? Absolutely ridiculous, offensive and damaging to a business the rest of us here in Washington Heights truly appreciate. These people need to grow up, and Yelp should consider removing their reviews for the purposes of this app's integrity since I am now questioning whether I should even trust this review service anymore. Seriously - the only place you will find this chicken is IN Korea or made by an actual Korean person.Back to the food: Mandu is pretty authentic as well (mandu are Korean dumplings), Ramen is great but I don't really eat ramen that much so I can't really compare it to other places. My next favorite thing (after the chicken box) is the spicy pork bowl - which is very close to how my actual Korean grandmother prepares this dish. The rest of the ""bowl"" dishes are great as well, and it's something my non-meat eating friends can enjoy too, since they have things like tofu. The one thing I wish they had is servings of gochujang, but you can get the chicken so spicy it's not even necessary. Thank you GoGo-Gi !!!Edit: Ended up checking the rest of the reviews and noticed there's another one star review that is border-line racist. Yelp, please remove these hateful comments as to allow this restaurant to rightfully thrive, and allow my neighborhood to continue enjoying our delicious chicken.

Not really sure what I was eating... I came in craving that korean bbq flavor on my lunch hour and ordered the BBQ pork rice bowl. While the meal hit the spot in portion size, I was rather disappointed with the contents of my bowl. I didn't realize that it came with cole slaw and french fries until after I ordered, and thought that was weird, but still looked forward to it. However, for $10.50, I got a bowl of kbbq pork that was mixed with... stale crinkle-cut french fries (like the frozen ones you bake)? And then the cole slaw was pretty wet so the vinegary, mayonnaise-y juices seeped into everything else and made the rice and meat an unwelcome acidic. The cole slaw was also straight up American tasting cole slaw, not like a pickled cabbage, or anything spicy. And unfortunately, the meat itself was also too burnt so every bite had that smokey, overcooked char taste. All in all, I was sort of confused by the meal. The closest thing to it would probably be one of those chicken/beef teriyaki platters you might get in a mall food court. Maybe the other bowls are better and I might come back to try one some time in the later future.",GoGo-Gi

354,none,I've gotta hand it to this place. Their seasoning on all of their dishes is delicious. I have no complaints when I'm at Pabellon.,"Stopped by this location today to order Chicharron de pollo sin hueso with sweet plantain (not by choice). The chicharron de pollo pieces were grotesquely HUGE Chicken breast (dark meat) pieces, with thick skin on every piece, and very slimy on the inside. I could not eat it, and was at the brink of throwing up! The chicken quality was very poor and low grade; EXTREMELY questionable. The fried sweet plantains were LOADED with so much grease, I could wring them out and have enough oil to refry them. Apparently, I could not eat those either! I wasted $10.00 on a nonedible meal, after not only walking to the store (over 15 minutes), but also walking to an ATM (No cash!). El Pabellon De Oro should be ASHAMED of themselves. Also, the menu is in desperate need of review and revision there are NO HEALTHY OPTIONS available. I did not want to order rice (because not everyone eats rice, or pork fried rice!), however I was told that I could not substitute the fried rice, French fries, or plantains ((everything is fried)) with broccoli or a different steamed vegetable :(. I was told that I had to choose one of those options, and if I wanted broccoli or another steamed vegetable (healthier option), I would have to order it SEPERATELY which comes with rice which is included in the price ($6.75). So, in order to eat lunch (which should be affordable) I have to order extra things that I do not want, or need AND I would have to pay EXTRA and have EXTRA food that I do not want. To end this review, I will not be visiting this establishment EVER again and do not recommend if you remotely care about your health. They, like many other establishments in the Bronx are the very reason for many of the health issues that many Bronxites are struggling with, due to lack of healthy food options, and healthier alternatives.

We came at a time where it wasn't quite busy so the service was really friendly. Upon arriving and after being seated, you receive some warm garlic bread. It was toasty yet fluffy on the inside, so I really liked that touch. The menu was average length on the shorter side, which I personally prefer because long menus overwhelm me. For our appetizer, my parents and I ordered the stuffed plantains with shrimp. It was very delicious but lacked salt. As for our entree, my mom had the churrasco, my dad had the sirloin and I opted for the filet mignon. We all ordered it medium well and had mashed potatoes on the side. Each steak entree comes with a free side and side salad. Ordering an extra side is an addition $5. My mom ordered rice and beans on the side that was average, nothing brag worthy. We all ended up loving our food! I personally liked my filet mignon the best, but everyone's food was delicious regardless. The quality of the meat was superb and the sides were equally amazing. The only thing I had a problem with regarding my food though was that it was too small. The size of the filet mignon compared to the rest of the steaks was disproportionately smaller. Besides that, I really enjoyed my time at Willie's Steak house. I can't wait to be back again.","I was expecting better, definitely.  The old glory days of Willie's steak house seemed to be truly over..... I used to dine there with friends and family many years ago...  To many options in the menu I think, my guests and I were expecting a known steak house, it was a surprise when the waiter had no idea what ""skirt steak"" meant.....Perhaps they are going through some kind of ownership change.... I would give another try because of the nostalgic feeling.... The place has history, I hope they get it together.","Parkchester was a major meeting point back in the day. It's still a hotspot and after a couple of decades, that area, paved the way for a few decent restaurants- one of them being Willie's Steak House. Under the L in Parkchester (Westchester & Thieriot Aves.- to be exact), still remains (a) the place to be seen, (b) see people you may haven't seen and (c) run into people that you may have gone to High School or hung out with eons ago. For Parkchester standards, Willie's is ""fancy"". The Man and I had an errand in the area and felt like having some Latin Caribbean food. Willie's was very quiet for a Thursday, but Salsa music was playing and fortunately, kicked up the mood. Our server was pleasant and brought out the menus only to notice Seafood options, outweighed the Steak- and worked to my advantage- but isn't this a Steakhouse? Mr. Man kind of questioned that, as there were all but 5 ""Steak"" dishes. He knew the food would be hearty and because this is a Puerto Rican restaurant, Mr. Man wanted to play it safe and ordered the Pork Chops instead- which he raved.My Camarones Enchilados (Deviled Shrimp), had the right amount of seasonings and my Tostones, were freshly fried. Full Bar but no extended cocktail menu- except for Red or White Sangria and Wine.Even though on the night we decided to visit there wasn't a live Latin Jazz band, in the end, it was all about the food- which didn't disappoint.",Willie's Steak House

My significant other (who is a Vegan) and I went Monday, and it was a perfect low key date night. He got the Alfred Burrito and enjoyed every bite, and I got the Caribe Pizza... the jalapeño and sweet plantain toppings were such an amazing contrast and flavor combo and the naan bread was a perfect crust! I didn't have room for dessert my first trip, so we tried the Avocado Ice Cream with sweet potato muffins and WHAM it was a home run! The Soursop Lemonade was a delicious addition to wash it all down too.I decided I had to treat my sister (also a Vegan) last night after a long day of work.

I only asked for credit tho","I am flabbergasted at some of these reviews. This spot is the business ! It's 100% authentic and has some of the best mafe (peanut butter stew) in the city. The thieb jen is great but I prefer the red one. I don't 100% love the fish they use though.  I also want to clear up some confusion. Sometimes people say thiebu jen and jollof rice is the same but it's not 100% the same. Thiebu Jen literally means ""rice + fish"" . They serve the white Thiebu Jen here which doesn't have tomatoes like jollof rice does. Thiebu Jen or Thiebu ginaar (rice + chicken) are some of my favorites. They also have yassa ginaar which is chicken with caramelized onions. I recommend trying all! The soupe konja is really good as well and is made out of okra, fish, meat, and palm oil. Although I love soupe konja I would recommend that one to someone who has tried other Senegalese dishes before. I'm also curious as to if they are Senegalese or Gambian. I think some of the chefs are from Guinea Conakry .","They take credit card which unusually for west african food spots. If you get the ""419"" lingo, then you'd understand why it's a shocker.RED FLAG #1: Their prices are ""subject to change without notice"", so their menu is pointless. I went in and ordered the $9 plate of ceebu yapp (Rice and chicken) and it turned out to be $10. No biggie but bait and switch, no matter the price = uncool. RED FLAG #2: You cannot see the food as its being served onto your plate/ take-out container and the servers are quick to wrap your food into a dark black bag. I guess they hope you discover any issues by the time you've headed home...RED FLAG #3 aka ULTIMATE RED FLAG. I get home...rice seems to taste decent. Not what I was expecting. I asked them for the equivalent of jollof rice..they said Ceebu. Yet the rice was brown and apparently fried. They gave me a huge half-chicken.

We ordered two tacos de carne asada.  I also ordered an al pastor and my bf got the carnitas.  For a simple order it took thirty minutes of waiting at the bar.  They were very disorganized and should have prioritized better.  Also when I grabbed two drinks it wasn't until later when I was checking up on my to-go order that they said one of the flavors had already been reserved for another customer.  Strangest thing ever so I had to pick another flavor. I didn't like how they lacked urgency and were non-chalant when I asked how much longer we would have to wait for the tacos.  Ok so onto the taste test part.  The carne asada was decently good, but the al pastor could have been more finely cut and juicy.  My bf liked his tacos, but we were annoyed at how long we had to wait for the tacos and the service wasn't up to par.  The prices were decent though for all the tacos I've had in NY.",none,Great food and great service.

After all they advertised UFC 241 all over their windows, but had pop music blasting through the fights, even up until the main card and their tv kept crashing and flickering on and off making it a pretty frustrating watching experience.

One con: they do not make enough patties and they usually sell out within first 2-3 hours of opening hour:( suns they will make more patties one day? Fingers crossed! I just hate rushing here to get few things for lunch and patties are sold out almost every time. Please make more of your delicious patties! The lady behind the counter is always nice. Always a plus.

You can get to H.I.M Ital by hopping off 233rd on the Bronx River Pkwy then drive up from there. But I was already in the area so drove under the L which got me there quick. In a borough where Vegan is hard to find, H.I.M specializes in Grains (pasta and rice), meat substitutes (which I always pass up) and obviously- Vegetables. Looks are deceiving- noticed a small counter with a stool or two up front but seems more for takeout meals than anything else. Maybe because it was so early in the day, most of their hot foods weren't prepared yet- so decided on what was readily available- a bowl of 1/2 Kale & 1/2 Okra which was very nice. Both items were seasoned sensibly and was nice to change my palate a bit. Also noticed all their dry herbs and natural elixirs available. Sybil is so friendly and gave me info on most of the selection as well as detox beverages. In the end, price for my super healthy and hefty 2-Veggie plate plus a few ounces of detox dry Herbs, was just $11. I was all over the spirituality mindset H.I.M provides. If you're in need of a serious health reboot, go for their Caribbean Vegan food. And even if you're not Vegan and you just feel like breaking up the week with some meat free meals, this place celebrates everything Ital (Vegan). Let me just say, H.I.M is armed with a healthy supply of clean eating and nature-focused way of life...and I liked every bit of it. One Love!","One of my favorite spots. They have the best seitan and broccoli. The bean curd is really good as well. They also usually have collard greens, chickpeas, lentils , sautéed mushrooms, veggie burgers, and plenty of smoothie options. They're one of the only places in the Bronx that have fresh herbs for any concoction you can come up with. They have most health supplements like morninga, spirulina, different oils , natural beauty products , and even dvds and books. Definitely a staple in the community. The owners are really cool and knowledgeable as well. Love this spot!",H.I.M Ital Health Food Market

However, the wait in line is well worth it.   While waiting in line, we met many nice old school customers who have been eating here for more than 20 years. That in itself speaks volumes. We look forward to returning there again whenever we are in the neighborhood.","24 hour Puerto Rican fast food in the Bronx!Found this super genuine hole in the wall (literally) Puerto Rican hot spot. This place is on and popping and they have fresh food coming out at all times. Small little spot, gets packed, order to go or stay in and dine on the little bar area (sits like 8 people).The food was good (for fast-food-ish), staff was so nice and accommodating. My only concern is not sure how up to health code this place is. Don't mean to bash it because the ladies that work here really stole my heart they're such nice people. However, I don't want to know what happens behind the scenes since the place is very questionable. Like I said, food is delicious and very very cheap. We ordered enough food for two people and drink for only $10! This included rice, beans, sweet plantains, tostones and passion fruit medium size drink. Everything was delicious. This little spot is right by the hospital so this food is definitely worth it if you feel like eating like home away from home. Open 24 hours. Alcapurrias, mofongo, mondongo, arroz con habichuelas and much more!","Fast food ""Spanish joint"" that's a Cuchifrito for you. I grew up eating this and I loved it. Located this one while in the area and of course the ratings got me in. Food was good -- ordered the typical Moro de gandules con pernil, you could never go wrong with that mix. Kids loved the chicken chunks w/ rice and beans. The lady behind the counter was very attentive and mind you she was busy. It's a small local spot. Oh and I can not forget my all time favorite drink anionjoli it was on point not watery like other places. Prices are a little too good to be true lol -- compared to restaurants which the quality of its food isn't too level.",La Isla Cuchifrito
390,none,none,none,"Cafe Royale is a pleasant diner in this section of the Bronx.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The diner itself is somewhat old fashioned looking in a good way and it feels like you're back in another era.  The menu has all of the diner breakfast and Greek food classics, but I saw on the back of the menu a Mexican specialities section, and so I assumed maybe these would be pretty legit.  I opted for the shrimp quesadilla and enjoyed it.  It wasn't super flavorful but hit the spot for a quick sit down lunch.  The accompanying salsa was probably the only downside.  I was naively expecting some sort of authentic Mexican salsa but it was definitely just mild American salsa that you can buy in a bottle.  The guacamole was also bland.  All in all though I left full and content.  Recommended!  A solid diner.","I've been coming to this diner for over a decade. This place is the perfect diner. The food has always been great except one occasion. My mom ordered an omelette and it was burnt and disgusting and my pancakes were burnt. When the waitress realized my mom didn't eat her food, they did not charge her for her meal. Besides this incident, I really like this place. It's my go to diner. They have delivery, pick up service, and take out. The waitresses are friendly and this place is pretty clean. Most importantly it's very affordable.","The recommended buffet down the street was closed on Mother's Day, so I had a late breakfast at Cafe Royale. They don't take credit cards, but the prices are reasonable enough that it's only an inconvenience, not a real problem.My veggie omelet was big and tasty, the coffee was above average, and the service was prompt and super friendly.",Cafe Royale Restaurant

If you are familiar with this area do you know what is surrounding everything in this area that could possibly bring the wrong crowd into this establishment. I've been here three times the bartenders are OK. I don't ever eat the food when I come but I did eat some wings the last time and they were OK. The hookah can be very harsh and burns out quickly if you seem like you don't know how a hookah should function then they may Scam you out of the first $30 so you can keep refilling it for $20. A hookah refill is $20 in an area like this; that is pretty pricey especially for the type of crowd that this place brings in. It's unfortunate because it's a really cute spot but it's a very small spot so when situations occur, fights really destroy the entire night and it shuts down. Yes I said grown people over 25 years old still coming outside to fight. I went last Saturday and as soon as we refilled two hookahs; not even 60 seconds afterwards an massive fight broke out (knocking over peoples drinks and hookahs) which caused the entire lounge to shut down. You can bet we are pretty peeved to just loose $40 like that. Not to mention being someone with a career and having to worry about being in establishment with a group of people over 25 years old and the cops have to run inside of it and shut it down.","Iight so boom. Came here on a Saturday night with my homegirls because a guy she was talking too said he hosts parties there every Saturday, and it's lit, blah blah blah. After doing our own research we saw Happy Hour was until 8pm. The party was SUPPOSED to start at 4pm (per the flyer) and go until 2am. So we pulled up around 7pm and let me tell you....straight restaurant NO PARTY. And it was relatively empty. But whatever, it's still happy hour and it's still a steakhouse. One thing about me, I'm gone eat. So we decide to indulge in the drinks and order a good meal before the party actually starts. (The restaurant did confirm that the DJ, hookah and party gets started around 9pm. The drinks were GOODT and the food was QUITE tasty. I ordered the ribeye which came with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. My homegirls had the wings, burrito and garlic & olive oil pasta. We all devoured as much as we could and had more for leftovers.Now for the party. Once the DJ came it was on & poppin. The bar was ""cash only"" (if you paid with a card it was a 2 drink minimum) but the vibe was on point. People were dancing, still eating & drinking, smoking hookah and enjoying the ambiance. Crowd was about 25-40 so def grown and sexy vibes. But overall, thumbs up from me.",none,none,Don Pancho's

This place isn't anything special but if you're hungry and looking for somewhere to eat Mexican food on a budget, this is the place for you.

They came topped with plenty of cheese, crema, onions, and of course, tasty green sauce. The inside of the place is a little bit tiny, only a few tables, but it does fit a wheelchair as I mentioned before. They do tons of takeout business - people seemed to be coming quite regularly to pick up food. So many people can't be wrong!",none,Delicious!!!! Tortas y tacos que mas tu quires??

Best kept secret in the Boogie down Bronx....","Honestly felt very half and half about this spot, and to be honest, in the Bronx especially, you can get much better hispanic food and service. What kept them from at least a 3 is how long we ended up waiting for food. I don't mind waiting for food, you can recover if its delicious, but here they try to disguise mistakes and flavors when you can't.To start, the appetizers, alcapurrias were too dry. Mayoketchu was saving the day on these, but not enough so. Tried to wash it down with coffee, but it tasted like water. My porkchops were dry, but I give them compliments on the way the beans were prepared. The carne guisada was almost as if it was prepared by a whole different kitchen considering it was moist, flavorful, and overall delicious.The best dish easily was the asopao de camarones. While I felt the broth could have been more shrimpy vs using the chicken broth used, it was still amazing. If they made everything like they  made this, it would be a better establishment overall.Thank you.","Best Spanish food in the Bronx. First of all clean establishment. As your enter the door they have a hot table to the left of the restaurant, that's if you want to take out or see the food (loads of pork, chicken, rice, beans etc).

As I was eating the gyro I noticed a long piece of hair in my food. Being pregnant, this caused me to feel extremely sick. I called the restaurant and they would not reissue me a refund.

They have a few tables outside, too. Good daily happy hour 5-8p, with $6/7 wines and $4 beers. Pulled pork sliders (slow cooked pork shoulder in house bbq sauce and coleslaw): very tasty. Get them. Inwood burger (8oz angus beef, aged cheddar, smoked bacon, tomato marmalade, chipotle mayo, French fries): also very good. Maybe a little overlooked, but juicy and flavorful nonetheless.

This time with a group of friends for their Sunday brunch.  We arrived and it was a PACKED house so we had to wait to get seated and while the wait was long, we had no problem as we stood by the bar drinking.  Miguel, the owner, came up to me, remembering me from the last Yelp review I left and he thanked me for it and let me know if I needed anything to let me know - his actions proved to me that he takes pride in Tenth Ave and it is shown with how amazing it is in there.Once we were seated, our waiter came to the table with a pitcher of sangria and filled all of our cups and took our orders down.  In the meanwhile, we were all having a good time, dancing and drinking.  I had the Bacon Mac N Cheese for appetizer and it was delicious.  For my entree, I ordered the Chicken and Waffles Sandwich and while I didn't eat MUCH of it because I was full off of the sangria (lol), it did taste great.Our favorite DJ, Werdamouf was there and of course we enjoyed his set.  All in all, Tenth Ave is definitely a great place to be, the ambiance, the people, the atmosphere - Everything is fantastic.  And yes, the air conditioning was working this time - As I said before, I'll be back.","My husband and I are Uptown Brunch Aficionados & we frequent the area quite often when it comes to going to brunch or a night out for some drinks and hookah.We decided to try out Tenth Ave for brunch since it was a new spot and our favorite DJ, DJ Werdamouf, just happened to be performing there the day of.We made reservations for 3 and we arrived a little late, around 3:20, however, we were seated quickly.  It wasn't very crowded and since it was a new location, I didn't really expect there to be many people.  However, the entrance to the location is downstairs and it looks great, two HUGE doors, then you're taken upstairs into the grandiose of it all.  It was a very nice place.The day of brunch, however, the Air Conditioning wasn't working and it just so happened to be an 85+ degree day in NYC - this is the reason why I decided not to give them 5 stars.We ordered the Shrimp Ceviche as an appetizer and in all honesty, it wasn't that good, I ate it because I was hungry but for some reason it tasted more earthy than seafood-y and it lacked flavor even salt could've saved the dish and perhaps a little lime for acidity.We ordered the Chimi Burger as our main meal and they redeemed themselves with it because it was absolutely DELICIOUS!  They surprised us with a little dessert of a flan which tasted very good.We drank Mimosas and Sangria which were just OKAY, they weren't very strong but they did taste good.All in All - I will be back, I'm sure the air conditioning not working was just a one-off thing and I'll just steer away from the shrimp ceviche.  The experience was great and definitely worth it.","Came to tenth ave rooftop with my wife. We ordered one chimi pizza pie which took about 30 mins to order and an extra 30 minutes to be served. When the waitress gave me the check , I then proceeded to give them my apple credit card which has a chip and magnetic swipe bar. Then the waitress asked me for my ID which is normal but then disappeared with my ID which is unheard of. She left with my card and ID for over 30 minutes so I had to look for her all over the lounge but she was nowhere to be found. So naturally, I became worried because she had disappeared for so long with my info. I finally see her pop out of their back room so I asked her where my card and ID were and she replied with "" I'm sorry but I had to make a photocopy of your ID and credit card."" So I then asked for the manager and asked him why the waitress made a copy of my info and he replied with ""we do that to protect you and us from chargebacks"". However , that doesn't protect ME from them committing fraud against me! He then proceeded to say he wouldn't take my apple credit card because there are no numbers on the card. I then gave them another credit card and the same manager asked the waitress to make another photocopy of my information. I highly recommend anyone entering this establishment to only pay in cash as per the management and staff are defrauding customers.Ps. Pizza was cold and soggy and drinks are overpriced and hopefully my identity won't get stolen from Tenth Ave Rooftop Bar!Pss.

And he was like ""well it's happy hour and that would be past the time"".  I just felt it was all a bit pedantic.

409,none,none,none,"My dad and I came to Hometown Dumpling and had a great time! It was surprisingly busy for a weekday lunch, but the owner of the restaurant was greeting everyone and walking around talking to and helping all of the diners along with the waiter. The owner told us that their home recipes were from her grandmother!We started with a generous portion of complimentary japchae noodles with vegetables. Then, we ordered a beef bibimbap and the shrimp dumplings lunch specials. As she and the waiter were bringing out our dishes, the owner asked us whether we were planning on sharing (which we were), and she brought out new dishes for us to use.The bibimbap came as a large bowl of beef with vegetables (bean sprouts, mushrooms, sliced carrots, some sort of spiralized vegetable, beef, fresh cucumbers, cucumber salad, and spinach) and a sunny-side-up egg with gochujang and a bowl of rice for each of us on the side. The dumplings were served with potatoes and a salad and came with soy sauce, and then furthermore, we received cucumber salad, kimchi, pickled cabbage. It was a really nice spread of refreshing food that was tasty but not too heavy--perfect for a hot day! (Next time, I might get the shrimp dumplings steamed rather than fried because the filling is flavorful enough that they probably don't need an oil-fried exterior to be delicious.) The portions were so generous that we wound up taking a bunch of food home, and our waiter packaged everything up separately and neatly for us.We actually came to Hometown Dumpling to scope it out as a potential place to get food to bring to my grandparents, and it definitely passed the test. I would recommend this place for a tasty, (reasonably) healthy meal--just come hungry or be prepared to save leftovers! :)","Fantastic service and food was delicious. Shrimp dumplings are awesome! We were served a great selection of kimchi's and complimentary potato noodle salad. We also ordered the crispy anchovies, which was also very delicious and worth trying. We are definitely coming back for a bibimbab. People next to us ordered the bibimbab and I had extreme food envy. This place is a gem. Highly recommend.","The dumplings were awwwwwesome!! Yeah!

We were asked what we wanted but we needed more time to decide. We were hungry as well. We ordered a pina colada, blue Hawaiian and a strawberry mojito to start. The appearance definitely will fool people. The piña colada had no alcohol and had to ask the waitress two times. The blue Hawaiian was pure sugar and the strawberry mojito...I should of knew just by the color. First, she brought me a regular mojito and I told her I ordered a strawberry. Then she bought me a strawberry and it tasted so watery. I again was not satisfied ...I told her it did not have any alcohol she went back to change it but it still tasted the same. I gave up after that.I was ready to go and that we did. Customer Service was a downfall! I will not return to this restaurant.",This was my first time coming to Roy's Bar NOT the restaurant. This is an a two in one. You have the restaurant entrance and the bar side. The bar is a pretty spacious size. I was brought here by a friend who recommended it for Happy hour. I was not disappointed at all! Great cubetazo special ( Beer bucket). The DJ was AMAZING!!! So BIG shoutout to the DJ! He played so much great music that took me back to the 90s.

Great table service by a really nice kid.,"I have passed here for a couple of years now, read all the good reviews on Yelp and FINALLY decided to try it for myself.I have to say that I'm a little disappointed because my food was just ok.I had a cheeseburger with onions, corn on the cob and 1/2 dozen raw clams (medium size).  Now I loved the onions on the cheeseburger but other than that the burger really didn't have much taste and the bun was too thick for the size of the burger.  The corn on the cob was delicious!  Nice and hot - could have used a little more butter but overall it was good.  The clams were good but the cocktail sauce could have used a little spice to it as it was kind of bland.  I didn't see any hot sauce to add to it and the waiter never came over to ask if I needed anything or to even bring me my check - I had to go inside and pay at the register.The restaurant had a steady stream of customers coming in and for that reason I will try it again just to see if maybe they were having an off day.  Stay tuned for an update.","My first time going there and this is a hidden GEM!My lady and I got fried fish, fried shrimp, and fried clams...

I was skeptical on how the food was because of the location (castle hill) but this was the closest  one and i was starving so we decided to try it out. It's a small humbled spot, very homey and the server was pretty friendly. We ordered almost everything. I'm greedy so I like to have varieties. ""She""(forgot the servers name)was very generous with the amount of food she served us. To my surprise 9 out of the 10 things we ordered was pretty tasty. The BBQ ribs were great very sweet and savory and tender also the fried chicken was so nice and crispy and very moist and flavorful, she had to cook it fresh (excellent) so we  had to wait a few minute but that was ok with me. The greens was good. I usually don't eat greens from certain places or people but I'm glad I tried it here, the mac and cheese was not my favorite and the yams as well wasn't my favorite, the taste was a little wired. For the most part I would recommend anyone to go here at least once or twice.","It's not spectacular, but it is satisfying.I'd personally think the flavors are spot on. I wouldn't mind slightly bigger portions, but maybe that's just me. Sometimes they don't always have what's on the menu.

The amount of grease that leaked from my food was ridiculous SMH. Thankfully I have rubber mats in my car because the grease definitely would have ruined any fabric it came into contact with. There is no reason for that amount of grease to be served with any dish! I need to find another location after that incident.,Nothing really exiting about these wings.

As a pescatarian, I was a bit hesitant to try a restaurant known for poultry, but I found there were a good amount of options. I would recommend the scallops and the fig dessert.

A gem enough to not want people to find out about it (lol jk). My fiancé and I have eaten here multiple times, I get the chicken and broccoli, he gets steak and broccoli, and we share noodles. I have wine, he has beer life is good. The staff is amazing- to make this review super long:The very first time we went we had an awesome food experience. 10/10 (as pictured- reviewed under hunan balcony)Then when we ordered take out in the future they sent us an extra bowl of free noodles. Very kind. On our most recent visit we sat in- *pretty late in the night*, they did not have Pinot Grigio, so my first Chardonnay was on the house AND when we ordered a small pork fried rice to-go, they sent us home with a large and did not charge us, at all. I am so pleased with this place I cannot wait to see them thrive as did my family's old favorite chicken & broccoli spot.*also noteworthy that I was kind** be extra kind to people and they will be extra kind to you. Oh also the wonton soup was awesome!","We always liked Hunan Balcony in person. Their delivery, for whatever reason, sucked. Under the ""new"" management, they have improved the vibe, changed the menu and most definitely raised the prices. The dim sum menu was overpriced, but delicious - at least the two dishes we tried; Spicy chicken in hot chili sauce and pork dumplings in soy. That said, they were out of another dish we had wanted to try - pork soup dumplings.  Odd for a Friday night, prime time. I ordered Hot & Sour soup - it never came. I had to ask multiple times for water and when our main dish, a simple cantonese Happy Family platter arrived, it was served with a tiny bowl of rice for 3 people. I asked for more rice and found later that I was charged for that. Shame on them! The dish itself was meh, at best. There was a single piece of lobster, overcooked and too tough to chew. The broccoli was good, but stalks were tough. The scallops and shrimp were passable and the steak pieces, plentiful and delicious. Overall, a disappointingly mediocre meal from a place we usually enjoy. In fact, I wouldn't be writing this if it weren't for the prices being so much higher and the added charge just to have an adequate amount of rice for the table. Raise your prices and you get no discounts for an off-night. They want my money and I want value for it! Plain and simple.","We've been coming here for a while but always just got the ""American "" classics.  This time I learned they have a special Szechuan menu that I heard the waiter call ""Chinese style"".   For instance, if you ask for Szechuan dumplings and aren't chinese you get the doughy ones withbthe peanut sauce. But if you specify you want it from the Szechuan menu or Chinese style you get the thinner noodle dumplings with a spicy chili sauce (pictured).   Then i got the Szechuan beef from the same menu. So if you go here and like spicy food. Ask for the Szechuan menu.  Really glad we did",Anise
463,none,none,none,"Where should I begin?Tony is the man, the dog, and the real deal. When I was a Bronx Science student from 2006-2010, this is the very guy that initiated me to halal cart food. Back in the day, we had a few mobile vendors around. Kenny's and the Ghetto Truck were the most prominent examples. Then came Ned's on the Goulden Avenue. Those served American fare and coffee. Now Tony's offered that speck of variety we all needed. First, the meat was chopped into fine pieces each morsel filled with flavor. I remembered there was chicken or gyro meat served over I presume basmati rice. That's also served with the complimentary salad. And there was that usual white and hot sauce. That hot sauce was insanely hot and I then had very little tolerance to it. We usually tempered it with BBQ sauce. On Fridays, he gave out a free drink to students. And the guy has a great memory for faces, which puts smiles on his customers. Very chill and laid back. Unfortunately, with the kind of service and food quality, Tony's set such a high bar of expectations that very few carts elsewhere meet it. Even years after I last visited, I'm joyed to see that his cart has a listing and so many people having the same views. It's a worthy trip down memory lane and I thank Tony and his crew, and the other Yelpers for bringing these past memories back into mind.","The cart is right in front of Lehman . Since I was in the area , I decided to grab a combo platter for $5 .  The portion size is on the low end  compared to the $5 carts in Manhattan.

We got a pseudo explanation that the party had and claimed they had reservations (but didn't actually have reservations) and since they'd been seated and ordered drinks there was nothing that could be done. The hostess/waitress was mortified, and checked multiple times with the owner, who didn't care to speak to us. The food is phenomenal, and generally offsets the strange service.

I left it up to the server.  All I know is that by the end I didn't even realize I was in Washington Heights.  It has elevated to a new level, up there.  And that's a good thing.  It's not what I lived in and it's a new day.  Very refreshing as someone who lived through the crack epidemic and knows the history of those streets.  A+","Nice and cozy space up in Washington Heights, near my mom's place so we had a go. Appetizers were excellent, the pate/cheese board for 2 was delicious, pate was homemade and really the standout.Our main courses were the leg of lamb and braised short rib, also both very good, although the lamb wasn't flavored all the way in, and once inside the meat, you had to douse it with the sauce to taste.Good selection of wine, the offered cab/merlot blend was excellent. Overall it's a good place for dinner if you don;t want to go all the way downtown for French food.

We went for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon (2:30p) and luckily the restaurant wasn't busy. They have some great lunch options. We went for a couple of staples, which both came with miso soup and a salad. Chirashi lunch (10 pieces of sashimi over rice): the fish was very fresh... I thoroughly enjoyed it; however, there was very little rice, and I left hungry... Considering how far you have to go to get here, you'd expect the $18 ""lunch deal"" to have more rice. Sushi & sashimi lunch (3 pieces of sushi, 9 of sashimi and 1 California roll): this $19.50 lunch ""deal"" was more filling.

The assigned chef was very engaging with everyone in our party and very attentive to each person's requests. I personally do not eat onions and he inquired whether I was allergic or if I just didn't like them.. which was pretty nice considering the difference does matter.He cooked my food separately as he was using onions in some of the meals. We ordered mahi mahi, salmon, chicken, steak and shrimp that came with rice and vegetables. He cooked them well with a latin twist. Overall it was a great experience, it was my first hibachi experience so I'm glad it went well.I probably will return, and definitely recommend.","This place is a great experience with great food at great prices.  A marvel of integration of Japanese, Asian, and Latino favorites. Only in New York can something like this surface.  The Waiter and Hibachi Chef were comical, engaging, and welcoming.  My wife and I who are City Island residents will come back!","Bland rice. Check. Over cooked Lobster Tail. Check. Well done Filet Mignon. Check. This is not how I remember Ohana. The Nor'easter restricted us to remain closer to home. So instead of going to our first choice in Pelham, we chose Ohana for convenience.  We've had great experiences here in the past hibachi and sushi-wise, but this evenings visit was an entirely different story......'Hibachi Chef, please don't over cook my lobster.' As I sadly look at my plate, I received an over cooked lobster tail...What a waste!Hibachi Chef asks, 'How would you like your Filet Mignon?' 'Medium rare, please.' 'Medium well? 'No, medium rare, please.' As he's cooking and flipping and whatever else he's doing, I'm trying to get his attention without making too much of a fuss, as I know the temp has surpassed medium on my Filet. But then it dawns on me, he only knows one cooking temperature and that's well done. So what I receive on my plate is a well done, tough to chew Filet Mignon. Another waste. Geez!! I hate wasting food. Our young hibachi chef, poor thing, tried to entertain doing the flippity flips and singe flame your eyebrows off, but that's as entertaining as it got. It was a sad display. He even dropped one of his spatulas...no doubt, jokes ensued. Forget the food. Forget the odd brighter than bright, bright lights meant for a doctors office within the main dining area.  My family being who we are, we made the best of an unfavorable birthday dinner and laughed and joked at the situation and had a great time despite the two and a half star food experience.",Ohana

But we had salad to start off with-- it was dressed in a VERY refreshing vinaigrette. I wish I ate more of it!! Then we had our pastas-- rigatoni and pappardelle. So creamy, fresh, al dente. Then lastly, we had chicken parm and salmon with a white vinegar reduction (I think) and oh my goodness, it was delicious!!! Each dish was so filling and seasoned to perfection. We will definitely come back again when we visit the east coast!","Tombolinos sits at the busy corner of Kimball and Yonkers Avenues. Parking seems somewhat limited -- a couple of unmarked spots just in front of the restaurant and metered street parking along Yonkers Ave. Inside, one is welcomed by a newly redecorated dining area with soft lighting, linen-clad tables, a wooden showcase and an alarmingly large TV that is sometimes distracting. We were the first dinner reservation for the evening and had the attention of the hostess, the new waitress and the restaurant manager for most of the evening. Water and bread were provided right away, and we were early enough to enjoy the mid-week happy hour prices which included $5 glasses of wine and reduced prices on appetizers. We selected the Burrata ($10) and two glasses of Cabernet to start. I typically love Burrata-based appetizers, as it's hard to improve upon the gooey, creamy, rich pulled curd cheese. The cheese was served room temp and covered in a sweet balsamic reduction with cracked pepper, but the sliced tomato bed it sat on was hard and icicle cold, clearly just out of the fridge, and perhaps out of season. Sourcing good tomatoes during the winter can be a challenge, but serving them at the same temperature as the cheese requires just a little forethought. Our waitress was a young woman who was new to the restaurant and still learning the menu. She was however, extremely attentive and professional, as were all the staff that served us that evening. We really appreciated their vigilant, yet unobtrusive presence that ensured we didn't lack for anything throughout our dinner. A few small things that were a little disruptive to our experience: the music being piped in overhead was punctuated by loud commercials. The dining area we were in had a giant TV just behind us with sports playing. I would have preferred a more formal setting with fewer distractions.Although we spent some time looking through the menu, two of the specials presented to us caught our attention and we decided to give them a chance. The broiled leg of lamb served with risotto ($27) and an Agnolotti served with a Bolognese sauce ($22). The lamb was near perfect - tender, moist and falling off the bone, and the side of risotto was light, fluffy and mildly creamy. The stuffed pasta was also tasty, finished with a sweet tomato sauce and enhanced by the delicate flavor of truffle oil. Of course, a little Parmesan and cracked pepper on top is nearly irresistible on any dish. There were a few minor mistakes with the menu but these were totally forgivable as the waitress was in training and the kitchen resolved these issues quickly - almost not worth mentioning due to the excellent service.For dessert we were tempted by the tiramisu. This rendition was forward on the coffee flavor, but extremely watery. More so than any other version I've had. Tasty none-the-less, but I would have preferred an execution that was either a little more syrupy or a little drier. It was very nicely plated with a beautiful herringbone-patterned cream/chocolate/raspberry coulis on the side. We enjoyed our dining experience at Tombolinos and would definitely come back again.",Tombolino Ristorante

470,none,none,none,"I don't know about you- but I've had my share of 'Italian' food done wrong. So when I look for an 'Italian' restaurant, that bad boy better be breathing Italian from top to bottom. And not anything else passing off as Italian. So Boom...Agostino's in New Rochelle is it! All I wanted to do after we finished with Mother's Day Brunch at my Mom's- was head home and nurse my cold. A day later, my husband left it up to me to let him know where to celebrate my post-Mother's Day. Agostino's caught my eye really good. Plus supporting- not only an Italian restaurant through and through, but Woman-Owned and Chef also- Anna Catalano was up there on my list. Agostino's is unmistakably one of those, 'don't judge a book by its cover'- because inside, is all the rage (at least for me it was)- it was like Grandma put her stamp on it (but not in a tacky way)! Wall-to-Wall Mirrors, black picture frame cream Wainscoting, eggshell-color walls and that soft lighting (could've been dimmed a bit more). This was a personal recipe for visual charm at that moment. It's a bit out of the way for us, but Italian-owned restaurants in the White Plains area are almost nil. But Agostino's is a different breed of Italian which I wanted- so dining here to having amazing Italian food- was a slam dunk. Picture the vibe: laughter, loud and happy. And if you're into your Appetizer, Entree and Dessert coming out at a mile a minute- Agostino's ain't it. I reserved for 7pm Thursday Dinner and we were out closed to 9:30. This is all about enjoying the evening at a slow and steady pace. Our server was smooth, had a strong Italian accent and tackled a few tables at a time. I'll be honest, I was a bit dazed in the beginning with her almost being a one-woman-show on the floor- but I guess this is just how they flow. Started with a simple and good 'Mozzarella/ Yellow Cherry Tomatoes Bites' with dressed Arugula. FYI: full bar but not sure if there's a Cocktail menu. I stuck with Rosé while hubby had Sangiovese. Broiled Branzino was delicately seasoned with a bit of Garlic and salt and Sautéed Garlic Broccoli made an excellent low-carb dinner. Hubby's Medium Rare Filet Mignon- was done precisely as he requested. But after we placed our order, I broke my Keto regimen and went all in for the Pasta. It crossed my mind and thought I didn't come all this way and not have pasta. I mean...THIS IS an Italian restaurant after all! Sure enough, ordered a side of Linguine with Tomato Sauce. Pasta was divine and Tomato Sauce itself- was out of this world simple. Nothing I hate most than having over seasoned tomato sauce. Food was very tasty with an almost old-school touch. Honestly, Agostino's is a nice blockbuster and drew us in quick.","Excellent service from Angela, delicious food, world class lasagna. Agostino's is a must visit when in New Rochelle ! The owners Anna and Antonio are delightful people and make everything from scratch!","THE BEST ITALIAN THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC. fresh, homemade and spectacularly delicious.

The passion fruit tres leches cake I had was ok. Too milky for my liking but the passion fruit was fresh and the bits of cake that wasn't soggy was actually not too shabby.   What I would say that was downright terrible was their red velvet cupcake . It was kept in a refrigerator which should have been a dead give away to stay away but I persisted . The cake was one of the driest I've ever had and lacked any noteworthy flavors worth speaking about . Easily the worst red velvet I've ever had . Maybe that's not their specialty ? I did speak with the owner who was very hospitable and takes great pride in his business and his products . He also took care of me after business hours which was very kind.

Delivery has always been pretty quick and reliable, and the orders have been correct.

It's not the best Chinese delivery ever - but I'd say it's in the top 25%. The food seems to be cleaner and fresher than your average Chinese spot, and I don't feel as icky after eating it.

And their tacos and tacos doradas are on point as well","I see all the energetic reviews and believe me, I am a big fan of the Estellita Poblana franchise. My family's favourite location is in the Bronx, near Westchester Square (specifically on Tremont which is an important factor as there are two in the area). Imagine our surprise when we found out that one of our fave foodie spots set up a brick and mortar in our 'hood?! We actually had a chance to pop in after dining in the area and took the opportunity to grab one of their take away menus and a card that had their delivery info with a 10% discount off the first order.Well, today we decided to order in so I whipped out that discount card and we started to enter our order. When it came time to enter a discount code, I noticed that the card had no code printed on it. After calling up to inquire, the gentleman I spoke to said that it's the company's fault that there is not code which I found otdd because it wasn't a card from any company like Grubhub, Seamless, etc. The url is the restaurant name so that didn't really make any sense. We just ended up ordering through Grubhub and calling it a day.Deliver was fast. The food came within 30 minutes which is great. Unfortunately, it looks as though they send the food by bike and I'm guessing that our delivery guy bit it enroute because a lot of our food containers were smashed and we ended up having to eat our food on top of the plastic bags in which the containers were carried. One other thing that peeved the hell out of me was that I specified and requested in the app that they please call and not ring the be because we have an infant and two dogs but the guy still rang the bell which sent my dogs into a frenzy and completely frustrated the hell out of my 8 month old daughter with all the loud noise.Grub Rundown:Churros - Best thing I ate. They were still warm so, of course I started to eat them first. They're served with both a caramel and strawberry sauce. Excellent.Shrimp Enchiladas Suizas - My go to dish whenever I visit EPIV. These were lacking so much. They were stuck to the container, they were bland and they were way smaller than the ones I get at the other location.Tamales - I had the Chile & Cheese which tasted good but the Chicken type was kind of dry and bland.Chipotle Chicken Chimichanagas - Hubby ordered this and liked it a lot.Rice & Beans - Both of our dishes came with this as a side dish but the rice was very undercooked and both of our containers were smashed, which caused the beans to ooze out all over the other four containers.Guacamole Side - Not worth it. They charge $4 for a container that holds three tablespoons and again, it's bland.Not ordering from this loc again. Too many things happened in this one delivery for me to give them another shot. I'd rather drive to the northeast Bronx for a better tasting meal. Many items seriously lacked salt and id rather wait an extra ten minutes if that means my food will make it to my home with lost of it in the containers and not plastered all over the bags. They have a lot to work on but they've only just opened, so maybe they'll do better.","This latest iteration of Estrellita Poblana is the Estrellita that we've all known and loved for years. Everything tastes delicious and fresh. The 4 sauces that they bring to the table are exquisite and provide something for everyone, whether you like it mild or want to feel the burn. Service is very kind. I'll of course return to EPTE and am deeply grateful for its existence. Best Mexican for miles!",Estrellita Poblana Taqueria Express

Yeah okay....I took my ass downstairs to the bar and the bartender asked me if I have a table upstairs already. Really? Well, you know this bitch right here can sense the bullshit so I lied. He explained the ""rules"" and I nodded sweetly and paid. Then took my drink upstairs while we were still waiting for our other party (I was here for a birthday). I really hate restaurants that do this type of bs. Just dont have HH and call it a day. I honestly can not stomach the amount of butter put on Hibachi food so I asked him to chill on the butter in advance. Its cute for the ""butter fly"" tricks but not so cute when I'm at home after.

Joe's slices of pizza are huge. I decided to grab a sicilian slice and a chicken bacon ranch slice. The sauce used in the sicilian slice was perfect. Perfectly balanced and not heavy. The dough was fluffy and had a nice crisp to the bottom. The chicken buffalo ranch slice was loaded with toppings. Definitely not skimping like some other pizzerias could be. The combination of the chicken and bacon with the crispy crust and creamy sauce was perfect. I would order it again. Parking may be difficult in this area depending on the time of day.

They have great prices for lunch specials and free delivery.,"I hadn't been here since I last had family over from the Dominican Republic ages ago. So to wrap up our night, wanted to revisit and pick up a few items before heading home. Can't comment on getup as my husband actually went inside. But I can attest- even looking from where we parked, they ditched their signature blues and whites from way back when- and went for a warmer touch. It was a good 20 minute wait for Shrimp Scampi, Mofongo de Camarones, white rice, Tostones and Pink Stew Beans- which wasn't bad at all. According to Mr. Man, service was fine- considering the many reviews complaining about rudeness (and among other things). But that wasn't the case and then again, all he did was an in and out visit to pick up at the counter. He did mention, the lady tending to our order, was very apologetic that Marisco Centro ran out of Mojo for Tostones. What??? What do you mean you ran out of Mojo in a Dominican restaurant? I was so dazed and confused, I wasn't even upset- in fact, I was cracking up. But a couple of things annoyed me: from door-to-door, it's about a 30-minute drive heading up to White Plains from Soundview and its surrounding areas. By the time we got home, Tostones were limp and I sure know our 30-minute drive up, wasn't the cause for soggy fried plantains. Furthermore, Dominicans know Tostones like the back of our hands and these weren't fresh or crispy and seemed old like they've been refried and refried some more. Price? I know Marisco Centro is perhaps the only seafood restaurant on the Castle Hill Ave. strip but damn.......prices were just brutal for the area. And forget about the Tostones- that was another arm and a leg. My 8 medium ""Shrimp Scampi""- $22.95 and my husband's ""Camarofongo"" with garlic sauce and about 5 Shrimp, ran up at the same price also. What??? In Castle Hill? To put it mildly though, our entrees tasted good, White Rice was perfectly done and Pink Stewed Beans- Lord...hold me back. At 3 and a 1/2, food was good, just wished they'd tweak a few things and put more priority on quality. Wouldn't be my regular spot. But for the time being, pick up came in somewhat handy.",Marisco Centro Seafood Restaurant & Fish Market

This time I ordered the jerk wings, with mac & cheese and rasta pasta. I also ordered a soup. They were out of soup and sent me a curry chicken lunch special instead. I agree with the reviews regarding the taste. I would never order rasta pasta from them again. Nor would I order any curry dish. Both lacked seasoning. Completely flavorless. The kitchen is a hit or miss. The prices are reasonable, the portions are mindful, but I need that Caribbean kick I expect when deciding to eat Caribbean food.

This location is our preferred one and we've been going to it for the past 3-4 years. Yesterday, we stopped by during lunch. Being that there were no table pagers available at the kiosks and the line for the cashier was long, we decided to order our meals to-go on the Panera app. Our order wasn't ready on time so we had to wait a couple of  extra minutes, which was fine. It was a busy day. We got our order and headed back home. My boyfriend quickly checked to see if we had everything and thought we did so we left. When we got home, I noticed that instead of giving us a full-sized salad, we had been given a half-sized one and our sides were missing. Frustrated, we drove back to the location, which is about 15 minutes away from us. When my boyfriend went to the Rapid Pick-Up area to explain to staff that part of our order was missing, no one apologized for the mistake. One of the staff members told another ""See! I told you!"" And they had the nerve to smile and laugh about it, like it was a joke. We were given the other half of the salad. I had to ask for our sides because they forgot those as well. Funny thing is that there on the wall is lettering that says if they get your order wrong, you get a free treat. Not only did we not get an apology, we didn't get a free treat either! We also noticed that the food didn't taste as good as it usually does. Some of my lettuce was wilted and turning brown. Also, the pack of chocolate cookies we ordered from the bakery were stale.Sadly, this isn't the first time that a mistake has been made regarding our orders. The past 4-5x that I've asked for salad dressing on the side when we dine-in, someone forgets to pack it on the tray so I have to go to the Rapid Check-Out area to ask for my dressing. We also stopped ordering bakery items when we dine in because the last several times we did order them, no one brought them out and when we mentioned it to the servers, we were told that we have to pick them up at the bakery, which defeats the whole purpose of ordering it while dining in. They used to bring bakery items to the table before so what changed?I'll say this...the servers are always really kind and friendly. We've never had a problem with them. The staff in the Rapid Pick-Up area? Eh. I always feel like I'm being ignored when I approach them to ask for my salad dressings. I highly doubt we'll be returning. At this point, we might as well go to the Panera that is closest to us.",none,Panera Bread
483,none,"I got out of work early for a change and was going to my favorite pizza place and saw that GoGreek was open. I ordered a Gyro and spinach slice. I was very disappointed in both. The gyro barley had any filling. When you cut the meat it should be in slices not chopped up and heated on the flattop to warm up. It only dries out the meat. Suggestion would be to have a squeeze bottle with chicken stock handy. I missed not having the strips of meat, chopped lettuce with raw onion and chopped tomato. My gyro was very lite on filling. The spinach square had very little filling of spinach & feta cheese. It was also very greasy. It would be better to be made in a pie pan fill it and make it high not flatten like road kill.

If someone placed a slice of this on a plate, you wouldn't say, That's S&S! I hope they return to their old recipe or method. Are they baking it a tad too long? Is it reduced fat cream cheese? Has a supplier changed an ingredient without telling them? Baking is a science and one small change can make all the difference. Please find out. And return with the unmistakeable, unique texture that was only at S&S.",S&S Cheesecake
490,none,none,"I've gotten food in person and paid less than I did in uber eats. I ordered this one time on uber eats and this is $50. How?!??  I'm so disappointed. I don't know if they changed their portions or something, but that is not $50 worth of food. So mad right now.","This place has everything you could ask for in terms of what it claims to be, on top of a very friendly staff. I found this on Yelp while in the area, and I was interested in exploring what a simple-looking Brazilian BBQ buffet would look like, and I was not disappointed. When you walk in, all you have to do is grab a plate and start loading food onto your plate from the trays. Before the meats, they have your standard array of salads and sides, including different rice, bean options, as well as things like plantains and yucca fries. This part is already pretty good, and they come with rotating specials (I believe) if that's all you want. I had the fried fish from this section, and it was awesome.After that, you can order BBQ meats one-by-one, which are spinning on the rotisserie the whole time. They have a variety of beef, chicken, and pork options, and I have confident that all of them are excellent after what I got to sample. When I went, I got the pork sausage, (beef) short rib, and flank steak. I'm a huge sausage fan and not too picky, so I liked the sausage a lot. The short rib was pretty incredible, and I recommend eating it all down to the bone. The flank steak was maintained at a nice medium rare, which I thought was really impressive, and the effort certainly pays off. The only thing I might recommend is adding some seasoning yourself (a pinch of salt perhaps) or anything else to your taste. The meats are fresh and prime for customization in my opinion.Though this place can be a trek for many (including myself), I think it's definitely worth the trip if you're looking to explore no frills Brazilian BBQ at your own pace. I wish I arrived more ready to engorge myself with meat, but I guess that means I'll just have to come back.","This place was ok. I was expecting a hole-in-the-wall, local feel, but it had a bright cafe type of vibe.  The place was very clean; bathroom was spotless.  Service was helpful and friendly, too.  I had a variety of items from the buffet.  Highlights include:-the beef short rib, which was very tender and tasty-fish cutlet, which was perfectly cooked and crisp on the outsideI also got a slice of beef flank from the non buffet area, for which they charge $9.95 instead of just $8.95 if I had just stuck to buffet items. It was really tough to chew.  For dessert, I got a slice of pineapple cake.  I found it mediocre. It was not sweet enough and was missing a pop of flavor. This is an ok place if you're in the area and if you stick to buffet items.",none,Paladar Brazilian BBQ
491,none,none,none,"Dear Mama definitely has less competition for 'Trendy Coffee Shops' in East Harlem than it would in the East Village, but it certainly doesn't falter; Dear Mama is a complete hidden gem and would beat out any alternative spot in a heartbeat. The cafe has your standard array of coffee and espresso drinks, but shines in its specialty and seasonal drinks that it swaps out every few months. I tried a summer matcha beverage -- it was matcha, a touch of honey, and a shot of espresso. The drink was exceptionally well balanced between the earthiness of the matcha, the acidity of the espresso, and just the right amount of honey sweetness. Although I was heading to a brunch, I couldn't avoid trying the ""Sir Muffington"" -- an earl gray carrot cake muffin with chocolate chips, orange marmalade, and a crumble topping. The muffin was potentially the best I'd ever had -- an extremely moist carrot-forward muffin was exceptionally accented by a taste of earl grey and sweetened by chocolate chunks. The muffin was extremely unique and very fresh; I can't wait to head back to try whatever Fall varietals they throw our way.Dear Mama has great sitting spots in the form of one large family-style table, several two-tops, as well as some couches and more comfortable seating towards the back of the cafe. On the weekend morning that we stopped by, there was light chatter, but not too much to be prohibitive if you wanted to make it a work place. Dear Mama is a place that you'd definitely want to become a 'regular' at, and with muffins as good as theirs, it certainly should become a habit for any person living even remotely in the area.","I enjoy this spot. A coffee shop with food, ample space and outlets. The meals are pretty expensive for a coffee shop. Perfect place for working in Harlem. They also have dope art on the walls. It's colorful and neon and for sale. It's also a great bar alternative. They have happy hour from 3-7 with mimosas, wine and beer for five bucks. Strong recommend.","I walked over from work for a coffee break following a coworkers recommendation and am so glad I did! This coffee shop is very nice and serves up a ton of different sandwiches, pastries, and espresso drinks, and the aesthetic is pretty trendy too. I came around 1:30 on a Wednesday afternoon and there was no line, and plenty of open seating. Dear Mama seems like a solid place to get some work done for that reason, though the music was distractingly loud for my taste. I ordered an iced oat milk latte and split a French toast croissant with my friend. The latte was really good and exactly the mid afternoon boost I needed. I'm glad my friend and I split the croissant because those suckers are big! It was both filled and topped with a streusel mixture and was super yummy. The baristas here were so nice and patient, and I loved their shirts, which say ""you are so appreciated"" on the back.  So nice! I appreciate YOU baristas!!I'll definitely be back to Dear Mama for future coffee breaks. There really aren't many places like this in East Harlem so it's a nice change in pace (but let's not mistake gentrification when it happens people!!)",Dear Mama Coffee
492,none,none,none,"I work nearby so i'm always trying to find diverse food options. Enter SUROSS. I am a loyal and forever customer for the following reasons:Sriracha fried rice is a spicy but delicious and filling rice dish that keeps well for a second meal later in the day. There's plenty of rice for that. I also love that the protein comes separately on top bc the textures of the protein dont get lost in the fried rice. Mussaman curry here is BOMB AF. Delicious on blustery days and packed with chunky potatoes, onions, peanuts, and chicken. I got mine ""medium"" and it was perfect. Not too boring, not butthole numbingly spicy.    Last but not least Khao Man Kai. So fried food is one thing and curry is another, but my favorite here is this healthy, homey dish. Basically its steamed ginger chicken served with grated ginger soy sauce and a clear broth than kicked my cold to the curb. This is my new go-to order for this winter. Runners-up to this list include:Spicy basil udon. Be careful it's really spicy!! But also a healthy veggie option! I like to get it with the crispy pork  Red curry with chicken. I ordered it for a friend one time and he basically licked the containers. Thai iced tea. Dense and deep flavor. So good. Also the seating is minimal but cute and the staff are so nice!Wish they were open for breakfast so I could get something to go rn",Great place to come to in the Washington heights neighborhood if you're looking for a quick bite to eat and are craving some Thai food.My friend and I had some pork chop and the pad Thai. The pad Thai was well seasoned and tart like it's supposed to be. We had ours with chicken. The bean sprouts added a nice crisp and contrast from the soft noodles. The pork chop was tender and flavorful. Def coming back to try the other dishes.The Thai tea was also made the way I like it. Yummy and refreshingly not too sweet.I did wish the dishes were spicier like Thai spicy but I understand they serve a diverse population and not everyone can handle the spice.,"This is not the review I've wanted to write. Lately, I've set a goal of trying a place more than once before writing a review, this way I can have a varied sample from which to write and cannot be accused of biased writing based off one experience. Which seems to permeate Yelp a lot lately.I've been to Suross 3x now and each has been more disappointing than the last, culminating with today. I ordered the suross udon lunch special. Which their menu describes as a ""popular"" dish containing ""stir fried udon, garlic, radish, bean sprouts and scallion with sesame brown sauce.""Sounds yummy doesn't it? Worth the walk and truly excited for the delicious lunch I was about to enjoy, I got back to my desk ready to eat and let me tell you, I ate that lunch out of spite. I ate because I had no other choices and because I paid for it. It was so sad looking, so flavorless and lacking.There was no sesame brown sauce, there was no garlic (and garlic flavor is not hard to add I think we all know), there were a ton of bean sprouts and a nice piece of chicken but no scallions. Everything looked like it was just thrown into my container carelessly without a thought about the enjoyment of eating & taste. Now, I'm left in a funk because I love the rich flavors of Thai food and their food is lacking severely in that regard. Every single time I've come here the food has been bland. What a waste of my lunch money and lunch hour.I'd recommend KinKhao Thai on 2200 Amsterdam Ave. for better flavor- note it has no where to enjoy indoors and its more of a pickup place. Suross has been open for quite some time now to work out the kinks and I keep expecting to be wowed the next time I go. It hasn't happened yet and I don't think it will.",SUROSS Thai Bistro

I thought they had pretty good selection of food too. Not too much, not too less. I hate when they have 200 things on the menu. It's way too much to look through.

I came for open mic night which is exquisite and worth coming to. However, I asked for a simple latte to go near the end of the event. There was still 40 min left but I wanted to sip and take the rest home. I've had this latte in the past and had it made to go and it was divine. However, this time it was delivered 10 minutes later and the cup was only half full. I asked why because if I'm paying $4 for a latte, I at least want the cup to be full. Again, this was not a problem in the past. The bartender must've been new, which is fine, but when I asked about why my cup wasn't full, she said that's the small size. She said she could add more milk. I don't know why the small size is put into a large to-go cup. The event was nearly over and there was no reason for me to have this latte anymore so I decided to close out the check. This is the part that really surprised me. The woman talks to a co-worker about my actions in front of me (Nevermind the customer always being right policy), tells him that she made the latte the correct size, and stormed off. She could've asked what size I wanted before making the latte, or at least not given me half a cup. When she gave my my card back after paying for the rest of the bill, she slammed it down so hard and scoffed away. All of this being said, the lattes here are great. Just make sure you clarify you want the cup full. UPDATE- 2 months later. I came back to show a friend how great the lattes are. Unfortunately that same worker who talked badly about me right in front of me was still behind the bar so we ran out immediately.","I love the atmosphere and most of the staff.

496,none,none,none,"You'd never know it from the location but this is spot on Greek food. Reminded me of my vacation there...especially the fresh food. Fresh garlic! Fresh red tomatoes! Soft and crumbly feta! Food is the highlight here. But it's also clean and casual. Water and pita with marinated olives were brought to the table as I was seated. I could have eaten all the olives but I had to resist. The chicken souvlaki platter was huge! It comes with a ton of delicious juicy chicken, rice or fries, pita and tzatziki (so yummy), and a Greek salad with a perfect slab of feta cheese. It is not tomato season but the tomatoes on the salad were so red and perfect, just like in Greece. The menu can be overwhelming because there's everything Greek you can imagine - Mediterranean overload in the best way possible. Waited a bit to get my check, but was nice not to be rushed through a mid afternoon lunch. Will be back to try a comfort food like moussaka next.",This is my first time trying this place and I am blown away!

My husband and I ordered there twice before finding something we loved. Always delivery (which was right on time). The first time, I got general tso's chicken. I found it sort of bland and soggy.

Which I thought was a little weird, since that's such like a basic thing, how amazing could it be?So third times a charm, we got the chicken and broccoli and decided to try the scallion pancake rolled with beef 'cause the picture on yelp looked good. Turns out that was the right call. The broccoli was perfectly cooked, still had a crunch to it. The chicken too was great, not soggy, not springy like I've had at other Chinese restaurants. And the scallion pancake was flakey, and the beef delicious (though I didn't care for the sauce it came with -- would have been better with a hoisin). That's now our order at Moon Star.

I will be back again when I come to the Bronx.,I decided to link up here with an ex coworker on a Thursday after work.....I have a friend who works close by and she raves about this place....So upon arriving I learned this place was simply a newer cleaner taqueria....nothing more ......now don't get me wrong I appreciate the clean part.....but this is not the Mexican restaurant you come to have a beer or sip sangria or anything....it is basically fast food....I will say the customer service was great.....the cashier even charged my phone and had no issue with  me waiting for my 30 min. Late friend.....the food was on point and I see how my friend orders from here all the time.....oh....and the portions are big......This seems to be the go to spot for people who work in the same area......the place was packed with officers from the local precinct that is directly across the street......I will not be going back for a night out.....however I will be ordering lunch from there and will even pick up some take out.,Cinco De Mayo

Now this morning 6/22 I call again and I'm still on bed rest with paper work and all to prove it and some other guy tells me no after I explained why I couldn't come down and that I would even tip the young man who comes up. Now let me remind you that yesterday the nicer guy said let me ask first and then got a yes to do so, now this morning this guy just tells me straight up no I have to walk down 5 flights with a injured foot to get the food.

509,none,none,none,This is my first time here and the food is amazing. A wonderful Christian Family Oriented restaurant. What a pleasant atmosphere. Did I meant the foods the bomb!!!!,I have been looking forward to trying this place for some time.  I went in for lunch.  I ordered the fried whiting with coard greens.  The person that took my order was personable and pleasant.  I waited about 10 minutes for my food because the fish is made to order.  The person that handed me my food looked like she would rather be somewhere else.  I asked for hot sauce and she just pointed to it at the counter.  Not pleasant at all. (Minus 1 star.)  The fish was nice and crispy.  There were some small bones but overall it was good.  It was breaded with cornmeal.  Not overly seasoned which was nice.  The collard greens were SALTY.  I took one bite and had to wash them down with water.  The flavor wasn't bad but I've had better.  I also got a corner piece of cornbread which was dry and overcooked. (Minus 1 star).It was worth the try.  I may try it again in the future but no rush.,"Tried out this place because my daughter recommended it.  Food was great.  I had the Parmesan Wingettes with collard Greens, cabbage and corn bread for a little over $12.  The portions are generous, wings were juicy and large.  Similar to BBQ wings, but not sure why called Parmesan wingettes.  I didn't taste any Parmesan but they were still great.  Corn Bread was moist and collards greens and cabbage were seasoned just right.  I would have loved some smoked ham to bring those collards to the next level but I understand a lot of people aren't into pork.  It's a great spot to check out if your in Yonkers, near Empire City Casino or Cross County shopping center and your in the mood for a plate of home cooked COMFORT FOOD.",BK Soul Food and Catering
510,none,none,none,"This is the best Mexican restaurant I know.  Their take on standards are not always traditional, but their flavors are wonderful. I had the Bulgogi beef taco(!) and the shredded pork taco, along with their Brussel sprouts salad.  There was enough there to feed at least two people.  And I can't describe the flavors but I loved every bite.  We went with friends who live nearby, and they eat there every week.  They love the Margaritas, which I don't, but the available beers offered a decent selection.  My wife loved the white sangria, and I liked the taste I had.  Advice: since most of the tables are high-tops, take it easy on the margaritas.","My lady and I were passing and noticed a few people dining, sitting outdoors. We gave it a shot!. We both ordered appetizers; tacos were tasty. and Were blown away by the Brussel Sprout Salad. It is very popular and I see why.","Great food, the bang bang tacos are a must try!

512,none,none,none,"I think this is the best Mexican restaurant I've been to. I'm vegetarian, so I can't speak for the meat, but all my omnivorous friends have given great reviews. My favorites are the flor de calabaza taco, flor de calabaza quesadilla (great hand made tortilla!) and the chiles rellenos. The decor is kitschy in a charming way. They seem to change it once a month to match the season. The servers are also charming, and their cheery demeanors fit well with the decor. The prices are great too. Generally, paying $10-$15 here on food will get your stomach full and give you leftovers for tomorrow. They haven't been very consistent in their liquor license, but when they do have drinks the prices are normal NYC prices and will dominate your bill.","2 stars for Fast delivery. Bland Bland Bland   iOrder. Guacamole n chips, definitely used to be better, mediocre guac is better. chicken (dark meat) tacos not grill chicken that's for 4$ more.. just bland. Hard ground beef taco.... yuck to greasy shell hiding underneath the lettuce and beef not looking freshly cooked AND they literally compressed it in one of those hot dog trays.... with the lettuce and tomato covering the taco, Hard taco underneath??  Idk what happened to this place.  They was good when I ordered from then when they was in 149th street","DELIVERY REVIEW !!!  Excellent !! I been ordering from this place since I moved to NYC. Food has never been a disappointment, but last time I ordered chorizo flautas and the chorizo was terrible. Before it was great!

Thank you to the gentlemen who seated us, the young man who kept our water glasses full, and our table clean.","Dined here for the first time. Cute spot. It seemed some what ""clicky"" to me. If the owner knew you, which it seemed to be most, people coming in, she was nice. She walked past my table at least 20 times, never once did she acknowledge us, ask how everything was. Food was good. Service was not good. No one checked on us. No one said, ""hey your good would be out shortly"". Food took way to long. My scallop meal was bland. No flavor. The scallops were good, soft, cooked well. But the menu said with risotto. That was clearly rice.Not sure if I would try them again. Could have been an off night?? They did get busy after we came in.","This place can easily be a 5 star joint but from what I experienced tonight I'm going to keep it at 3 stars. Caffe Regatta is not a big restaurant it's rather cozy with a small bar and a couple of TV's above it. The food was very good but the service was totally lacking. With 3 waiters and the owner hustling around plus a girl at the front I would have expected better. Slower that the last shit I took to be honest.Our menus we given to us when we sat down and a little while later the waiter takes our drink order. The drink arrives at the table and then at least 15 minutes pass until he takes our order. That's where it went down hill. It took FOREVER for our appetizer and main courses to come. At least come and check on us in between. The two hardest working people were the owner and the bus boy.I might give them another try as like I said, the food was very good. We shall see.",Caffe Regatta
514,none,none,none,"A Mexican bar and restaurant with a delicious and quite extensive food menu. They're also serious about their food presentation and their cocktails. Most importantly, they're serious about mezcal. They don't have a menu for the mezcal selection, you only have to talk to the bartender/owner Nestor who can help you with what you like. Can't go wrong with any order really. They're not very traditionally Mexican but they sure are very very delicious. The cocas are delicious and ceviches too. And the escargot. Let's support this small business. We need more of these places in New York City.","I have to say the drinks were great! Service, was less than subpar. Our tan was $260 for 3 ppl and the waitress was nothing but rude and short. She seemed annoyed with every question and request. We were the only clients in there for about 1 hr and still we had to wave her down for all requests. Food portions are very small as expected for tapas but not your typical Mexican restaurant, literally only 1 type of tacos- fish. Which were my favorite. Drinks are great and that's the only thing I would come back for. I suggest sitting at the bar, maybe that would receive more timely service.","This place is a hidden gem! If you're not looking, you could pass this little nook and miss out on a great food experience, as the outdoor display isn't noteworthy. While the spot is tiny, there's tons of cultural charm lining the walls and there's an outdoor space in the back, although it wasn't open when I went.This is a tapas spot, so don't look to be full after ordering an ""entree"" but be prepared for magic in your mouth. I tried to alter an item on the menu, to which I was promptly told no because it would change the flavor, and I'm so happy I trusted the receipe design of each plate. I had the guacamole and chips for an appetizer, and the Chabela for my entree and every item I tasted was clearly made with love. Everything was so well seasoned! If I wasn't a believer in ""good things take time,"" I might have been a little annoyed at how long my food took to get to the table. But the food was so good though that it was worth the wait. If you are in a rush, this is not your place. But if you are looking for a meal your palate will undoubtedly enjoy, you'll find it here.",El Kallejon
515,none,none,none,"There's one primary reason that this place deserves five stars. And I'm pretty damn picky. It's because the food is consistently good--like having your mom cook food for you the way you like all the time. The owner comes from a family of cooks and has been cooking her entire life, and she's just an amazingly sweet and lovely woman. If that's not enough for you to have a host that cooks consistently well and greet you with a smile consistently then I don't know what the heck you're looking for when you go out to eat. From my perspective there are only two reasons to go out to eat: 1) to get food that you normally can't get at home.2) to be waited on and served in such a way that you want to return to a place.The Barbecue Pit is far, far more than just barbecue. From their samosas, to their fried chicken, to their lentil soup, and Mediterranean and Indian fare, there's nothing this amazing woman can't cook. If you're looking for a place you can trust that you're going to be well received and well fed for a very fair price, don't just do take out, come here and sit in. It's cozy, it's friendly, and it's delicious. How do I know all this? Because I think I've eaten here about 40+ times. I live in New York City, I go out to eat all the time, but there are some places that you just call home and go to when you need a consistently delicious meal.","Exceptional food, great atmosphere, definitely will be back. Highly recommended to anyone in the area, and if you aren't in the area definitely worth the trip. 100% will be back","I was browsing Yelp for a different BBQ spot in the Bronx and found the Barbecue Pit.  This past weekend, my girlfriend and I decided to check the place out and we were so glad we did.  I can't believe this place has been in the Bronx for 19 years and I've never had the pleasure of dining here.  First off, Rani (the owner) was great.  She came to our table and spoke to us and was very attentive.  My girlfriend and I both had the chicken and rib combo.  the meat was fantastic.  You can tell that the BBQ sauce was house made.  Also, the mac and cheese was good, but what really sold me was that you can taste the freshness.  The portions were decent.  We ended up taking a doggy bag home along with a slice of Key Lime Pie.  Best Key Lime Pie outside of Key West as far as I'm concerned.  Instant fan.  Can't wait to go back for more.",The Barbecue Pit
516,This is one of my favorite neighborhood restaurant. It is BYOB! The liquor store is nearby. Their service is exceptional. Its family run. Every time i come here i try something different from their menu and i am never disappointed!  I love their salad & the grilled octopus is a must try!,none,none,none,"Small cozy restaurant in the Bronx that serves some solid food.  First off, it is sometimes hard to find parking around especially with the construction going on.  We finally got parking and made our way in. The restaurant only has a handful of tables but it wasn't packed for lunch so we had plenty of room. We started with the spinakopita and the zucchini croquettes.  I didnt know zucchini croquettes were a greek thing but I went with it. They are served with tzatziki and were pretty good. They had a crunchy exterior and didn't taste oily even though they were fried. The spinakopita was very think and looked like it wasn't as fresh as I would expect. I know this because the dough wasn't flaky or crisp. The flavor was actually pretty good though so not the worse thing in the world.For lunch I ordered the halloumi salad since I am half cypriot and love that halloumi is popping up everywhere now. For those who dont know halloumi is a cypriot cheese that is grilled or sauteed and holds together well. It is a little salty and has a high melting point so it stays together well. The acidic dressing complimented the cheese and the freshness of the greens brought it all together.It was a quick lunch and I enjoyed it. The service was prompt with no frills. This greek food isn't stuff you would call your grandma raving about but it is solid. I like what they are doing plus they have wifi which is always a positive. Good job Greek Express!","Can I just say that I'm so happy and full right now? I became anxious when hubbs called to say he was on his way home and would pick up some take away from our neighborhood Greek restaurant. I was nervous because I just don't like the service or the food from the restaurant closest to our home but I was prepared to order something from them because I know he had a rough day and I just wanted him to be able to get home as soon as possible and decompress from all the worries he experienced today. While looking for the menu on Yelp, I searched Greek...and low and behold, Greek Express came up on my search list and the rating looked promising. Even better, they're located near our home as well. I quickly called hubbs and gave him the address as well as my order.First off, let me say that they must prepare foods with lightening speed because hubby got home with record timing. The food was warm, fresh and tasted oh, so good. I think we've found a new spot for our Meditteranean fix and any place that has halloumi has my heart!The Grub Rundown:Gyro Platter - ample gyro meat, choice of rice or fries and PLENTY of warm pita. Hubbs ordered this and, of course, I had a couple of bites for prosperity *wink wink*Halloumi - four grilled pieces of halloumi cheese, served with greens and lemon wedges. I liked this a lot but I'm sure it tastes way better if eaten in the restaurant, straight from the kitchen.Hummus - the color threw me off but the flavor is completely on point. They gave us so much warm pita for everything. We really wanted for nothing.Octopus - I took a chance ordering the octopus for take out from a place I've never eaten but after all of the rave reviews, I had to try it out. I'm glad I did. It was tender, well-seasoned and cooked well.Kourambiedes (Butter Almond Cookies) - very tasty and I'm glad I compromised the calories to try this dessert.I've already confirmed with hubby that this is our new Greek spot, no pun intended (well, maybe a l'il :D).",Greek Express

I got red curry with beef, which included an appetizer (I chose gyoza) and a salad, plus I added in a Thai Green Tea. I've had a bunch of Thai food in NYC, but this place definitely stands out as one of the best! The red curry was super flavorful and thick with a generous helping of vegetables and beef. Combined with the gyoza and salad, I was absolutely stuffed. Green tea was very sweet but delicious and hit the spot for what I was looking for (I wanted to try something different from a Thai Iced Tea).The place is super small (only two chairs for sitting), so take out is best. Will definitely drop by again when I'm in the area!","Love this place. Offers dishes you don't typically see at most Thai restaurants. The Seafood Hor Mhok is my favorite. Tons of big chunks of assorted fresh seafood and egg cooked with curry paste. Delicious. Also love the Nua Ya Nam Tok beef salad with lime and mint - so flavorful, and I could drink the dressing with a straw. Real crab meat fried rice is loaded with big chunks of sweet crab and egg. Only things I don't like are the green curry and bubble tea - too sweet for me. Tiny storefront with take-out only, though there are a couple of cramped barstool spots under a narrow counter, but I think that's mostly for customers waiting to pick up their orders.","Pretty decent Thai on the UES.  I have only gotten delivery but the food is solid and the prices are very reasonable - most entrees are around $10-14 MAX.  1. Pad Thai - Solid take on a classic2. Massaman curry - Nice, creamy, and savory with tender chicken, onions, carrots, and potatoes.  It's spicy (well for me - your mileage may vary) but not overwhelmingly so.  Get a side of sticky rice vs Jasmine.  It's the perfect comfort food.3.  Kaprow: They give you an option of chicken, beef, or pork, which is nice since most places are pork only.  I still went with the pork and it was solid.  Not the best ever as it is only meat but still pretty good mixed with rice.  I would definitely add a fried egg on top for $2 as the dish itself is only $10.4. Ocean Khao Soi: Interesting take on the traditional chicken Khao Soi as they add a salmon fillet.  The broth is savory and creamy - very solid and the egg noodles are nice and chewy.  The only thing missing is the crunch from the crispy noodles that I had at OBao and Mi Noodle.5. Crabmeat fried rice: Pretty solid version with real lump crabmeat.  The only thing is that it is quite literally just rice, some egg, and crab so I would ask for extra scallion and onions.A good option for Thai delivery/takeout!",Chu-Ros Thai

524,none,none,none,"The Holy Grail. The pride and joy of the Bronx. Michelin star pending. One day, when you and your bros aren't too busy absolutely crushing it, it is imperative you assemble the squad and ride out to Merryland. You pay $8, cash, not for a meal - but for a one way ticket into pure ecstasy. I'm talking ALL the greasy Chinese food that your heart desires. Not to mention the mouth-watering donuts, cake and surprisedly fresh fruit. Dining at this establishment is an experience that truly can't be beaten. So please, before you enter Saturday night hyper drive, pad your stomach lining with a few meals at Merryland. God speed.","Not a bad place if you eat a lot, it was worth it for me because I love dumplings, sweet and sour chicken and yellow rice. But The desert is ass don't go for that. 9.75 for that. The spoons seems a bit dirty, I dint want to trust the cups they offered. Honestly not Horrible, Not Perfect but decent. 3.5 almost 4.","I was originally attracted to this buffet because of their $4 take out deal. At their 149th street location, they had a variety of food and for just $4 you could buy as much food that you could fit in the plastic container plus you got a free can of soda. Great lunch deal if you ask me.I was in the Fordham area today with my sister, since we were super hungry, decided to give this location a try. As a lot of the other reviewers say, the tables here are way too close to each other. Not only that, but the hostess purposely gives you a table right next to other people even though there are empty group of tables on the other side. The location itself is actually quite small too. Don't get me wrong, they have a wide selection of food and even dessert. My sister and I paid $18.50 to dine in. I guess you get what you pay for. You pay upon entering if you're eating there and then you can have as much food as you want for one hour. Plus as much soft drinks (soda) as you want as well. Now if you're buying food to take out you get all the food then you pay. They have about three different size containers with different prices. The $4 deal is also offered here.  I'm a huge fan of their food selections - ranging from shrimp, veggie fried rice, fried chicken, plátanos maduros to even dessert!!! But I think I'll probably stick to the Hub location, great concept but location is too small for me.",Merryland buffet

Everything I was hoping to try in this neighborhood was closed and my grumbling stomach could wait no longer so here I was ordering a staple. Baked chicken with yucca to go. The food sits out on a steam table and the chicken is closed inside of what looks like a giant oven.  The chicken here is a 2.5 out of 5. The breast piece is dry and the thigh is okay, but I feel like once you peel off the skin there isn't much flavor in the meat. Now the yucca, it was completely flavorless and also dry, with no onions or anything else to save it from the trash. I tried dousing it with the mojito but I my taste buds were still not satisfied. With all the amazing places to have this staple in the Bronx, I doubt I will be returning here.Happy Yelping!",Had their lunch special beef stew ... it was good ... rice and beans were equally delish... the sweet plantains were firm and cooked perfect .... large portions took half home ....,El Nuevo Pollo Sabroso

Just as we thought, we had to park little bit farther than anticipated.When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by the hostess and given a table. The staff was very nice and the decor is very cool, with the walls covered in paintings of different Latin celebs and cultural influencers. I love me a Frieda painting any day. The dining area is kept dimly lit so this would be a nice date night location, for sure.We all shared a bunch of items including surf and turf montaditos, empanadas, ceviche and churrasco with yucca frites.

My glass was never empty and waiter stopped by numerous times to make sure we were good. The food was excellent. And the decor in this place is fresh and really pretty. We don't normally order any starters unless something screams out at us, figuring we'll share main dishes instead. We got the cochinita pibil tacos along with the carnitas tacos, 4 altogether being that one order of tacos only brings 2. Both tacos consisted of pork meat. Both just deliciously smothered in some crazy tasty sauce. We loved them but wished we had more. Next came the chicken enchiladas Suizas style. You can chose different sauces.  Our enchiladas were very good. Succulent white meat only with just the right amount of salsa verde on the outside but maybe 2 slivers of the cheese that is supposed to go with it. And to add to that awful surprise, we only had 2 enchiladas on our plate.  Everywhere I've been to and ordered tacos or enchiladas, I've been served 3 of each. 3 tacos, 3 enchiladas etc. This place however only served 2 of each. We would be ok with that only when it was time to pay our bill, we noticed a $2 charge for ordering the Suizas style enchiladas because apparently much like guac, cheese is extra. Another thing that really turned us off was the amount of noise at this particular restaurant. Wow!  Patrons at the bar screaming over loud music. We couldn't hold a conversation so we texted each other instead. Quite romantic for our 2nd wedding anniversary dinner.

May be I did not like this particular Indian food. Customer service isn't that great,"As I came off of the BX39 bus, I had an itching for the usual Shami kabob that I get from this establishment.  As I walked in and glanced at the other items on the buffet, my mind wandered to the possibility of trying something new. I am an avid fan of all Pakistani, Indian, and Bangladeshi dishes, so trying a different selection on the Shahi menu would not, I figured, be too much of a surprise.   I was greeted not only by the friendly and patient staff there, but also the manager of the restaurant. He was so willing to explain each dish to me in such a warm and friendly manner. I explained that I usually get the Shami kabob and he suggested that I try some of their more popular dishes. I told him that I am familiar with many Pakistani dishes and he said that he had something in mind for me. He brought out some of the best tasting Papadoms, a crispy fried wafer with various vegetables, and I was very impressed. I bought their Chicken Bihari Kabab, Chicken Jalfrezi, and plain Naan. For dessert, I got the Kheer. Boy, did I make the right decision going to this place. Everything was seasoned just right. The flavors are so complex yet very satisfying. Although you would want to eat more and gorge yourself because of the flavor, a little goes a long way. Yummy!As New Yorkers, I think that we take for granted the vast selection of eateries we have in the city. We visit these restaurants outrageous expectations from our local ""mom and pop"" type of business without thinking about the level of care and pride people from various cultures want t o display.

I have received nothing but great service here and look forward to going back, often.","Staff is rude and unattentive. If you are not their kind, you won't even get acknowledged.

But the space was now bigger. The wall facing the street had been replaced with an open space, and then a large dining room. What was once a three table operation had 20, along with a dartboard and a dancefloor.I imagine this was my subconscious confirming what I'd tell any person that asked - this place makes a mean torta. You don't have to come all the way up here to get a good Mexican sandwich, but the odds of the combination of stringy cheese, beans, tomato, lettuce and chorizo coming out right are certainly higher in this area. Under a soccer match, and protected by The Virgin of Guadalupe, I waited for and the ate my sandwich.I wish there were proper agua frescas (only in the summer, I was told) or even the Jarrito's soda water (instead of just flavors) but these are minor complaints.

Excellent sauce combined with the octopus and potato; highly recommended.The plantains are sweet yet crispy, with a bit of saltiness from the sprinkle of cheese. Definitely a good side for sharing.Finally, the Pork Chaufa was a disappointment. It's heavy with fat and incredibly salty, and has large chunks of pork fat with skin attached. These are too large to eat in one bite and the bowl is not conducive to cutting with a knife, so the meat on these is a little hard to get off easily.

Simple, with sherry vinegar and sea salt. Large. Perfectly cooked. Lemon wedge to brighten it against the olive oil. Excellent. Roasted pork.  Rolled  around vegetables. Also excellent. Service was efficient. Clean, fast, friendly, reasonable prices, excellent food, broad menu. Outstanding for lunch. God smiled on me to let me find it.

Our waiter was extremely nice, she had a lot of class, and checked on us frequently even though we probably dying for no more than 10 minutes. We gave her A really nice tip and left. I'm glad this restaurant hasn't changed much in my opinion. I will return on my next visit.",I've been to about 25 diff IHOP's across America and this one is by far the best. I gotta say the key to this place's success is the management. I've been coming here for about 15+ years since I was in high school and this place has been great since. Really friendly staff. Food is consistently on point. Very smooth operation. The place is packed the majority of the time. You can find people waiting in the hallways and even outside. But the speed and efficiency makes the wait not feel pushing at all. Lots of faves on the menu. I'm sure everyone has been to an IHOP. But the simple things that make this place great when they get it wrong it can throw you off. I never have to worry about those things here. even when ordering takeout. I can be assured when I get home everything is exactly as I wanted. Love love love this place. Especially for the candy lol. My daughters can't get enough.,IHOP in my humble opposition makes the best omelettes hands down!

We were hungry and wanted some Chinese food for take out. Without cash, we decided to find a place on Seamlessweb. The only Chinese place that delivers to our apartment on Seamless was China Wok. 4* reviews there...(this is why folks, always check with YELP before trusting reviews on SEAMLESS) so I'm like ok...well can't be that bad. We were hungry so forgot to check yelp. We ordered 2 dishes and a qrt of home made ice tea. Delivery took about 35 minutes. Ok so far so good. The horror begins when we took out our food and realized...NO HOME MADE ICE TEA! So I called the restaurant and let them know what had happened. Asked for a refund for the ice tea: ""no refunds"". Asked for them to return with the ice tea: ""Delivery man is very busy tonight, we will give you free ice tea next time you order."" OK..alright..maybe i'll do that (at this point I'm so tired and hungry I didn't really care). Here's what got me all fired up...my Thai spicy basil beef dish was 80% junk VEGETABLES and 20% tiny pieces of beef strips. I had never had such bad Chinese food EVER. It was rather pathetic. Made me think that they ran out of beef so they cut my beef into tiny tiny pieces and covered it with onions, peppers, mushrooms. By now, I'm pissed. I called them up and asked them if they had given me the right dish because I didn't order mixed vegetables with beef...They said, it's the right one and that they doubled checked. I said, why is there so much more vegetables, like 80% more than the main ingredient. Their response? Of course there is going to be more vegetables than meat anywhere you order. WOW. That was the last straw. I immediately called up seamless and let them know what happened. At first they gave me a meager 15% off my next order. I explained to them that that was unacceptable. How would you like it if you had a bad day and you have to come back to eat a plate of takeout that was 80% filled with nasty vegetables with the tiniest pieces of beef? After that, they resorted to give me a refund of my order minus the delivery fees and tip. Much better than the 15% off. Point of my review: China Wok? NEVER AGAIN.",none,The China Wok

Probably 3rd grade. And it was terrible lol.I'm so glad I took a chance on this spot.Initially I thought $10 for a small sandwich (The Slop Drop and Roll) was a little steep, but it's actually the right portion size without being too much food and tasted amazing. The perfect combination of a soft bun, seasoned beef, sauces and cheese. And the jalapeno popper and fresh jalapenos added a crunch and texture that definitely took the sloppy joe to a new level. I was here on a Monday afternoon so there was no line, but if this place was open late on the weekends it would be well patronized with the post-casino/bar/club crowd. Hopefully word spreads quickly and their business thrives in this location. I'll definitely be back for more!","Don't let those grade school lunches dissuade you from coming here.Last time I had a ""Sloppy Joe"" was probably 2nd or 3rd grade. School lunches pretty much ruined most things and a Sloppy Joe was no exception. I stopped eating them with absolutely no desire to ever try them again thanks to those cafeteria lunches. Fast forward many, many years later. I've been eyeballing this location for a few months and finally decided to just try this, though my expectations were low. A little history of this location - it was ""Mario's Shortstop"" for many years, became something else, then it became the ""Thai Shack"", and now it's Sloppie Joes - all different owners of course. Those who know or live in the area should know where this is.While my expectations were low, the menu looked pretty good. I decided on the 'Big Sloppie' and ordered the 'Average Joe' for my son, who wanted to also try something from here. The Big Sloppie was quite good actually and instantly I felt that grade school lunch stigma go away. My son liked the fries and his Average Joe enough to where he asked me if we could order from here again soon, to which I agreed. My second time I ordered the same and added some sides. The fries are pretty good, along with the sweet potato fries. The onion rings are standard but good. I intend to try the salad eventually along with other things on the menu.It can be a little ""sloppy"" no matter how you try to eat it, so make sure you have a napkin handy. The employees have been welcoming and friendly. There are two tables to sit there and eat if the weather is nice enough. Located right across the street from that Empire City Casino. Street parking is limited, since the side streets in the immediate area require permits (thanks to the Casino patrons and their employees) or you can park at a meter. I would suggest ordering ahead of time and picking up if you can help it. If you're local, it's an easy walk over.I've been here twice and will return again. They've reestablished the 'sloppy Joe' for me and showed that it can be done right. A good option in the area.","Such an amazing/delicious place, came here and the owner himself was there explaining what inspired him to his creation. Customer service was awesome felt as if I was being treated as family. I never had a sloppie joe and when I asked what it was, he was able to break down each sandwhich, what he recommended for the first time and honestly I can't wait to come back.What I ordered was ""The Average Joe"", with some""Jalapeño Poppers"" which was just out of this world!! Texture was perfect, the buns just melt in your mouth and the meat seasoning on the Sloppie Joe was perfect. The Jalapeño Poppers was also just amazing looked like a chicken nugget but it's delicious melted cheese with jalapeños and its just out of this world.

Tremont Ave, once housing long time family resident Spotos, has now been morphed into Parq Sports Bar & Grill. No longer an Italian restaurant, but now a sports bar slash lounge. As you walk in through the facade that has grocery store-type doors, the bar area is still the same, yet slightly different. There's now a walkable pass through opening between the bar and restaurant lounge area, giving the bar a slightly more airy feel. The reconfiguration of the entire restaurant provides more open spaces that were previously confined.  Now split into half the size of the original real estate, gives Parq a smaller, yet roomy enough space to hold enough white banquet-style seating, for lounging and snacking on their diverse menu options.  Unfortunately I am unable to provide a description of Parq's food, as we ate earlier.  Our impromptu visit to Parq was to check out who took over the last piece of real estate that housed Spoto's for almost 30 years. Parq is in no way the Italian establishment that once was, but a new kid on the block creating their own identity. Only time will tell how well Parq Sports Bar & Grill can hold down this corner of history.  Note: Three and a half stars for atmosphere, friendliness and a welcomed venue to the neighborhood.",none,Parq Sports Bar & Grill

The table was too small. I felt so cramped the whole meal. Almost like the table wasn't wide enough for their large serving plates. Food was tasty but needed work!

The pizza is simply delicious. No stupid trophies in the window claiming to be the best, no nonsense, just great delicious pizza. You can tell from the first bite that the ingredients are fresh and the cheese is premium because when it melts it does NOT turn into oil! My kids are picky but they would eat the pizza every day if I brought it for them. I usually order through ""Yelp!"" and have no issues, even the delivery guys are courteous and nice!By the slice or by the pie, you're nuts if you don't try this place! It does tend to get a little crowded right after school, but never rowdy and I would rather come here and give my children fresh pizza than that crap they serve at McDonald's! Did I mention the rainbow ice's?Just GREAT!!!","Lol where do I even begin? I placed an order through grub hub and decided to trust yelp reviews based on pizza places delivering to my address. This seemed to be the best one apparently. First off, that in itself is a major lie. Delivery time was fast which is always great. Once I had opened my box, I didn't expect to see what I saw. 4 small slices in the hugest box that has now caused my ""toppings"" to shift off the slices. I had ordered special slices and noted in toppings I wanted in hopes they'd understand that's the type of specialty slice I longed for. Judging from the photos posted by the business owner onto yelp, it's what I expected to get in the special slice. Instead, what I received was the complete opposite. They literally took the saddest plain slices they must of had sitting there and threw the toppings I wanted on them. For example, I asked for any slice that contained eggplant or veggies that they might of had available and they actually just threw a long thin by sliced piece of unseasoned eggplant onto the slice. They didn't even cut the eggplant into pieces lol. (See photos). The chicken on my chicken broccoli was a joke in the entire slice itself. The pizza dough was surrounded by crust that was now eating its way into my pizza so it was pretty much just crust. The dough itself was so paper thin (See photos) that it just tasted like cardboard. And the chicken was chewy and just not edible. To be fair, I asked for crispy but did not realize that today the crust would be paper thin causing it to just burn instead. The greatest part of this all is when I called the pizza place to complain about it, what I heard what he last thing any consumer should hear. I imagined it to be better like maybe say ""I'm sorry that Your pizza didn't come out right"", ""I'm sorry for this, let us remake it for you"" - honestly, a simple sorry would of been great. Instead, I have this poor, poor girl on the end of the other line dealing with me and the owner now. I could hear the owner in the back screaming at the top of his lungs. At first, I thought there was a game on their tv and maybe a customer was getting excited. As I listened closer, it's the actual owner arguing with me in the background about how I have shitty taste and how his pizza is the best I will ever have. Insulting me and cursing at me through this poor girl he has on the phone. Didn't even have the guts to pick up himself and say these things to me. To the owner, you are so rude and disgusting, so disrespectful that I am even surprised at how you even have a customer base. I'm actually even shocked that you've managed to gain 4stars on Yelp and maintain it. Wow. Your pizza is actually one of the worst I've ever had. I've had frozen pizza that tasted better than this trash you serve. At this point, I would've been happier with papa johns or lil cesers as much as it kills me to say that. This is the first and last time I will ever be ordering from this establishment. So much better to actually drive out of my way to get better pizza like Full Moon. This place is an absolute joke and a nightmare!","The Bronx Pizzeria, stomped their way in Throggs Neck a Few months ago. And when The Tasty Ladies documented their visit, Jason M. and I, decided to try a slice and some refreshments.The name is synonymous with old-fashioned neighborhood pizzerias: typical yellow menu boards and wooden tables/chairs decor. It's flashback to that 80s-straight-up-Bronx-corner-pizza-spot! Nothing fancy and definitely, not the spot to grab an artisanal pie or slice. In turn, our slices were decent (thick for my taste, nonetheless, good): my Plain Slice, had a suitable amount of cheese and light sauce and Jason's, 'White Slice' looked divine. Service was warm and friendly and one of the gentlemen, hooked me up with a Vanilla egg cream that came together ok, with a good trace of fizz. Nice to see a family business, opening and thriving every step of the way in The Bronx!",The Bronx Pizzeria
590,none,none,none,"Cute, quaint, and tasty! 3 words that describe this gem of a burger joint. My boyfriend and I had an appointment in the area and ended up being late. The business was wiling to reschedule us but it would be for another 2 hours. We decided to reschedule and walk around get a bite in the meantime. During our walk, we lucked up on 'Yo-Burger'. It was a very HOT Saturday afternoon. We walked in and noticed a short line. The place overall, wasn't too packed. There is plenty of seating inside and outside. The menu is pretty straight forward and features American classics (burgers, veggie burgers, hot dogs), drinks, shakes, smoothies, and frozen yogurt. There is also beer and wine for sale. Toppings are free for the most part with the exception of mushrooms, bacon, and eggs. We both ordered cheeseburgers with fries and some drinks. We did not try the shakes or frozen yogurt, but the yogurt seems to be self-serve and they offer both low fat and nonfat. The burger itself was very tasty and exceeded my expectations. Honestly, if you like Five Guys or Johnny Rockets burgers, you will like Yo-Burger. The burger was fresh, juicy, and well-cooked. I really did not expect it to taste as good as it did and we were both pleased. The fries were also tasty and hot. Free refills on fountain drinks. No issues, no complaints. Service was also very courteous and fast. I'd definitely return and recommend to others. Its a nice place to come on a summer evening or casual date. We will be returning!","Hubby brought me back some fries, a double cheese burger and a hotdog and I swear, my life flashed before my eyes. I was one month postpartum and thankful that the world outside could be brought to my table.Their burgers are picture-worthy, even when having traveled a distance. You can tell they take pride in what they serve. The meal was definitely fulfilling and my only wish would be to have been able to eat it in the restaurant because I'm sure that it tastes best fresh. Hubby and my sine were able to eat their food in house and mine was take away. It was still good.","This place is great for kids. They have hamburgers and cheeseburgers with fries or sweet potato fries. You can get bottomless soft drinks or milk shakes. We have been there many times and the kids love it. They have a good selection of frozen yogurt flavors, some no fat and lots of toppings. Prices are a little high, but way less expensive and more suitable for kids than other restaurants on Riverdale Ave. I have also seen children's birthday parties there on weekend afternoons.",Yo-Burger
591,none,none,none,"This is the first restaurant review I've written, and I was moved to do it by the most extraordinarily accommodating graduation party I hosted here for my daughter. First off, let me say that I've had lunch and dinner here a number of times, and have consistently enjoyed the wide choice of burgers, the tasty, crispy fries, and the welcoming, comfortable atmosphere. But the party I recently hosted (for 20 people) increased my appreciation of Bronx Burger House tenfold. First, unlike many restaurants, who have a party room in a back-of-the-restaurant dark location, parties here are in a sunny front room, with tons of windows and views of Van Cortland Park. And Laura, the server who helped us, was extraordinary! She let us customize the room to fit our needs, allowed us to adjust when we served various courses to take into account guests who showed up at various times, and was 100% responsive to our myriad requests. The party was a big success, and all of our guests commented on how good the food was and how comfortable the setting.Carol P.","Updating my last review because they've done so much since my initial visit!Firstly, they now have TACO TUESDAYS! Yes...your choice of flavor taco for a discounted price, every Tuesday. Also, if you're looking for entertainment, they also host trivia night on Tuesdays...with a prize. Yaaas.Secondly, they have karaoke on Fridays and have recently have begun to offer live music. I really do love this spot.Thirdly, they now serve adult milkshakes so, go get you one! Oh, and grab an order of Nutella S'mores Fries! All of the bartenders are nice...Nina, Norma and Laura are the best! The owner, Andre, is so very personable and he likes to visit with the customers to ensure that they're enjoying their visit.Tonight, we witnessed a couple try to get a free meal because they saw a bug on the wall. Mind you that today was one of, if not the warmest day of spring yet, and they had their door open. They're also located across from a tree-lined street along Van Cortlandt Park so it would be understandable that an insect found its way inside of a brightly lit restaurant with its door wide open. Instead of seeking management, they tried to dine and dash and got caught and made to pay their bill. I've never seen anything that made me question the cleanliness of this business. The tables, bar and bathroom have always been clean so it's obvious that this couple was out here, looking for a free meal.One thing I'll say is please don't come for a small business because you didn't happen to account for a dinner out in your weekly budget. It's not right to try to skate on a bill at any place. If you have a legitimate concern, write a review or contact the city's governing bodies to hold them accountable. The very first thing you should do is ask for management. Ya'll got caught and looked muy estupido...don't come back with your foolishness because I WILL live tweet you next time If you see a review from these jokers, don't take it to heart because they're trying to make up for the fact that they spent some of their rent money and they're tight AF. BIG LOL...","The staff is really nice and the prices are on point. The burger choices are intriguing and everything we evert eat here is really great.  Hubby, my son and I come here often and have a few burgers, fries and shakes. The atmosphere is family-friendly and the food is awesome. We've had the Lamb Burger with its Tzatziki, the Cowboy Burger and Spencer Burger. We've ordered their chili cheese fries on the side and loved them. Being that they're only short five minute drive from our home we've frequented them since first trying so many years ago and we've seen their young staff grow and move on and start new. They have a great team at BBH and they've always been hospitable and welcoming to myself, my family and friends that I've brought in.You can't really go wrong with any choice, especially since they allow you to customize and tweak their signature burgers to your liking. Our go-to brunch burgers are now the Old English for hubby, the Chuck Long for me and the Mexican for my boy and we always get our Chipotle Aioli and Habañero Relish on the side. Brunch is $25/pp with the 2 hour AYCD option. You can not go wrong with any of their fry varieties and adding garlic more than often enhances your sides.The bartenders are very nice and treat patrons well. Happy Hour drink specials are great and some of the food options include their Quesadillas, Buffalo Wings and Calamari, all of which are solid choices.They've recently started hosting karaoke on Friday nights at 9pm, the first one being this past weekend. I went with friends, it was fun and can only get better. Bronx Burger House definitely deserves repeat business. It's truly a neighborhood gem and they're reinventing themselves all the time, supporting local breweries and offering great deals. Get you an adult Milkshake because they're now serving those! Sooo good!",The Bronx Burger House
592,none,none,none,Bistro Casa Azul is an elegant environment that offers great friendly service and food with the greatest ingredient... love. I'm truly grateful to have stumbled into this special place and happy to have become a regular patron.,"*CASH ONLY*We went here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner - it looked like a quaint yet modern Mexican restaurant, and it's walking distance from our place!  We walked in, and I fell in love with the dim lighting, deep blue tiles, and whole fruit and growing chili peppers used as decorations. There were only about 6 other people present, which is a lot considering this place is usually empty or only hosting a few people at a time. So if you're looking for a quiet and intimate date night, this is the place to go! While perusing through the menu, an employee comes up to us to see if we have any questions. I didn't have any questions about the food, but I did ask him if they did anything for birthdays. Judging by his answer of ""Sure we can do something."", it sounded like they don't usually do anything for birthdays, but because I asked nicely, they would be able to whip something up. He also asked if we wanted any wine to go with our food. We have zero knowledge on wine, so he was nice enough to let us sample some of the red wine Bistro Casa Azul has. I felt awful in the sense I didn't like any of the red wine he offered, as I don't drink much, but he accepted that with a smile. My boyfriend did end up getting his own glass of red wine to celebrate his birthday. After some wine sampling, I ended up ordering the filet mignon with bacon and Oaxaca cheese. As I ordered my steak medium rare, it was tender and so easy to cut! This steak was rich, and its juicy and savory flavors were complimented by the fatty bacon and creamy Oaxaca cheese. The yellow rice was fluffy and a bit aromatic as well. Together, they were the perfect sized portion to eat at the restaurant without any leftovers nor without feeling too full - for most people. Later on, as I am expecting the check, our waiter comes out with a beautiful slice of light vanilla cake. It has some delicious vanilla mousse as well, making it the perfectly sweet and airy dessert to end our meals here. A dinner for 2 and some wine ended up costing us around $70 with tip, and because this place is cash only, make sure to bring a lot of cash with you! Bistro Casa Azul is pricey, but it's worth it! If you're ever in the mood for splurging on yourself and/or for others, this is the place to go!","Absolutely delicious food with hospitable hosts. My mom and I came in for brunch, were warmly greeted and seated right away and quickly received delicious, hot french press coffee. We ordered the bacon, huevos rancheros and molletes. The sauce on the huevos rancheros was outstanding, with just the right amount of heat. The molletes (French bread with pico de gallo and Oaxaca cheese) were yummy, fresh, and simultaneously light and filling. And the bacon... OH THE BACON! The bacon was unbelievably smokey and a little sweet with lick-the-plate-good maple glaze. The owner was always checking in and making sure we had all we need. Overall a great spot for a laid back delicious brunch.",Bistro Casa Azul
593,none,none,The service at this establishment is abysmal. You walk in and get ignored. When they finally decide to serve you they have an attitude. The food overall did not look fresh. The Chicharron they are known for was good but comparable to any other spot in my opinion. They also took forever to accept my payment. I would skip not worth it in my opinion.,the best place for chicharron in the heights. no doubt. especially when it is freshly made. i wish i could eat it every day. i would probably die of a heart attack soon after but HAPPY!,"Food (2/2): I haven't tried other similar-serving locations so this might be a bit biased. However, at the very least, around this area, this place serves the best chicharron. Skin portion is completely crispy when you bite down and immediately greeted by the fat-gushing juiciness of the meat. Flavor is also top-notch, though likely doesn't require much. Simple saltiness to it without much else (beyond lime juice) that blends amazingly well with the rice and beans. Rice is dry, which complements the meat well in this case. Beans are slightly on the sweeter side and when taken together with the meat, adds an additional layer to the meat without detracting from the crunchy skin. It's definitely not a dish with complex flavor-profiles but still satisfies your stomach.Service/wait-time/cleanliness (1/2): Service is so-so. I unfortunately was faced with a language barrier since they primarily speak Spanish. Despite that, the staff still managed to get my order so I'm really happy with that. Wait-time however, can be long sometimes even though they're not packed; likely related to their slow pace in general. Cleanliness is definitely not something I would expect from this place. At the very least, they maintained it where the food are located. Price (0.5/1): For its price, you should at least give this place a try, though probably not a place that you'd frequent. However, I personally am willing to return just for the chicharron!",none,Elsa La Reina Del Chicharron
594,none,"I honestly think I can make a decent mofongo compared to the one I had here to go. The plátano itself was dry, overall the sauce was tasteless. Should of read up on the reviews before coming here.","For a restaurant that is named mofongo you'd think that it was their specialty, right? Well no, this has the be one of the worst tasting mofongos I've ever had. It tasted like old platanos. Their pernil and piña coladas were on point though! For me it's a no, id never visit here again.","My friend decided to bring me here to eat for lunch. I later on learned that another woman took him here and that's how he learned about this place. I just thought that was funny so I decided to include it in my review. Thank you girl, whoever you are, because the food was good. Once we walked into the place, I noticed that there was only one table of customers, family of 3 to be exact. So this place isn't so busy on a Saturday between the hours of 2 and 3 p.m. My friend inquired about a specific soup and the waitress seemed to be confused. I think they both were confused at that time because he's African and doesn't know much about their food and I think the waitress is used to Latino people eating at this place. After all, it is considered to be a Dominican restaurant. Nevertheless, I don't discriminate against food just because it's not culturally related to me. Good food is good food!!! I think she was thrown off by his accent because when I repeated the same thing that he was saying, he just wanted to know what the Dominican soup was made of, she had no problems telling him the contents of the soup. She went to fix his food as I still needed time to decide what I wanted to eat. After looking at the menu, I decided on rice and beans without any meat. The waitress was actually a bit surprised because she even questioned me to make sure that maybe I wasn't forgetting to say I wanted meat. I also decided to go along with a drink they call Topical Mango. I really do think that whoever was responsible for producing the look of the menu, I think they meant to write tropical mango. Because for the life of me, I don't know what the hell a topical mango is. Even my phone wouldn't allow me to spell it the way it's spelled on the menu. I had to go behind the autocorrect and change it from tropical mango to topical mango. Haha. I will have you know that the topical mango was absolutely delicious. It was just a tad bit grainy which was just fine with me. I hate for smoothies to be so thick that it's tough to suck it through the straw. The flavor was absolutely perfect and it was so cold that by the time I finished the drink, I was freezing. Our waitress was absolutely gorgeous. Her skin looked as if you can swim in it. I don't know if you're now viewing me as crazy or just weird as hell, but if you have never witnessed someone with beautiful, Flawless skin... Come here. Her eyebrows were heaven-sent and she had a head full of beautiful hair that was slicked back. Her hips were out of this world and I mean that in a good way. It was as if it doesn't matter what this girl wears, just the silhouette of her body is pleasing to the eyes. Everything from head to toe about her was on point. I remember there was Spanish music playing the whole time. I think that when a place caters to a certain type of crowd or type of people, they forget to include ""others"". They had two television sets on, but because the music was drowning the sound out, closed captioning was on. Of course the closed captioning was in Spanish. It's a good thing they had something like baseball on because I don't need to know what the hell they're saying to watch baseball.",none,none,Mofongo El Mocano

Get there early so you can have options, the croissant is always a great choice. There are huge windows in the front where you can sit and take in the warmth of the sun. If you don't like the sun, the space is big enough, there is a nice dim cozy space (not small cozy either). The best iced chai latte in the area. Some of the food options may take up to 10 minutes for prep and cooking, this just means it's fresh. A great options, dare I say a gem.","Fantastic local coffee shop, which really is populated by neighborhood folks.  The hot coffee is always, always great (not bitter, not burnt, a little sweet).  The food's pretty good, too- have to try the Jalapeno Cheese Danish twist thing.  I really dig how well thought out the interior is, how welcome and inviting the atmosphere is.  Very grateful to the owners for having the vision to open this where it is!","Common Good is the ideal neighborhood cafe. The coffee is good, the staff are friendly, the space is beautiful, and you can stay as long as you'd like. I'm a huge fan of the fresh flowers and assorted houseplants throughout the cafe, and there's something about that natural light that is truly sustaining. Walking into Common Good lifts my mood before I even sit down with my coffee and snacks. $4 for a nothing-special pain au chocolate is a bit steep, but otherwise the pricing is decent: $1.50/$2.25 for small/medium drip coffee, $6-7 breakfast/lunch items. Everything is premade and just reheated upon ordering, so you may need to request that your dish be heated more -- our frittata was served just barely above room temp and would probably have been tastier hot.",Common Good Harlem

It's a one-man show, but the owner/shucker Ray knows what he's doing and is a really pleasant person. His mantra is simple: fresh oysters from nearby sources, excellent cheeses, and delicious, reasonably-priced wines.

They have 2 huge tables that could seat six in front which one could easily see as community seating, but the are not. After asking two women who were dining together outside if I could have a seat a share their large table, the owner came out and told me that the table was a private table. She was nice about it, and moved to a window sill ledge facing inside the restaurant. It was awkward, uncomfortable and a bit embarrassing. Had I not already placed my order, I would have just left. I asked the sever to pack my dinner order to go.As I walked home with my dinner in a bag, I wished I would have went to The Anchor Bar and Restaurant across the street instead as it was so nice out. (They has plenty of tables outside.) There are plenty of places on Broadway with outdoor seating that would have made me feel welcome. When I got home, the food itself was pretty good. Too bad, my first meal from there will be my last meal to eat from there.","What a great experience!Ambience: earthy/soul/hip/chic with a twist of feel right at home. Nicely done.

I'm sure she will greet you with a smile. Menu: options! The menu headline isn't lying. Food for everyone. Vegan/vegetarian/and options for others as well. I went for the vegan options. And I was overwhelmed with my choices. I couldn't try them all because I was practicing self-restraint but I will be back. But plenty of appetizers (some seem smaller than others so definitely ask about the size if you are planning to share; you might have to order two of something depending on your group size). Entrees for everyone (vegans/vegetarians/pescatarians and carnivores). Also desserts YUM. I didn't get any but I did see the table next to me order the coconut ice cream. It was beautifully presented in a martini glass! How pretty! Next time I will try some (and by some I mean a few of their desserts, yes!)Cocktails: please peruse their cocktail menu. It definitely entertained me. So informative and the best part it makes you feel healthy. Like yes I must have the Green Light because it ""aids my heart and weight loss"". How could I say no to that?! They also have wines and beers (including IPAS which matters to me). Food: I had the pleasure of tasting:The guacamole - it's a side and the portion is small. That said, it was very fresh! Enjoy. The mushroom & lentil pate - it's an appetizer and a small portion but it was all mine and it was a perfect size appetizer just for me. Tasty! Vegan Thai curry rice - entree. Decent portion. I would even say big. Good to share if you're into that kinda thing. And then you can order something else so you can taste more items (wink wink but I've regressed). As Gigi warned ""it has a kick"". She didn't lie. It does. But most of the sauce is on the side so it's under your control. A satisfying amount of grilled delicious vegetables. I didn't eat much of the rice (personal summer body reasons). But it has peanuts in it. That was fun. Although I think it would have been nicer if the peanuts weren't whole. Perhaps crushed would have been better that's just one of my lil picky preferences. Anyway if you're hungry, want veggies, and like flavor in your mouth and can handle a some spice Go For It. Zucchini lasagna - this is an appetizer but can easily be an entree.

After too many drinks last night, a bowl of Pace Picante would have been perfectly fine, to be honest, but this tasted more like canned Hunts pasta sauce. Why the hell was it so sweet! And then there were some poorly chopped herbs (mostly stems, really) that somehow made it all even worse. Then came the dry chewy rice, and the beans which tasted like someone forgot to rinse them off after pouring them out of the can. And then the dry chewy Huarache. Then the bland boring chicken tamale which was only made worse by the watery green salsa. Then the bland fatty pork tamale which was only made worse by the watery red salsa.

This is a place hidden in plain sight, but well loved among residents and workers in the neighbor for eat-in OR take out.The chicken here is a tad less salty/flavorful than I remember, but that could also be because NYC has been cutting down on transfer, MSG, etc. over the past several years. Still, $5 for a savory half a chicken is no bad deal. I most recently ordered one to go and ate it at the park across the street one evening after work last week.I honestly cannot say I've ever had anything bad here and anybody I've brought here has enjoyed the food. I love their chicken and Cuban sandwiches, but also the rice and beans, plantains--sweet and salty, steaks, and desserts. I've passed many a weekend afternoon/early evening with my late mother's here, who also enjoyed it.My advice to owner/manage my? If it's not broken after 15-20 years, don't fix it, and keep on doing what you do. I'm hoping this place stats around for another 15-20 and beyond.","This place has been here since I was a kid ! I grew up around the block and it has never ever disappointed! This is hands down the best chicken, so much flavor . Everytime I go back home I have to stop at 3 way",none,3 Way Restaurant
605,none,none,none,"Me and my girlfriend came here for a quick bite in the heights, the pizza was amazing and the Sangria Lol OMG, got a pitcher of it, it was gone so quick and everything is reasonably priced, loved the Spanish bodega vibes as well, Real nyc feel.","Came here last month with the roommate in checking out spots in our new hood. Been hearing about Bodega Pizza for years and finally got to try it out. It's a cool concept of being in a bodega/pizzeria. Had the margherita pizza and it was definitely worth the try.Cool spot for locals and tourists alike. Pizza is not much on the expensive side, especially if you split the price.","Hubby surprised me with a birthday weekend for the ages! We had dinner with family the night before and he then organized a birthday pizza brunch with our friends at this awesome restaurant. Walking inside was like walking in time to when we were kids hanging out in the Bronx, going to the bodega for quarter waters, grandma cookies and honey buns or a Deli sandwich and a Mystic. It's like a NYC borough time capsule. All the bogedas of yore pretty much had the same look, same items for sale, same pricing and they were all the cornerstones of their respective neighborhoods. It was uncanny, the similarities, and it brought back a nostalgia for me that was comforting. They thought everything, down to the clear plastic display cases with all the 5¢ candies that they have on the wall behind the bar.They hooked us up with a large communal table once everyone arrived. Our server was the bartender as well and she was pretty attentive, despite there being a few other tables dining. All of the pizzas are personal sized which is great for sharing. The Spicy, Margherita, Breakfast and Tres Golpe pizzas were among the crowd faves and we also saw a bodega sandwich made in the front. Everyone loved the food. I even got a birthday Nutella pizza for dessert which had bananas AND strawberries. It was awesome. Deadass.",Bodega Pizza

That's about it.",This is your typical small deli/coffee shop that accepts cash only !I grabbed a ham/egg and cheese sandwich and an OJ and my friend a muffin heated and a coffee before getting on the subway The sandwich was delicious and my friend was happy with the taste of her coffee ( so much that she got a cup to go after eating at Nickis the next day across the street ).  She said this places coffee was much better It's only 2 blocks from my apt so I will defiantly be back.  Thank you!!,"I stop by here for breakfast and lunch a few times per week.

607,none,none,none,"I decided on trying this place out because my GF found a deal on Groupon. After reading the reviews on this place I was a little hesitant to say the least but she had been here before so she vouched for the place. She made a reservation for Monday at 7 pm, note that they get a tad standoffish when you mention that you want to make a reservation for a Groupon deal, but regardless it was made.We show up and we are seated outside because the inside was a little too loud and we had a group of 4. The seating outside wasn't bad. Our waiter came out and was a delight (Shutouts to Franklin) Now this is something very important to note YOU CAN NOT USE YOUR GROUPON AND GET HAPPY HOUR SPECIAL. You either get use your groupon deal and pay for full price drinks, or just go for happy hour, you can not combine. We decided on saving the groupon deal for another time and did the happy hour instead. We ordered the Passion Fruit Mojito pitcher was a little too sweet but definitely good and Red Sangria Pitcher was really good with blueberries and apples in it.They also gave us two round of shots of passion fruit and tequila on the house which was sweet. We ordered our food we started off with apps Chicken Katsu Bites which was delicious and the Gyoza which was also good, after that we order the fusion rolls that didn't take that long to come out. We had the El Ninja Roll, Uptown Roll, Mambo Special Roll and the Quisqueya Roll all were amazing and delicious. Our waiter would come and check up on us frequently also which is important to add because most of the yelp reviews state how bad the service is, we didn't notice. They also have hookah which is OK, they only have one flavor which is star-buzz mint which is basic but what can you do and they use the quick light coals (3 kings coals) and anyone that's a hookah head knows is trash. Also the hookah is $30 and not included on the bill so you have to pay cash when the hookah boy gets there.Over all my experience was good, definitely will come back.","I recently had a birthday dinner with my brother. To be fair, my experience was higher than three stars but stopped short of four stars.Despite the reviews to the contrary, the staff was nice to us. We sat outside and when our food did not fit on a table, they gave a second table. This later proved to be a burden as when it got later, people started to show up and hate us as they had to wait for that other table. That was awkward. Since we were outside, they were literally part of our dinner.The food takes a while to come.The regular sushi rolls were fine but not phenominal. It was what you would expect as part of a lunch special sized portion at a midtown sushi spot. Small. No clapping, but no complaints either. Average is safe.The specialty rolls are different and they seem to be trying to do something unique and they should be applauded for that.  These things are worth a try. Many of them have nothing to do with fish.The Dominican fried rice is tasty but sized like a side. It is literally the rice you would find in a small rice bowl. Paired with two rolls, I was still somewhat unfufilled. The El rey is pretty cool.Drinks were ok.  I went to wash my hands and the soap bottle was basically water put into the dying bottle. Bathroom was otherwise fine, clean and had towels.There was no problem paying by credit card. Gratuity was added to the check. Not sure why, but I'm ok with that. What gave me pause was the credit card bill being returned without the original receipt and a simple total with a blank gratuity line and no reflection that a gratuity had been previously assessed. In the end, concepts like this in neighborhoods that would otherwise not enjoy these cusines are great. The small things bring this to just under a 4 star review to me.","Went here for the brunch. The service and food were amazing! If you're looking to turn up for brunch, this isn't the spot. The music is on pretty low and it's just a playlist. If you want good sangria and latin fusion sushi then I definitely recommend this place.",Sushi Mambo

And we were glad for the smaller kids portion.Friendly staff, fresh ingredients.Would just suggest they do something about all the flies hovering back by the bathroom.","I'm really not a sandwich person. In fact, my friends were really surprised when I told them that I voluntarily came here because I really am NOT a sandwich person. However, my co-workers rave about Mason Sandwich Company, and I had to taste the hype for myself. I've noticed that this area has a lot of food treasures because Mason doesn't look like much on the outside--it's located in a small square and has a pretty plain sign and interior, but it's bustling with people during lunch rush. My co-workers and I ordered 20 minutes ahead of time because we heard they can get back tracked on orders. I ordered the 59th and 6th and fries (not really a fries girl either but my co-worker got some and I wanted to try them as well). When I picked up my order, I also ordered their house sauce, which was $1. Honestly, their sandwich was really delicious. It reminded me of halal gyro; the yogurt-like sauce was delicious and coated the crispy sandwich bun nicely. They don't skip out on ingredient quantity either. There are a lot of freshly cut lettuce and tomatoes. It's probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, and it makes me want to try their other menu items as well. The fries I could've passed on--they were pretty basic and not super memorable.","This was my first time visiting the Mason Sandwich Company. All of the menu options sounded great. My wife and I shared the steak sandwich and fries, it was very tasty.",Mason Sandwich Company

They have a nice outside seating but you cannot order alcohol if you eat outside.  I wanted to order salad, but they said they cannot put chicken or shrimp on top. Also, I wanted tacos without pork and they said they cannot do it either. Therefore I was not 100% satisfied. They could up been more open to adjusting menu to personal needs. Also service was kind of slow, we were seating for a good 20 min without anyone coming to pick up dirty dishes. Food did not taste amazing but was not bad either. It is a nice place but not great.",none,"My husband and I order from this place relatively often on seamless. We've also eaten in the restaurant once prior to this time. Honestly, the place lives up to its name! It offers different options for guacamole and each option is just as amazing as the other ones. What I appreciate about their guac is that it isn't chunky, but on the creamy side and the flavor profiles for their guac go together well like the fresco guac has pomegranate seeds and jicama; I can never get enough of it or any of their guacamoles! The servers at the restaurant are very friendly and attentive; they made sure to refill our tortilla chips when we were running low and asked if we wanted another refill on our sangria when she saw we were out. The tacos are also packed full of flavor and they have some different ones like octopus, where you typically wouldn't find in many of your common taco places. The only thing is, if you don't like cilantro, you should ask for less or none because they do add a lot of cilantro on top of your tacos. Definitely a place to try if you like guacamole!",none,"I am not in the habit of leaving  negative feedback on yelp as I like to accentuate my positive experiences, but...Me and my girlfriend went there for dinner last week. I ordered the fajita with steak which tasted good but was a over cooked and greasy. My date ordered a burrito without sour cream or cheese as she is vegan.  She also asked the server if they served any non-alcoholic juices. We were told they do not but she can bring a virgin margarita (basically, sour mix with ice).  When the food arrived there was cheese on top of the burrito and my date reminded the server that she requested no cheese. The waitress kindly took it back and quickly returned the burrito which was the same burrito with the cheese wiped off. It was clear that this was done as there was still cheese in the sauce on the plate.  We received the check and didn't realize until we got home that we were charged $13.00  each for two virgin margaritas which happens to be the cost of a regular margarita with tequila.  I feel ripped off about this and think it's unbelievable that they would charge us $13.00 for sour mix.  I will not return to this restaurant.",Guacamole Taqueria

612,none,none,Came out of desperation since my car was parked next door and I was starving after a long day at work. I was close to eating my shoe that is how hungry I was. They have ample seating in here which is a place. You can sit at the stools in front or at tables. They also have a makeshift bar in the back that people were sitting at. I started with the cuban sandwich and it was solid. The bread was probably a little top charred for my liking but the cheese was melted and the ham was warmed through. Might have tasted better because I was starving. I also ordered the porkchop which was incredibly salty. It was borderline inedible. Not sure how that is possible but it was not good. I think I contracted diabetes and high blood pressure after eating it.In the end Florita is not my favorite spot in this area. I would come back for a quick sandwich but not a sit down meal.,This place has great Cuban food.. i always order the grilled chicken with rice and beans.

615,none,"Just ordered off Uber eats and the food was so trash we couldn't eat it. I got the beef stew with rice and beans and my bf got a grilled chicken salad. We also ordered two sides of sweet plantains (maduros). Beef stew was horrible, cheap thin slices of beef with some peppers and onions and no seasoning. Peppers and onions were still firm and the beef was so tough it was hard to cut even with a knife so they clearly didn't cook it long enough. Plantains were burnt and hard as rocks. Inedible. Maduros are supposed to be ripe, soft, plantains. Also they forgot to put dressing for the salad even though you have to choose your dressing in the app. The beans were watery and plain. Can't say anything about the rice but that's the one thing that is hard to mess up. No utensils were put in the bag. We will be contacting Uber eats to get a refund. Whoever was working today clearly gave no fu**s about making sure customers are happy.

Love Love LOVE these Gyros,"Gyro King has been a solid place for the hand held goodness since my childhood. Not the most ascetically pleasing place showing its age and the amount volume they handle. They serve up serval menu items from pizza, burgers & fries and other on the go staples, and of course those gyros. Strictly a to-go spot except in summer months where you  can cop-a-squat @ one of the very unofficial plastic tables and chairs right outside the doors. Top on my list because they actually serve real chicken gyros. They slow cook the chicken on a spinning grill known as the Gyro/Shawarma machine just like the lamb. Where I've witnessed many other spots try to offer frozen ""steak'em"" like strips when you ask for chicken. Here it's craved right off the machine and tossed a grill to ensure thorough cooking as you order. I'm sure that there are now many other places that are good or even better, but when I rarely have taste for a chicken gyro, GK is what comes to mind. Just A Note:Drivers beware, parking can be an issue and the vultures are always out to grant you with a ticket for your Gyro craving.","Im not quite sure how i feel about this gyro, after hanging out wit some friends after work  I stopped and grabbed a Gyro from a local spot. The smells in this place make you want to order one of everything but that was not the plan this night just a gyro to go lol. I got the lamb gyro with everything on it. In hindsight i should have made sure to ask for hot sauce because after the long ride back to mt. Vernon only to realize that there was no hot sauce really bummed me out big time.

618,none,"Dinner with a side of sexual harassment. #timesup #timestheFUcKup Please don't go here until they fire this little perp.I LOVe Thai food. Could eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner--there are times I would kill for a good panang or tom yum. Both dishes are literally medicinal for me....the mingling of sour and savory and spicy and sweet? My heart lurched for joy seeing the River sign next door from this place a few weeks ago.And then I found out it's run by the Mumbai Masala folks--by one creep in particular who's singlehandedly ruined over a year of friendly neighborhood service.You see, I've been a loyal diner there, next door at the Indian joint, for years (run by the same family who's opening this Thai place). I loved the food and reeeeally appreciated the neighborly feeling they gave me; the way they'd go out of their way to chop up extra fresh garlic for me whenever chronic Lyme was kicking my butt and I needed the boost?? The way they oblige my request for no dairy in my spinach? I was always SO grateful!!!! For a while last summer I was a very frequent diner (both eat-in and take-out) because of said chronic illness; I was too ill to cook for myself very often (and good food is key to recovery) so I could often be found hobbling my way over there--feverish, foggy-headed and ""beaten""--for some lovely sustenance. I even took on the moniker ""Garlic Lady"" and they always delivered. :) It was lovely to have them in the neighborhood! Everything from the veggies to the seafoods to the meat was mostly awesome. Their service was warm and hospitable and lovely. Until one day recently, I bumped into one of the male managers on the block right next to the restaurant. At first he just asked why I hadn't been going there as much. I explained that I am lucky enough to have found an awesome partner now who cooks for me a lot--and that (in part thanks to him!) I'm mercifully recovering and can cook for myself more often too! He immediately proceeded to make inappropriate comments--glaring through me the way perps always do. It's not even so much *what he said (which was patently inappropriate) so much as the clear entitlement he felt--and ladies you all know what I'm talking about here--to deliberately attempt to gin up my discomfort, and the patently pathetic, sociopathic way he in fact gets off, like a little klepto, on that attempted discomfort and *intimidation* of a woman he's alone with. To look in my eye and rub it in that he feels ***entitled to say things he knows I don't wanna hear, clearly against my wishes and without my consent. (Seriously, just keep your hands AND THOuGhtS to yourself bruh....it shouldn't be that difficult!) Like all sexual harassment, it's a POWER play, pure and simple, and it was far too instant/automatic for this to be the first or worst example of someone he's done this to; it was literally a 20-second convo!! He wasn't even hitting on me simply taking the opportunity to get this sick part of him off bc I happened to be alone. I wouldn't trust this motherfucker for shit now--and was dumb to go back there even once to trust him w my meal. He ended up being there and had the audacity to ask me to go next door w him!!?? That was when I hit the ceiling and quite audibly confronted him over it, face to face. In the presence of other diners (even before my fish jalfrezi came! Lol). And in typical perp fashion he 1) didn't see that coming.... assumed I'd demure to his shit like women have been doing for too long; 2) was embarrassed as shit... 3) blew smoke up my ass with some phony apology, but was too chicken and busy playing ""dumb"" to even tell me WHY what he did was wrong. No other members of management came to ask me what was up either--guess they'd rather keep their heads in the sand and turn a blind eye to his shit. It's a shame bc as far as I can see (except for their enabling?) everyone else is lovely--get rid of this pathetic little perp, and I'll GLADLY repatronize!! With partner and w friends!!

We told the lady we wanted the 2.00 Cuchifritos stuff and she charged us $10. You have to be really specific if you aren't a regular and visiting the area. I ordered the yuca salad and the vinegar sauce was light near almost bland. But it was still good food overall. My friend enjoyed her taquito and the empanadas were really good! I would good back again and give it another try!,Cuchifritos
621,none,none,none,"They make their own pizza dough and sauce on site, have nice Nathan's hot dogs, purple grapes in a cup and even sell beer! Staff was very hospitable and swift. Solid dining for a zoo.","You know what you're in for when you find yourself at the Dancing Crane Cafe: extortionately priced carnival food. You'd think with the turnover here, though, that the food would at least be fresh. Nope. A $4.50 pretzel that any Central Park hot dog vendor could competently execute was completely inedible at Dancing Crane. Thankfully, the zoo allows you to bring in your own food and drink. That should be your strategy.","Like many other reviews have stated this is not an impressive selection. The food is what you would find at any other amusement park. Overpriced burgers, hot dogs, fries, chicken fingers, and pizza. This location happens to have some pre-made salads and sandwiches available along with beer!I ordered the chicken fingers and fries combo : a number 3 I believe and opted to get the boo at the zoo cup that you could refill all day for free. All in all my meal came to about 17$. They do offer a lot of options for dipping sauces for the chicken fingers, the honey mustard was pretty good. One thing I wasn't happy with was how fast my fries got cold and ultimately inedible. The set up in the dining area is kinda crazy. First you can go up to one of the lanes to get your food or you have the option of grabbing a pre made meal. Once you get one of those options you are supposed to go up to the lanes and pay for your food. One thing that I did notice was a lot of people skipping out on paying there bill. For the zoo's sake i'd try to come up with a way of either opting for  more staff to ensure payment was made. Not fair that I get stuck paying $17 and they get it for free. One cool thing about eating in the park and being a member you get 20% off discount.",Dancing Crane Cafe
622,none,none,Me and my friend were looking for a place to continue drinking after Sunday brunch.  We decided to go here because they had outdoor tables available.  We had to buy two bottles to get a table. I guess that wasn't enough because they service was terrible & the guy that brings the hookah had a bad attitude.,"I came to Pat'r Palo for my birthday last year, it was sooooooo good that I didn't find another place that could compete with them for this year's celebration.It was an awesome evening. Their bottomless brunch has GREAT items plus an AWESOME price for both adults and kids.I had Ceviche, the best ceviche I have tried at a restaurant. For entree I had Churrasco, it was as delicious as I remembered, maybe better than Last year's. Their brunch goes for 1 hour and a half, somehow, we ended up getting like 2 and a half hours, our waiter Benjamin was the best!!!They also go around with a bottle of Tequila and shots cups and give you free shots for you to enjoy even more, they gave me three and I had to stop them cause I didn't want to get wasted. I LOVE Pat'e Palo, their ambiance is the best, their service is more than excellent. I would come every Sunday if I could. The best!!!!!!!","I was here specifically on June 17th, had not had taken the time to review this place.We came here for *Brunch on my exact Birthday. We made a reservation two days before and they had everything set up for my group. When we got there, we noticed they had prepared a table for us but it was inside the restaurant. It was a Hot Summer day and we actually wanted to be seated outside so requested for the table to be outside and within minutes they made the change for us with positive vibes and no complaints. Everything was PERFECT. Our waitress was what we say in Spanish ""UN AMOR!!!"". She was very attentive, very professional, funny and considered. I had every drink on the brunch menu, starting with Mimosa and scaling my way to the top to the Rum Punch, which in my opinion was the BEST BEST of all the drinks they offer. Loved the variety of the menu for Brunch. Different options for appetizer and we kinda shared all of them and they were all delicious. Most of all ordered Churrasco for Entree, and that was delicious too.I had a great time and will definitely be back whenever I feel like having a great time and enjoying a great brunch.Since it was mine and my Twin's birthday, the waitress gave the whole table a round of free shots, and my sister and me got 2 shots each, she made us choose and my partner chose Patron. It was a very nice and enjoyable noon, and we all left tipsy and happy.",none,Pat'e Palo Bar & Grill
623,none,"Good food, horrible service. The lady at the counter acts like she hates her job for that reason alone I will not be returning ! She ignored me when I walked and I was just standing there waiting to order and she said nothing to me. The cook was the one who actually asked if I was trying to place an order. I'd rather go somewhere with better service and worse food! Sucks because this is a black establishment that I would like to support but I don't like all the attitude & rudeness.",none,"The fish dinner with two sides of collard greens and Mac cheese ...were tasty, fresh and delicious. I ordered a side of yams that were just the right sweet for me...this meal on my meal plan cheat day was worth every bit of it!!! Yummy yummy in your tummy. The service was friendly and had me laughing at the end of a long work week.Kudos!",none,"One of the best seafood spots in Harlem. If you know Famous Fish on 145th and St. Nicholas (Harlem staple) then you'll love Make My Fish. It's the same former owner, fresher plentiful options and satisfying portions minus the long long lines.",Make My Fish
624,none,none,none,"I've come here a handful of times, and each time I'm hoping for something better but this place always falls short somewhere. The food is decent. It's what you'd expect from a ""pub"" type of place, maybe slightly lesser quality though. The service is usually alright, but today it was god awful. This was almost a 2 hour production. I give the waiter some sympathy though because he was the only one working the whole outside deck area...but c'mon...The drinks came quick but waiting for everything else was like watching paint dry.Wings (BBQ)- 2/5 the wings were relatively small with not much meat on them. The quality wasn't great but there was a lot of sauce which was nice..getting dry wings just isn't the same.Boom Boom Shrimp Wrap-2/5 the wrap itself wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. Aside from being cold, not even lukewarm the shrimp tasted like it was taken out of a freezer bag sautéed for 30 seconds and thrown into the mix. The sauce was like a mayo base with hot sauce..not what I was expecting and probably wouldn't get again.Chicken Parm Sandwich-3/5 surprisingly pretty decent. I'll admit I really wasn't expecting this to be very good but it was alright.Fries-Literally identical to McDonalds with a little less salt. Not complaining, but not quality steak fries or anything.Overall, this place is what it is...mediocre food with a beautiful view. Not a bad change up if you're looking for that scene but don't expect to be blown away by any great grub","Love this place! The food is great food, the prices are resonable. Its family friendly during daytime hours and the view of the throgsneck bridge is a huge plus.","Yummy drinks!!! First time coming after hearing about it for so long. I went on a Sunday night hoping it wasn't too busy and luckily, it wasn't. For starters, their drink menu has great selections! I was drawn to their Piña Colada which I liked instantly even though I usually don't prefer frozen drinks. My boyfriend had the Miami Vice which he thought was mediocre.  Luckily, our bartender came to us saying our next round was on the house from the boss! I was so excited and grateful for that. We both ordered Mango Margaritas which was yummy too.The ambiance was very chill and cool.. although the music could be a bit better lol. After we headed out we went to sit on the ledge by the water with the beautiful view of the Throgs Neck and Whitestone bridge.",Paddy's On the Bay
625,none,none,none,Their smoothies are great!!! So refreshing and nice!!! My favorite smoothie is D-Moon Shake. I had their vegetarian burrito once too that was really good as well!! Their smoothies really help me get through the hot days at work though.,"Cheap, fast and easy. It gets a bit rowdy so I would just order takeout. The smoothie here is amazing.","Fast Service, appeared clean though there were some flies around. You order with the ""juice lady"" and then pay at the register. There were multiple drink and size options in which you can add fresh yogurt, various nuts and honey. There were some seats if you wanted to dine in but we were on a quick lunch so was not able to. The gentleman behind the register was very helpful and even packaged up the multiple drinks nicely for our long walk. There seems to be a lot of food choices for the health conscious would like to come back another day and try their food.",Franco's
626,none,none,none,Now that my husband and I are somewhat regulars I would recommend the Chimichanga de Carnitas (shredded pork) and the Chicken Pozole! My favorite margarita is the Tamarindo Margarita!!,Love this place! The prices are very fair with the taste of the food. The margaritas aren't the strongest but I've noticed I enjoy it much more because it doesn't give a burning sensation!,"This review rating is based mainly on the service. True story loading:I came with my coworkers here after a short day. The waitress gave us the lunch menu and regular menu. The lunch special comes with a small (4-6oz.) drink. When she came to take our orders, I used the lunch special menu and pointed at the LUNCH SPECIAL burrito. I also ordered a Mezcal margarita (from the drink menu). When I finished my first drink, mid meal, I inquired about the drink that came with my lunch special meal. The waitress proceeds to tell us I never ordered a lunch special because she saw me look at the ""big menu"". Um, what? My coworker, who speaks fluent Spanish (the waitress only speaks Spanish) attempts to clear it up. She is adamant that because I looked at the ""big menu"" I will be charged for the big burrito and not the lunch special burrito (that is the same burrito my friend ordered). Make it make sense. My coworker starts to get frustrated and she tells us while walking away ""Some people will do anything for $2"". It's not about $2, its about the principle. Not only was she rude and dare I say discriminatory (because I don't speak Spanish well), but had zero common sense or professionalism. This is also not the first time I've had a bad experience with her as my waitress. I held off reviewing after my first check in but this second time let me know I wasn't crazy.The food is good. Just make sure you clarify every price and what you are getting when you order. I would say I'm not going back but I will. She will never be my waitress again though. That is for sure.",El Porton
