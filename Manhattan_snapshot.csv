0,"Mehhhhh. Overrated in my opinion.We walked in with no reservation which you prob shouldn't do given the hype surrounding this place. We were lucky enough to get a table and were given a time limit on how long we could stay, no big deal. The oysters were fresh and delicious.. service was standard.. waiter knowledgeable but to me it was overall an unmemorable mediocre dining experience.Maybe I missed something....","This place is overrated, i would give only 2 stars. We got a table through waitlist on yelp so it was very convenient and fast however food experience was not as great. We ordered crab cakes, which were good, came with spicy salad, Fettuccine with clams which was extremely oily and had so much garlic that it was impossible to eat and surf and turf which was also very oily. I love oil and garlic but this was just too much of everything.Picture quality is due to poor lighting.","Maybe it was Friday the 13th, maybe it was the full moon, the service here was just downright RUDE!  Not only were we barked orders to fill out a piece of paper for oysters but we were give a broken pencil that doesn't even write!  When we tried to get the waiter's attention he just down right ignored us.  Maybe he had something against Asians?  Sure felt pretty discriminated against especially since he was being hospitable to the Caucasian guests and curtly talking over us.  I would give this place 5 stars but the rude service just put a really bad taste in my mouth...  i don't need to be spending my money on racist and unprofessional establishments.  Oh and thank you sir for the unpleasant experience.","Had a reservation on Saturday night for dinner. Everything we ordered was incredible. We started with half a dozen oysters and the tuna tartare. Oysters were fresh and tasty. Tuna tartare was really yummy, it came served with bread but I would've enjoyed plantain chips too. For entrees, we split the scallops and grilled octopus. Both were flavorful and cooked to perfection. I want to come back for happy hour!","While it's not my new go-to place for seafood, I still liked it.Came here on a Sunday night -- made a reservation through Yelp -- and it was pretty packed. I saw some people were turned away, so definitely make a reservation just in case.My friend and I just went straight to entrees: surf and turf (hangar steak and grilled shrimp with sugar snap peas, fingerling potatoes, & balsamic reduction) and the scallops special (deep diver scallops over mushroom brown rice risotto). Both dishes were delish and what think is reasonably priced. It looks like the menu doesn't change very often, but it definitely does change. What I also love is that they only serve 7 entrees, so you can't get overwhelmed with their offerings -- and the limited menu helps to get your entrees out faster!I think the dishes are reasonably portioned -- it's not too filling, but just enough to be satisfied with the meal.Cailin's Recommendations- Surf & Turf ($20): hangar steak and grilled shrimp with sugar snap peas, fingerling potatoes, & balsamic reduction- Scallops Special ($18): deep diver scallops over mushroom brown rice risottoAgain, these items will most likely change, so get these while you can!","Unfortunately, dinner here was pretty disappointing. Maybe we ordered the ""wrong thing"" but for a restaurant that has 4.5 overall rating, I was surprised and left feeling underwhelmed.SETTING: had a reservation for dinner on Friday night at 8pm. The restaurant is very very dark. It's a tight squeeze with tables quite close together. Good ambiance for a date. Completely full on a Friday night. FOOD: we ordered 12 oysters (6 east coast, 6 west coast). These were probably the highlight of the meal And they weren't that great. We also ordered the uni (served with pieces of bread, salmon roe, raw egg) and the burrata (served with big pieces of pasta and some sweet tomato-y sauce). The uni was just not that great a dish. And I LOVE uni. It was extremely fishy (understanding it's from Maine and won't be be as mild as uni from Japan) but it just didn't taste very fresh and didn't go as well as you would think with a raw egg broken on top and mixed with salmon roe and carrot purée. The burrata was not very creamy or soft. It was also quite small and served with big pieces of pasta that did nothing with the burrata. We left the dish half eaten. VERDICT: with all the amazing seafood restaurants in the city, I just don't think Upstate was up to par. My friend agreed that she would also give 3/5 stars for the food. Probably won't be back.",Upstate
1,"The place is small and loud but that's New York! I had the crab tartine, barata, and filet mignon. The barata was phenomenal, the steak was good but not super large. I'm personally not a fan of (greasy) roasted squash and zucchini, but that's just a personal preference.","We had made reservations for a Sunday brunch (11:30 am) and the place wasn't busy at all. We were seated right away and ordered a bottle of Malbec for the table.We placed our order which included a few omelettes and I got the Amélie Lamb Burger ($16) with lettuce wrap. Service was quick and food arrived within 20 mins.Service quality itself wasn't that great. The French speaking staff especially needs some lessons on hospitality. No one checked with us if everything was ok and to our liking. We wanted some hot sauce but no one was paying attention and didn't bother coming to our table in spite if signaling a few servers.Also, when we called for check, they charged us for home fries which was clearly included with omelettes. When we flagged this error, again, the French speaking staff said, that they are not included. Finally, the nice gentleman who was at the bar corrected this error and even apologized for this error. Kind man.Food was ok.. the Lamb Burger had no salt (and guess what, salt wasn't on the table either)! So yeah, felt and looked like very authentic French place!","I'm not sure if I'm crazy or if everyone else is. I brought my mother to NY for Mother's Day Weekend and had bookmarked Amelie as one of my go-tos the next time I was in town. I had a craving for Foie Gras, made a reservation and convinced my mom to take the trek over from Midtown East. Our server was very nice and asked if we wanted to start with a drink but I was there for the food. Mom ordered the Cod and I ordered the Foie Gras (of course). When the meal came out the first thing to hit me was the smell of the fish and the second was the underwhelming looking Foie Gras. Nonetheless, I decided ""hey, I'm here, I'm hungry, may as well eat"". I ended up finding a piece of plastic in my foie gras and that's when everything went downhill. I immediately felt sick and I was DONE. We waived the server over and let him know about the plastic and he ended up being very gracious about it but it's just not enough to make me ever go back. The total ended up being $30 and change after he removed my meal and I tipped $10 because the server is obviously not at fault. Why they would serve smelly fish, I don't know. I don't know if they had an off night and I was unlucky or if this is the norm, but, I'm completely grossed out by our meal and sad that I wasted my money and time at what should have been a nice dinner in NY at this place when I could've gone anywhere else.",The food and drinks here are both delicious. We started with cocktails...both very strong. Then we did a flight of wine...definitely a must! For appetizers we had the mussels...just ok I would not recommend. We also had the tuna tartare...amazing! For dinner I had the salmon special...it was perfectly moist and seasoned. My boyfriend has the steak which was just ok...we've had better. For dessert I had the chocolate cake and my boyfriend had the creme brûlée which he said was the best he's ever had! Definitely a place worth visiting in the nyc area!,"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday earlier this month. It was something different for us since typically favor Latin American and Caribbean cuisine. But boy oh boy, was this place amazing! The flavors of each dish we ordered blew our minds. We were both so glad to have changed things up from our usual. He surprised me and it was definitely a pleasant and welcomed surprise. For appetizers we shared the Warm Pistachio Crusted Goat Cheese Ball with Honey (the flavors were to die for) and the Flatbread Topped with Portabella Mushrooms (also to die for). Every meal we had was bursting with juxtaposed flavors. So delightful and unique. For our main entrees, my boyfriend had ravioli and cheese (or mac and cheese) and I had the special of the night which were scallops and vegetables. (Had a much fancier name and ingredients than I'm describing, can't find the proper dish names on the menu). I had a pineapple flavored cocktail that I still think about. It was just that good! They really know what they are doing with their flavors both in the food and drinks. Everything was incredible.The wine of course was wonderful. My boyfriend said they are known for their wine selection and I was impressed with the different tastes and options they had. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and attentive. It can get a bit noisy in the restaurant but the lighting and decor was very romantic and intimate. I was pleased all around with the food and experience and hope to be back here one day. This place is definitely worth your time and will awaken your taste buds!","We came for our anniversary dinner. I got the first Cabernet listed on the menu and my boyfriend got an old fashioned. Neither of us really liked our drinks, but I guess that's what we get when we get the cheapest Cabernet and whiskey at a wine bar ‍We got a charcuterie board to start with goat cheese, chorizo, and prosciutto. It was pretty delicious; I think the goat cheese + jam on the baguette was my favorite thing. The best thing we had was the lamb burger. We ordered it medium rare and the juices were dripping out of it. It was sooooo good. We also got the steak frite, which was also pretty good, but not as good as the burger. Fries were ok. It's pretty loud and tight in the restaurant, so it certainly wasn't the most romantic setting. I'd come back, but not for a special occasion. The happy hour wine flight looked good, so it might be something nice to try if we come back and sit at the bar.",Amélie
2,"Came here many years ago & tried their famous Maine blueberry pancakes with maple syrup which was so delicious! I also liked their version of the chicken and waffles, but it was not the best I have tried. If you are desperate to try Clinton's famous pancakes, come on a weekday. Don't even bother going during brunch hours on the weekends.","Came here on a weekend morning for brunch, wait time was 45 minutes for a table of 4. We got 2 servings of the pancakes and 2 servings of the chicken and waffles. The pancakes were extremely fluffy, and the accompanying sauce for both the chicken and waffles dish and pancakes dish was very sweet but addicting. Would come back again if I could if not for the long wait time","To go the Brioche French Toast which i didn't think it was brioche at all and felt like it was not prepared with love. Lightly grilled on the outside and the toast was just still dry and the same throughout, quite disappointed honestly. Sweet potato fries was also a little sad, string and soggy.","I stopped by here to have brunch on my last day in NYC. Good thing I had some cash with me (I normally don't) 'cause this place is cash only for breakfast/lunch. Credit card is allowed for dinner however. A bit of annoying and arbitrary rule if you ask me. Anyway, I didn't have to wait coz it was a weekday and I opted to sit at the bar. I ordered a cup of coffee which sadly took a long time to materialize even though the bar staff was right in front of me. I ordered a side of bacon and their famous Blueberry Pancakes. The pancakes were fluffy and full of blueberries. Definitely one of the best pancakes I've had. I'm more of a savory breakfast eater, so the pancakes were a nice treat. I think next time though I will order a savory dish instead. I saw someone eating a nice Chicken Sandwich and it looked really good. Or an egg dish. I'm glad I finally got to try this place, but I wouldn't wait for an hour on the weekends just to have their pancakes. The cash only rule for breakfast also makes me want to go elsewhere.","This is probably my favorite brunch in NYC, feel spoiled by good food in there. I ordered warm syrup pancake with blueberry on the top. Unostentatious, it was the BEST pancake ever, syrup was the high light. The omelette was also awesome because of oyster mushroom and cheese!!! Very good combination. I'll definitely come again!!! Tips: cash only. :)","I've heard so much about this place over the years but knew it was notorious for their long wait times. Regardless, when my friends recommended it as the spot to catch up at I said, ""heck, why not"". All I'll say is that it was definitely worth the wait.Our party of four arrived around 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon. When we got there we informed the hostess of our group size and she said it be a 45 minute wait. Understandable given the fact that the restaurant was completely filled when we got there. I'm not sure if they take reservations, but if they do, MAKE THEM. If they don't, just get here hella early if you're not trying to wait. Our wait actually turned out to be around 30 or so minutes so if you don't mind waiting that could be an option as well.The restaurant itself has an open layout. Large windows allow for a lot of natural light to flow in so it was bright the entire time we were there. After being seated our server gave us our menu's and gave us ample time to look over them.When it came time to order I decided to go with one of the apparently popular dishes on the menu, the fried chicken & waffles ($17). It was definitely a hefty dish. Two pieces of fried boneless chicken breast on top of a very thick Belgian waffle. All of it was amazing but the honey-tabasco sauce was legit the icing on the cake. I'd highly recommend this dish if you're looking for something filling, savory, and sweet.The service here was really good too! After we placed our orders our server brought us out our drinks and after only waiting a few minutes our dishes came out to us really well prepared. The waiter informed us after the fact that though that this was a CASH ONLY spot. If he would've done so in the beginning it would've been more convenient. Overall a great brunch spot in LES. I'd come here with friends EARLY to make the most of the experience.",Clinton Street Baking Company
3,Found this place on Yelp. The pictures look nicer than the actual place. This is a hole in a wall place. Food is just decent.,"Everything is full of flavors and surprise. Rendang has crazy beef source and amazingly chewy beef chunk in it, highly recommend!",Not sure what all the rave is but I ordered a pad Thai that that didn't taste like pad Thai. I also ordered mee goreng that was definitely burnt. I couldn't even finish it and literally threw it away. Maybe I didn't order the right dishes but I don't think I'll be ordering from here again. Also order took about an hour to be delivered.,"Was here with my boyfriend one Sunday evening and I could not be happier with the food! This is Mark Wiens level lol ( if you are watch his YouTube videos). Please the the pictures attached (we ordered the Tom Yum soup, mixed seafood curry Laksa, Kao Prao Basil Sauce and the Malay spring rolls. The flavor is to die for! It's so rich and complex. The spice is just right. Even the wok does its work perfectly here. It gives the Kao Prao just the right amount of flavor.The price is very good for the experience and the staff are very friendly. Also, my boyfriend is a chef. I trust his taste buds. He has been to Thailand twice and this little spot takes him right back :)Come here for a quick weekday dinner (food comes so quickly!) or a weekend party! (Plenty of space!)","My friend and I checked out LoveMama around 6pm on a Friday.  They do not take reservations during this time, but it was not that busy!  If you can, this would be a good time to come.  The restaurant was never more than halfway full between 6pm-7:15pm.  The ambiance is like a casual diner, which matches the theme of homestyle cooking.  We ordered the Thai shumai dumpling ($6), pad see ew ($12) with beef (+$2), and the mixed seafood curry laksa ($13).  Pricing is competitive with other places in the city.  When my friend's dumplings came out, all I could focus on was that they were really small.  For $6, I would pick a more filling appetizer.  My friend had a Thai craving and either eats pad thai and pad see ew, and she liked her meal but said there was nothing distinctive or special about it.  I enjoyed the laksa.  There is definitely a kick to it, but it was not overwhelming, so I was able to taste flavor beyond the spice.  My one critique is that I didn't get the variety of seafood I was expecting (just mussels and shrimp).I was pleasantly surprised by the service here.  Our server did multiple check-backs and refilled our waters.  I do think LoveMama cares a lot about it's Yelp reputation, so they do strive to provide good customer service.  Overall, I see LoveMama as a solid choice that covers a variety of cuisines.  While nothing was mind-blowingly amazing, it's a place I would return to!","We were vacationing in New York and found this restaurant with many good reviews from Yelp. The menu is mixed with Thai, Vietnamese and Malaysian. My basic instinct told me that this might be not good. We ordered beef and chicken rendang, Roti and milk tea, everything tasted just very mediocre. The owner of restaurant asked us how we found this place and asked us to leave a good review. Well, my review is one star to food and friendly service is one star",LoveMama
4,I do not recommend this restaurant for the following reasons: - fake Vietnamese food. None of the Viet flavors are here. - prices are high for simply made and not good tasting food...-my bf had to use the restroom several times throughout the evening most likely because of the salmon(not food poisoning). The entire bowl of salmon had a very murky flavor of not so fresh fish like the salmon was sitting out for a while.- the chicken I had was dry and overcooked. It tasted like a simple and old soy sauce chickenI'm off to grab some bubble tea to rinse my palette now...,"I like the food but I don't really like pancakes it is not delicious and the waiter is ok, come ask me some time. Food is come not fast and salmon is not fresh.",It is below average. Vietnamese coffee was like water downed and portions of pho was very little.. I didn't see much vegetables. Vermicelli meat was very hard to chew. Also over priced. The place made me miss other authentic Vietnamese food in NYC. Not sure why the owner opened the Vietnamese food restaurant,"I came here with my friend last Saturday because she wanted to go to a nearby store. We came without a reservation around noon and were sat down immediately. The vibe inside Bocaphe is young and hip, casual, with cool decorations. The space in the restaurant is quite tight, but they manage to fit in alot of tables. Looking around, everyone seemed to have quite large portions and the food looked really good. I ordered the green papaya chicken salad and my friend got the veggies and tofu bo bun. I actually was looking for a lighter dish and thus was surprised when my salad came out with a very large amount of chicken. It seemed like my salad was alot more of chicken than papaya. But overall the flavor was very good, just more meat than I expected. My friend had the opposite problem. She agreed that her bo bun had great flavors but she was able to count 5 small pieces of tofu which was a bit disappointing. Overall, food was good but not perfect (maybe I just ordered the wrong thing). Vibe is cool.","We found this restaurant from the review on yelp because my friend, she wanted to eat noodles plus the style of interior is very interesting She wanted to sit in the back but the server said it is for only a big party. After we ordered everything, our service forgot our drinks order so we had to asked another server to follow up our drinks.Food is regular taste, maybe we gad too highly expectation from reading such a nice review from yelp. Salmon is not do fresh, my friend is a raw fish lover so she can tell which fresh which is not. Only thing I like about this place is the ambiance, how I feel when i sit and eat here.","I'm surprised this place has such good reviews - this was one of the times that I felt really let down by yelp reviews, cause they are fairly accurate in New York. We might as well have gone to a fast-casual place for a bowl for half the price. I ordered the lemongrass beef rice bowl, and my mother ordered the truffle beef with shiitake mushroom bowl. We also had the beef bao. Each of these dishes tasted exactly the same - like store-bought teriyaki beef. It was so disappointing and extremely expensive for what it was.My husband got the shrimp curry which was also very bland.The noise level is NOT average, it is VERY loud. Take your money elsewhere.",BoCaphe
5,"This place is a bit tricky to find. It's upstairs and is basically a suite.  I went with my boyfriend in late September 2019. We got a steak and burger. Pros: decent steak, unique burger Cons: steak was so fatty, portions were very small, plates included no sides, prices were very high, the whole place was perhaps the loudest restaurant I had been in, menu was limited. I've had much better Korean food elsewhere. This place is memorable, but not in the way the restaurant would want it to be.","Don't get me wrong the food was good, but it's not worth the wait. We ordered four dishes and they brought one dish at a time. Keep in mind, each dish is small. I came here with a group of three people, with these baby dishes coming out one at a time, so not satisfied . I would not recommend coming here if you are with a big group.","Went there yesterday with friends and family after making a reservation in yelp. Service is very good, food is very tasteful BUT in my opinion the plates are too small.",Great food and service! Would come here anytime ;)Food on pointDrinks on pointVibes on pointService on pointMusic on pointI'm tipsy on point,"Came here after seeing a dazzling 4.5 stars on Yelp. Read my friend's reviews and confidently ignored them. Here's my story...Ordered the Popcorn Chicken. A bit salty, a bit different but not that bad. A good chicken to batter ratio. Interesting concept and a good shareable dish, in my opinion. It came out hot...too hot, in fact.Next, we ordered the Anytime Salad. You guys ever watch that episode of Kitchen Nightmares where the chef grilled half a head of romaine lettuce then put some sauce over it and went voila? This salad was served with a fork and knife. Baffled me, honestly. Then I saw the salad. It was half a head of romaine lettuce with the different toppings and sauce. While aesthetics are important, so is the ability to comfortably eat food. Gordon Ramsay would've disapproved. BUT, I'm a man of optimism. And to be fair, it tasted pretty good. The Bossam. Ordered two. The first one was great, interesting sauce and some swollen rice (I forgot what it's called but for now, it's called swollen rice or oats). The Bossam melted in your mouth! But the second one was a jokbal. The difference in the texture and how it felt was noticeable. Finally, the Anytime steak. It was not good. There was a lot of fat on it and the dressings, garnishes and sauce only made it saltier than it already was. Overall, while it is an interesting concept, it was fairly overpriced. I expected bigger dishes but unless you're here to impress a date, reap the benefits of 32nd street to the fullest.","It's really hard to decide what to love most about Anytime.  Here are all my favorites that tied for the gold medal, center podium.  The location.  Nondescript entrance leads you to elevator up to the third floor that opens straight into a beautifully designed dining space.  Smartly fitting many patrons with out feeling cramped.The menu.  Both food and drink. Wow, first thing you notice is the reasonable prices.  It's a thoughtful paired down menu where everything that comes out of the kitchen doesn't disappoint.  Get the idea cocktail  The food.  Exceptional.  Stars were the squid ink popcorn chicken and the seafood stir fry (that I could seriously eat everyday). And the pork belly with the coconut soy sauce was a not far runner up. The staff.  They truly treat you like family and go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your dining experience...without being invasive.  This will be a spot I add to my list to recommend to all that come to NYC.  Gold medal all around (Queue Korea National Anthem)",Anytime
6,Love tha ambiance of this modern Korean fare.  Reserve thru Yelp so we did not wait.  We sat in the back near the kitchen it is a tad bit more quiet.  We ordered 5 dishes for the two of us.  We had a tempura based roll with an aioli.  Then a soft shell crab deep fried with home made tartar and a hint of truffle oil.  Then we had a bulgogi stone bowl followed by a crispy fried chicken bun and lastly their homemade vegetarian dumplings.  Highlights were the soft shell and the chicken bao. The sauce on and texture of the bao made the dish.  The soft shell crab I would order it again then had a way to keep it crunchy without getting soggy.Sorry for the lack of pics - was really hungry!,"We have been to the union sq location before and this was our first time here.There was a wait time of around 45 min and we waitlisted on yelp before reaching there.When we reached the place there was still a wait of 15-20 min but we were seated at the bar.We ordered a few drinks and chicken wings.Our table was ready by the time we finished our drink.The garlic parmesan chicken wings were yummy.Perfectly crunchy and sticky on the outside and juicy on the inside.We ordered fried chicken bao,kimchi udon mad chicken hot stone bowl for our mains.Everything was soo delicious.The service was quick and efficient.Must try if you are in the neighborhood.","First time at this location. I loved the other one but this one does not compare! I brought my friends here for lunch and we all left disappointed. We didn't even want the leftovers because nothing was that good. The jap chae was really bland. Truffle fries lacked truffle flavor. Soft-shell crab was underwhelming. Crunchy tofu was ok, but did not taste like kimchi.In conclusion, we ate, but reluctantly. I was pretty embarrassed I brought them here","This place is amazing! A modern take on Korean. The food was flavorful and well presented. I will be back for more!!They have multiple soju drinks that you can get in a flight and man are they tasty! The chicken wings were cooked perfectly. They were crispy and flavorful. The chicken fondue was delicious. The chicken was good enough to be eaten alone. The fondue was just the right portion. The pork buns were amazing, the perfect bun!Everything we got was delicious and the staff was attentive and accommodating. This is a definite visit again restaurant.","I was going to give Barn Joo 35 three stars because something intangible left me....unsatisfied. And I can't quite pick out what it was. The restaurant staff was wonderful, very knowledgeable, patient and quick.  I had the bulgogi hot stone bowl, chicken buns and truffle fries. The food wad presented beautifully and very Instagram-worthy. It ticked all the boxes! But I had much higher expectations from a restaurants with as many raving yelp reviews as Barn Joo. I think the issue was that the food while presented beautifully, tasted meh and overall was heavily fried and lacked essential flavor. I'm told the union square location is bigger and better but have never been. In the end, I gave barn joo four stars because my husband thought it deserved five and so we split the difference :))","Came here on a Monday night after work for a quick meal with friends. We have heard so much buzz about this Korean gastropub we just had to try it! First off, the location is great, especially if you commute via train (it's a 10 minute walk from Penn). Make a reservation, no matter what day of the week. The restaurant is two levels, and it started filling up around 6pm, as they have a happy hour menu. The four of us were seated, and our waiter brought us water and menus. Their food options were so unique and trendy. We opted for a few appetizers, because they all looked delicious. We ordered the crispy chicken buns, calamari and Parmesan fries. Boy did the appetizers not disappoint!!!  They were fresh and super flavorful!For our meals, we all ordered something different. I opted for the NY Bites, which was smoked beef and potatoes. It was alright, nothing be excited about. Once i was time for dessert, we were excited. We ordered the cheesecake with fresh fruit, a churro bowl with vanilla ice cream, and the chocolate lava cake. They were delicious, and a big serving.All in all, the food was okay, but the appetizers took the cake. The prices are on the higher side, but that's expected for a trendy, fresh Korean gastropub. Would want to try something new next time!! Service was great!",Barn Joo 35
7,the ambiance and the food is no doubt very good. but rude inefficient women at the booking table ruined our Saturday evening. they don't take reservations on Friday & SATURDAY. we arrived at 6:45pm and put our name down for the expected wait - 45mins. we left our contact number and went down the block for drinks at another bar. At 8:30pm we received a message from them - more than an hour and a half later to come for your table. we settled our tab at the other bar and walked back - it took us 18 mins. when we reached we were told the table was given to another party as their policy is to hold the table is 10 mins. this last message was NOT conveyed to us at the time of name placement nor when they called us.result they have lost loyal customers due to pathetic and incredibly rude arrogant women who were managing the clients. another issue I felt is that their language skills require polishing.,I came here for my friend's birthday awhile ago. The food was good however it was also too spicy for my taste buds.,"There's no other disappointment when you pick a restaurant with a high number of reviews, then come to find out after waiting over an hour to be seated that the food quality is quite poor.2 Stars! I love Thai food, been to Thailand and decided to go here on Valentine's Day. Not sure what the chefs were doing in the kitchen this day. The food was such a complete disappointment. The only two dishes that were subpar was the papaya salad and the curry puffs.The Pad Krapraw was the most bland and flavorless dish that I've ever had at any Thai restaurant in my life. Very bad. This dish is supposed to be flavorful and spicy and honestly it was neither of the two. Never experienced a more bland dish at any Thai establishment. Guess they never heard of salt or pepper??The Royal Pad Thai, was definitely not royal in any sense of the word. It was just ok!Not sure why this place is hyped, maybe I caught them on a bad day however I cannot even give these guys another chance! My suggestion would be to go somewhere else",My girlfriend surprised me with this place for my birthday and WOW! Some of the best Thai food I have ever eaten in my life. The menu is separated between 'regular' Thai recipes that you could get at any other Thai place and the 'royal' recipes... I got the royal pad Thai and it was amazing. The presentation was amazing. The ambience was great too. A little pricey for asian food but definitely worth it. Definitely make a reservation here if you plan on getting in and out quick.,"This place gets A LOT of traffic as can be seen from their excessive wait times. My friend brought me here as a birthday surprise and she used the Yelp ""add yourself to the waitlist"" online feature so we were seated a few minutes after we arrived since it was our turn. Otherwise you can expect to wait over an hour at peak times (dinner). The place is very classy and well decorated so I can see why there's so much hype around it. The staff also runs like a well oiled machine, which is definitely necessary for a place like this. However, I have to say that efficiency also removes away from the personal experience of dining here. I felt somewhat rushed and like I was part of a conveyor belt of customers coming in and going out. The food was delicious and came out incredible fast so there aren't any complaints there. I just wish I kinda had a chance to slow down and not feel like my table was needed ASAP. I might return again because the food was good, but maybe at an off peak time.",5 stars for the service5 stars for the drinks5 stars for the interiorCon:The food was beautiful but didn't stood out for me much. I enjoyed the tom yum soup though. Don't get the: Blue DumplingsFried fish in the picture Wrapped lotus leaf thing Drinks were amazing if you like sweet and sour cocktails,Thai Villa
8,"Still amazing place, amazing food. The waiter was actually kinda rude this time around, which is weird considering last time I went a few months ago, he was my waiter and super nice then. I'd give him the benefit of the doubt but I still haven't understood why waiters will be rude to you knowing they are working off of your tips (I've had my share of bad days as a waitress in the past and it was never worth losing on tips). So despite the below average service THIS time around, JPs will always be #1 in my heart. Slash this was my first time trying something other than the shrimp and grits or veggie omelette so I had to make a new post. Got the fish tacos, absolutely delicious !!!! How could it really be otherwise though....(And no walk is too long for JPs, even one from long island. THAT worth it. Period)","I've made so many mistakes when it comes to Jacob's Pickles...I spent some time on the Upper West Side a couple years ago; Jacob's Pickles always popped up top of page when I searched for restaurants in my vicinity. I had the erroneous misconception of it being a stodgy, quiet eatery when the opposite is actually true. Jacob's Pickles has a booming energy that spills out onto the street. My first mistake is not coming in sooner. A couple weeks ago I finally decided to try Jacob's Pickles on a Friday evening. Our wait time was minimal & when we were seated, it was at one of the communal picnic benches in the back room. This restaurant is more spacious than the crowded front bar area lead me to believe. We each ordered a Southern biscuit fried chicken sandwich & soon saw how foolish we had been; the portions are such that three of us could have shared one (not that anyone's counting but this is mistake #2.) $17 each for my Honey Chicken & Pickles and the Hot Chicken Biscuit (you want this Nashville hot sauce!) & $18 for the Southern BLT which stars the incredible fried green tomato. All accompanied by an addictive side of salty, buttery grits. Not ordering some variety of their namesake food (cukes, beets, carrots, jalapeños, even eggs, etc.), thinking the pickles on our sandwiches would suffice -- well, that was my third mistake. As tables received their orders of colorful pickled veggies, I resigned myself to my meal devoid of any pickley assortment. My being a flawed individual benefits you. You now know to go to Jacob's Pickles ASAP, share the monster-sized southern biscuit sandwich, & order the pickles. It ain't called Jacob's Pickles for nothing.",This spot is fun! It's a bit over priced and the food is good but not as great as everyone told me it would be. I live in New York and I'd say this is a great spot for tourists (and that seemed to be who was in line with us)! We had a good meal and enjoyed everything. The servings are giant and very heavy so no need to order a ton or different things. The vibe inside is great and loved that!! Service was great!,"So my rating will never change. NEVER!!but I'll keep reviewing because every visit is so wonderfully exceptional.I haven't been here since December 2016. I know, I'm terrible. The fact that this visit was the first time I checked-in was riduc, but clearly I've got the reviews to prove the number of visits.I came after brunch on a Sunday. I started off with a Flying mule (with aviation gin) and boy was it strong AF. Delicious but strong. Obviously I had to get a second one. Obvi.To eat, I ventered out and ordered the Caesar salad with fried chicken. Yum!! Out came with biscuit cheese bread that was delicious. The portions are insane and even for a bulimic, it's a lot (today was my binge day and I failed).The service was great! Especially the bartender who got my first drink and who clearly reads Mr mind because just as I was thinking about water, he gives me a glass of water.This place will always be my number one in the world.Finally bought a shirt. Can't wait to wear it. It comes with a mason jar!! The shirt feels so freaking soft","Two years!!! That's how long I had to wait till I was able to come back to this fine establishment. And during that time, I ate my way through the South, still not finding any food that even remotely compared to JPs. In my opinion, if you want the best southern food, stay in NYC. No point going down to the South. You'll just be disappointed. I had my ""usual"", the egg white veggie omelette with home fries that were even better than I remembered. The service was fantastic and the food excellent! I'm only here for a month, but expect to see me every weekend.","You know a place is absolutely revitalizing and scrumptious when even their condiments - jams, butter, maple syrup butter and even their ketchup - tastes like heaven melting in your mouth.  So you can only imagine how the rest of the food tastes. We went for brunch and ordered the egg white veggie omelet with the side potatoes...sigh...I'm trying to figure out how many times i can go back to this place every day without being judged for it.  Until then...a must go.",Jacob's Pickles
9,"Cash only!Solid place to get udon. I ordered the ankake egg drop udon. The udon noodles are top quality, pretty chewy. The egg drop thickens the broth and the freshly chopped green onions are a nice touch. The only downside here is the miso pork. I ordered it as a side to go with my carb heavy dinner, but it was way too salty. The entire thing is doused in sesame oil and feels gross to down all at once.","More of a 3.5/5. Disclaimer, I didn't order the udon. It's 80-90 degrees on average in the city and I'm not the type to eat hot udon soup in this type of weather. I ordered the oyako don ($13) and it was just okay/good. Not great. It had way too much rice for the amount of chicken in there. Side note: there is also no cold AC in the tiny restaurant, so our 12:30pm lunch was very, very hot. I'm not sure why it wasn't working that day or if that's normal. That day, their deep fryer was also broken so we couldn't order the Katsu don. Overall, it was a whatever experience considering there are so many great places to pick from in NYC!",Looks pretty but salty to eat. I ordered Niku (udon with beef) and it was too salty. I even feel uncomfortable and cannot finish my meals. This place is cash only and ask for 18% gratuity. Not recommend.,"The best udon in Manhattan! The restaurant is small but cozy, great for a casual dinner. Did not try the fried chicken but I've heard from multiple people that it's fantastic. I had the Niku Udon - normally I skip tripe but this was so flavorful and surprisingly light. The udon bowls are definitely sizable and absolutely worth the trip.","This place is probably the best place to get Udon, especially with the cold weather coming in. Coming in, we almost missed the place because there wasn't a major sign outside saying it was the restaurant. The place is small, cozy, and very minimalistic but chic. Utilizing the waitlist they have on Yelp is really useful since there isn't much tables to sit at. They have around 12 tabletops and a stool sitting area near the door.For food, I ordered the Sansai udon with a side of shrimp tempura. I could barely finish my bowl of soup with how filling the serving size was. You can tell how fresh their ingredients and noodles are with every bite, and how rich in flavor their broth was. This definitely satisfied my could weather soup cravings.The total can out to be $19 total, $13 for the soup and $6 for the shrimp tempura add on, without tip. Just a heads up, they are cash only but they have an ATM in the restaurant.","Raku doesn't live up to the hype but it's still pretty damn good. This spot literally blew up my instagram so naturally, I had to see for myself what all the fuss was about. The wait for my party of four was 40 minutes! We decided to just wait it out because I wasn't too hungry and was feeling extra patient that day (LOL).The restaurant doesn't have an awning so it's pretty difficult to locate. My cousin who was meeting us there was walking back and forth down the street because the location was so obscure. There's a tiny menu posted outside of the restaurant but apart from that, there were no other indicators that'll tell you that you've indeed arrived at the right place. When we finally got to the noodle shop, I was shocked to discover how tiny the restaurant is. The restaurant could only seat a handful of parties so we felt like we were being rushed out as soon as we finished our meal. I get it, they have to turnover tables much faster because of the seating limitations. This wasn't a dealbreaker for me because it's not exactly a place you'd want to lounge around in.Service-wise, there's not much to say. Our waitress was neither friendly nor rude, just quick and efficient. I tried the two most popular noodle soups: the niku udon and the curry udon with beef. I thought the niku broth was a little on the bland side but the bowl comes with huge, generous chucks of stewed beef and tripe. So delicious! The curry broth was very aromatic. I enjoyed it but my mom couldn't stand it (she's very picky when it comes to her curries). The highlight of my dish was the udon. It's far better than your average udon! The texture of the noodle was so good and perfectly chewy, just the way I like it. We also ordered the pork gyoza, which was a mistake. It was bland and uninteresting. I ate one and decided that they weren't worth the extra calories.The complimentary frozen grapes at the end of our meal were a great touch! Such a great palette cleanser! I would recommend giving this spot a go but don't forget to bring cash!",Raku
10,Unbeatable prices for the qualityHighly recommend the classics (1.5 lobsters + burger),"Consider the lobster. I have several friends who balk at consuming these creepy, crawly, bug-like crustaceans. ""They're bottom feeders! The roaches of the sea!!"" they exclaim. Sure, but they're damn tasty, these bugs.If the humane transportation and killing of the lobsters concerns you, B&L does purport to be at the forefront of lobster technology, putting them into a comatose state and then killing them within 5 seconds (versus the 12-15 seconds it usually takes to kill them at home, which I have never tried. eek). I'm mildly comforted by this. Maybe that's why the lobster rolls here are so much tastier than some of the plain, flavorless ones I've had elsewhere in town. For $20 you get a good amount of meat per lobster roll, plus a side salad AND fries. You read that right, you get both. Plus, they toast and butter the roll itself, making for a very good lobster roll. I crave it all the time.",I got the burger and lobster combo which to me wasn't that worth it. It was tasty with portions a bit on the smaller side. Comes with an unnecessary side salad. It was good but not anything spectacular. It is worth it to try it once but I don't think I'll come back,"First meal in New York on a Saturday evening. Had a reservation at 8pm, figuring dinner time would be busiest on a weekend. We arrived at 7:30pm and the restaurant was not too busy... yet!I ordered the Original (lobster is in its name so I had to) and V ordered the Portobello mushroom burger. The food arrived about 10-15 minutes after. Talk about some fast service!I started with the side of fries. V described them as McDonald's fries which was spot on. Quite salty for my liking. The lobster was pretty good. I don't normally eat lobster so I don't really know what to compare it to but the garlic butter with the lobster was delicious! I took a few bites of V's burger and was not a huge fan of it. The bottom patty got soggy too quickly and I had to eat it with a knife and fork to prevent myself from eating like a slob. V enjoyed it more than me, but that's probably because I am not a huge fan of portobello mushrooms. Lobster was good. I would definitely go back here again for the Original. Just make sure to make a reservation if you want to skip the lines!","Attended a baby shower at B&L and the food was good and ok. For the life of me, I can't figure out why would you serve cold food. Cold fries and burgers. I ask the young sassy ass waiters about the getting warm food and she replied ... ""Yeah once the cold ones are done!"" I mean... Really?","Burger & Lobster is truly undefeated. I've been meaning to try them out for years now, and I'm kicking myself for not trying them out sooner.  My dining experience here was absolutely fabulous!  As soon as I walked in I was immediately seated and had my order taken. I was also checked up on several times throughout my meal. After looking over the menu, I couldn't decide between a burger or lobster so ultimately, I figured the best bang for my buck would be the ""combo for 1"" which includes a 6oz burger cooked however you like (I got mine cooked medium), a whole 1lb lobster (which they crack most of open for you), a side salad, french fries, and the most delicious garlic butter sauce in a ladle, all for just $35. OMG, everything was splendiferously divine! The burger was nice, flavorful, and juicy. The lobster was succulent, and even the fries and salad were amazing (especially when I poured that garlic butter sauce all over them).All in all, Burger and Lobster in Flatiron needs to be a stop for any foodie that finds themselves in New York City. UGH, it's just SO good!",Burger & Lobster
11,"2.75/5 if I'm feeling generous. I came back here for lunch for a birthday meal, and was left feeling so disappointed by the food. I did order different things from the menu, but the expectation vs reality hit really hard with this restaurant. Could be that Boucherie really only excels at confit duck and steak frites (or just any beef dish?) If that's the case, I'm really disappointed and unfortunately, would not be returning. Escargot ($10): nowhere did it say on the menu that these would be served to me WITHOUT the shells. I legit thought I was getting the whole experience of picking out my own snail meat! Instead, what came to our table was a circular plate of snail meat drenched in butter, garlic, and other herbs. Tasteless and oily - that summed up the escargot. Chefs literally did not even bother to add salt. Squid Ink Linguine ($19): was gutted by this one because for the life of me, I wasn't expecting a tomato sauce for the squid ink pasta (the menu just said ""& tomatoes""), and unfortunately, that sauce ruined the dish. The difference between squid ink and regular linguine was lost on me - could barely taste it, and it also wasn't as black as expected. Shrimp was perfect, but calamari was just so-so. Overall, disappointing executive and pasta was a little on the lumpy/overcooked side. Red Wine Braised Beef ($18): saving grace of the meal, this braised beef was tender enough, and flavor was infused that it was yummy to eat. Veryyyy generous portion, but not fond of the vegetable choices. You can see the thinly sliced celery as the greens of the dish awkwardly placed on top","My dad and his girlfriend came in from out of town and wanted to eat steak frites. I had heard that the steak frites here were good and despite having a pretty unmemorable brunch experience here before I decided to chance it again due to the high ratings and having only had the tuna nicoise here.We started with a bottle of red wine and the mussels. The mussels were very decadent with a heavy cream sauce, white wine and bacon. If you like this sort of dish, it was pretty enjoyable - 4 stars. We then ordered two orders of the steak frites for the 3 of us. This dish is the reason for my low review of this restaurant. The steak while flavorful, was tough and difficult to chew. The French fries were also not very good and we ended up leaving behind the second order of them. Unfortunately would not recommend coming here for the steak frites - this was a solid 2.5 or 3 meal for everyone at my table which is unacceptable at this price point. I felt so disappointed that I was unable to give my dad the steak frites experience he wanted. At the end we got the apple tart with vanilla ice cream which was also not up to our expectations. A 3 at best, this would also be a dish to avoid at this establishment. Just a note the tables here are impossibly small and my dad's girlfriend ended up spilling wine all over herself. I don't think the small tables should be used for parties of 3 but that may just be me.",Came here for the winter restaurant week and the food was okay. The best item on that menu was the mussels with bacon. The sauce was tasty and we dipped all the available bread in the sauce. My boyfriend and I both got the steak frites and the steak was too tough even though we had it cooked medium. The dessert was probably the worst part of the meal. Don't get the tart unless you like sour apples.,"Wow. This was honestly one of the BEST meals I've had in a long time! Everything was literally perfect from the moment we walked in , to the service (our server Akin was very nice & attentive) to everything we ate.We made reservations for 2 an hour prior , which was available on Yelp - showed up at 9:15pm and it was very busy with a couple of tables available . They placed us at a table inside which was what we preferred , and it was next to the opening of the patio seating so we got the best of both worlds.We ordered:- steak tartare: 5/5 it was amazing! Better than most of the steak tartare we had in Paris. It came with a quail egg you pour on top which was pretty cool. - foie gras mousse: 4.5/5 it was really good and smooth , and fluffy ; it just needed a little bit of salt which we added to it and then it was perfect!- steak frites: 5/5 it was phenomenal! I think it might've been one of the best steaks Ive ever had. We ordered medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. It wasn't too bloody either , and the quality of the steak was amazing. Especially for a NY strip. The peppercorn sauce was very tasty and the fries were perfect and crispy too .Overall it was an amazing experience and I will definitely make sure to always come back to this restaurant whenever I make a trip to New York. We are so glad we came across this place!","I went for lunch to Boucherie West Village, I love French food and for a while I wanted to check one of their great location in NYC. It turned to be a little bit disappointing. I requested the outside area as the day was too beautiful to stay in. They have a lunch menu and also lunch specials on the board in the entrance of the restaurant, but if you have a short memory or if you don't spot it coming in you'll probably miss it as there is not physical copy of it on the table neither is repeated by the waiter. It took a little bit to take my order and the restaurant was almost empty and it took even more aprox 20-25 to bring a glass of wine to my table and I think is general thing as the table in front of me got the wine when they were completely finished ! I got Bœuf Bourguignon and I saw food passing by to tables sat after me and nothing of my food. It took forever! My understood is that Bœuf B has to be prepared in advance, as it takes hours to be fully cooked! But never mind! I was enjoying my ""ok"" Cote du Rhône . Bread and butter was served to everybody but me, I don't know maybe was the fact that I was alone, food finally came and I asked bread and butter to the busboy who kindly brought it and also ground some fresh pepper in my food. Food presentation was good but the Bœuf  Bourguingon itself was a little tasteless, I have tried it several times even cooked it at home and always there is this explosion of flavor, such explosion did not happen, it was just ok, perhaps I little bit more of sauce would have been great cause you run out of sauce very quick trying to add flavor to the meat. Almost finishing my food, the question was asked! Everything ok sir? Of course I was almost done, but nothing seemed to bother me as I had my view which was worthy. I don't even bother to ask for dessert or another glass of wine ( neither I was asked) anyway at their steps it would have been diner by the time it arrivedStill the place is beautiful, has a lot of space, but I don't wanna be there when it gets full. Something I give to the place it's very relaxed! I felt almost invisible which is sometimes appreciated.","I was excited to experience the Boucherie restaurant upon reading its wonderful reviews. The food is amazing, however the service was not (it was a Monday late afternoon). The waiter forgot my little cousins milk and a supposedly her special order of pasta and butter was made incorrectly. I ordered the ""moules frites"" which were suppose to come with French fries and if I had not asked for them they probably wouldn't have came. What happened to being attentive to paying client/s and acknowledging that mistakes were made and being apologetic. I'm crossing my fingers that they redeem themselves by offering a discounted rate and/or dessert on the house.EDIT: After the fact, waiter apologized and arrived at the table with 3 delicious desserts, which made my cousins truly happy! Dessert always makes everything sweeter!!!",Boucherie West Village
12,"My girlfriend and I selected this spot for our biweekly brunch tradition in her neighborhood~ Right off the bat, you will notice that their menu prices are suspiciously expensive for both food and drinks. Although the coffee was good and their décor charming, tables are positioned wayyyy too close together - you can't have a conversation without the people next to you hearing every single word!Our waitress was snooty and impersonal, and the food was just alright? Definitely not worth $22 each for my shrimp & grits or my friend's chicken & waffle. And who in their right mind charges $13 for a weak mimosa that comes in a tiny glass? Uglyduckling... sit down, be humble.",The food was so subpar. The service was incredibly subpar because they had one waiter for the whole restaurant. We sat for nearly 20 minutes and had to ask for the menu because no one came to greet us. We had to pay for bread and butter AND it came out AFTER our meals. My friend was told that she would get 'English Breakfast' tea and they brought her Lipton. Anything we asked for took more than twice as long as usual to get. The chicken lacked flavor and was cooked too hard in some spots. It's a beautiful space so it's really a shame it's so subpar in every other way. I see why it was empty....I recommend maybe going for drinks but keep your expectations to a minimum for nearly everything else.,"Not sure what happened since I first came here. Recently came back with friends and ordered the chicken and waffle which was bland. Chicken was overcooked, dry and tough to chew. Waffle was deep fried and had resembled more of a funnel cake than waffle. This wasn't bad...just different. Friends orders were mixed up numerous times. No one really enjoyed their food. Notable was the mac and cheese which was very watery and lacked flavor, very bland.Perhaps I'll give this place another shot down the line, no time soon thougb.","I really really love the layout and design of the uglyduckling and the tall window french door at the entrance is breathtaking, I love it!Came here during the week for lunch with a good friend of mine and both enjoyed our time here. The restaurant has lots of seating with tall wooden chairs and tables. They have a wide range of items on their menu with the option to eat by both land and sea. For our drinks I had Rosemary's Mule and she had the Aperol Spritz both cocktails tasted good. Rosemary's Mule has ginger in it and at the same time not overpowering the entire taste of the drink. I then had a Salmon with a cucumber salad, avocado, roasted corn and tomatoes. This was a perfect meal sizing , salmon was well done and the salads to go along with it was a perfect pair.  My friend had the grilled chicken sandwich and curly fries, it looked so good and she enjoyed it as well. I mean how wrong can you get with a sandwich ‍This is one of the stand out restaurants on the busy and popular Smith Street.Definitely give them a try! I will be back!","Good selection of beers. The best lagers and ales. Friendly bartenders and an owner who always had a smile.The service was lacking, however. When at table with service I've had to go up to the bar to get further rounds.","Took my friend there for brunch...had a reservation for 1PM, but it was unnecessary as the place wasn't hopping yet.Food was the perfect mix of homestyle and upscale.  Staff took great care of us, gave me lots of water refills.The rain made us stay for dessert and we had the lemon cake with blueberry compote...much to our delight.",Uglyduckling
13,"Oh no, everything was just horrible. This is my second time here, and it was so bad. Service: the Italian festival just started so they were BUSY, but only had ONE waiter for 10 tables upstairs!! And there were two bus boys for entire restaurant?! Our table was so wobbly, they didn't fix it until halfway through our meal, and we never got our lemons! The waiter was so busy/ careless he charged me $160 for a $63 meal. We waited 10 minutes but he never came back to our table. Additionally, he didn't apologize when I went up to him to correct the error. So rude!Food: The pasta was tiny! The plate was not deep at all, it was so shallow! My friend made a custom pasta and the sauce was good but the portions were hilarious. Also, I got the burrata and it was NOT burrata. It looked like feta.... *they're doing construction atm so it's difficult to navigate the space.  Not accessible. There are stairs to go down into their new makeshift entrance.","HOME MADE PASTA!Pasta is the thing here in this funky Little Italy bistro.     The deal is you pick your pasta and your sauce and pasta magic occurs.  And it did.   I had carbonara, Beloved  Offspring marina and we are both still enjoying our carb high.  So why not 5 stars?Service nice but slow because they were obviously painfully understaffed on a Saturday  night.Our salad was fatally overdressed and kinda brown.   On the up side, they swiftly took it off the bill.We will go back",Underwhelming. Strange because the spaghetti was the size of udon--never seen that before. Service was slow. Nothing too special. Probably would not come back?,"This was by far the best pasta I have had in the entire United States, only surpassed by what I've had in Italy herself. Aunt Jake's is an intimate, refined Italian place in Little Italy that features handmade build your own pastas  (pick a pasta type + sauce from a generous list) as well as pasta specialties, wine list, and weekend brunch. The atmosphere was comfortable and classy, and while the service felt slow, we also came on a weekend night at prime dinner time and were tided over with delicious complementary garlic breadsticks.I simply cannot articulate well enough how unbelievably amazing this pasta was. Everything we ordered was so incredibly good. I polished off my tagliatelle with the roasted garlic sauce way too quickly because it was just too delicious. The carbonara and Sunday meat sauce were equally amazing. The prices were typical for an NYC Italian dinner, but both the individual and family sized portions were well worth it. Can't recommend enough!","I came right when they opened & asked for a table in the back garden - it's so beautiful & colorful! Ambiance was nice & brunchy, service was kind. You get to customize your pastas (& by customize I mean choose your noodle & choose your sauce) & their white wine sangria made me happy :) Although, that being said, the food came a little slower than I had hoped...but also probably cause I was starving. Pecorino Truffle FriesCrispy & yummy. Perfect side for everyone! Would definitely order again whenever I come. Spaghetti with Arrabiata Sauce - Noodles made from Semolina, Durum Flour, and Olive Oil with Tomato Sauce with Chili Pepper & Roasted GarlicI know it's spaghetti, but the simplicity just boosted its yumminess & because the arrabiata sauce was killer. Plus, I love that little kick & garlic is always a good idea, even though sometimes it's not :) Tagliatelle with Broken Meatball Sauce - Long Medium Width Noodle made from Semolina with House Tomato Sauce with the Addition of Broken MeatballsNoodles were cooked nicely & the sauce was awesome. Also, the tomatoes were oddly heavenly. I feel like I was drooling while eating. Porchetta Hash with Poached Egg and Calabrian Chile HollandaiseVery brunch with the potatoes, onions, & peppers! I think it was a tad salty & yet still flavorful. But the poached egg was perfect, loved the oooooze~","The San Gennaro festival happening in Little Italy right now was crazy crowded and very touristy. So instead of eating from a vendor, we stopped in for dinner at Aunt Jake's. It was a good choice!There was no wait for a table for 2 at 8:00 PM. We sat upstairs in a nice dining room that overlooked the festival crowd below.Service was attentive and our food was good. Not the best pasta we've ever had, but it was pretty good and the portions are huge. Two people could easily split a single pasta.We had the tagliatelle + garlic pecorino sauce ($19), as well as the cavatelli + Sunday sauce ($22). Both were expensive but given the portion size, it didn't seem too crazy.Overall, I'm sure there's better pasta to be had in NYC, but this is a great choice if you're in/near Little Italy and looking for a big portion of good pasta.",Aunt Jake's
14,"I was disappointed from beginning to end.  We traveled all the way from Florida to get their famous soup dumplings.  It was my husband first time in NYC and would be his first time trying soup dumpling.  I wanted this experience to be a good one for him since I've had soup dumplings before and from Joe's Shanghai. And it's was great then.  When we got to the restaurant, the hostess was plenty rude.  We understand there is a long wait and was ok with that.  We place our name on the list and we proceed to sit on the bench that was empty and available inside the restaurant.  I was told to get up and wasn't allow when asked why, the hostess said it's for the people that are ahead of us and they are waiting onside so we would have to wait outside too because it's unfair to those that are here before us.  I didn't understand the concept.  I asked if they knew that these seats were available, she said yes.  Because the people ahead of me chooses to wait outside, why do I have to wait outside especially I was 6 months pregnant and it's hard for me to be on my feet for a long time.  She basically told we had to wait outside while the bench is not being used.  It was plain stupid and unreasonable but did not want to argue any further so we waited outside standing in the hot summer heat.  We finally got seated after 30 mins.  At this point I was tired, hot, hungry, thirsty and upset so I just want to get our drinks and food.  We ordered two ice waters and the water was warm, they didn't put enough ice so ice were melted by the time it reach our table.  The soup dumplings taste terrible and fishy.  We got the pork and crab dumplings.  Can't even taste the filling inside.  It's was mush and didn't taste right at all.  There were 6-8 dumplings in an order, we couldn't even finish it.  We probably had two each.  We didn't order anything else after that.  Just paid for our bills and left.  Never coming back here again.",This place was legit old school chinese restaurant.  Located in a seedy wet alley looking street which seems as if one will be getting into a kung fu fight coming out of the restaurant just as on the old kung fu movies. I had the Shanghai noodles and pork dumplings...ate the entire plate of noodles and about 6 dumplings.  So delicious. Authentic chinese cuisine.,"Those soup dumplings  are in my top 20 favorite things I've ever put in my mouth.  That's coming from a non meat /non pork - high vegetable mostly raw vegan southwestern freakzoid that talks much shit about mysteriously sourced food.  I wholesomely love those dumplings with every cell of my body.  I want to be the soup dumplings.  I must become them again.   I waited forty minutes to be seated as a single diner to a communal round table deep in the back of the restaurant.  I was crammed in with all the other non Chinese people.  I didn't care about any of that.  None of it bothered me, the service was whatever.  Those dumplings were all I wanted and needed in that time and I didn't know it till I had them. Juicy, popping delicious explosiveness happened inside me.  I ordered more food but those soup dumplings were all I need.  Those dumplings are all I need.  I want your dumplings Joe!  I need them.  Ah!","*CASH ONLY; 15% TIP INCLUDED IN BILL*This place has the best soup dumplings in the city!

Will definitely return!","BEWARE... Tourist Trap!!Excited to try NYC's famous Xiaolongbao's, I went straight towards the place with the most reviews. Deep in Chinatown, I was confident this place would deliver. But when I looked around inside, there was not a single local. The xiaolongbaos were large, much bigger than the ones from Din Tai Fung. The wrapper was also noticeably thicker. The dumplings were decent but definitely not worth the hype. The leek pancakes on the hand were surprisingly good. They weren't particularly special, but they did taste better than the dumplings. Try another place for  xiaolongbaos!!!","It's funny, I can't even remember what movie I was watching yesterday, but one of the very first scenes, Joe's popped up on a driveby.  And mind you, the movie was filmed in the early 90's.  So, even back then, this place was prevalent.  Honestly, with how busy this place is, I am shocked there isn't more than 10-15K Yelp reviews.With that being said, I went on a trip to NY a few months ago with my friends from the Bay.  I wanted to show them what was up with the food scene in NYC.  After gorging on all sorts of stuff, We managed to fit Joe's in on a Saturday night, before they closed.This place sits in an alley, which, at first glance, it looks terrifying.  Don't worry, the locals just hang out on the street smoking weed (the young ones), and the older ones playing games and singing passing around a bottle of vodka.  With that being said, I didn't feel threatened.While you wait (which, I would presume 90% of the time there is one), you get a raffle ticket- that is their queue system.  The place is small, so, your best bet is to hang out on the street and soak up the aromas of New Orleans-esque odors (aka sewage).  You may even catch a kitchen staff member or two just sitting outside chillin.  They keep saying this place is cash only (they have an ATM, so do places down the street if you need one)- however, they may have upped their game.  Needless to say, the whole visit was confusing (and I was sober too), so, bring enough cash (or a loaded debit card) to be safe.  There were 5 of us, and it looked like we shared a table.  I swear, if they could fit 8 at our table, they would.  With that being said, this place is very, intimate.  One of my buddies is even taller than me, and I was cramped- so I could only imagine how it felt for him.I ordered the XLB via seafood and meat, along with the potstickers.  Also, had water and tea to drink (fyi, the tea seemed easier to get than the water...).  Honestly, I wasn't too impressed with the seafood XLB, and it had an off yellow color, like bile- don't spill it on your clothes unless you want to look like a rabies bite victim.  Aside from the looks of the liquid, it just seemed underwhelming.  Mind you though, this place was bringing orders of XLBs out like Katz's slings pastrami sandwiches.  They must have a crew to just make those.The potstickers were ok, I liked the texture, but the flavor was underwhelming as well.  Maybe that is the way it is supposed to be... But those were probably my favorite items I tried.When we got our check, we got orange slices- the healthiest thing I ate all day.I was glad I got to try it for the experience, I will def have to check out the one in Flushing now, but, I can't go with another group that big, I almost got stuck at the table.  Oh yea, and if you are a germophobe- steer clear of this place, just saying...",Joe's Shanghai
15,"yesyesyes - I've been here three times and it's been fine and consistent for the occasions.Cute, intimate spot for light bites - meaning if you're ravenous you should sample lots or plan for round two at BCD. Food here is for a dainty, feminine palate.  Ample meat-on-stick options to try at fair low risk buy-in. I always opt for 'funkier' here: heart tissue, liver, cartilage, tongue. The Nori Tofu is a block of silken tofu with avo and seaweed - the seaweed paste (laced with wasabi) makes it worth it. Charred Mushrooms and Grilled Romaine to get the veggies in, but nothing to write home about. Ramen felt and tasted like an afterthought, but was also ordered as an afterthought...",NONONO:  What we order:1. Yakitori Don2. Vegetable Green Curry3. Uni Avocado  4. Yuzu Sorbet 5. Kuro Goma(Black sesame panna cotta and ice cream) Highly recommend the yuzu sorbet and kuro goma!,"I can tell this is a Korean owned Japanese restaurant, have been here a couple times, price is lower than most of the authentic Japanese restaurants. This could be a regular spot for good quality Japanese food in town for once a month. 2 people for about 60 bucks, good location, can't complaint more. I love their gyoza wings and toriyaki. Tips, make reservations before you come, otherwise the average waiting time for weekend is about 45mins for a 2 people table.",So happy we discovered this place! I've now been to nonono 3 times since opening and am so grateful for such a yummy restaurant near Penn Station / MSG. The variety of options is great and there is something for everyone. Some of our favorites include:- Nasu dengaku: deep fried eggplant with miso- Zuke maguro: marinated tuna sashimi with jalapeno sauce- Scallop and uni carpaccio- Beef tongue stew- Hamakama nikomi: simmered yellowtail collar with miso broth- Kinoko: Assorted charred mushrooms- Duck ankake: grilled duck over fermented miso scallion,"Worst service attitude ever.... the host has a look, tone of owing her money... the food isn't bad, but honestly there are countless good restaurants in NYC, so service is extra important... no one wants to have to encounter a host that has no smile and such a bad attitude The food is just okay as well - regular Japanese yakitoris among other dishes. But they do have a big menu with lots of options","My friends and I came here for dinner on a Sunday evening at 5:30. We had a reservation but we had to wait outside where a line was forming to get in since the restaurant wasn't opened yet.  When we got seated, we looked at the menu and I was a bit overwhelmed because there was so much food to choose from! We ended up ordering a bunch of skewers/Yakitori to share like the chicken wing, steak with shishito peppers, and tofu. We also got the stuffed mushroom (with pesto and scallops I think) and the mackerel. There was also a $9 sashimi special we got that was very good (I believe it included tuna, scallop, and some sort of fish). Everything we ordered was delicious. The portions were small so we had enough room in our stomachs a for our own entrees. I had the tori tantan ramen which I requested to be a little bit spicy but when I took the initial few bites, my mouth was on fire. After that, I got used to it and enjoyed it very much. Broth was creamy and almost peanut butter-like and the ground pork was perfect.Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. The prices were reasonable. I would definitely come here again if I'm in the area.",nonono
16,"Update 10/03Although I order much from here much less frequently, they continue to provide good food when I do order ocassionaly","I've never written a bad review. Sooner or later it was gonna happen. Here goes..The food was just ok but our waitress was a rude jerk. My wife asked where the restrooms were and she says ""we don't have any"". I asked her how spicy a certain dish was and she said ""not too bad but it's white person spicy."" That may be industry talk at this establishment but it should stay in the kitchen and probably not a conversation that's actually spoken to customers. We asked if we could start off with the steamed pork dumplings and our entree came out first. I asked her about the dumplings and she looks at me and says ""I know"", completely unconcerned as she walked away. If I'm wrong and this is one of those restaurants where you pay for the waitstaff to insult you, I apologize but the entire experience here was just rude and awkward.Also it was hot outside and the temperature was about the same inside.",Pretty decent Chinese restaurant. I love the beef and tripe appetizer and Ma Po Tofu so much. Dan Dan noodles are not spicy enough. It's a little disappointed that they put too much sugar in every single dish.,This is currently my favorite Chinese restaurant in NYC. The dishes are authentic and not Americanized though the spicy and hot factor might be toned down. It's been a good place both for eating in and take out.My favorites are the sautéed green beans and twice cooked pork.,"Loved Chow House. I came here for a large group dinner and we did everything family style and I swear I liked every last item we had. My favorites: - THE FRIED RICE. I DEVOURED IT. - Scallion pancakes - Mapo Tofu- Sweet and Sour Chicken - Some chicken and veggie dish I wish I knew what it was We also had some other beef dish and some noodles - they were also very good but those other dishes were the standouts I'd recommend to order. Service was great and prompt for such a large party. Beware there's no phone service downstairs and the WiFi isn't great - great news for you, you can actually pay attention to your company!",It's just ok.I wouldn't be super excited to go to this place. However I wouldn't be super apposed. I get that there are Chinese restaurants that do an Americanized version of the foodI also get Chinese restaurants that do solely Chinese style cooking This place is like a Chinese restaurant that can't decide which to do and it makes everything average. You'll eat something and say ok cool. Did I like it? Sure.Do I LOVE IT? nope,Chow House
17,"I was so impressed with everything about the food, and can't wait to return! The beet pumpkin empanada was awesome, and so was the black lava rice and palm carnitas jackfruit taco. Great flavors and textures. Very difficult getting a seat though - the place is small. It was a 2+ hr wait so tried for the bar, but a lot of people were sitting there waiting for their tables not ordering anything, which was frustrating. When we finally sat down people were standing over us bc it's so tight. But food made up for it all!","I stopped by here and tried one of the carnitas tacos on a mini food tour of the area and was pleasantly surprised by the flavor and texture. It doesn't really give that meatiness that I was expecting, but it was still tasty nonetheless.","We ordered some nachos and then noticed a few bugs crawling on the walls and flys around us. We decided to cancel the order due to the bugs. We were then told by the manager that we could no longer sit at the table if we were ordering drinks as the wait time is very long. Understandable, but we also waited just as long for a table. There were no seats at the bar either. It felt very rude and unprofessional. We felt rushed to leave I will not be back.","Hands down one of my favorite vegan restaurants in the city. I discovered the place about 6 months ago and have already been 5 times! If I'm going out with someone with dietary restrictions, this is my go to. Not to mention the food is freaking delicious. The nachos, pupusas, cauliflower and chayote fish tacos are highlights for me. All have great texture and flavor! They also have these signature sauces that will take your taste buds to the next level.In addition to the great food, Jajaja has fantastic service! Don't be surprised if you pop in on an evening, especially Thursdays and Fridays, and have to wait 1-2 hours for a table. I've waited about 2 hours on more than one occasion and keep coming back because this place does not disappoint!","It takes a lot for me to write a bad review on a business, but after my experience with my friends, this business definitely deserved one. Our waitress was extremely rude (don't remember her name, but she is the one with blue hair). She practically avoided us the entire time, gave us an attitude when we asked for water, gave us an attitude when we asked for plain chips for my friend's kid, and when we were paying for the bill and haven't left yet, she was taking away our dishes before we were ready to go. The only reason why I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the food and ambiance. The food is actually delicious and the ambiance is really nice.","- Really busy on a random Thursday afternoon  *I can tell this placed must be jam packed at night- Service is exquisite- I don't usually like vegan restaurants but this place is off the charts- I enjoyed the loads of sunlight and color- The sangria was good- I got the enchiladas verde, which was delicious- I got the fish tacos- I total forgot what wife ordered bc I was too into my own food  * Whatever it was tasted like heaven- The nachos are presented very well",Jajaja
18,"I'll start with the pros- friendly waiter and the gluten-free fried chicken was good. Unfortunately serving us sub-par grits (you're a southern restaurant?!) and gluten-free biscuits that were both hard and stale, was an insult to our taste buds. First and last visit.","Ordered the Kilt Lettuce Salad & it was amazing (a little too charred at the tips...but I just cut those parts off). I loved the bacon vinaigrette and grapefruit combo! I'd definitely recommend.My husband ordered the Fried Chicken Biscuits. He enjoyed the first couple of bites but got tired after a while.  He wasn't a huge fan of the sweet glaze on the biscuit. Although it's a small plate, it's 100% filling.","3.5 stars rounded down. ""southern comfort"" food in a pretty watered down fashion. There were some decent dishes but also some misses as well. Came for lunch on a weekday around 1:30 and it was pretty much empty - conversely if you come for dinner on a Friday or Saturday without a reservation you'll end up waiting all night. Started with the deviled eggs and Macaroni & cheese. Deviled eggs were good, but not super special. Didn't taste like there was much added to the egg yolk mix other than mayo. The Mac and cheese was a better starter but the noodles were a little overcooked. For mains we got the fried chicken biscuits (a little overbattered, not that crispy) and short rib meatloaf. The mealoaf was more like shredded beef pressed into squares vs a real meatloaf. Was a little dry for my liking and didn't carry any real oomph. Ended with the key lime pie which was not good - sickly sweet and hard to finish. Overall not a terrible place but not worth the $, hype or wait if you come at a busy time. Try Jacobs Pickles for their fried chicken instead.","Two words, the BISCUITS! Oh my gosh, they have the most delectable gluten free biscuits. I could not get enough of them! They come with a side of chicken jus but I'd much rather have them with some maple syrup or molasses (that's the Southener in me). This place is such a gem. I actually await the next time I can stop by for brunch. My friend and I ordered from the brunch menu which comes with a shareable starter and main meal. Many of the items on the menu can be made gluten-free and they are very accommodating and mindful of allergies. I was just happy to have biscuits that were flaky and tasted quite close to the ones my Grandmother used to make. Needless to say, I really enjoyed my meal! If going on a Saturday, there may be a wait as it was pretty busy around 1pm. I also recommend the lavender lemonade which was a great way to round out the meal. Add this one to your list!","This was by far one of the most disappointing meals I've had in awhile. I've had R&B bookmarked for some time, so I was really excited when a friend suggested we go for our group outing.Our party of four (all major foodies) ordered the whole fried chicken, 2 orders of mac & cheese, a side of asparagus, and the pecan pie to share. Our order was a reasonable amount for 4 people to finish, however the taste of the food was so disappointing that we didn't finish and NONE of us wanted to take the leftovers home.Chicken: Severely lacked flavor and many pieces felt undercooked. When you eat friend chicken (southern style or any) you expect the initial bite to have a bit of crunch -- most of our chicken lacked that and was soggy and fairly pale in color (see photo). I had a bite of one piece and didn't bother with the rest.Mac & Cheese: This was by far one of the driest, flavorless macs I've had in awhile. There was hardly any cheese and/or béchamel sauce.Asparagus: This was the market veggie. It was sautéed and sprinkled with parm. Good flavor and texture -- a simple dish that's pretty hard to mess up. They could've used less oil, for sure but overall this was very tasty.Bourbon Pecan Pie: A very small portion for the price, but it was the best thing we had.Staff & Venue: Friendly and attentive staff and a nicely decorated venue with a good amount of seating. Honestly, if it weren't for the folks being nice, I'd have to drop 1 star here.I hope this was just an off day, but idk that I'm willing to give it another go. The price to quality ratio is just not worth it.","This used to be my go-to gluten-free fried chicken spot! I loved it so much that when I went the second to last time, the recipe seemed to have changed, but I decided to give it one more chance because I don't give up on ppl. I went fairly recently and within a half hour did not feel well. Let's just say, I was sick for the rest of the day. This was the meal I picked as a ""treat yo' self"" after a really intense summer. The problem: shortly after finishing my share, something told me that the recipe was off again. Since the GF option only applies to the half or full fried chicken basket and the GF biscuit order comes with two, I always have leftovers (even with friends) this time I had no desire to save it for another day. I reached out to management before posting this, because maybe there was a mistake in my recipe (I didn't want to believe that maybe there was more to it) and I received an email asking for the information that I had already provided (location visited) and that was the end of their communication. And with this, I warn others, especially if you're coming here for the GF options, to be careful. My experience caused me great discomfort and $50+.",Root & Bone
19,"Note that this is a review for Tonkatsu to go and not the restaurant itself.Halfway through eating my donburi bowl and realized the middle of the pork tasted funny.. then realized it is not cooked through in the middle. The meat is a clear color, and does not look like it is cooked, thus the weird taste and chewy feeling.Threw the rest of the food out, have picture as well but dont think anyone would appreciate a pic of my half biten into meat piece.. I will not be returning, too bad because I'm a regular here and everything has been good so far...","Stumbled upon this place through the help of Yelp. During our stay in New York, we were over pizza and wanted something different. If you're in the area, I highly suggest you stop by and try them out. They weren't that busy on a Monday night so the food didn't take too long to come out. We ordered grilled squid and 2 combo meals. I honestly don't know if you can find a cheaper but yet authentic Japanese eatery in New York.","Come here if you're looking for a very authentic Japanese dining experience. Upon being seated, I noticed that I was the only non-Japanese customer for a Friday night dinner. Everything was well flavorful and came with various difference topping sauces and spices to add and customize our meals. We ordered fried oyster fries, and gyu-meshi.","Loved everything about this place starting, of course, with the taste and quality of our meal!Bottom line on this place: AMAZING prices, delicious food, PIPING HOT fresh from the kitchen, clean and bright interior, excellent and fast service and icing on the cake: NO TIPPING! What more could you ask for in a dining experience?! Overall dining value = priceless! :)We had just been to Japan on vacation and experienced authentic Japanese tonkatsu and this place immediately brought us back there even as we stepped through the front entrance with their plastic food display case! The place is not big but the seating is not cramped and crowded. It's clean, inviting and open. We arrived for an early dinner - around 5PM. Service was excellent and though the food didn't arrive lickety-split, it came out shortly thereafter and PIPING HOT - a sign that they cook to order. Signs on the wall ask customers to be patient because of this. Like fine wine, good deep fried tonkatsu cannot be rushed! :)While there, we saw a lot of customers come in to place carry out orders. Also there's a street-facing To-Go storefront. Party of 5 (adults). We ordered the edamame appetizer, their basic Pork Loin Cutlet Tonkatsu (Teisyoku set), their Beef and Tonkatsu Bowl (Large Aomori Gyu-Meshi Bowl) and their grilled mackerel dish (Saba Shioyaki). All were delicious. The tonkatsu was COOKED PERFECTLY. Perfectly breaded for that nice crunch factor, pork was juicy and tender and the size of each cutlet was substantial. The Bowls had the right mix of rice, tonkatsu and beef - a tasty combo. Bowl items are accompanied by a bowl of shredded cabbage and a miso soup. The cabbage dressing was delicious and refreshing (though messy when it's poured out). All the condiments and sauces are on the table (jut like in Japan!). When you're finished your meal, ask for the check, head to the counter to pay, NO TIP REQUIRED OR EVEN ENCOURAGED!, then go! So refreshing! How many times you gonna find that in NYC at a full service restaurant - or anywhere here in the US for that matter - ?!Heaven on earth! HIGHLY RECOMMEND and may even be back during our short visit - we enjoyed it THAT much.","Came here on my way back from JFK with my suitcase in tow, which the hostess kindly stored behind a counter. I was seated immediately, although there was definitely a lunch rush right after! The katsu was so good and hot and came on a little metal stand so it wouldn't get soggy. It paired perfectly with the cabbage salad, tonkatsu sauce, miso dressing (? on counter), and the horseradish-y paste that came on the plate. Rice and miso soup were just ok. No tipping! Great place for a quick but hot & delicious meal.","This day I went to this Katsu joint, you know, switch things up from my usual ramen trips. Katsu is like in top 3 of japanese dishes so I might start going on a Katsu trip one of these days....maybe after I try EVERY ramen restaurant lol.Anyway, on to the food review. I ordered pork loin 150 gram don, comes with a soup like egg on top of it. The katsu was still somewhat crispy and the flavor was all there. I wish I could say more but I'm not an expert on katsu dons....I'll do more research before my next katsu stop!And yes, I recommend everyone to try this place out!",Tonkatsu Matsunoya
20,Bomb AF. Highly recommend. The waffles were so light and fluffy! The Bloody Mary was top notch. Wish they had a location in CA!,I came here on a saturday night and they open very late. I order the fried catfish and the sweet chick bucket. Previous time i have order the red eye chicken and waffle. The food is good but some dishes the portion might be too small if you are hungry and might need to order something on the side along with it.,"Fried chickens were delicious. But I want to share my experience about a hostess there. She was rude and unfriendly. So I went back to check in after I received the ""table is ready"" text, then she told me to line up at the back while helping other people who just walked in and gave them a table. I felt discriminated and was disappointed.","Sweet Chicks was everything I expected and more. After reading the reviews I knew we had to be there when they first open to avoid waiting.We arrived for brunch around 10:30am and was seated immediately. The food was smelling good and I had no clue what I was going to order.The wait staff was efficient and was moving quickly to accommodate the customers.     I ordered the bacon, egg and cheese biscuit with the home fries and a side order the Carolina cheese grits. The sandwich was excellent and it didn't fall apart when you tried to eat it like a sandwich. The home fries was so crispy you can eat it without any condiments. The Carolina cheese grits was nice and thick and that's the way I like my grits.I had an excellent brunch and I wasn't rushed through my meal. I suggest if you want yo go for brunch, get there when they open so you can relax and enjoy your meal.","fucking phenomenalamazing staff great foodthe host?? amazing energykisses to the chef(s)manager on duty was very helpful the music?!? what a vibe who is the dj?? recommended food: chicken and waffles!! duhdrink: get that boozy lemonade you heard (don't forget to choose your spirit!) don't forget to tip 20% (or more, it's the les) they deserve it!",Came in about 4:05 & was immediately seated. Another table was seated next to us after we had been at the table to 10 mins patiently waiting to be greeted by our server. A guy who seemed to be our server went to attend that other table who was just seated next to us immediately which was very upsetting to witness. Finally a woman comes over to take our order after we had to start looking around to see who is going to acknowledge that we are patiently waiting to order. Menu is very limited to 4 options between 4-6 which is disappointing but I guess it's understandable due to the transitioning. But what's not understandable is the lack of service. Very inattentive & no sense of urgency. The food runner was more attentive then the server and service & that's insane. My Shrimp & Grits was delicious & very on point so no complaints there. Mac & Cheese is delicious but very small portioned. My lady got the Chicken & Waffles & the waffle wasn't cooked long enough because we was able to taste the mix. Flavor and texture on the chicken was spot on. During the time of eating that same guy who attended the other table that was seated near us checked on us twice which I Don't Understand because he's not the one who took our order so technically not our server. That table that was seated after us left before us. Almost like a free for all environment. Doesn't that say enough ?Crazy part is I was just at the Bedford location myself yesterday & that was my first experience and I loved it so much that I was excited to come here to the Ludlow location but big difference in SERVICE! I hope they get it together because service is way too laid back & for that reason I'll go to Bedford where service is there's top priority. We ask for our check & receive another table's check. Again with the mistakes. The guy comped our mac & cheese since he noticed how upset we was and that's appreciated but unfortunately doesn't change me and my lady's experience. Gotta do better guys. Where's the management ?,Sweet Chick
21,"I don't know what all the fuss is about. The pizza was just OK in my opinion. So was the service. The guys make your pizza with no hair nets or gloves which creeped me out a little.... am i the only one ? Anyways it's hella expensive, three meatballs were $14.00 just for starters. Pic of the receipt so you guys can see for yourself.","Great pizza solid 4.5 stars. Thin and crispy and fresh sauce and just the right amount of cheese. Dried Italian herbs may be a hot or miss for some. Worth the long wait but not the best pizza. Sorry. Salad was quite ordinary and lame. Worth half the price. Calzone is served without sauce - you have to order the saicenseparate. No big deal - but it is meat based Ragu sauce and we are vegetarian. We asked them to give us whatever sauce they have - pizza sauce for example. They said that they cannot do that and there was no other alternative. Really - no tomatoes sauce at a pizza joint! After a minute of dumb staring, we gave up and ate the calzone sans sauce - a good one btw. Packed the rest. Time for dessert - cannoli. It was a bit of a let down too - something you get from a store ... hmmmWe say just come for pizza, skip the salad  and have dessert elsewhere as there is plenty to explore around",Not impressed especially after waiting an hour on the line. The bottom of the pizza was slightly burned as if the oven needed to be cleaned. Won't be returning. The setup and design of the restaurant was nice,"Of course it's absolutely incredible! Don't you see that line! Yes, it's worth the wait! And when you're finally in, just sit down and enjoy yourself. Enjoy the legacy of the original pizza makers of the United States, conveniently presented to you in the form of a masterpiece of pizza pie.I'm betting they're all good. But you can't lose with the ""No. 4""- tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto, and arugula... Can't lose...This is in my top 5 of all pizza places in the world (Italy included)...",Great Pizza from the previous owners of Grimaldi's!If you are looking have a nice day/night out in dumbo this is a great spot to get a thin pizza that is delicious.I came here 2hrs before closing on a Saturday and it was perfect as I got a spot right away infront of the pizza oven. This was the best as I'm waiting for my pizza I get to see the pros at work. It was really hot out so the waiter kept pouring the water which was great cause I was dehydrated.We got the Marinara pizza to keep it simple and it hit the spot. It's a nice size pizza and was perfect for 2.In short:- Good Pizza- Great location- Nice waitstaff,"Was at Juliana's pizza on a Sunday. The place is usually considered a competitor of Grimaldi's Pizza right next door. Both places had long lines, but a word of mouth around the neighborhood was telling us that Juliana's pizza is way better than Grimaldi's so we decided to give it a shot. It was a party of two and we waiting on line for about 15-20 minutes or so. We sat by the wall on the right hand side as soon as you walk in. We were greeted by the host who was very kind and professional although she was busy taking care of the crowd outside she still managed to keep her professionalism and attention to the customers. A young server helps us taking our order, apparently he was very busy which we understand, they want people in and out. He rushed us to order, so we just ordered meatballs and a medium pie. The meatballs were perfectly cooked with the perfect amount of garlic and parsley in it, a juicy and tender flavorful meatball with a very well made sauce, I decided to cut one and add it to my slice of pizza and I've got to say: PERFECT COMBO. The pizza was thin crust and was well made. The medium pie comes with 8 slices so we had 4 slices each, they are very thin so won't really fill you up as I thought it was. We asked for parmigiano cheese and the waiter was a little resistant about the request  although we wanted cheese on our pizza he replies :"" are you sure?! This pizza usually doesn't need cheese, the parmigiano ruins it"" We just ignored his opinion and still went for the parmigiano and it was excellent on top of the pizza so we were confused of what he was tried to prove. ‍. Overall we only saw our waiter when we asked for cheese, we had to ask for straws to the buss boy who replies "" I can't, you have to ask your waiter"" For straws?!  strange So I decided to get up and ask the host who was the only polite staff that we've encountered and she brought us straws in a heart beat. I definitely recommend this place if you'd like to try their pizza. It's different from others for sure.",Juliana's Pizza
22,"Had a relatively late dinner here after drinks elsewhere beforehand.  I see all the other 4~5 stars review and I'm not getting it...The food was decent, but I didn't think that it was out of this world good...  The steak came out after a really long time and was way on the heavy/salty side.  The pork was also a bit too dry.  Uni was surprisingly only just ok...  The highlights were probably the lamb meatballs and truffle mac, but the rest of the plates were honestly just so so.Sat at the bar, so the service was good.  However, they unfortunately don't have a hard liquor license, so they are limited to those beverages under 20% only.  Tried the makgoli here and it was just bad, so we sent it back.  The other drinks with glowy lights didn't really impress me either.  They reminded me of those kids' sneakers with flashy LED lights back in the 90s...","There is no need for this place to have a line out the  door like some exclusive club and a 2 hour wait. The food isn't that great. Its good but nothing amazing or notable. Also this place is horrible, i mean horrible for the environment with these stupid drinks that come in stupid plastic bags.  I hope the mayor bans that nonsense next.","the food's pretty good here, but I think a bit overpriced. Food would be 4 stars but taking a star off for the price, expect small portions for everything, I guess they're following the tapas style - but not on the prices. I'd probably come back again when I'm not hungry at all and craving for small bites. I think you'll need to fill yourself up somewhere else.","I really wanted to hate this place.It's loud. It's full of people who make millennials seem old. And their drinks glow - wtf??? I just want to eat. But it got bonkers reviews on Yelp, so I begrudgingly sat at the bar and ordered. Unbeknownst to me, I even ordered a blue, glowing drink. Holy crap, the food is good. The service is as well. I wish I remembered what I ordered, but it was a few small dishes, perfectly and uniquely seasoned in a way that literally changed my mood. (As did my glowing drink.)","Had to be one of the best dinners I had in a really long time. Came here for date night and we had a blast. Each and every dish we had was so packed with flavors. Got here around minutes to 6- which was great because this place fills up super fast.We started off with drinks- my date had Ruby the GF and I got Lychee Reach Rich... both drinks were amazing and so addicting. The LED ice cube and the Capri pouch give you such a nostalgic feeling with a cool edge.For mains we got the angry sweet potatoes, gnocchi, Korean popcorn chicken, lamb meatballs,and duck confit empanadas. Everything was so amazingly good. My favorite has to be the gnocchi- it was so flavorful and spicy and definitely stand out from all the dishes.For dessert we got the bread pudding- perfect way to end dinner- not too sweet and just the right balance. Will definitely be coming back to try new dishes.","I always recommend this place when there's a group of us going to dinner. There's enough variety on the menu for everyone to find things they'll like, the drinks are fun, the prices are reasonable, and the vibe is young and buzzy.I've tried almost everything on the current menu and I always get the edamame dumplings, eel tacos, and the steak. The only disappointments on the menu for me are the Kimchi Paella and the Korean Popcorn Chicken. Don't expect the capri sun drinks to be boozy. The bread pudding is also really good.In my experience, they over-estimate the wait time, but then you're pleasantly surprised when your table is ready sooner than expected. On weeknights around 7pm, the wait for two or three was only about 30 min. On one weekend around 8pm, we were told the wait for four was 3 hours but it was actually only 1.5 hours. They also have a nearby bar you can hang out at while you wait.",Thursday Kitchen
23,We came for a late dinner Friday night and got seated right away.Get the Grilled Haloumi. It's Cyprian cheese that always tricks me into thinking it's chicken (it's wild). Even the grapes that came with the dish were really complementary.The lamb lasagne was also tasty!They have crayons for drawing on the paper menus btw.,"This place is ok, nothing great. The space was small, cramped, loud, and service was slow. My friends and I waited a long time for our food and it was kind of a disappointment when it arrived. The waffles were ok, but not the best. The burger was nothing special, and pretty dry. The shakshuka was pretty good, but all of the food was generally overpriced. Overall a decent restaurant, but I'd pick a different place next time.",It's my first to come at Jack's Wife Freda. Food is not bad will definitely come again. However yesterday was one of the hottest day in NY. There are only 2 AC in the restaurant as I saw and then the waitress open the door and let all the hot air come into the restaurant. Outside was 100F and was too hot to stay inside. So 3 of us couldn't enjoy the food at all.,"Second time here. Healthy and tasty as well. Always have a reason to come back here. I ordered my go to food green shakshuka. Only thing is that the food is very light, i got hungry after two hours! It doesn't take reservations unfortunately. We there at 10:20am on Sunday and waited like around 20 minutes.","Cute, small brunch place with locations in West Village and Soho on Lafayette. Dishes are average and on the smaller side, and I'm not sure if it really makes up for the long lines. I would not recommend coming here with larger parties unless you are willing to come earlier to put your name down, but note that they won't seat you until all of your party is here. It's also very loud because the place is so small. Most recently, I tried their Shakshuka, and I have gotten their Rosewater Waffle as well. I'd recommend skipping on the waffle if you don't like floral tasting things and sour greek yogurt.The shakshuka is definitely better, and I like the cilantro and salsa-y flavor with the baked eggs. Only complaint is I wish the eggs were more gooey and the portions were larger for the price ($13!! :(). Regardless, I still think Jack's Wife Freda is a good brunch spot and it's definitely popular for a reason.","Great Brunch place! There is generally a  line, but it moves fairly quickly.  Nice  and interesting menu, delicious food and good service. Lots of vegetarian options. A relatively small place, with close tables, tight space. Not a great place to go if you want to sit for a long time and talk because it is  fairly LOUD! But it is a fun environment with good vibes. I would def return.",Jack's Wife Freda
24,"I've gone here enough times to have tried all the flavors of their shaved ice, twice. I still can't pick a favorite. On the upside, their smoked dashi ramen is consistent. Every. Single. Time. Highly recommend trying out this place if you haven't already!","Phenomenal ramen, sake, and shaved ice. It was the sukiyaki buns, however, that BLEW me away. The best buns I've literally ever experienced. I also underestimated how good the mango shaved ice with the cream would turn out but it was incredible.",Their ramen was meh... I've found better ramen for cheaper p.I  do not understand why it is Michelin grade restaurant. I give 5 stars for their milk shaves.,"Been wanting to try this ramen spot for a while and it did not disappoint. Pan-fried gyzo: The skin was nicely crisp from the skillet, but it really lacked in any special standout flavor. Would skip this.Spicy tan tan ramen: Well balanced spice. Loved the texture of the thick wavy chewy noodles. However, the peanuty flavor overpowered the soup towards the end. Matcha milk shaved ice: Meant for 3-4 people honestly. The honey cream and bean paste complimented the slight bitter matcha taste really well. In summary, still a five star review (great food and great service) and would come back to try other items on the menu!","Very trendy ramen spot in Midtown! The ramen and rice balls were deliciousI got the Smoked Dashi ramen which was really good but definitely on the fishy side if you like that. Surprisingly they had a bunch of delicious little clams in there as well as well.The rice ball I got was a charsiu with spicy mayo, super delicious and a great compliment to the ramen.The spot is really trendy with beautiful modern looking decor and an open kitchen, great little date spot. Fully stocked bar as well and a variety of cocktails.Only reason I deducted 1 star is the price but I guess it's expected for Midtown. Not the best ramen I've ever had (I've been blessed with quite good ramen places) but definitely up there. Will stop by again if I am craving ramen for lunch.","We were looking for a last minute ramen place, ended up picking this one because they have a vegan ramen since we needed a place that was vegan friendly, good thing we rsvp once we arrived we were seated right away. Once seated we all stuck to water, no appetizers all we wanted was some Ramen. I had the Tokyo Tonkotsu this is their signature ramen it was very good, nice tasting broth, good egg the thinly sliced pork was great.My friends had the Spicy ramen, good yes a bit too spicy for my taste but my friends enjoyed it & the Miso ginger this is the vegan option w lots of veggies, good as well. If u feel a regular portion is too much they also serve a half portions which is a nice idea for a little less in price. As for the restaurant decent size, bar area upfront nicely decorated service was quick & prices are reasonable we enjoyed our ramen.",TONCHIN NEW YORK
25,"I came here on a busy Saturday night with reservations. We ordered a couple appetizers--which were delicious--and I ordered the cod entree. The cod was fresh and cooked perfectly. Unfortunately, the fish was salted to death. It was saltier than the Red Sea. I was thirsty all night. We were also pressured to leave so that the next table could be seated. Alas, the dinner experience could have been perfect were it not for the salt and the service.","What a ripoff. A shitty glass of white wine, a shitty pour, $11. I guess it's the only thing on the block, but if you walk a block or two, you can do way better",The mussels and cheese plates and whipped potatoes were all wonderful. The steak frites were not that great though.,"We were in the neighborhood and came here as a random Yelp find on a Tuesday night, and were super glad that we did.  The food and service were both excellent.  The Tartare Du Bled was absolutely fantastic, and a great deal given the quality/amount.  The cocktails were quite good, and the service was both fast and very nice/pleasant.I'd highly recommend dropping in, I'll be back just for the tartare.","This was my first time having French food. I was just in the area looking for a quick lunch and stumbled upon this place. There's sitting area and aesthetic of the restaurant is great, especially if you're looking for a quick date, consider it here. The flavoring of the food is strategic and exquisite. Good service and was able to answer all my questions as well!Things to note:- seating arrangements are a little close to one another- cash only! I ordered a lunch special for $12 which is half kale salad with a yogurt Caesar dressing and half of a sandwich with fig spread and goat cheese.","Sunday boozy brunch for power of one, please.A long holiday weekend summons self-care to just be.  The reviews are indeed paint an accurate experience for food and service excellence.  This French bistro embodies a classic bistro in a New York environment. This business is easily accessible by F train at East Broadway station in Lower East Side walking distance on Henry Street intersecting Jefferson Street.  I am glad Yelp search enables me a good find as I was very inclined.  Around the corner there is a annex for a bakery in true Parisian French fare bakery in the front, cafe in the rear.  My male server was doing it all as a very capable, competent, able-bodied man who was ""running around like a chicken with its head cut off"" as hostess, waiter, bus boy, cashier, etc. as he was operating the business alone.  I valued and appreciate hard work, efficiency, effectiveness, attentiveness, respect and professionalism which my male server exhibits all.  My bill total $29 as Eggs Norwegian is an added $2 to the boozy brunch set price $27.  The bill is served on a actual used vintage postcard with a foreign postage stamp.LES Eggs Norwegian + $2Two poached eggs, marinated salmon, Hollandaise sauce served on English muffin, salad and roasted potatoes.  It was enticing delicious!  The Hollandaise sauce was refreshing as it was light.  The two poached eggs were prepared well as the running yolk was oozing onto my plate very well and fresh.  It is extremely pleasing soft and prepared well.  The roasted potatoes were good side portion but slightly harden perhaps overcooked and slightly dry which I had to use salt for condiment.  The side salad was very light and refreshing as it contain sufficient dressing without drowning.One brunch cocktail (included)Mimosa was delightful but contain pulp from orange.  I do not like pulp in drinks.I substituted coffee for mint tea by Bio Tea Malongo which was very aromatic and fragrant.  I am enamored of this tea.  The aroma fragrant enable to de-stress mind, body and briefly cleansed my spirit. This tea was aromatherapy than sipping for hydration.Note:  Cash only and there is a ATM machine inside.",Les Enfants de Boheme
26,"I honestly don't know what this place is or how to describe it.It's a... dive seafood restaurant?More than half their menu is fried foods (get the fried chicken... it's more of a schnitzel).You can order a bucket of random ass beers.The owner will walk around with a gigantic bottle of Jameson and pour shots randomly to your table.Also, his elderly Asian mom works in the kitchen.Like, WHAT THE FUCK is this place?Heaven is my closest guess.","Hole in the wall restaurant/bar. Cracked glass door leads to a completely unassuming place which makes the meanest food. The fried rice is a must try, I have no idea how they get the the individual rice to be so crispy. Friendly owner and fast service. It gets crowded fast.",I went a few years ago so the review might not be reflecting how it is now but it was basically a dive bar with a weird menu. Bar food and some Chinese food items.,"Been meaning to try this bar/restaurant forever - a long standing hangout in the seaport for drinks/seafood/Chinese food. From the outside the place looks completely abandoned (especially when they're first opening for the day), but inside there's a dive-bar feel with a welcoming bartender to boot.After starting off with a draft beer ($6), went to town on the Fish Tacos ($14) and Popcorn Shrimp ($12). Shrimp comes out within 15 minutes - a giant basket of browned fish served alongside tartar sauce. Surprisingly not oily and easy to eat as the name suggests, especially with a little bit of lemon. Tacos come out next, a couple of double wrapped two-handers with fried fish inside each. Not as good flavor as the shrimp, though I quickly ate them as well. The fries that it comes with was overkill, yet they were fresh made and not overly salty.Out of all the restaurants at the seaport, you probably will get your best value here. Try to come around 2pm as they take some time to get started.","A seriously dingey place with quality food and quality service.When I first walked into the Fishmarket Restaurant, the door was shattered but glued back together, the doorknob was non existent and I was seriously hesitant to step food into a place that smelled like raw fish and not in a good way... however once I got over the look and the smell of the place, it all went uphill from there.I ordered the steamed lobster and Crispy fried rice with sausage and both entrees were amazing. The lobster was very fresh and the side of butter really topped it all off. The crispy fried rice is literally crispy fried rice and tastes very homey and authentic. The menu was super interesting because there's a mix of American but also Chinese dishes. There is no drink menu so know what you want before you go in! The bartender simply said ""you get what you see"". At one point in the night, he poured Jameson shots for everyone in the restaurant.","We were in the area exploring and found this gem on Yelp.After reading the good reviews ,we decided to give it a try.Let me warn you..the place doesn't look appealing at all.We were hesitant when we first entered the place but don't worry.The  people working here are the most friendly people and the service is great.We had the mama's curry chicken ,which is a must try.It was soooo delicious.We also had the garlic shrimp ,which was good too.",Fishmarket Restaurant
27,"#I'm not sure why my friend and I were so pissed when we were here. I think it's because he was touting the free #Yelp check-in mozzarella sticks and that's why we came here. But they said the offer didn't apply to that day we went (I think weekend). I didn't really want to eat the #mozzarella sticks myself, but for some reason I was still mad about it.The #burger and fries were just okay. But maybe it's because I had a #bad taste in my mouth.","Short Story: The atmosphere was alright and the burgers were extra tasty! Would recommend. Long Story: my husband and I were in Brooklyn on a vacation and needed somewhere to eat. I found Juanchi's on Yelp! We each got a burger, his was something spicy and mine was something with an egg in it and they were both very good. The egg burger situation also had honey on it - I was originally apprehensive about it but decided it was worth risk and MAN WAS IT.  My only complaint was the fries - they were not great - soggy, and it seemed like the end of the bag because they were all so small and short. All in all - would recommend.",Burgers were fire and don't miss the truffleFries. I'll be coming back here everytimeI'm in Williamsburg,"I have had this place bookmarked and thought about going here for over a year, and constantly found myself looking at photos of the burgers and have my mouth water up. Well last night I finally went here and it lived up to the hype.After a full day bringing my friends massive golden retriever around Brooklyn, we had worked up an appetite and came here for dinner since this place was dog friendly. We sat outside because Twix (our dog) is so big, he would take up so much space inside) and it was a beautiful night. There were 3 of us around 8 and we had no problem getting a table. They had a Happy Hour going on with beer, wine and cocktails for $6 which was great so I had a Stella! For burgers, me and one of my friends split the Heart Attack which is a mac & cheese bun which was literally a patty of mac and cheese and fried. It was amazing. We also split the Caribe which had white cheese, avocado, fried plantain and a sauce and was amazing. If i came back I would definitely get this for myself. All of their burgers were so unique and I'm sure you couldn't go wrong with any of them! This should be a place that is on everyone's list!","This really pains me to leave a 3 star review but the flavor just wasn't there. I had this placed bookmarked for over a year and couldn't wait to try it, but after last night, I wish I had. Headed there on a Friday night about 10 pm and was immediately seated. Our server Noah tended to us quickly and was overall great. We started off with a strawberry lemonade and iced tea, they were regular nothing spectacular. For an appetizer we ordered the chicken tenders again regular nothing spectacular, although it did pair nicely with a curry sauce.  I wanted to unlock the yelp offer for feee mozzarella sticks but it's only done Mon-Thursday. For our entrees we ordered a heart attack burger and a Spanish Queen. This is where things went south. My fries although Juilenne cut we incredibly small like maybe 2 inches in length, I guess I got the crumbs or the broken pieces at the bottom of the bag. My burger (Spanish Queen) although cooked perfectly lacked the flavor and seasoning it NEEDED, it was so bland. I was so disappointed but I pressed through. I then tasted my husband's burger instead of a bun it was fried  Mac n cheese. Again no flavor. Can you imagine the disappointment. I searched for depth of flavor but found none. I wanted to sink into my seat. No this place couldn't have been such a let down, I dreamed of eating here for a whole year! Overall the food was less than subpar and honestly I wish I would have spent my $60 elsewhere. I guess all that glitters really isn't gold.","Cool place in Williamsburg for a casual dinner and beers at fair prices. Came here for a Yelp event, so to be transparent, got my meal fo' free. Don't hate the Yelper, hate your lame reviews ;-)Started with a sampler of appetizers - plantains with cheese is never my style, wings were solid, and arepas were okay. I liked the mozzarella sticks the most. Anywho, tried the Spanish Queen burger with avocado, pico de gallo, and chorizo on top. Super yummy, but it's thick -- be prepared to stretch that jaw and get very full, very quickly. That said, really tasty. I will say that the sweet potato fries stole the show. Those lil guys + Cajun mayo just sent me over the moon. Honestly, it may have outshone the burger. So good!!Would definitely come back to this spot, though at $17-$19 per burger, this ain't no cheap burger joint. Expect high quality ingredients and casual atmosphere, and enjoy!",Juanchi's Burger
28,"This review is for the Happy hour only ....Last days of summer & we happen to walk by nice warm day out & the ""happy hour"" ""frozen sangria"" sign caught our attention , we came in & sat at the bar asked about the happy hour & the frozen sangria .. not included go figured - strike one.. we still wanted to try it so we got it , it comes in a wine glass barely half full - strike two.. & finally that half glass was $15 dollars ughhhh strike three !! Now listen living in NYC u get used to overpaying for things which I understand but in no way shape or form is a half glass of anything worth $15 dollars the drink was more than some of the food on their menu WTF!! The drink itself was not terrible taste wise why I gave it the 2 stars, it's more of a Rose wine sangria than your typical red or white. Really not cool how they jack up the price on this drink, unacceptable.","It was good, but it was one of those over-priced, small plates, bad service places.I am not sure if it was the language barrier OR it was truly a busy night, but the servers were very unhelpful and everything just came in piece meal. Like ... how did the flat bread come before pita bread appetizers? A table behind us actually made a complaint about the poor service and just left. So I thought it was just us. And I know I'm emphasizing a lot on the service but if I am going to pay a $200+ bill then I do expect a certain type of experience.","Food: had the spinach artichoke dip, zucchini pancakes, and chicken orzo soup. There were 3 of us eating and we are all very experienced foodys. For entree we had lamb, chicken, and ribeye skewers as well as the pesto pasta. The food was bland and below average for the most part. Both steak and lamb were cooked so poorly and just such a dull taste. The best dish was the spinach artichoke dip which was flavorful. Service: Both that and the wine were excellent but for me that always comes second to food. Bottom line the restaurant looked good on paper but they failed to execute.","What can I say? I'm a fan. Excellent Mediterranean food delivered by people intimately familiar with how it should taste like and how it should look like with a few American staples that are also very well executed. No matter how picky your friends are there is going to be at least something on Balzam's single page menu they can munch on.Excellent and reasonably priced wine list. When you are tired of fake food of a place a block away, go to Balzem.","Was at a group dinner with a bunch of friends, served us raw chicken skewers... my friends were obviously more polite and understanding than I was because I would've normally flipped a switch.  When we brought it up with the waiter who clearly saw the chicken was raw, no apologies or understanding response was given to us.  A simple collection of the skewers from everyone at the table and then replacing it with properly cooked skewers.    Yuk!!!! In retrospect, my husband said we should've asked for a manager... he thinks it may have just been a waiter covering up for the cooks in the back... I am rather new at getting served raw chicken, so... I will know better for next time! Stay away!!!","Looking for a light lunch to share on a sunny Saturday and I remembered I wanted to try this place.  I'm so glad we did.First the service at the bar with our friendly bartender was outstanding.He said yes to everything we asked for... light ice in our drinks.  No problem.  Medium well on the steak.  No problem.  Baguette instead of Ciabatta bread.  No problem.   In other words, they are VERY accommodating and didn't make us feel weird about it.   We sat at the bar and shared that hanger steak sandwich along with a couple of fruity Rose Sangria's.  It was a really nice day and meal.  Felt like family.   Stop in but late in the week for dinner, try to make reservations as it's a bit small interior.   Wonderful and will be back.",Balzem
29,Had to stop working and eventually eat again....  Such a friendly staff and the quality of the seafood was solid.  Dont be afraid of the squid ink spaghetti!  #Newyorkcity #ikram #askforikram,"I tried the chicken parmesan and I think I saw God. The gnocci was really good, but water was on another level.","Although it seems to locate in a tourist trap that you cannot expect much usually, their foods exceed my expectation. I had to go back there again in my one-week stay in NY to get their Linguine Nere Alla Monsignore. It was sooo good even if you take that out. For their location and their particular pasta dish, it deserves 5 star, 4.6 to be precise though.","My mother's birthday day in the city ended with a wonderful meal at TT. Please make your reservation in advance as this is a popular restaurant not just because of the delicious food, but because its near the theatre district and a lot of theatre guests stop here before and after their show for a great meal.We were seated promptly and our server took our drink order right away. When he came back we were told the specials and then after we ordered our meals we were served bread with butter and oil for the table. I ordered the Rigatoni Alla Trecolori (Sweet Italian sausage, broccoli rabe and sun-dried tomato in a roasted garlic-pesto sauce) - $19. It was delicious! So much food I had to pack the rest for leftovers. For dessert we ordered the chocolate cake which came with a cute candle in it for my mother. Complimentary birthday song and clapping were just the thing she needed to embarrass her juuuuuust a little bit. Overall, the experience was great. Service was great, food was great, and we had a wonderful time as a family. Thank you TT!","This is a reasonably priced and nice Italian place right by Times Square! My boyfriend and I had dinner here with his visiting family, and this was in a great location to show them around afterward. The food was tasty and the ambience was great -- I was pleasantly surprised that it had affordable and good quality food, despite its touristy location. I had the cheese tortellini (served deliciously warm, nicely creamy but not too rich) and he had the chicken parm. We both enjoyed our dishes. It was also surprisingly easy to make a reservation, with only an hour's notice on a Saturday night, and it was poppin but not overcrowded. Our guests enjoyed it as well. Great spot!","This Italian joint is conveniently located in the theater district for those who are going to see a show and want to grab a bite beforehand.  They are used to rushing out food in time for shows and the food quality did not seem to suffer for it.  The servers were friendly and amenable.  The food well priced and decent considering its location which is typically quite the opposite.I ordered the tortellini and it was good, though I would not call what they served in the sauce prosciutto, but non the less good.I ordered a gin drink which was too strong and not good.I'd come back though of I was ever in a rush to grab a bite before Broadway show again.",Trattoria Trecolori
30,I love Japanese places because i always feel comfortable and relaxed in their zone but not in this place tho.I had so bad experience . This place is so not dog friendly even if its service well behaving dog so they try to make you so uncomfortable that you want to leave and never come back. Funniest part was when a bartender took a chance to came and ask to check my  service dog card but instead of looking at my dog she was looking at me as she has to identify if i really need service dog or not . Legally they are able just to ask if its service dog or not and if inspections is there i am obligated to show them document with code so they can check it .Our appetizers were served separately for some reason . My date got first her tuna tartar and then after 5 minutes i got mine . Not nice  !!! Food was very delicious but to bad we couldn't take it out and eat in some nice and friendly place. Good luck doing business this way,"Totally HEARTBROKEN!!! I read such great reviews on this place and it was AWFUL service.Our reservation was 5:30 and we were kept waiting about 10 minutes or so. The booth was not ready for me to sit and I didn't like that the bathrooms were down a steep flight of steps. Anyone who is handicapped must avoid it.Next we ordered the meal. We were told the steak-dish  was already sold out and do keep in mind it was only 6:20. We had Chicken tatsuta-age, 6 fried chicken in a dish that came with a piece of lemon slice and very hot mayo. When I asked for more lemon... I actually got another small slice. For $8 give me LEMON!Next we got the big bowls of udon with a huge wooden spoon. The 3 bowls were NOT brought to the table at one time. The soup was good a bit to salty for my taste buds. The noodle texture was fresh and soft. Nameko Udon, Chicken Udon with  lots of dark meat which I am not fond of, and Udon with fried shrimp that was served on a plate so it didn't get soggy. I am also accustomed to taking my udon from the larger bowl into smaller bowls to make it easier to consume and I had to ask for BOWLS. The waiter returned with 1 bowl. Well, guess what He had to walk back with 2 more.Is it to hard for this waiter to be a tad more into his customers. He didn't introduce himself, we started with a waitress who never returned and it was like asking anyone who passed by for Service.My son totally told the waiter it was my birthday and to serve the desert with a candle. Well, they handed us the bill without even asking if we wanted anything else. My son-- gave the waiter a stare-- which I didn't understand and asked for the desert list. Well $10 later getting this cake with whisky ice cream, there was no Candle and he was very very disappointed. Food was fine. But for $70 worth of food I didn't like the service. Silent and rude!!!",,We had a lovely family lunch at Raku. The udon was absolutely delicious! I added the special shiitake mushroom to my udon soup. This soup is the perfect comfort food. The service was very friendly and efficient. We appreciated their kind attention.,This place is much much bigger than the green village ones. I love their noddles very special ! Niku is my favorite one! Enough beef enough soup enough noddles. their tofu and fried chicken are also good. Would like to try cold noddles next time before winter comes Totally the price matches the quality and A+ full after eating niku,"I had been drying to try Raku after hearing rave reviews from multiple people...and I'm so glad I finally went! I'm not a huge udon person so I almost ordered a rice bowl, but I decided to go for the udon since that's what they're famous for. I ordered the Jaja cold noodles and it was amazing! The udon noodles are thinner than typical udon and perfectly chewy. The sauce and meat was slightly spicy and super flavorful..soo good. Raku has a large selection of hot and cold udon dishes, appetizers and rice bowls. The service was great and I enjoyed the ambiance - super chill yet still on the nicer side. The prices were surprisingly reasonable (for NYC) considering how popular the place is! I recommend Raku (even to people who don't like Udon) and will definitely be back to try other items on the menu!!",Raku
31,"Went back here the other night and realized you basically can't deviate from the three dishes mentioned in my previous review as must-gets. It stinks cause I was excited about this place! We ended up paying over $75 for a meal that wasn't good which, in a city with incredible places, both cheap and expensive, doesn't cut it.While the sautéed mushrooms with garlic were delicious, we also tried the beef short ribs stew entree with grits and the mushroom soup entree, and that's where things took a turn. Had to send back the mushroom soup, and the beef short ribs stew was served cold. The grits have an odd consistency. We didn't eat much of this or this puff pastry with cheese either. Like a bad quesadilla. No good.","I kept reading great things about CM and I was really looking forward to eating here. Unfortunately, my family was very underwhelmed by this place. The best part of the meal was an egg and cheese bread. However, the rest of our order was subpar and overpriced. We tried a tomato and cucumber salad which was OK but nothing special and very small for $9. (The menu said there were pomegranate seeds in the salad but there weren't any). We also ordered dumplings which were mediocre and very overpriced at three dumplings for $11 (the menu said there were chopped nuts in the dumplings but there weren't any). Furthermore, we ordered some kind of marinated mushrooms entree. This was underwhelming and would have been far more appropriate had it been categorized as an appetizer rather than as a main course. The reviews for CM are good so maybe it's just me but I wasn't impressed.","I have given this restaurant a few tries but I have to say service is always very bad all the waiters seem so confused an food takes forever to come. Also their portions are extremely small we ordered the stuffed eggplant for appetizer and got three tiny eggplant pieces for 9 dollars, Georgian food is all about hearty satisfying food and this place is not it. Try have lot of work to do food is not bad though but not worth is so far","My first experience here with a group of 9 and I must say the service was outstanding. The servers were friendly and explained the menu and what to expect from a dish as none of us had ever had Georgian food. I called in advance to book a reservation and they had the area ready for us on time. Although some of the guest arrived late, they still seated the ones who arrived on time. The server recommended a wine and she also recommended the food. When we placed the order and said it would be shared, she portioned it out and brought it to us which was great. Everything we got was good. The chicken was cooked well, tender and flavorful. The braised lab soup was delicious with the right amount of Spices. And the cheese bread with butter was great. When you put the service, the food and the price together, this place is a must try. Even with a party of nine the bill was not precharge with a tip. Highly recommend.","I came here with a group of friends for my birthday. We had selected this restaurant because one of our friends is Georgian and would be able to order the appropriate foods, not that the offer was needed because the menu and place is very English friendly. The service is very friendly and helpful with the menu.We ordered a slew of dishes in addition to a couple of Georgian wines that were delicious and very strong. I don't quite remember the names of what we ordered, but they were all delicious. The cheese dumplings were phenomenal, the beef dumplings were equally as good. They were buttery and the dough was amazing. The bread bowl with cheese and egg is a DEFINITE MUST HAVE. If anything order this -- it's delicious and tastes exactly like melted buttery popcorn.Overall, I will be back for the service and amazing food. The ambiance was very clean, neat, and bright. One star off because the food did take a really long time to come out, but perhaps that's because of the love and care bestowed on the food.","Service was excellent, however, it was extremely loud and we were disappointed with most of our meal. We've dined at quite a few Georgian restaurants in NYC and abroad and this was the poorest in term of food. What was good? The wine, the adjaruli and the adjabsandali (eggplant). What was not so good? The simple salad and our main dish, the chakapuli with mushrooms. As our server said, the chakapuli is an ""acquired taste"". We disliked it enough that we couldn't eat it, told them we did not enjoy it (which we never do!) but the restaurant charged us anyways.In terms of ambience, we were seated in the back room at a communal table. We wouldn't have minded this so much but it was so so loud we could barely hear each other.Really wanted to love this place but we both kinda felt like we just threw $100 away.",Chama Mama
32,"My review may be an anomaly, but wish I could get my money back.  I got a lobster grilled cheese.  They were not generous with the lobster (three minuscule pieces on each half).  Essentially, I paid for a grilled cheese. I had the blueberry lemonade.  It was not sweet at all so if you wanted that lemonade feel - this drink is a no.   Ate half of the sandwich. Tossed it.  Barely drank the lemonade.(It's not on the menu - but if you ask, they will make it).",I just need some Luke's Lobster Rolls once in a while. It's such a classic and it's so consistently good every time no matter which shop I go to.,Expensive but delicious! Sad part was I was still hungry after spending $20.00. Not complaining though quality isn't cheap.,Besides delicious food as always This one has the best service ever ! Thanks to the team I've visited on Tuesday 7/30/19 You deserved 5 stars,"It's expensive, but goddamn is it delicious. Save some money by skipping the chips and drink combo offer, stick with just a roll and some chowder/soup. You can grab the aforementioned chips and drink at Duane Reade for half the price. Remember to ask for a (free!) pickle.","The thing that shines at this place is the service. Who says that New Yorkers are rude?! I think this place proves that it's actually the opposite. They obviously care about the customer. I got the trio sampler which had half a sandwich of the lobster roll, crab roll, and shrimp roll. I also ordered the lobster bisque with the meal. I can say that EVERYTHING tasted wonderful! Now, my only gripe is with the obvious that this is a pricey meal for what you actually get. All lobster rolls in general are super expensive, I know this. However, I can say that with all the lobster rolls I've had in my life, this was the smallest I've had (I'm judging this based off of my friend's full lobster roll size). I get that this establishment serves lobster (which is already expensive) and that they're operating in one of the most expensive cities in the world. However, I've had many lobster rolls all over the city and this one is still the smallest portion at the highest price. Again, this is only a small gripe. I would come back mainly for the convenience and the service.",Luke's Lobster FiDi
33,"Everything was really delicious here!The pork buns were small and perfect The Ramen Broth was the best I've ever had! Unfortunately we really didn't love the noodles, kinda thin and had no chew. So that a bit of a bummer but the broth made up for it.","Hella crowded, and the ramen was expensive. I think I had to wait 2-3 hours or something just to get in here.The taste was unmemorable, since I couldn't recollect anything special about their ramen bowl. I wonder why this place was so popular. They (Ippudo Ramen) just opened a location in Santa Monica, California, and the people in Santa Monica didn't really frequent this location due to mediocre ramen.",Used to come here a lot during my lunch breaks. Ramen is really good and the wait times can get insanely long. Much easier to get seated quickly if you are alone.They also have these pepper wings that are to die for!,"One of my favorite ramen spots in the city! Open all day Friday - Sunday (dinner starts at 4:45PM) To avoid the rush, arrive right as dinner is about to start! My party of 2 was seated right away at 5:15 on a Friday. Otherwise, expect to wait a while to be seated especially on a weekend We ordered two Karaka-men: spice level is definitely manageable! As you can see from the photo, the spice paste comes on top unmixed so you have the option to take some off as needed. The pork buns were flavorful and tender and the chicken wings, crispy and complimented nicely with the cold sesame oil smothered cabbageTotal bill for two ramen and two appetizers: $55","Not sure if I'm spoiled by the plethora of solid to amazing ramen shops in the Bay Area but I was actually really underwhelmed by Ippudo. A friend did tell me they were the first original ramen shop to open in NY from Japan, so I'm sure that's part of the hype. And the hype is real. We were fortunate to have the luxury of still being on California time, meaning we could eat a later meal and avoid some of the dinner rush and not have. crazy hangry kids. But when we were seated after 8PM, we overheard the hostess tell a couple to expect an estimated hour to 1.5 hour wait. At 8PM. On a Thursday night. What is this madness?? But my honest opinion? After a 45 minute wait, and for $16 a bowl, I felt like Ramen Nagi and even Orenchi in the Bay were better. We tried the shiromaru hakata classic and the akamaru modern (which comes with a lump of miso), and even though j preferred the shiromaru, I didn't love it.  My husband did note that he was a fan of the thin noodles and the chewy texture; it's his pet peeve when ramen shops overcook their noodles.Five stars for the service, though: the awesome wait staff even brought out two sets of kid friendly (read: plastic and not breakable!) bowls and utensils when I asked for extra bowls. I know it can be hard for restaurants to be accommodating for kids when they can be such messy and loud eaters, so thumbs up to Ippudo for being so nice! As a side note -- at least I didn't have to worry about my kids being loud and bothering the other diners: the restaurant was SO loud (is it the acoustics in there or something?) that I spent half the night screeching to my husband sitting just next to me and the other half not being able to hear what he said to me. I feel like an old person but I'm still going to say it: it felt a little too loud in there. :)",We were visiting New York for September long weekend and ramen was on our must eat list. Luckily we were able to get onto the waitlist and after waiting for around 20 minutes we were shown our table. The ambience was trendy and neat. For appetizers we got the veggie buns while our friends got the pork buns. The veggie buns were stuffed with crispy eggplant and mushroom and a spicy mayo sauce. The buns were extremely flavorful and tasty and I absolutely loved them. For ramen my husband and I got the Akamaru New York as this was their recommendation in the vegan/vegetarian ramen. Our friends got a pork based one whose name I don't know. This is probably the best ramen I've ever had! Nowhere did I feel that the broth lacked flavor just because it wasn't meat based. The amount of flavor there were able to develop was phenomenal. It was rich and creamy but light at the same time. I kept eating though I was quite full and have craved for the flavor of the ramen many times later too!! Definitely going back to this place when I'm in New York again!,Ippudo NY
34,Very authentic Northwest Chinese food. Very suitable for large group outing!! 10 out of 10 recommended!,"Horrible...this place has taken a downturn. I was so excited about this place after my first visit when the store first opened so I brought a whole group of friends back and they were all equally as disappointed. The noodles in Lanzhou noodle soup was soggy and over cooked. And when we made a comment, the person who worked there was just super defensive. The skewers also came out cold that day and I made a comment about it to the waiter. He took it back into the kitchen and came back out a minute later...it's as if these skewers were premade and then zapped in the microwave. Sadly nothing was good this time except the garlic eggplant and the service was even worse. This is another place that can't keep up with the demand and quality long term.",We had a 7pm reservation but didn't get seated over 30 minutes later. Still standing in this hectic line,Restaurant is clean and nice.Amazing Lanzhou noodle! Best I'be ever had. 5/5The eggplant is also good. 4/5,"The noodles and soup were delicious! I would love to come back for those! Dun Huang invited me to their East Village location restaurant with the offer of FREE lamb and rice because I couldn't be at their Yelp Event last time. I checked in on Yelp and was offered a FREE Kelp salad. Got both! We also ordered their Signature Lanzhou Beef Noodles because it sounded so good, and a Herbal Beverage. The presentation of the lamb and rice looked really bad; messy. It looked like leftover food that nobody wants. I've never had food presented to me this way at a restaurant. Wonder if it would still look like this if it was something I had to pay for? The lamb was also tough to chew. We were going to order some lamb skewers, but after having a taste of the lamb, we didn't order it. The FREE kelp salad was pretty tasty. It's shredded kelp soaked in toasted sesame oil, chili oil, garlic, and black vinegar. The only FREE salads they offer are this one and their pickled cabbage. We thought this one might be a better choice. Our favorite was the noodle and the soup. The texture of the noodle was just so good and it actually looks like it was hand-pulled; maybe it was. I want to try their wide noodles next time. I'm already craving their noodles as I am writing this review. However, after eating here, it left a strong taste in my mouth and I took 4 mints after that but could still taste it. I probably will only eat here at night or on a day when I don't need to talk to people, which is nearly never.","Very solid NW China province food with friendly and fast service. 1. The monster plate chicken is very solid and served over hand-pulled wide noodles. It's definitely spicy though!2. The lamb and rice pilaf is a solid side with carrots, raisins, and lamb chunks. It's light yet still flavorful. 3. The fried bread fried are great - savory and perfectly crispy with a soft inside. Prices are very reasonable and the portions generous as well.  A great option in the East Village for noodles and dongbei cuisine.",Dun Huang - East Village
35,"I have been going to this place for almost 10 years when I am in New York and I have always loved it. It has great food and it used to have awesome servers, however this time the experience was completely ruined by the waitresses when after waiting for about 25 minutes to get out order taken, we get our breakfasts but no utensils to eat with, we asked the server for forks and she got quite upset with her facial expression. We ate our breakfast and after we finished the upset and unhappy waitress says to me, do need more forks?I don't know what this lady thinks but she got her role completely up side down. She willfully wanted to upset this fine restaurant's customers. I know this is a busy place and will not loose customers because of this but I think ownership should know about this person and send her to the back of the house where she is not exposed to the public. I was there on 9/18/19 at around 10 am in the small room inside on the booth for four.","I've been coming to Mogador in WillIamsburg for 6 years. I live in the neighborhood and always bring our visitors here. They have a great reputation as food is always fantastic but service can be spotty. They're never flexible with small requests. Well today will be our last visit. I. AM. LIVID. And embarrassed as we brought my mother who was visiting from out town. I'm allergic to egg yolk. I came on a Monday morning at 11am.  Not Sunday brunch when the restaurant is slammed. Half the restaurant was empty. I requested egg whites scrambled as I always do. And as usual they said they can't make special requests. I said I was allergic and the server said ""let me ask the kitchen"". Normally they come back and say ok since it's an allergy. But today, not so much. I asked to speak with the manager. Some flakey girl (Rachel I believe) with zero management skills comes to the table. Same convo. ""Let me ask the kitchen"". If you're the manager, shouldn't you be able to make the request and not simply ""ask""? Nope, kitchen said no because it will slow down service. Seriously? What kind of a restaurant would not accommodate a food allergy? And what kind of a manager needs to ask her staff and not make the decision herself. We left and went to Sweet Chick where they were more than happy to accommodate. Never again. Which is very disappointing. If you like pretentious restaurants with zero hospitality and care for their guests, then Mogador is your spot.",Wanted to try this place after seeing a show. We asked to look at a menu and then to sit outside. We were seated and brought water. The restaurant was pretty empty and the food that people receiving looked great. Multiple servers came to the tables next to us. We patiently waited for 25 minutes and no one ever came. A real mood killer.,"Everything is just so fresh and flavorful, really. I've been to the East Village original before years ago, but this outpost didn't fail to impress at the very least.The chicken tagine with dates was yum, but my praises are for everything else we had. The meze platter had great, fresh apps all around.Delicious, soft, warm pita. Good, spicy schug.","I have had my eye on Café Mogador for some time, and it was worth the wait.It is a charming space right in the heart of Williamsburg. The interior has Moroccan touches and is cozy and inviting.The food here is excellent. I went with a group and shared several plates. The hummus/falafel platter and babaganoosh are, unsurprisingly, delicious. We also had the roasted halumi cheese and a cauliflower appetizer that were pretty tasty.My favorite dish that I tried here was the Bastilla. It was prepared with a deliciously golden flaky crust and stuffed with perfectly seasoned shredded chicken. We also had a roasted chicken entree and whole fish which were pretty good, but I'd probably try something different next time.The service was great and the staff was very friendly. I definitely plan on returning for more delicious bites. The brunch menu, in particular, looks very enticing.","Where do I begin. Let me just relish on how amazing this place is. We came here over the weekend to what was the start to a fun filled night. I anticipated a wait time since it was pretty busy, but the hostess was able to get us seated in less than 5 mins. I made the safe bet with the granola bowl, Eggs Norwegian, and side of Canadian bacon. The wife had chicken with basmati rice, in addition, we added a Falafel with Tahini. Everything was fantastic! The waitress was very kind, and alert. She was definitely on her A game, since she had several tables in her jurisdiction and everything came out perfectly without any hitch. Also, the food wait time was at a minimal. I appreciated the chill vibes, as they are profound here, with Queen and the Bugees playing on the same playlist. I've noticed that we've been steering more and more away from the city as Bk and Queens have consistently produced some solid brunch spots. With quality places like a Cafe Mogador you can see why =).",Cafe Mogador
36,"I came here last night with my boyfriend for our anniversary. Based on some of pictures posted on Yelp, it looked like it would be a quiet place, due to the dining area being dimly lit. It was slightly difficult to find this restaurant because there was no name on the front door. The dining area was very loud and at times it was difficult to hold a conversation. I felt like we were shouting at each other. The food was tapas style. Our server suggested 2-3 plates person. We ordered the polenta, black bass, Japanese eggplant, gnocchi, and braised short ribs. All were delicious. However, I felt like most of the dishes were on the spicy side and the menu made no mention of it. It was even enough to fill us up. The only downside is the price. It is a little pricey for tapas.","Looks can be deceiving! For years, I have walked by this seemingly charming restaurant and never gone in. When back in the neighborhood relatively early on a Sunday evening, my boyfriend and I stopped in. Now he had just come from an art competition and was schlepping a canvas and and brushes and other ""creative person"" items. The hostess was friendly and suggested that she store the items for him. That was very kind and helpful. The place is massive. In the front is a sexy, dark bar and in the back, there are two large rooms; one being a balcony overlooking the rest of the restaurant. For ambiance or a date night, this would get five stars undoubtedly. Unfortunately, the quality of the food was average, not worth the price point in my humble opinion, and the service was awkward and off putting. Our server tried to cajole us to buy alcohol and we didn't order a lot of food as we just wanted to share two dishes. He suggested that every person rather than the table have at least 3 dishes. Yes, the tapas were small and we were still hungry, but being that we are not corporate yuppies, we don't want to end up spending $200 bucks on average food. All in all, we had the goat cheese balls which were above average, but not outstanding. We also shared the lamb balls which were tasty, and a nochi. They were flavorful, but not necessarily memorable. When asking the server what he likes on the menu, he seemed annoyed that we were asking and was just so awkward in his demeanor. (I see other reviews describing a condescending server and me thinks it is very likely the same person.) He did recommend the candy bar for dessert which we tried. Again, it was good, but nothing amazing. All in all, our server was so awkward that we felt very uncomfortable there and didn't really enjoy the overall experience.","Very disappointing venue - terrible service and they charge $10 for bread the size of an English muffin. The waiter was extremely condescending; I ordered something by mistake and did not touch it. When I asked him to change my order to something else, he said he could not because it would be thrown out and no one would eat it. I was surprised at his answer as this venue is not only a very expensive establishment (3 $$$), but even the lowest tier McDonald's will change a customer's order to make it right. It is scandalous that a restaurant that serves small portions that require an accompaniment of bread does not offer any option but a $10 naan bread that is sufficient for one person only because it's the size of an English muffin.","I had not been to Alta in about ten years, but I was surprised happily to see that it was still there.I am not a huge fan of tapas places, but I do like the tapas at Alta.  The food was quite good, as was the selection. The staff were helpful, and attentive.",Have been here twice. Surprisingly easier to get reservations to for similar type and sized restaurants. Have ordered over 15 different tapas. All of them have been exceptionally good. Great date place,"Nice ambiance, great margaritas and wine , service spectacular. We were passing by and saw this littlePlace and caught our attention and it was super cute and cozy and amazing",Alta
37,Went for lunch by myself on 8/18/19. My wife and Son decided on other options. This place is a whole in the wall for sure. They serve good portions and for $6.00 I had more than enough for me to be full and I gave a good meal to a homeless guy sleeping on a nearby bench. The pork was very good and tender. The white rice was filling. The sauce was good but as others have mentioned not as much spice or flavor as I needed. If I was a starving student and lived close by I would be a regular here. Since I am not I probably would not go back.,"I really regret not getting crispy pork belly here. It's not really obvious on the sign that there is pork belly, and it was hard to see all the meats in the window. We ended up getting the roasted pork and roasted duck, both of which were solid. For the price, they were both good. I would definitely come back to try the other meats. Although there was a line, everything moved really quickly. But that also made us feel very rushed when trying to look at what they had.","For the price, it's worth 6 stars...6You get so much food for your money. I mean...it's not the tastiest or the cleanest, but if you're poor and hungry, this is the place to go.The duck as a little bland but the crispy roast pork was actually surprisingly good.","Although this place is not some exquisite high class place, given the price and quality of their food along with their speedy service I'd have to give this place 5 stars! All day everyday Wah Fung has a steal deal where you can order a small rice and stir-fried cabbage with the choice of pork or chicken for only $4.25. The portion they give is definitely large enough to fill you up. I have tried both their pork and chicken, which are both tasty, but I enjoyed the pork slightly better. The meat is prepared very tenderly and is delicious, especially when paired with the sauce, rice and cabbage. I haven't tried their duck yet so I'd like to return to give that a try. This place is just overall a great place to go to when you're not in the mood to cook, want something cheap, but still yummy.*Wah Fung is cash only so make sure you come prepared with a few dollar bills :)","Forget why I bookmarked this but I did.  So while in the vicinity I had to try it out.  Small pork or chicken ""bowl"" for $4.25.  That's a deal considering I had just left the Fulton where dual entrees left us with a $100 bill.  For the price, the food is a great option for a quick on the go lunch.  BUT I have eaten at Vanessa's Dumpling House around the corner so in comparison this is just not a competitor.   Vanessa's happened to be closed.  Given the option between the two, I'd probably not venture here again.  Great option for low carb diets tho!!!",If you are like some people I know and stay clear of any sketchy looking places and/or will not wander into hole in the wall spots that may seem a bit unsanitary...stay away.If you are like myself and seek hole in the wall mom/pop shops that have good or gteat food along with cheap prices...definately stop by.They do have some options that I have not tried but the specialty here and what pretty much everyone is ordering is the plate of chicken or pork with rice and cabbage. A small is only $5 which is a great find in the city.There will usually be a line out the door that does move pretty quickly and be aware that no seating is available. A park located directly across the street is more appealing to me anyhow for a quick bite.Enjoy.,Wah Fung No 1 Fast Food
38,"There aren't many AYCE hot pot options around Flushing that I've found, which is a little surprising. Maybe I'm jut not looking hard enough, or maybe AYCE is not a sustainable business model around here for whatever reason.99 Flavor Taste is A-OK. When it gets busy you can share a table with another small party if you're dining solo or a group of 2. This makes for an awkward dining experience, since the shared tables aren't long or rounded, they're just a typical booth. No deduction here though, since you can always come early or wait for a table.Mostly, there's just nothing interesting or outstanding about the ingredients, service, selection, or flavors here. If you're in the mood for AYCE hot pot, I'd say you can go here and feel alright after. Not wowed, but not super disappointed. Precisely a 3/5 experience.",Will update this after the meal - made some edits. Will keep you all posted!Seriously - will do.,I'd say good not great. Had the kimchi hot pot and bbq. Broth was good nothing special. Same with their bbq and their ingredients.Don't care to come back reallyWhat really upset me was how much food they let go to waste. They should put a limit as to how many things people can order at a time or something to prevent so much waste. So I don't support that aspect.,"If you're looking for a quick bite, this is NOT it and you're going to feel very 2-star about this space. However, if you're willing to wait this is a fabulous experience. Get on the waitlist, go get some ice cream to burn 40 minutes, come back and wait another 40 minutes. Yep, it took time to get in y'all. But the wait was WORTH. We did the hot pots (1 spicy, 1 pork bone). You are able to choose up to three flavored soup bases, with prices fluctuating by amount and age of customer. From this point on it's essentially an all you can eat extravaganza. Be sure to mix and match sauces. The meats and veg were fresh and neatly prepared; we loved the white fish, beef, lamb, enoki, and spinach. Okay... we loved all of it. We left with full bellies, clear sinuses, and messy shirts (don't wear your fancy clothes people).","We came here for lunch on Saturday. It's a pretty popular place so if your party is more than 4, you should try to get a reservation ahead of time. Overall we found the restaurant was well organized and service was fairly quick. They were able to accommodate our non-pork broth request with veg-based broth. As far as flavors go, I did not find the food or broths much different from other hot pots I've been to. The sauce station was also ok with the peanut, sesame, and soy variations you see at other hotpot places. The value in this location is that it's all you can eat so make sure to come hungry! Out of the fresh ingredients, we enjoyed the beef, mushrooms, squid, spinach, and pumpkin the most.",Best place food is good worth the price They help you cook the kbbq So you can eat and not worry about cooking,99 Favor Taste
39,"Rude and unwelcoming host and waiter. The menu is limited, doesn't have any vegan options. They refused to adjust any meals for vegan diet. Overpriced.","Just ate here with friends. The food was tasty, despite being over priced and having egg shell in the Eggs Florentine. Our waiter was the real downside of the experience. He was rude when asked questions about ingredients, but the most concerning part was when he delivered our buttermilk biscuits at the end of the meal. We had ordered them to go with our meal but had long since finished and he promised to take it off the bill. When another waiter delivered them, we were surprised, but reached for them anyway only for him to snatch them up and put them on another table. This is crazy unsanitary and made us very uncomfortable. You can't take unattended food from one table and put it on another! Gross! Won't be coming back here.","My wife and I stopped in here after we walked the Brooklyn bridge, and had a few drinks and snacks. It's mostly a place that would probably require a reservation at peak times, but they have a bar and common table in the bar area that's first come, first serve. The drinks were reasonably priced for NYC and the Mac and cheese is to die for. Then we just got some fries, but ultimately a cool spot to swing through if you need a destination after the bridge.","Delicious drinks, cute ambiance, and pretty good food. I highly recommend giving the tea and kalamansi cocktail a try.For food, I enjoyed the mussel appetizer and duck breast entree. Dipping the complimentary toasted and garlicky bread into the mussel's butter sauce was divine. The duck breast entree was very tender and flavorful.","The staff acted like we were lucky to be able to ""get in"" for Sunday brunch. Red Flag 1. They weren't even busy. The cocktails were decent but not worth $17! I had the bloody mary and my friend had a mimosa. The food was terrible. The avocado toast was cold as was the poached egg on top. My friend had the eggs Florentine and didn't like it at all. The portions were very small.We left spending $70 plus tip for the least-satisfying brunch ever.","Party of 4 was in and out in 45 min thanks to the server that couldn't wait to go home. We were rushed out of the restaurant in a pressing bordering with aggressive manner. Another round of drinks wasn't offered, neither was the dessert. We were not the last nor second to last table there. Ordered housemade bread was ice-cold in the center, the second one was charred and greasy -drizzled in butter. Cheese board was thrown on the table with no explanation. We were enjoying 5 mysterious cheeses. It was our second time there - we brought our traveling from the West Coast friends. Left feeling ashamed for the server's behavior. Not coming back.",Atrium Dumbo
40,My go to place for dumplings and hand-pulled noodles.,"Not sure what all the hype was about. Just ok tasting noodles, nothing out of this world!","The noodles and the dumplings are so fresh, they almost melt in your mouth. Every time I am in NY, I have to stop by. This place is small so sometimes there is a wait but people usually eat quickly and leave since this place is cramped and dirty. I would give them a 5 star if they remodeled and cleaned up a bit. But the food is superb and pricing just right.","Let's face it: you don't come here for the service or a clean dining experience. You strictly come here for the food.My all-time favorite dish is the pan fried pork chop noodles with knife cut noodles. The soups are also good, but the noodles in this dish are extra chewy and flavorful. It's the Chinese rival to Piccola Cucina Osteria Siciliana (a fabulous Italian joint on Spring Street that serves handmade noodles). You can also get a massive meal for a small price--but remember that this is a cash-only establishment! Come prepared.",The noodle soups are pretty good here - my favorite to order is always breef brisket noodle soup.Soup is pretty good but I've had better broth at other hand pulled noodle places.The dumplings are alright here as well - nothing too special.I'll still recommend this place for their noodle soups! Something warm and homey - it hits the spot on those cold winter nights!,"The food is great. Four stars, really. But let's talk about the service, consideration (or should I say lack of). I placed a simple order and patiently waited for my food. An hour passed, then another. Where the heck was my food?! I was hungry when I ordered and now I was hangry. But I kept my composure and kindly called them to ask. The woman who answered said it wasn't her fault because she was new and didn't know how to work the system. That's fine and I said ""so will it come?"" She responded, ""do you want it to come?"" (Umm I don't know I think I ordered it for a reason...) and we asked her to deliver and she said, ""fine."" Thirty minutes passed and I call again, and asked to cancel the food because we had been waiting too long. She said ""ok"" and quickly hung up.  AND did not refund me. Long story short. They are rude and disrespectful but somehow equally delicious",Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles
41,"I was really disappointed with their Brunch. I haven't been to Jane before, but the inside seemed a bit crowded, with tables crowded next to each other. My sister and I decided to sit at the bar since the wait was 30 minutes for a table around 1 pm on Memorial Day. My sister ordered an ice coffee, which we couldn't find on their menu (probably because they use a Nespresso/coffee machine, which the bartender told us). I assume they at least have typical breakfast beverages if you ask?We ordered two sides, chicken sausage and rosemary fries, which were served before our main dishes. The chicken sausage was flavorless, didn't seem to be seasoned at all. The rosemary fries were lukewarm and tasted like regular fries. I think they just used the rosemary as garnish. For our mains, my sister order the Salmon Benedict. She told me that her food wasn't hot, and when I took a bite, I could tell that it was either sitting out for a while or it had been made before my dish. I ordered the Farmers Popover, which did come out fresh from the kitchen. However, the outer bread tasted burnt and the inside did not have any seasoning. Very disappointing, even with added salt and pepper. I definitely would not waste my time to travel to this restaurant or waste my time for flavorless, lukewarm/cold food. We were starving after our gym class, and the food still didn't taste good to us. My sister said this was one of the most disappointing meals she's had. Recommend Jane's brunch to people you hate!","Not great value here. Nine pieces of tiny gnocchi for $17. Ouch, right? Here's the story:Ordered (via yelp delivery) the gnocchi and the Caesar salad. The gnocchi is AMAZING. Like SO GOOD, but the ""small"" dinner portion comes with exactly nine pieces of gnocchi. They are very, very small pieces (see photos). For $17 I expected more! SEVENTEEN DOLLARS. That should give you a whole meal, even if it's the ""small"" dinner portion.  Quite disappointed. Even though the gnocchi tasted amazing, I'm not sure I see myself ordering from this place again, and you should consider the price-value situation here before ordering. To me, the value just isn't there. Not really ever in the mood to light $17 on fire for a snack. The Caesar salad wasn't anything to write home about. Really. Very normal and meh.","Came here for brunch with my dawg, left feeling pretty meh about the restaurant overall. To start with positives, the space is really nice - the dining area is open, with good lighting, high ceilings, and lots of tables. Service was great, both at the bar and when seated at a table. And while I didn't get a drink, the cocktail menu looked interesting, with some unique offerings that showed effort.Unfortunately, our food wasn't all that great. We got the brussel sprouts to start (photo included), because the addition of orange zest sounded really interesting. The orange flavor never got a chance to come through in the dish, as the sprouts were really salty and drenched in oil.For meals, I got the huevos rancheros (also pictured), and was pretty disappointed. The dish wasn't very flavorful, with eggs well-prepared but dominating the overall taste. It's a shame I couldn't enjoy salsa, beans, or the tortilla underneath. I felt like I was eating overpriced diner eggs, with the other components of the meal added in as an afterthought.My friend ordered the burger, medium. What he got was a well-done meat patty, with no pink to be found in the center. And the trimmings on the burger left a lot to be desired.Overall I would say that Jane is a better place for a drink than anything else, as the food wasn't particularly impressive or deserving of that NYC brunch price tag that we all know and hate.","Honestly just another very strong brunch place to hit up downtown. I can't say there is something I particularly disliked or liked, because the quality of their food is very solid. I ordered a HUGE sandwich and it came along also with a HUGE plate of rosemary fries. I was particularly craving some fries so that was a huge plus. The french toast was fluffy and soft according to my friend, and the smoked salmon benedict had a gorgeous yolk drip. Although, the greens on the side of the benedict did seem a little wimpy. This wasn't my first time coming here, and both times there wasn't anything mindblowing, but the overall experience was quite pleasant.","Heard tons of recommendations for brunch at Jane and finally had a chance to check It out on a weekday. Honestly, the food was not mind-blowingly good or bad; the menu definitely did not impress me right off the bat and all the dishes seemed pretty ""standard"" for brunch items. Ordered the Avocado Toast, Classic Eggs Benedict, and Meatballs to share. The avocado toast was at best just ok - the toast to avocado ratio was really off: the toast itself was really thick compared to the little amount of avocado spread. The crust was very hard to the point where it was almost hard to chew. The two poached eggs on top was actually cooked perfectly with a runny yolk (so the photos came out really pretty). The meatballs tasted fine flavor wise but were a bit cold to my liking. The classic eggs Benedict was pretty basic as well, you know how eggs, ham, English muffin taste with hollandaise sauce. No major complains, but the all the dishes made me wonder if I should have ordered something more extravagant like French toast (you can never go wrong with that!). Service wise, I am not sure if it was because that I went on a weekday, but the kitchen REALLY took their time serving the dishes (and we did not order burger or anything hard to make). I would give the over experience a two and a half stars but the atmosphere of the restaurant overall was decent and got a table next to the window which pumped the overall rating to a 3 star.","Came here for brunch with a friend one Saturday. She got the Eggs Benedict as she's heard that that's what Jane is know for, but said that she was disappointed with it. We shared the French toast, which had a vanilla creme brulee batter, which sounded great in theory, but in reality was meh. My huevos rancheros was not the best I've ever had. The tortilla was soggy, and the flavors were just ok. The best part of my meal here was the cocktail I got called the Barnstormer, featuringbourbon, aperol, amaro nonino,grapefruit, and sparkling wine. I wouldn't reccomend it for brunch as it was a bit strong for that early in the day, but for cocktails at night it's a ten out of ten. I suppose if come back for drinks. The Brunch just seemed a bit overhyped.",Jane
42,"Overall, if I lived nearby, this would be my go to pasta takeout! The pasta is fresh and cooked deliciously. We got the cacio e pepe dish, which was a big hit. It has the perfect mix of cheese and pepper and is a respectable portion. The other dish we tried was a special: truffle fettuccine. This was good (pasta was cooked perfectly), but it has a milder flavor, and I would try something different next time.Be aware that there is no official waitlist. It depends on Lillo to remember who came first, which makes it difficult if you want to leave and grab a drink somewhere during the waiting time. **there is NO BATHROOM at this restaurant, so plan accordingly.","Come on people. This hype is absurd. The place is decent. The food is nothing special. The most unique thing about this place is that there are no reservations, no list to put your name on, and no one to tell you how long until your table may be ready or where you are in the queue, because none exists.  So if that gets you going and really jazzed for some average Italian food that you could easily replicate at home, I get your 5 star rating. Bottom line: Don't believe the hype. If this spot wasn't in BK, but was in say the east village, it wouldn't get so much dap.","As an italian that just got back from visiting Rome, it gets all the thumbs up!! Molto Bene!",I love this place because they make it their priority to serve simple and delicious food. It's totally no frills and they make due with the space they have.The menu is simple variations of similar pasta dishes. Everything is delicious and you can't go wrong with anything. I had the speck with zucchini and the rigatoni with eggplant. Definitely start with one of their salads too - I had the white bean and tuna salad.Can't wait to go back to try the tiramisu with an afogato.,What a great find! The food and service is irreplaceable and amazing! Meatballs and spaghetti Ragu are to die for!! Will return soon!,"I was visiting New York and found this dope Italian restaurant right next to where I was working. From the outside it looks like a coffeshop but from the second you walk into the joint you know it's a great restaurant. The owner welcomes you like a friend and you get the sense of being home on some fancy ish. Its beautiful inside, light streaming through small windows that making you feel like you're in Genoa siting by the sea side. But most importantly, the food is great especially the Cacio de Pepe. The portions were served on large rustic ceramic plates and at the end you always want a little bit more.At the end I ordered a Cappuccino that was off the charts!Mos def coming back here again!",Lillo Cucina Italiana
43,"Katz's Deli is a hyped up NYC staple, but that's about it. I personally think it's overpriced and overrated. The lines are always crazy and the sandwiches are famously overloaded, but the taste for me has always been just mediocre. If you are familiar with traditional NY Jewish-style deli, you know that there are much better ones around, with a less chaotic environment. That being said, if you are in NYC visiting, you should definitely stop in and grab a sandwich and pickles. Maybe even sit where Harry met Sally. Will end up back here at some point and will update my review if anything changes.","Katz's is a very popular Lower East Side deli. They're famous for their large meat sandwiches. Ive heard several people say its the best corned beefed/or rueben they've ever had. I'm not a huge meat eater so I usually get fries and a soda. Extremely popular with tourists, this place is always packed with a line out the door. Its chaotic and hard to understand how it all works. A few notes that might help you:-You take a ticket and go to the counter to order your food from the men making it or sit down at a Waiter Table.-Tables against the wall are Waiter Service Only, tables in the middle are Self Serve meaning you order at the counter then sit down. -The front door register is cash only. If you're paying with a card, pay at the back register.This is a no frills cafeteria style diner with high prices, rushed orders and wet school lunch trays. The French fries were ok. We take out of town relatives here because they've heard of it and they want to go but we never go outside of that.","Despite how famous Katz's Delicatessen is, I really am not a fan of their  famous pastrami sandwich with their homemade mustard on rye bread. I tried to like it, but it was not that delicious to me. The sandwich was abundant so sharing between two people is ideal. The pastrami meat was very savory and juicy, however, I thought it was very oily too. After eating the pastrami sandwich, I had a guilty feeling that I just cut off a few years of my life by eating this.I also do not like their ordering system and that it can be a bit annoyance if you accidentally lost your ticket.",Definitely worth the hype. The pastrami sandwich is really good. It's clear why this place is famous. Definitely worth a visit at least once.,"These sandwiches are huge. Fresh bread stacked with loads of tender flavorful meat in between. My boyfriend and I split a pastrami and it was enough for us. Definitely could not have finished two whole sandwiches.Their set up needs improvement. The line breaks into smaller lines, but the smaller lines goes straight into the seating area, making it hard to get to the lines further down and find seats.Verdict: It's good, but I don't know if I'd go back. Like it's good to try, but it's not something I'd crave or anything. And their sandwiches are pretty pricey, $22 for a pastrami. I know meat can be expensive and they give you a good amount, but that's probably the most expensive sandwich I've had before.","Half and half pastrami with brisket is the go to. With mustard. Their different lines to order is quite efficient, because it's actually making the food that takes some time - not the wait. Keep your ticket they give upon entering as that's basically your receipt, and a lost fee is applied if you don't have one! You pay before you leave. The brisket was extremely tender and juicy. I got both brisket and pastrami so I think that definitely played with the flavoring more, and added extra taste. Tasted even better with mustard and pickles!",Katz's Delicatessen
44,"Few big brunch places that receive reservation in NYC. Very convenient to visit. Ordered the Sicilian eggs, which is really good. I love the tomato in general. Also ordered the egg Benedict. Good but not special.One star is deducted for the noise. I really cannot hear my friend who sit in front of me.",Worst service ever!! Waiter was grumpy took our order and never returned - definitely not going back and will not recommend to friends and family!!,The good:  Great service.  The bad:  Food was overpriced and average in taste.The ugly:  Yelp reviews way overrated in my opinion.,"They have a few around Manhattan but you're always going to be in good hands. They've focused on the important things: food and service. I've never had a bad meal from lunch to dinner. Yesterday's choice was the apex with only two words - Short Rib. It was gently placed in a warm mound of polenta with crispy onions/shallots? It should only with a spoon because you need nothing else to pull the meat apart and savor mouthfuls of flavor. It was a solid portion, but not too big that you can't think of dessert. If you agree, you should choose the caramel laden Sticky Toffee which will arrive in a cast iron mini skillet. A large dollop of vanilla bean ice cream gives you the perfect blend of chocolate and vanilla. Overall it's a great place with strong service and excellent food (despite the acoustics challenge that make you yell at your friends so they can hear you).","The Mac and cheese was SO good. And I take mac and cheese seriously. Granted, it's an ""appetizer"" but we ordered it as a main dish for brunch and it was plenty for 2 people..maybe even 3 for those who don't LOVE mac and cheese the way we do (assuming people like that exist). The French toast that my friend got was pretty good.. a little too sweet for my liking but since we shared the two dishes it was a perfect combo of sweet and salty. It just worked perfectly together. The place is HUGE, and elegant. The staff was friendly and attentive. Solid choice for brunch. I wanted to try the Sicilian baked eggs, but that would've been way too much food for one sitting..so will likely go back to try that.","Disgustingly Rude.This USED TO be our go-to spot for a delicious meal and great service. Until....... today. We made a reservation, (though early for dinner) with hopes to secure a window seat. I managed to get the day off and wanted to spend the warm afternoon with my kids by one of the beautiful sunlit windows that line the front of the restaurant. We checked in and were pleased to see that they weren't too busy. It was still early, 4ish.  The hostess proceeded to bring us to a table that was *not by a window and I noticed that there was an open one by a window. I politely asked her if we could possibly have that one instead and the attitude began...... She reluctantly agreed but then mentioned that it needed to be cleaned first. So we agreed to wait. The original table was in the middle of the restaurant and she just walked off. As we didn't want to awkwardly stand in the middle of the room, we opted to stand beside the new table while we waited. She then came back and told us - very firmly and in a rude tone 'I told you, we need to set it up first!' I was so taken back by her attitude. I tried to keep things positive, especially since my kids were around and thanked her for the effort. I then said , I really appreciated it and mentioned that I had put it in my resv. notes. The kids were really excited to be by the window I said. She then, snapped at me and said 'The other table IS BY A WINDOW' *which was not * It was so rude that the busser who was resetting the table looked at me in shock. And then tried his best to set the table faster. I asked her for her name and I mentioned that I understood because I'm in the industry and she -*once again - walked off!!!!!!!! If my kids were not with me, this situation would have gone in a completely different direction. But I wasn't about to spoil our Friday afternoon because of one sour grape. Suffice to say, it spoiled our appetite and what could've easily been a full meal experience, turned out to be a rushed and awkward feeling. Our server was the only happy thing about this experience and the only reason why they got a star at all. She was joyful and attentive as always. And she was the ONLY reason why we didn't leave. But we won't be back. Oh --- and did I mention, that I'm a CHEF! Ha! For a 3 star in the city. . So yeah, ... bad move, Miss. This block survives off of the neighborhood, and WE ALL talk to each other. Good luck.",The Smith
45,Ordered chicken pad thai for take out around dinner time ...and was disappointed It was a large portion...but my noodles tasted dry and there were a couple pieces of chicken I bit into but it didnt seem like the meat was cooked fully and clumps of noodle stuck together.Honestly it wouldve tasted better if I ate there instead of doing a take out.,"Unbelievable food, we came from Hollywood Los Angeles,  the city of Thai food.  Was in doubt when we got here.We ordered path thai,  beef curry,  Thai basil chicken fired rice,  papaya salad.  Foods are so tasty, services was excellent, our server name is Nice, she was the best.We'll be back when visit NYC.Highly recommended.",Foods are great but the service is so awwwwwful!!!We waited for our foods for more than half an hour. Waitress was not responsive at all. I asked for my Diet Coke for three times!!!!! I was so disappointed at their service. That day was a special anniversary for me but they just totally ruined it!!!!What is worse is that the waitress checked how much tips I gave and asked for more. I gave them 10% because I was angry BUT she asked for 20% and she refused to give me the receipt unless I gave her 20%. WHAT IS THIS??? A ROBBERY?!!!!!--------------The owner said that they would look into the gratuity problem. Feeling better now....,"Restaurant was a gem of a find on the UES .We picked this place because of its large outdoor space. However it ended up raining and we were inside and it was still lovely. Fantastic atmosphere! Great food! Loved the Khao Soi, particularly my recent trip to Thailand. It was equally authentic here!  My 4 girlfriends and I loved it! Will be back!","It is def worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood! Solid choice!! The service is on point. Everyone is so friendly! And can see them being super efficient, working hard so it's a smooth operation, and drinks and food coming out super quick. Came for dinner without reservation. They said it would be a 20 minute wait. So we decided to just eat at the bar - and no wait haha. Sitting at the bar we also got to see the bartender at work - it was pretty coolThe place probably seats 30 ppl inside, and then another 20 ppl outside. There were a lot of groups and families. The menu had good amount of choices, there was right amount of variety without being overwhelming. the pictures were definitely helpful. I checked in on yelp! And got $1 Thai ice teaI learned from a sign in bathroom of you write a review on yelp, it's a free Thai ice tea or Thai coffee! Haha I saw the review wayyy to late, after paid bill and about to leave - missed out haha The food was very tasty. I ordered the pad Thai and it was standard haha. The curry was actually very good. It didn't order t as my dish bc it had one spicy symbol, but it's actually not spicy at all. So would recommend that.",Update:Came here again and got the chicken pad Thai. Very good. Also doing the check in for the free Thai iced tea!!! ---We came here on a Sunday afternoon. No wait. We had the the THEP platter. It comes with two pieces each. It has 4 dipping sauces. All very good. We got the queen basil with chicken. It was super spicy. We did not realize this. Still great. They offer a check in special for a $1 Thai iced tea. It was very good. We would come back again. Actually. It is my second tkm,THEP Thai Restaurant
46,"I have been going back for work lunches and a few dinners, and after the experience the past few months I think it's time to break up. I've experienced nothing but slow service without any explanations, meals that I've had to send back, unfriendly hostesses, and some salty meals. Food is generally really good- but the service since they opened has gone downhill.","Unfortunately, despite calling ahead to ensure we would have a table, the hostess was intent on articulating that the restaurant is not a welcoming place for customers. We arrived with less than 5 occupied tables in the place, and the restaurant remained largely empty through the course of our meal. Yet, when we walked in, no one greeted us, leaving us to stand by the door for nearly a minute, wondering if they were actually open for business. When the host finally graced us with her presence, she started the interaction by rolling her eyes while asking if we made a reservation. We did. Went downhill from there.There were leftover food bits on the unwashed drinking glass at our table. When I pointed the dirty dish out to our waiter, instead of handing us a clean glass from the multiple unoccupied tables next to us, he left to ""get us a new glass"". This took over 8 minutes. The water we asked for took over 15 minutes to arrive. Drinks (draft beer) also took unusually long, considering that the restaurant was empty.The food was clearly microwaved and drenched in stale olive oil to compensate for the rubbery texture. Previous reviews also echo this. The view is nice, but not worth the abusive service athmosphere! If you want to watch the view from here, be mentally prepared for bad vibes and extremely overpriced and subpar food.",The good was okay but way overpriced for the minisculeportions.  The staff have no knowledge of allergies and actually kept bringing the very things we are allergic to.  The shakshuka eggs came raw.,"Celestine has such an amazing location right under the Manhattan bridge, the views can not be beat. They also open all the exterior windows in summer that you're basically sitting on the water. The menu has some standard Mediterranean dishes plus some more unique things I hadn't tried before. But, literally everything was delicious. We had...-baba ghannouj -pistachio feta spread-Manti (so good)-reginette-cauliflower & broccolini -mjuderah-Persian potatoI recommend anything I listed above. This would be a great place for a special occasion because the view is so spectacular. I'm excited to come back later in fall/winter and check out the cozy vibes.","This is a new place near my office - and a great option for a nicer dinner with the team or clients. First, the view is phenomenal, I could sit there with a bottle of wine and be happy.I went with a few friends and we immediately went back a few days later, I want to try their brunch! We each had a cocktail and loved them. I can't recall the names. We split a few dishes both times:1). Baba Ganoush - 5/5 so yummy2). Muhammara - 5/5 very yummy3). Hummus - 5/5 4). Flat Bread - 5/55). Branzino - 5/56). Short Rib Dumpling - 5/57). Green Bean Salad - 4/5Service was good, but the food was amazing.","Extremely pricey with unfocused service.   You are mostly paying for the view, which is the underside of the Manhattan Bridge, which makes me wonder if even that is worth the price.  Still at sunset, with the all glass walls and the gentle setting, it is a lovely moment.Drinks were novel and good.  Room pretty.  People also pretty.However, the service left much to be desired.  The room was not full, and yet we suffered long waits for our courses and for our server's attention. Our server floated about the room, exhibiting a casual, chatty manner, which, although it might delight some customers to have one's server making extended small talk at one's table, failed to deliver the attentive experience that I would expect for the very dear price this establishment demands for its Mediterranean offerings, many of which are simply street food with lipstick painted on (falafel, hummus, etc...).I had the Flatiron steak, which consisted of 8 or 10 slices of tender and nicely seasoned meat but for the price, I could have enjoyed a formidable, dry aged 16 oz New York Strip at many a well known steakhouse in NYC.  My companions ordered the whole Branzino.  Again, delicious and tender, but for the price not so sure it was worth it.The bill when it arrived, was heart stopping.  Never again.The walk along the water following the dinner was the highlight of the evening.  It was a lovely night, comfortably temperate, with a light breeze.",Celestine
47,Used to be one of my top brunch spots in the city when they used to have all you can eat and drink!  They've switched up to a prefix menu while offering bottomless drinks.  Not the same and super disappointed they changed it up.,"I went to Bea last night.Cocktails are not such a good option, I tried the maracuya margarita and it tasted more like a regular juice.Food is nice and environment is also nice.Server was nice but he was not very attentive. Every time we had to look for him to make our requests.","DONT GO THERE!! Bad food, slow service and unprofessional manager. I went with my friend who came from Colombia to have brunch and everything was a disaster. We got the bottomless brunch and the food was horrible.I got the French toasts and they were made with BAGUETTE BREAD!! The funny thing is the people next to  us they got a nice brioche bread so when I asked why they made the French toasts with baguette bread they said it was because they didn't have more brioche bread so instead of letting me know that they decided to make that with that disgusting bread. I requested to talk with the manager and he offered me to get another plate so I got the egg Benedict which I saw first in the table next to us so when I got the egg they came without any salad and cold. The manager didn't do ANYTHING!! He didn't even know how to manage the situation and the only thing he did was remove $10 from the bill. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!",Came here with my mom before a broadway show for her bday! The table was approx the width of my big toe but it was super cute and the food was amazing!! Def make a reservation there was a line out the door within the hr of it opening for dinner service!!The waiter was very nice and made sure we got the check on time so we wouldn't miss the show!The green pasta and the ricotta appetizer were so good and unique I would go back and order that again and not share it this time because I'm a fat ass ‍ #yolo,"Stumbled upon this place for brunch with no reservations on a Sunday - but fortunately snagged some seats at the bar. When you walk in, you are instantly greeted by waitstaff who actually open the door for you. The inside is charming and very cute. There's an outside patio area that has a lot of natural light where the rest of the restaurant is pretty dark. Began with drinks, the blushing mimosa and regular mimosa - you would think service would be quick sitting at the bar but I believe the bartender forgot about us. The menu mentions I pre fixe, which includes ricotta with honey for the table, a starter, a share, and an entree for $26. My friend was able to do this while I ordered an entree a la carte and they let us split everything no problem - how accommodating! I got the steak and eggs which was only $15 and a very generous portion! The ricotta and honey, kale Caesar, and Brussels were all delicious and flavorful as well! Oh and the best part - we had 6 drinks and were only charged for 2! We will be back BEA","I'm obsessed with AYCE restaurants which I'm not sure if they even have here anymore but I checked out their AYCE brunch with my husband last year. The restaurant is huge and super cute. Service was amazing but the food was just average. And as my husband likes to tell me, every restaurant is technically all you can eat ahem.The standouts were the house ricotta, candied thick cut bacon, and brioche french toast. The benedict was a mess and definitely should be skipped.",Bea
48,Randomly came across this place on yelp and couldn't believe all the reviews they had and all 5 stars?? (What what??) I decided to give it a try for brunch on a Saturday and boy were these reviews on point! The burger? BOMB! The truffle fries? BOMB!! The drinks?! BOMB!!,My go-to brunch spot in Queens! Service is always friendly here. I usually get the avocado toast because I'm boring but it never disappoints!I also love their margaritas/monitors. Really interesting flavors!,Ratings for this place has got to be rigged. Overall Rating: 2.75 Stars for average food and inexperienced staff.  Slightly odd and pretty underwhelming experience. Food: 3 StarsThere was nothing special about it.Service: 2.5 StarsGetting a table for 3 was a long wait because most of their tables are for couples and their largest table was held for a party of 5 or more.  Worst part is there's nowhere to wait besides in the heat outside or by the bar which is really reserved for drinking only.  We basically had nowhere to wait and saw a couple of empty tables around that they wouldn't seat us at.Atmosphere: 2.5 StarsIt was very cluttered and instead of using their  ACs on a hot summer day they had fans on resulting in unnecessary mugginess.  The servers would wiggle their way in between customers and often bumped into me instead of walking where there was more space.,"Lovely neighborhood restaurant with a late night kitchen. We will often show up close to midnight looking for dinner. The service has never faltered and the food has never disappointed in the past 3 years. We come in about 3 times a month. The staff are amazingly nice. We are often greeted with a ""hey guys!"" and a hand shake. The service is attentive and quick. The menu is simple, with lots of items to choose from: sandwiches, salads, burgers (yum!!), and nachos (my fav) just to name a few. I would describe the menu as wholesome, comfort food. The dishes are simple, without overly complex flavors and no fancy-shmancy sauces. BUT that does not mean the food isn't fantastic. It is very good, quality food with flavors that stand out. Also, they have a great tap list from local breweries and quality glasses of wine for under $10. We will continue to come here for our late night dinners.","September 2019 11/10! Thank you Jonathan and Geill? (sorry I misspelled your name) for this amazing meal! from ambiance to food, perfection! A restaurant with such good vibes are hard to come around and when it does, I have to keep telling people about it! The servers and customers there were so friendly in suggesting what's good in this tiny but cozy place in the hearty of Sunnyside, happy hours til 7pm. We had all the popular dishes like nachos, skirt steak lollipop, alcove burger with upgraded truffle fries, cuban sandwich, angus burger (when I actually meant to order alcove, either way, this is delicious as well), and the churros with mango sorbet. We also tried the margarita flight (included in HH!) with guava, passiofruit, pineapple and traditional flavors (shot glass sized), tamarind margarita, and blueberry beer! We all enjoyed our time there and I definitely would come back for more! Keep it up, The Alcove!","Our experience on Friday night was extraordinary! The 30 minute wait was more than worth it. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant, and looked around to see that the place was packed to the brim! All the other tables were taken along with all the seats at the bar. Usually in establishments where the owner is helping out it turns out to be a top notch place. Our waiter and our bartender were the owner's brothers, and we could clearly feel the passion behind their amazing service.To eat, we started with the patacones. As an avid meat eater, I loved that they added topped them with pork. To eat, I ordered the Chimichurri Truffle Fries. It sounds like a weird combination but it was actually very delicious. We also got the steak lollipops which were very well seasoned and tender.The grilled chicken tacos were a hit too. They have an amazing local beer selection, and offer margarita flights. After a long day of work there's nothing I wanted more than a margarita flight. The servings are small but definitely potent. I was also surprised to learn that it was my birthday that night. When I returned from the bathroom, the wait staff and the owner brought out warm churros and ice cream. They also belted out ""Happy Birthday"" in the best harmony I've ever heard. They were delicious and a great ending to our meal. The food was great and the hospitality was unforgettable. I can't wait to return!",The Alcove
49,"I had Brindle Room saved under my 'to try' list for a while, so I was excited to finally try out what they claimed to have -- 'the best burger in town'.For the price of $15+, you'd expect it to come with a side or a soda or something. Nope. You get slightly-larger-than-slider-sized burger with a slice of cheese and some caramelized onions. That's it.The burger was okay at most, but overly salty. But that wasn't all to it.The pork confit poutine was UNBEARABLY salty. Could not even finish half the dish because I could feel my blood pressure rising at the alarming intake of sodium. Verdict: Never again. Maybe if your taste buds are dull, then you can give it a try.","Super straightforward and simple. Get the burger. As a note: it is on the salty side, but it's a damn good regardless. But if you're sensitive to salt I could see not enjoying this style. Went here on a Wednesday night around 9 and sat down right away. Had the cauliflower mac and cheese dish as an appetizer and it was okay. I would stick with the burgers and not get distracted. Weird thing I learned: They have the letters PGB everywhere, on the walls, on the sauces they sell, ect. I asked what it stands for and the waitress mentioned that they are SUPPOSED to say it's the owners grandmother's initials...but it really stands for Prison Gang Bang. Woah. Very weird and slightly...unsettling?","The famous burger was extremely juicy but also somehow charred-tasting, and salty to the point of inedible. I only ate half.","What do you call a cow with no legs? GROUND BEEF. And wow, does the Brindle Room have a lot of good quality cows with no legs. I came here with my friend for our weekly post gym session meals. We made a reservation about 30 minutes before we were planning on arriving and it was very smooth. We got there exactly at 8 PM and was seated after about a 5 minute wait. It looked like they only had one server manning the entire restaurant which was 90% packed. (Hire more workers please!) Anyways, when we were seated we were given the menu and asked what we'll like to drink. My beer ordered a beer and I just stuck with water. Despite there only being one server, he was very attentive which I really appreciated.We decided to order the pork poutine and I got the Laotian burger and my friend got the Steakhouse burger. We received our poutine first and omg- it was soooo delicious. I can't remember the last time I had poutine this good! The cheese, the fries and the flavor of the pork was to die for! After inhaling our poutine, we received our burgers. The burgers do not come with fries so make sure to order it as a side if you're a fries lover. The Laotian burger was cooked perfectly and was extremely juicy. My friend really enjoyed his burger as well. I'll definitely be coming back here again!","We came here randomly when another brunch place told us there would be a two hour wait - this spot had no wait at all and the three of us were close to starving, so we were more than happy to sit at the bar for brunch here!First an honest admission - I had no idea how famous their burger here is when we walked in. I found out only when I saw the sign by the door and looked them up online (after being seated). That being said, it's probably one of the tastiest burgers I've had in the city. Juicy, correctly salted and bursting with flavor - you'd be hard pressed to find a better burger anywhere. But the major gripe I have here is how small it is. I've had sliders almost as big as this, and for the amount of deliciousness, we deserve to have more! As for the other dishes - the shakshuka was kind of subpar and the shrimp and grits were not all that great either.The place is really small - maybe about four tables of two or three each, and some counter seating at the bar. The bartender/server was friendly and attentive and took good care of us. Decent selection of beer here as well.I might return here for some beers, and maybe for that epic burger as well - if I'm really craving it. Otherwise this place has nothing so great so as to bring me back.","I have never been a burger lover growing up. If I had a craving, I would go to my local In-N-Out. Most recently, I have been having burger cravings. My friend was on the same page as me and he found this place near his apartment.Walking into the restaurant, you will notice a sign on the street stating ""Best Burger in NY"" Okay.. I had to find out for myself. I dined on a Saturday at noon and the restaurant was starting to fill up. They sat us in these weird 2 seaters since the walk walk is narrow. A little awks. Of course I ordered their famous burger. The only thing I didn't like is that you have to pay extra for fries. My friend ordered his burger without it and the burger looked so sad and lonely on the plate. Upon first bite of the burger, I was in utter foodgasm. The patty was so juicy and rich. If you have a low salt tolerance, beware because it's pretty salty, but I loved it. I savored each bite. The caramelized onions were a perfect match with the burger as well. The fries were also extremely good and I would highly recommend ordering this as a side. Their special hot sauce was extra spicy. I mixed it with my ketchup and it was bombbb.I have converted into the hamburger lyfe. The sign outside was true and this is currently my favorite burger in NY, for now.",Brindle Room

Eat at the cozy communal low-key tables in the back or take your lunch back to your hotel or have yourself a little outdoor picnic.Wine and beer. Sandwiches to die for. Get at least a couple of the croquettas. All sorts of little tapas delicacies. Big fan. Huge. If you don't go here, it'll be a big mistake. Huge.",Really fun place. They have a market at the entrance that leads to the registers. They have a great selection of Spanish grocery items and samples! Josh let me taste a couple extras before making my purchase (pricey). I ordered the Tradicional with Serrano ham and the chorizo a la sidre. The place has a great ambiance and I would return for a special treat but for the price I could not become a regular.Update: They messed up my order. Ugh. I asked for two meats on my sandwich and they charged me extra and didn't put it on...,"Was hoping that this place could somewhat replicate the food nirvana that is San Sebastian and Barcelona.  It's got all the trappings, including a variety of options, but the actual taste falls a little short.  It's not bad, but also not good enough to come back or push people to visit.  The chorizo was on the salty side, the blood sausage was a bit bland, and the boquerones savory flavor was overpowered by the vinegar.There was some strange quirk in the menu where they charged more for a glass of cava vs. a bottle, asked the cashier when ordering what was up and she just shrugged and said that's how it was...so we obviously went with the bottle.","The Perfect afternoon in SOHO- sipping Spanish Vermut and noshing on Spanish tortillas while enjoying great conversation with good friends! Despana is the canvas which makes this enjoyable experience possible! Despana is a Spanish specialty grocery store that carries a large variety of items including a deli with cheese and meats.   At the rear of the store is a small dining area with a few tables and standing bars for customers. Customers order at the food at the back counter and have a variety of items to choose from either from their menu or the beautiful display counter.   We stood at a bar/counter near the prep area and enjoyed watching the employees carefully craft the beautiful meat and cheese plates along with everything they were making. I was very impressed with the attention to detail and care put into plating the various items, which is a reflection on the staff. I also enjoyed the friendly service and never once did we feel pressure to rush and leave the store. During this visit we tried for the first time a delicious glass (or two) of Spanish vermut (vermouth)! We are now hooked on this beverage and feel like we have been missing out by not experiencing this before. We enjoyed it so much that we visited their wine/spirits store next door and purchased a several bottles to take home! The various Spanish tortillas we tried were also very good. Our only regret is that we live so far away that we can't stop by on a regular basis!Thank you, employees, of Despana for creating a great environment to enjoy the delicious food and drink that Spain has to offer! Keep up the great work!.","underwhelmed tiny space tiny tapas lots of money for cold under seasoned options shared codfish croquettes $3 a pop ? , tortilla with ham , potatoes and chorizo , fried anchovies best thing tortilla ok wine options might go back just for cheese or cold cut platter but many better tapas options in the city so why bother","I love this place! The food is fantastic. You can buy goodies and take home some jamon or quesos that are soo yummy! They sell various items from Spain. Its also great little place for a quick bite & some vino.  Seating is limited just have some patience.  The food is fantastic I have never not liked something i've tried there. The service is pretty good. The register girl was okay but the food server was super kind. If you like meats, cheeses, and wines its a must.",Despaña
51,"The food here is pretty good. I went here back in 2016 when it first became popular and I think it was better then. For some reason, the cheese smelled really bad when they brought it out to us, and we got the traditional cheese, not one of the other ones. The pesto flatbread with the mozzarella and cherry tomatoes was better than the raclette with potatoes and meat.I know cheese isn't the best smelling thing in the world, and I love cheese, but it smelled so bad that it made me not want to eat it. I also thought the cheese wasn't warm enough because it became hard and cold very quickly. The staff was also not the most friendly. We came in the afternoon, after the lunch rush, and it was basically empty. All the employees were just standing around and I had ask them for things like extra water, the check, taking the check back. With that little amount of people in the store, you'd think the service would be much better.","Me and my wife visited this restaurant on our trip to New York, we made a reservation on OpenTable and arrived 10 minutes early and was seated, 15 minutes later the head server/supervisor comes up and asks if we had a reservation I said yes and stated the reservation name, then 5 minutes later she came back and asked for the name again .... considering we were on time and for our reservation I got a feeling that they wanted to make room for others despite there being a few empty tables in the restaurant, the way it was handled was poor.With that being said the food was good and waiter who served us was nice but the person who ran the bookings was a bit abrupt in her questioning which affected our overall experience visiting Raclette.","It was ok for a ""check off your list"" place.  The pouring of the melted cheese over your veggies and potatoes was cool.  The underlying food aside from the melted cheese experience was overall just ok.  The menu choices were somewhat limited to those items that go well with the cheese choices.  I left the place feeling kind of gross after all the cheese.  But it was an int","This is really a great spot for cheese lovers. I've been here on multiple occasions and have enjoyed myself every time. (Please note that this establishment, like many other cheese places does smell like cheese, you will get use to it after 5 minutes.) The experience here is almost theatrical and I love that aspect. It sets this dining experience apart from the rest. The service here has always been spectacular. I've been well cared for every time I've dined here. They've changed the burger meat, and now the burger is very good.  I recommend getting the burger with the truffle cheese if it is available. Also, expect to take home half. All of the food here is very filling and it is easy to over- eat when you are shoveling delicious cheese in your mouth.I've also had the savoyarde. It pairs well with the variety of cheeses they offer. If you are not wanting to have the cheese- scrapping experience I can also fully recommend the mac and cheese and the fig tartine.  I've been able to try a few different wines here, I find the staff to be very helpful with deciding which drink to pair with my meal. This is a great date night spot. Definitely don't skip on this. 4.8/5","ILoveCheeseThat's really the one main thing you need to know about me when it comes to food. If you also have cheese, you should do yourself a favor and visit. I'm so picky about Mac & Cheese that I'll rarely order it when out. Does anyone like that neon sludge like you had in grade school that's mostly wax? No. So get this one instead. So much delicious cheese flavor. It reminds me of homemade. My dad had the burger where they being the cheese wheel out and pour it over the burger. He said it was one of the top three burgers of his life. I had the gig tasting and I loved the balance of salt and sweet and nutty. It was a great way to start the meal. I definitely want to go back and order one of the traditional raclette dishes.","Not too sure what the hype was about, seriously.  I love a variety of cheeses and have been wanting to try this place out for quite some time (when they were located in the much smaller restaurant).  Anyhow, I was in the area one Saturday afternoon and they had availability.  The meal worked perfectly for my low-carb diet - dairy fat, veggie, and beef.Ordered the Raclette Burger; subbed the fries for asparagus.  I moved the bun to the side, and went in on the patty, asparagus, and other veggies that came with the burger.  The entire plate was too salty for me, and I generally don't mind salt.  If you're going for the visual stimulation of having cheese all over your food, then you're good to go.  However, the taste of everything wasn't delicious.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  Also, the atmosphere of the place kind of turned me off and customer service was meh.  So my general experience wasn't pleasant.  Or maybe my mood was off because of my diet... don't know.  But with this diet, it doesn't take a lot to please my palette - I was just looking to eat a decent plate of fat, meat, and veg.  Raclette didn't do it for me and I don't plan on returning.",Raclette
52,Do not come here if you aren't planning on ordering from their biscuit menu. We decided to come here for my boyfriends birthday brunch and as you can see the portions are so so sad. Drinks were not good and the avocado was hard/not edible. I literally got 4 fries and my burger was dry and falling apart. My boyfriend ate his food in 5 minutes and we were so hungry still after even though we paid 50$ for 2 drinks and our meals. xOverall I would never come back here due to slow service and portion to price to food quality ratio.,Start with a White Wolf tea - vanilla & minty goodness.Duroc bacon & chicken sausage biscuits with fresh avocado are money - this place is the real deal.,"POST is a solid brunch spot if you're in Alphabet City! It's housed in a tiny space, so definitely get there earlier for brunch (after 11:30 am, there was a wait for seating). I loved the minimalist but homey cozy design and the great service (shout out to Mike!). The food was not the best I've ever had, but quite tasty nonetheless - a 4 might be a bit stingy; I would give this place a 4.5. As a Filipina, I had to try the adobo pork biscuit. So, maybe it wasn't adobo like my people make it, but the mix of pulled pork, fluffy (if a little too greasy) biscuits, and well-dressed greens was compelling enough to finish the meal. Would stop by again if I were in the area!","I had one of the best brunches here, and I've had a lot of brunches in my life.Food: My friend and I shared the pancake sandwich and the biscuit with sausage gravy. I don't know what to say other than they know what they're doing. The biscuit was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The gravy, poured over haphazardly for a rather rustic plating, was creamy and savory. And even though I was there for the biscuit, I was blown away by the pancake sandwich. While it looks quite simple, the flavors are perfectly balanced with each bite. Ambience: Very clean and minimal setting. My favorite piece of decor was the crochet pendant light. Physically, the restaurant is small, as in most likely you'll be sat at the bar, which can be pretty tight. I was trying not to bump elbows with my neighbor. Tldr: very cute, very delicious, but tiny brunch place in alphabet city!","I say it all the time... I want to LOVE and support local business that I know are up against chains and rising rents. I can't get behind this place at least for dinner.I was starving and craving something indulgent so we got the pulled pork nachos. They were actually delicious.Then we waited 40 minutes (we were one of two tables)... waiting... waiting... and finally our food came out. I try not to eat meat when I don't have to so I was happy to see the beyond meat burger on the menu. Had to get it! Then it came. The only way I could describe it is was a crappy burger you get at a beach bbq as a kid. ZERO sauce. Not even ketchup. The bun was amazing but it's brought in from Balthazar... The burger patty though... fridge cold. It barely even had cook marks on a the outside. They must have thrown it on for 30 seconds on each side on low. It came with 4 anemic cold potato wedges... where I'd almost rather be charged for fries (in addition to the tiny, $17 burger). We also ordered the snap peas which I didn't realize when we ordered them, that they were just tossed for a second in olive oil and barely cooked, with no seasoning (not even salt). Drinks were good though.I've heard amazing things about their breakfast, and it's a cute bar, but then just be a bar and don't have a mediocre dinner that cheapens your place. My advice to management would be, pick a lane. If you want to be high-end, be high-end, but the food just seemed like they wanted it to be pretentious, but couldn't really meet that based on their cooking skills. The menu seems casual, but the prices and attempt at high-end don't meet that. I've seen tons of restaurants in my decade in the neighborhood come and go for catering to the fickle, showy/bougie crowd and not catering to the still high-end, but more laid back locals (look at Kinsley up the street - which closed). Very disappointing considering I've loved every experience at the bar.","This place specializes in all kinds of biscuits, there are different options to choose from, all of them looks mouthwatering. I had the biscuit with bacon and egg, the biscuit was baked perfectly golden, crusty on top and still soft inside, there's a green salad that goes with it. Although the biscuit looks small, it's actually packed with the ingredients and I left feeling quite full, a lot of people had left over food since the portion is large. The price is affordable, with coffee less than $3 and the biscuits around $12-$14. The restaurant looks very retro and romantic, there are plants everywhere, if you get lucky you might get a spot to sit outdoors to enjoy the weather. Our server was nice, she's an energetic woman who made our dining experience very enjoyable.",POST
53,The storefront is not so obvious. You'll have to take the elevator to the second floor. This place is not AYCE. This is a premium treat yourself Korean BBQ spot. It is on the pricier side but you get what you pay for. We got pork jowl and the marinated beef platter. It totaled around $160. Worth every penny!,"Two important tips: NO OUTSIDE DRINK! Forget about bringing in your bubble tea from next door. We were forced to throw away our bubble tea at the door. :( Also, THE WHOLE PARTY NEED TO BE PRESENT TO BE SEATED. So don't expect your Yelp waitlist spot to get you a table right away if you are the first person there.We spent $50/person without ordering any drinks and got plenty of food. Their MEAT is definitely top quality. That's probably what makes this place the most popular Korean bbq place on this street. The pork belly is probably the best I've ever had. Kalbi was also very good and positively fatty. :) Portion is decent but not huge. The seafood scallion pancake was a bit disappointing. You don't see seafood or scallion in that pathetic pancake. It's literally a pile of flour. :( I'd definitely put my money on their meat dishes instead next time.",A bit on the pricier end for what i'd consider average kbbq. However the service here took it to another level.Thank you for the experience!,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! Best KBBQ in nyc. I had a craving when visiting with friends and jongeo did not disappoint. There is always a wait, but you can put your name on the waitlist via yelp to help cut down in the time spent crammed in the entryway by the elevator.Inside, it's styled to look like the streets of Korea. The booth we sat is was spacious (a rarity for NYC!) and had a fume hood to cut down on cooking smoke- honestly, this was the only time I've been to a KBBQ place where my hair and clothes didn't reek of smoke after. We had a large meat platter, but between the three of us ordered pork jowl (my fave) and more brisket. They don't have rice paper, which always bums me out, but the kimchi was great and the service fast and excellent. Overall, New York prices but good quality meat and totally worth it. If you're looking for bomb KBBQ and aren't worried about paying a little more, can't recommend enough!","Came here on a Thursday night around 6pm. We ordered the Large Beef Combination platter because the boyfriend wanted both marinated and un-marinated meat. Our server warned us that the platter serves three people. Challenge accepted. Food Quality: 4/5Have been here maybe five times, and each time the meat quality never disappoints. It is consistently very tender and fresh. This was our first time getting marinated beef here though, and I have to say I don't know if I will be ordering marinated meat in the future: it was honestly nothing special. We thought there were supposed to be two cuts of marinated meat, but it turns out they just combine them and cook them at the same time: honestly we couldn't tell the difference between the kalbi and the salchi cut. They were both so-so, and a lot less meat than we expected. The un-marinated meat was spot-on, though. The brisket was especially good. We also got the lychee soju cocktail which is pretty sweet but really, really good. Service: 4.8/5Even though it tends to get really busy here, the waitstaff is always really attentive: at one point there were three different waitstaff who came over to cook one cut of meat. They also readily replace the side dishes even without you having to ask. tl;dr: overall good experience but probably wouldn't order marinated meat next time, & service is on-point.","WAITIt usually gets pretty busy here on the weekends, so definitely try to get a table early, especially if you're with a big party.AMBIANCETraditional KBBQ restaurant, nothing crazy here. It's a huge space to accommodate for large parties. The servers cook the meat for you, which should be expected at this price point. It's kind of hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for, as it is tucked away on the second floor of a building. FOODWe went with the large beef and pork sets for a group of 6. The cuts were pretty standard. The beef really stood out more than the pork for me. High quality meat, as to be expected, and solid panchan choices. Big fan of serving lettuce over salad. I love making wraps at KBBQ. OVERALLIt's usually a good time when you get KBBQ with friends. It's just meat and conversation over a grill. For this price point though, I'd probably walk across the street for Kanghodong Baekjong (I've never had Kanghodong in ktown Manhattan, but I assume it'd be similar to what they do in socal)",Jongro BBQ
54,"I have never been more disappointed in a restaurant. NEVER. And I went into 1803 with low expectations.After much deliberation over what to order, I narrowed my options down to a salad or a burger. I ultimately opted for the former, since I ate a voluptuous chunk of meat for lunch several hours prior. The salad and the burger were the same price--$14--which seemed somewhat reasonable relative to their other items (e.g. the jambalaya, which is rice with several morsels of chicken and sausage and three disappointing shrimp for a whopping $28, although its taste is fine). In a wave of incompetence, I thought this chopped salad would be comparable in size to a burger, although perhaps slightly less filling given the lack of protein.I couldn't have been more wrong.The lame excuse for a salad arrived and contained the following:-1 medium tomato-1/4 cucumber-1/8 small eggplant-1/16 onion-1 tbsp feta-the tiniest suckle of olive oil-feather's weight of sproutsFor $14.This place is charging the same price for this ""salad"" as they charge for a large plate with a hamburger and fries. I pointed this out to the waiter, who, after much hesitation, offered me consolation bread. BREAD.Needless to say, I won't be at 1803 again.The managers of this place should be ashamed of themselves. I've been trying to figure out how they sleep at night. Feel free to reach out to me if you think you have an answer!EDIT: After receiving several passionate pieces of feedback from my fellow Yelpers, I have decided to provide a bit more information. I would first like to say that I fully support the above review. I would like to add a closer breakdown of where the stars come from.Five (5) stars are attributed to the ambience. The restaurant is very pleasant with regards to its ambience.Two (2) stars are attributed to the taste of the food. Everything I tried was at least decent. Even my ""salad"" tasted good--the morsels of vegetables and the cheese were fresh.Negative five (-5) stars are attributed to the value of my meal.Negative one (-1) stars are attributed to the unwillingness or inability of the staff to effectively remediate my dissatisfaction.",I dont know. 25 min wait for a pulled pork burger and the 1803 burger not really worth it for the price. Also we ask the waitress and the waiter whats going on and they just ignore us the first time and then come back saying another couple of minutes? Come on man its Manhattan and lunch time. Way to correct us saying its been 25 min when its been 30 min. I guess you are proud of the 25 min wait for 2 damn burgers.,,"Long time coming for this review. 1803 delivered the New Orleans cuisine! Food: 5 stars. I ordered the chargrilled oysters with gumbo as my entree. The chargrilled oysters were tasty - some of the best chargrilled oysters I've ever had. The gumbo was nothing short of amazing and flavorful. Filled with the right amount of shrimp, fish, and mussels - the gumbo was spot on.Service: 5 stars. I dined at 1803 for lunch, and the restaurant was fairly busy. I was attended to quickly, and there wasn't much of wait from when I ordered my food to when it arrived.All-in-all, I am envious that New Yorkers have this gem! I'm a huge fan of Creole cuisine, and would love to see 1803 in the DC area.","Came for happy hour and had a great time! The service is A+++!

Throughout out our entire meal, we were well taken care of and checked on The happy menu was extensive - lots of food options (runs till 7). And drinks were $3 off the menu.- seafood hush puppy: 4 pieces, crispy, and big. But not too much seafood in it, mostly dough. The green sauce was good- shrimp with peppers: 6 pieces, Very good. Great seasoning   - would order again. Came with a spicy mayo type sauce- mini burger - great value. very tasty, but fries too salty - mini pho boy - great value/size. was ok, and fries too salty Noticed a lot of people ordering wings. Maybe will come back and try them!","Came here on a Monday evening with a 6:45 res. We arrived a bit late and were accommodated right away at 6:55. Our server was so kind, he came around right away and let us know he really didn't want us to miss the happy hour cut off and to let him know if we wanted a drink. Why, don't mind if we do!The cocktails were tasty with a punch, and $3 off before 7pm. Hard to argue with that.As for the food, the hush puppies had great flavor and crispness. My fiancé thoroughly enjoyed every bite of his jambalaya. My Niçoise salad with medium rare tuna was fresh, however the tuna seemed a bit overcooked and even a bit hard. Maybe I came on an off day since it was a monday? Overall the service was great, drinks wonderful, ambiance nice for after work drinks or maybe a casual date. One star off due to the tuna that was a bit off. Would try again if in the area!",1803

They don't have table water, you have to purchase bottled water or choose something else from their drink selection. When our orders came we were excited... till we tasted it. It was probably one of the saltiest things I have ever eaten in my life. If I'm ever in the Flushing area again I'd probably go somewhere else...","Definitely get the dumplings. Both times I've gone, I've gotten 2 orders of fried pork dumplings and they always hit the spot. Also the hand pulled minced pork noodles are bomb.","SKIP THE KNIFE CUT NOODLES and go straight for the dumplings. My lamb noodle soup with knife cut noodles was so bland. The soup barely had any taste to it and the texture of the noodles were inconsistent. The outer part of the noodles were flimsy, and the middle was more thick and possibly undercooked. Hot chili oil couldn't even save my soup. But try their fried dumplings and don't forget to use their garlic soy sauce with chili oil!","Super cheap, fast, and delicious. We got 2 orders of pot stickers, 1 stir fried dish and 1 noodle soups and it came out to be less than $30. Make sure to ask for knife cut noodles which are thinner but wider than typical lo mein noodles.Definitely think I found my new noodle place in Chinatown!","One of my favorite places to go for noodle soup in Chinatown. The beef noodle soup and pork bone noodle soup are my faves, and I usually like to get it with hand pulled noodles. Both the boiled and fried pork dumplings are also great and the price can't be beat ($4 for 8). I've gotten takeout from here and the food is usually still delicious even after a 45 minute commute home. FYI they accept credit cards but there is a 4.5% fee.","Cheap, delicious Chinese food for a quick bite to eat or on the go! We ordered the beef stir fried hand pulled noodles, boiled dumplings, and fried dumplings. Everything came out within 10-15 minutes and was fantastic. The hand pulled noodles were perfectly chewy and flavorful. The dumplings were hot and had a nice crispy outer skin.

Be prepared for a huge appetite, all of what they serve is nearly family-style sized portions! Loved everything they have - Fried chicken, biscuits, their salad (didn't hold back the cranberries and other toppings in it) - But found that their pies weren't that fresh.

We gave her our orders and the food was out within 10-15 mins. I ordered the chicken and waffles and it was good. The initial bites were delicious but as I progressed through the food, the flavor became more and more tiring and I got full after eating half of my plate. That is probably a personal problem because my friend ordered the same thing and crushed it.Great service, great food, and great vibes. Check them out!","We took the family to an evening in Williamsburg and I wanted to find a place to go that everyone would like. Pies-n-Thighs caught my eye because they had good reviews and their menu included something that would appeal to everyone in my party. I wish I would have done the waitlist yelp thing because when we got there it was about 45 minutes for a seat. No biggie, we weren't starving and that gave us more time to explore. But if we were any hungrier it might have been a problem.They seated us in the bigger section in the back by the window and our server was taking care of us within minutes. My daughter got the lemonade which she though was too sour but I though it was good. We ordered the pulled pork, chicken and waffles, the hamburger and catfish basket. The food took an average amount of time to come out, and looked delicious. They happily accepted my request for no bun with my pulled pork, so I got a healthy portion of pork in a cup. It was so good and had so much flavor, my mouth is watering just thinking about the vinegar based bbq sauce. The greens were obviously fresh and not canned, and my husband and I fought over the last little bit of them. Everyone else really enjoyed their food, and they let my mom special order thighs for her chicken and waffles. There were hardly any leftovers. Oh, and we highly recommend the fried green tomatoes appetizer. The remoulade is super good and has a little kick. I would definitely go back to Pies-n-Thighs, and I would use the waitlist feature to secure a place in line.","If we had remembered to use the wait list, we could've been seated much earlier. But since there were benches outside Pies n Thighs, we were fine waiting over an hour. We were starving!  We scarfed down the Butter Pecan donut which was the best donut i have ever had. The frosting was creamy and soooo yummy. And the fried chicken at Pies n Thighs is perfection. Just a crispy fried chicken piece. No special spices. Crunchy. Juicy. Just perfect. Drumsticks and Thighs. Two of my favorite parts. I had mine with the waffles. I thought the waffles were a little dense. I prefer a thinner waffle.

57,"Mominette was a last minute brunch pick in Brooklyn after we realized we weren't really ready for Bagatelle's ""enhanced"" presentation. If we're ranking strictly on food, 4 stars largely because although the food was a bit lacking in seasoning/flavor, it was certainly prepared well. The steak and eggs were decent; got the eggs poached and they came, well, poached (most places end up with this bizarre kinda-hard-boiled thing), and the steak itself was tender if not exactly the most exciting to my tongue. And although bacon is bacon, this bacon rocked... don't know why; it just did.Minus one for charged refills per short glass. No cans or bottles delivered to the table, so we had no idea it was canned/bottled until after I questioned the check for having four diet cokes on it for one person (me). For all I know, one can yielded two glasses delivered to the table (seemed that way. Fresh ice each refill in an 8oz glass, standard cans are 12oz).Minus one for service defects more generally. Largely just tone/approach with a larger party, but I suppose I might be embittered by the mishandling of drinks above.Two stars. Probably not coming back, but I'll check in on reviews the next time I'm in Brooklyn and see if it's worth a repeat trip for me.",This is a cute little place in Brooklyn.

I started off with a cheese tasting plate that wasn't anything extraordinary. The presentation was beautiful with fruits and nuts accompanying the cheese, but the cheeses were all pretty standard things that I could have found in my Trader Joe's. I was expecting more spectacular French cheeses basically. I had a few glasses of one of their roses that was really tasty and refreshing especially on a summer night. For dinner I got the Coq au vin blanco (chicken with pasta and veggies) and it was really yummy. The chicken was literally falling off the bone. The veggies were well cooked and the pasta didn't really have sauce, but seemed to be enveloped in the chicken broth, so it wasn't super savory. As this was my first time having French food, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was satisfied with my meal overall and the restaurant was super cute. The meals are a little pricey, so I would recommend this place for a special occasion.","So, after my large party experience here, I am like meh about this place.My dear friend hosted her bridal shower here and it was just poorly organized.We had reserved the patio for 20 people. However the party (like half) arrived early and some of us were NOT permitted inside due to ""slowing down service"" by standing In the bar area while our tables were ready. We had to wait outside in the heat for nearly 20 to 30 minutes. There was also another large party occupying the back patio. If we knew we had to wait outside, we would have notified our entire party to arrive later. We were not allowed to be in the area, like the backyard until it was the exact time of the reservation. Once we sat down, we had to pick up the tables ourselves to rearrange the party and seating the way we wanted to. Not only that, but the staff took forever to take orders, even with water! I was just confused to why everything was moving so slow? 20 people is not tooo bad. I have worked in the restaurant industry so having 3 staff to suppose 20 ladies is not bad but everything like beverages came out late. Slow to replenish water jugs and even mixing up food orders. Just seem a little sloppy for a large party in my opinion. Food was good, but not anything great. Like your typical brunch spot. Anyway. That's that.","Came across this Parisienne like bistro in Bushwick.  Why was I in Bushwick, you ask?  Good question.  Let's just say country representatives and Ministers of Defense like 5-star Manhattan eateries.  Those who buy and sell at the edges and how work the vig, so to speak, they like low-level, out of the way, 5-star places in Brooklyn.  Let's just say Sheepshead Bay, is not just all about the Russians.Anyway, the bartender is a neurologic pshyciatrist by day; a hard mixing Old-Fashioned bartender at night.  The appetizer I had (Avocado Gravlux) was creative, tasty and amazing, let alone super healthy, and the pesto pasta for my vegan friend, just delectable.This is going to be a go-to place to go....",Mominette
58,Just came back from Vacation in Portugal and had extreme depression and was craving a pasteis de Nata. When I was in Portugal I would have like 2 to 3 a day (it's fine I did a lot of walking don't judge me). First order of business was to find a place near my job to get my fix. This place was about walking distance. I ordered an order of pasteis and an espresso on seamless . The pasteis is about 10$ and comes in 3. Unfortunately when I arrived to pick up they told me they don't do espresso to go...so I had to sit at the bar and chug my espresso then walk back to my office to eat my treats and that wasn't really the vibe I was going for. The pasteis were pretty good...obviously not the same and I get it but I got it out of my system.,"The entrees and drinks were decent but I wasn't a fan of the appetizers we ordered. Also, even though our main server was incredibly nice and helpful, there was one person on the waitstaff that made our table very uncomfortable.For appetizers, we ordered the shrimp in garlic / olive oil as well as the pasteis (empanadas). The shrimp lacked flavor and was disappointing to me. I would also prefer to get empanadas elsewhere.For our entrees, we shared the Churrasco Impanema (NY strip topped with cheese, crabmeat and shrimp) and the Paelha. I enjoyed the toppings on the steak and a decent amount of seafood came with the Paelha.Unfortunately, we also had a waitstaff who was extremely pushy and at times rude with our table. I have no complaints with our main server, but the person coming around to refill our waters and take away plates made us uncomfortable. His tone was a bit condescending towards us and at one point he was shaking my to-go package in my face.",Allow me to start with I had a reservation and was not greeted at the door. Second after walking in I walked to waiter with my client and was able to have a seat. It was loud! So loud I could not even talk or hear my client. The food was second not delicious I ordered empanadas dish and shrimp dish ( the shrimp was good) as for the empanadas is was COLD. Wine was fair now for the main course-dishes I order a chicken breast- with banana it was the worst dish I have ever had. My client had salmon she couldn't even finish it. The white and bean we didn't touch it as it look like it was reheated and given to us from another table. Not let's talk about the ambience we were only two and they sat us to a loud group of people. Honestly I am disappointed of this restaurant. Happy eating folks!,"I've eaten at Ipanema in Little Brazil the last two times my wife and I attended a Broadway show and both times it was excellent in both service and food. Of our two visits below is what I'd highly recommend you try...Drinks: CaipirinhasAppetizer: PasteisEntree: Fraldinha, and/or Camarao Empanado","First time trying Portuguese and finding an authentic Brazilian/Portuguese restaurant that offers a great ambiance that's a little more upscale than the typical is sometimes hard to find even in New York. My picanha was amazing, cooked perfectly the sauce was perfect and tasted home made. The Caipirinha and Sangria a plus!  For dessert my friend and I shared and of course we had to try the Brazilian flan and Pasteis de Nata. One specialty of each country: Brazil and Portugal. And both were flavorful and well served and the flan was pretty big enough for two.The staff is all very nice and welcoming. Love this place!","*WOULD RECOMMEND*We visited Ipanema during 4th of July weekend before our broadway show and it was a good choice. The restaurant is two stories with a nice interior.The waiters were all very friendly and taught us how to pronounce some of the dishes. The menu was relatively small but all the food looked really good. I've never had Brazilian/Portuguese food (besides steak) but it all looks quite authentic to me. Their hot sauce is TO DIE FOR! It is homemade with fresh chilies, vinegar, and a lot of other ingredients I cannot pronounce. It started off a bit sweet and sour, followed by a kick of spice.I love sour so this hot sauce is right up my alley. The waiter even packed me a container of the hot sauce to take home. Service 10/10! *DINNER*Pao de queijo - cheese bread. I thought it was going to be gooey, but it was actually was fluffy. I think they mixed the cheese into the dough. It was quite light and tasted very good with the hot sauce.Paelha - Brazilian/Portuguese version of paella. It had fresh clams, mussles, shrimp, chicken, sausage, and scallops, with a side of black bean sauce. All the seafood was fresh, especially the scallops (it was so tender). The rice itself didn't have as much depth in flavor as I'd hope. My friends all said they had better.Feijoada completa - national Brazilian dish. Basically black bean stew with a variety of meat and different sides (greens, breadcrumbs, and orange). The meat was alright, but the really dark looking one (I'm not sure which one that was) was really good. The combination of the stew with the sides was not bad. However, I do think there was a bit too much black bean to my liking. Flan - quite dense but pretty good*VERDICT*I would go back again and try their other food. This was just an introduction to Brazilian/Portuguese food for me outside of just steak.",Ipanema Restaurant
59,"I have to say I was not too impressed with this place. The food was a bit on the bland side however 2 things really saved the night. The pork belly was the savior of the night but be forewarned don't let the dish get cold. Once it turns cold it's pretty gross. The other was the fresh naan bread. Seafood noodle was very bland and it did not have much flavor which I was very disappointed withThe chicken rice was undercooked. I personally feel that should automatically give this place zero stars, it's an Asian restaurant that could not properly cook its rice. Hunan Chicken was ok but they were really cheap with the soy sauce.Service was ok, they were not busy but they were confused at who was suppose to be helping us.   I probably wouldn't recommend going to the place and I know I won't be returning anytime soon.","We ordered a lot, Really tasty and authentic, except the cash only part was quite disappointing, would definitely come back again!","I paid a second visit but this time the food quality wasn't as impressive...Hainan chicken tastes worse than before, not sure whether it's because it's not as novel as its first taste.Curry vegetables are just plain unexciting.Sizzling beef is what disappointed me the most. Can't believe how the sizzling beef can be made with such a standard. It tastes like marinated paper...","This place is solid.  Sometimes it's a miss, but for the most part it's pretty good.  Easy going efficient service.  Long lines and cash only.","what a find! nyonya serves a variety of cantonese, singaporean and malaysian dishes at a very affordable price. i highly recommend on of their white-looking 'pearl noodle' soup dish. a lighter flavor, spring onion, spring of parsley and egg drop soup sort of flavor. it has a less viscous consistency. they serve complimentary barley tea at nyonya, which helped me digest my heavier dish. i ordered the hong kong noodle soup. it wasn't really my go-to, but the flavor of shallot soup base was decent. the noodle was overcooked, so it sort of fell apart and melted when i took a bite (not even a slurp). that is why i give them a 4 and not 5-star. i think the pearl noodle was a bit overcooked as well. lots of appealing appetizers and entrees we did not have the stomach to try. otherwise, easy place to unwind and order a delicious eastern asian dish. the location sits between little italy and china town. you can walk off dinner or lunch before you take the subway back.","we struggled for an hr to decide if we should go to a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown vs Malaysian restaurant. We landed-up going to Nyonya and it was worth it. the reviews speaks for itself ...prompt service, reasonable cost, portions are generous and food is delicious! we tried: Hainanese Chicken- can be an acquired taste but worth trying for sauce Nasi Lemak- delicious curry. Absolute must! Ginger Duck- different but not bad (can't decide if i like or not)Curry Mee with Young Tau Foo- delicious.",Nyonya
60,"This is a terrible place!I ordered a dry pot in total around $55. Like beef tone beef meat, fish tofu. Squid, crab stick and tofu skin etc.. I called the restaurant they said it's regular size. I don't know what's wrong with the order never should go to this place!!","I walked here last night from south street seaport to try it out. I get there, the place was nearly empty. I ask the hostess for a seat and she tells me all of the seats are reserved and there were no open spots all night. I ended up leaving and going to another nearby hot pot place. What a joke.","A very high-end hot pot place. I have never had wagyu beef inside of hot pot and it tasted very good. There was also table side grill but we didn't order that. Instead, we had Pecking duck, which reminded me the one that I had in Beijing. My only complaint was the lamb was very chewy.","I went to zhen wei fang to try out their dry pot, and it exceeded expectations! I had the seafood combo while my friend had the vegetable combo. They both were extremely flavorful and came with a side of rice each. They also asked us what level of spice we would like, and the flavor and quality of the spice was amazing! Ingredients were fresh and authentic, and I can't wait to try more dishes here! - Navya J@nyconthetable","I went here tonight, the food was decent. It was a little on the pricier side, I got ribeye hotpot, chicken breast, some mixed veggies,baby cuttlefish and pork bone broth along with a side order if beef skewers. It came out to about $57. The food tasted pretty fresh, I think my only qualm would be their lack of a sauce bar. They give you a choice of 6 little powders/2 sauces. I also found the broth itself to be a bit on the bland side.The beef skewers were good, nice and juicy.Will i go here again? Probably. I will try a different broth though and mostly when I want to splurge.","The restaurant was very tidy and clean. We ordered lamb skewers, shrimp, crab, Peking duck, hot pot, Kobe beef, fish and fish cakes etc. The staff was very attentive and came to refill our hot pot bowls when needed. There is also karaoke station in the room for us to sing. Good choices of drinks both fruit and alcohol. They give us small tic tacs in the need to refresh our breath.",Zhen Wei Fang
61,"I don't see what the hype is about this place. Came here expecting to get wowes, but instead was shocked by the price of the food. I guess, it's midtown prices so what can I expect??We ordered the shredded tripe in chili oil, dan dan noodles, fish filet with tofu, eggplant in garlic sauce, and lotus seed puree. The only dishes that I enjoyed was the dan dan noodles and fish filet with tofu. The least liked dish was the eggplant one. I couldn't even finish it and took it home to be even more displeased. The lotus seed puree sounded good, but it was really bland. I wasn't impressed at all. The only thing that impressed me was the service. So many waiters on call.","I was looking forward to this restaurant, bc c'mon...who doesn't love Chinese food?! Don't expect anything fancy other than it being sort of clean and surprisingly a good amount of seating. We ordered a bunch of things from the menu and most were pretty good.Spicy wontons - my least favorite. Was more greasy and didn't seem like it was fully heated throughout the whole wonton.Steamed whole fish - was light but flavorful. Watch those bones.Kung Fu Shrimp - very nice size shrimp. Pain to take shell off so if you're planning to do that, I would pass. Dan Dan noodles - tasty.Kung Pao Chicken - Very tasty, which the chicken was cut larger.I think I would go back. Service was just okay - there are many servers walking around but you basically need to flag them down if you need something. Scotch prices (Oban 14) was actually pretty cheap here, which I liked.","we ordered three dishes - the eggplant in Szechuan sauce, the spicy cumin lamb and the shredded duck in garlic. We LOVED the spicy cumin lamb and eggplant but the duck was pretty disappointing. It literally was 98% bell pepper and tiny pieces of duck. The duck tasted good but we wished the ratio hadn't been so ridiculous.","I have to qualify my review by saying I haven't had this kind of authentic Chinese food before. All dishes except for the stir fried veg were new to me. I'm rating the food on how it tasted to me plain and simple. Service was very good. Really fast and efficient. Food was solid but not as good as expected with them having a Michelin star and all. We ordered:Dan-dan noodles: Sauce has an odd creamy texture and is generally under seasoned. The minced pork is nice and salty. More of it would help the dish quite a bit. Noodles seemed too soft/overcooked but maybe that's how it's supposed to be. 5.8/10Braised Pork: Pork has nice tender texture. Flavor is basically salty with some sour from the pickled veg underneath. Solid dish and maybe great for someone who has had it elsewhere. To me it was just solid. 7.6/10Chungking Chicken: Described as ""extremely spicy"" by the waiter. It was not hot spicy but more numbing spicy. I had to eat it sparingly as the numbing sensation is strong. Another reviewer mentioned it tasted like fruit loops to him. Totally agree. Not sure what spice it is. Apart from that the chicken is crispy and well seasoned. It tastes really good for the first few seconds until the excess spices and numbing pepper kick in. If simplified this would be a great dish. 7.0/10Stir Fried Chinese Broccoli: I have had this before. I've had better, but also worse. Pretty well seasoned and generally a safe dish. 7.2/10I went into this restaurant hungry which if anything should have inflated the score. Maybe expectations were too high because of the Michelin star. Either way it is solid food that is worth a try but considering price and overall experience I probably wouldn't go back. If I did I would try some safer items like dumplings and kung pao chicken. I'd like to give a 3.5 star rating if I could. But maybe I'm just a fat American with a low tier pallet so I can't see the greatness of this food.","I've been told this supposed to be the best Chinese food in Manhattan. Great expectation became great disappointment. This dark packed small restaurant wasn't what the glory of the Michelin Star once shine upon. The food: in comparison to most Americanized Chinese restaurants, their food flavor was acceptable. I wouldn't say this is real SiChuan style, because it's far from authentic, it's just water downed version of SiChuan flavor. The Mung bean noodles was way too soft, hard to pickup with chopsticks, way too sweet for my taste, failed. The Tea-smoked duck was just ok, nothing like the Real thing from the motherland, just average smoke flavor, no crispy skin, disappointing. The eggplant in garlic sauce was pretty good, pretty standard, acceptable. Wonton soup was laughable, no flavor no thing, just a plain meat ball rush into the wonton wrap. The brown rice was the Epic Fail of all: way too hard, some part wasn't evenly cooked. What kind of Michelin Star restaurant DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE BRIWN RICE?!Service: waiter came in about 10 mins after we were seated, some food came in about 15 mins, the rest came within half hour. Not in peak lunch hour. Overall: Not in good value. The food taste without souls and effects. If it's a no-name Mom & Pa place, I would say it was acceptable. But since it's in Manhattan, it's NYC, this kind of food really doesn't meet the standard food culture here. Don't get fooled by the pictures and past reviews. This place doesn't feel like it has the integrity to hold any Michelin Star (Seriously wonder how did they get there at the first place). At least they need to take the job more seriously.",Very nice place. Always crowd and it's very difficult to get a table if you don't wait 45 minutes at least. I been here several times and the food is very good.The staff is friendly. The place is small but cuteThe dishes are not super big but honestly very delicious. I recommend this place,Café China
62,"Great streak grilled to perfection. Ordered New York strip steak, it was . It was 14 oz, but I can finish it all! The sauce is not a highlight actually, it didn't add much more flavor to the steak  as I think.","I came to this spot and really wanted to take out my cousin to eat some A5 Wagyu+Uni. Unfortunately, the day I went in they were out of Uni-how sad is that!!! I went for lunch in the daytime and they already ran out of Uni?! SO EARLY. We got the Wagyu sandwich and was good-but i'm not a good ""meat"" judge. Was really looking forward to their other sandwich","Though we've lived in the neighborhood for awhile, we hadn't made it to Salt and Charcoal yet. We decided to go when we met a couple at a restaurant in LA who said this place was their favorite restaurant in all of NYC. To be honest, this place is decent, but maybe not quite worth the price compared to some of the other Japanese style steakhouses in the city. The sushi was actually the star of the meal, with the steak tartare as a close second (though not sure the portion was worth the steep $34 price tag). Unfortunately, the NY strip was the disappointing part of the meal. We asked for it medium rare, but it came far closer to medium well.","Salt and Charcoal is a delicious Japanese steakhouse.  The place itself is small and has an open wall where some diners can see the chefs and cooks in action.  There is also some outdoor sidewalk seating.  Service was polite but not always efficient, and it took a very long time for our food to be served, because our waiter didn't put our main order in.  Fortunately after my wife inquired our food was out in 15-20 minutes.  The food itself was delicious.  The gem salad was unique and worthwhile, and our Wagyu steak was tender and flavorful.  Recommended!","Looked this place up because mt friends wanted to do a steak dinner for a gathering.Price is a little fancy, but the service is what you pay for so that balances out. Staff is super friendly.Originally I thought the wagyu was gonna be the star of the show, but even though it was nicel marbled it was lacking in taste and had some tendon toughness to it.I would definitely recommend their aged porterhouse. Their baked potato is solid as well.","I wanted to try this restaurant for long time and my friends and I was just hanging out in the area. We saw tons of good reviews about food in this place so we didn't feel disappointed at all after we had dinner. Highlight of this restaurant is beef. There are so many kind of beef preparations. We had....- Uni Fillet Mignon : excellence! 10/10- Grilled Bronzino : delicious 9/10- Assort Sashimi of the Day : very fresh 9/10- Kaisou Salad : only one that we weren't crazy about 6/10Service is great, server kept checking our table, kept cleaning but waiting a bit long to add up some more orders.",Salt + Charcoal
63,*cash only*Make a reservation on OpenTable! BBQ shrimp appetizer with cajun fries was delicious. We aren't used to having shrimp head-on but we got the hang of it pretty quickly.. Just twist the head off and peel lolFor dinner we shared combo (B) 1/2 lb of lobster and substituted the 1/2 lbs. of crawfish for shrimp. Got it in mild Garlic Butter sauce and it was to die for! I would dip everything in that sauce if I could.As far as drinks the Peach Lemonade with Tito's vodka was sooo good. Not too sweet at all. Wouldn't really recommend the margaritas here,"Woah. So I've never had crawfish. This place has flavorful food. The sauce was on point. Everything was tasty. Fries were tasty as well. I would pass on the garlic bread though, not work it.","I can't tell you how good the food here is you have to try it yourself! And make sure to get the blend sauce. Two reasons why I minus one star: 1. this is a cash only establishment, but come on, even the smallest ice cream shop nowadays takes cards. 2. Cajun wings tasted somewhat disappointing. Not juicy enough and the seasoning was tedious.","It was my first time here and damn was the food delicious! Arrived several minutes before 5 o'clock on a Monday evening and decided to walk around the block since the doors weren't open yet. Came back at 5 sharp (lol was a bit impatient, what can I say) and were the first customers in. Didn't make a reservation. So typical.We were seated immediately. The place did smell a bit raw (probably the smell of oysters or something). Ordered the Crab and Crawfish Combo, but swapped the crawfish out for shrimp, and an extra pound of shrimp. Honestly, the entire experience was a breeze. I just sat there, staring at the menu, stupefied of what to get. Thank god, my friend was there (tip: bring a friend, preferably one who's been there before). Of course, I peeled shrimp and ate too. Would've been pretty stupid if I just sat there watching my sister and friend eat.The staff will hand you nitrile gloves and tie a plastic bib around your neck. Yes, they'll tie it for you lol. But, amazing service. They'll check in every so often making sure everything's okay. One waiter came and checked in with us like three times in the hour or so we were there.Food came pretty quick. The sauce was rich and flavorful. The crab legs and shrimp were cooked to perfection and it was really easy to peel everything. No mess. Nada. Probably just garlic breath for the evening.Anyways, had a pleasant experience. Will definitely be back soon for some more seafood.","YUM! Loveeee this place. The food, the service, the patrons- its great positive energy and delicious food!Some tips- they don't take reservations so if you want to eat right away come just when they open to get a table.I also like to have the sauce on the side because when its immersed in the bag especially when I get medium level of hotness, it gets even hotter with each bite. PLUS if I have leftover sauce I can bring it home and mix with my rice. ! It tastes even better the next day. Enjoy!","This is one of my 'go - to, catch up with friends' dinner places. I always make sure to make reservations and take out cash, because both of their locations are cash only. I prefer the nyu location as it's a little bigger. The chinatown location is small, so when it gets busy it almost feels like we're sitting on top of each other. I went as a party of 3 and everyone ordered their own bag of goodies. I went with the combo A (1lb of crawfish and 1lb of shrimp) garlic butter sauce. Garlic butter is def my favorite sauce. But if you like a spicier version of it, go for the special sauce. It tastes a bit like lemon pepper and garlic butter mixed and then spicy. We also got the garlic bread, which was reaaaaaaaallly good. It was good to eat on its own and dip in the sauce. The servers are really attentive, always ready to empty the shell bucket before it gets full, always ready to pour our water cups. Can't really ask for more really. I only wish they accept credit card, so even when I'm broke and have no money i can still come and enjoy.",The Boil
64,"Pasta is good & mussels , service can be 50/50 guess it just depends on who the host is our who serves you ...",Beware of this server (pics below) its about 4:30pm my partner and I wanted to have cocktails and apps outside just like the other people - he said NO thats for dinner tables - its 4:30pm. Oh wait he just sat people - see below pics. Wait perhaps i dont look like them - even in NYC it happens.,,"This place was another one on my list for quite some time. Decided to stop by and grab a bite at the bar counter one evening. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!Ambience: 8/10. Very green and casual decor with outdoor seating if you desire. I opted for the indoor seating because there were open windows everywhere and preferred to be away from the pigeons. A bit loud inside but it didn't bother me. Service: 7/10 Bar staff wasn't overly attentive or enthusiastic. Service wasn't good or bad enough to drastically contribute to overall scoring. Food: Surprised me! I wasn't expecting it but the pastas were full of flavor and cooked to al dente perfection. I still dream about that carbonara with that yolk mixing all over it. Creamy, chewy, and perfectly salted with hints of meat in every bite. The clam pasta was very well done- lighter in taste so it really contrasted the carbonara. Clams were fresh with no hints of sand. Note that the portions here are a bit small so I'd finished both pastas myself. Call me fat but I blame it on the portions. You should probably get both. I forgot the name of the fish that I'd gotten, but it was cooked to perfection. Crispy skin, and moist meat on the inside. Well done. A true 10/10 for the food here. I would've taken away some points for the portion sizes but I think I actually prefer it that way. Verdict: Overall 8.5/10. Go here for some hella good instagrammable pasta on a casual night with a friend or two. Maybe even brunch on a Sunday. But choose another place if you need a quieter atmosphere to talk about the details of that divorce.","I'm staying in the neighborhood for a few days and wanted to find something local to enjoy for dinner on my last night. I'd walked by here a few times and thought I'd try it.The restaurant is beautifuly decorated. At Victoria's reccomendation, I had the Carbonara and it was so flavorful on its own and the egg made it luscious and rich. I'd definitely come back.","We came here for our anniversary celebration, it was a weekday night. We got there early and had 2 cocktails each. They were all delicious!  and the bar tender was really sweet, more importantly, his drinks came out really good! Too bad when you get seated at the tables, you don't get to enjoy happy hour. That's only at the bar. We ordered Polipo In Padella - the octopus to share as an appetizer, it was okay. A little dry and the salad cane with actually tastes better For the entree, we got a pizza and a Carbonara pasta. Man oh man, did that pasta bring me back to Italy!!! We shared a tiramisu and that perfectly ended our anniversary dinner. And very satisfied! Services were pleasant throughout the night. I'll be back for that pasta and cocktails",Olio e Piú
65,This place is my go-to place for small events. Just remember to reserve ahead of time!,"The ambience is very nice and modern, the service was attentive and accommodating. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the food as it was greasy and bland. I ordered the lamb noodles and the crispy tofu, and even though it's been a few hours, I still feel sick. I hate to write such a poor review, but I paid over $30, and I wanted this to be a warning.","The place was very famous, lots of my friends have been to this place and recommended this place to me. Fine dining place like cafe China. The food was fresh and delicious. But nothing surprising. A little bit disappointed.","Stopped in for dinner on Friday evening. Got here around 5:30-6:00pm and the restaurant was pretty empty but filled out quickly. If you want to get a table easily, I highly recommend showing up then.The ambiance of the restaurant is fantastic. Open, airy, and green. Service was also very quick and attentive. The server had some great suggestions, was happy to answer questions, and was quick to check on us if we ever needed anything.We tried a ton of dishes and everything was outstanding. Definitely among my favorites on the area!","Crispy shrimp with peanuts, braised lamb noodles, sauteed shrimp with pumpkin, fried pork belly, spinach in ginger sauce, veggie spring rolls and seafood fried rice. A perfect medley of food. We each ordered our own dish along with a few appetizers but soon learned when they put all of the dishes in the center of the table and gave us small plates that it was meant to be enjoyed family style. Okay by me. My favorite dishes were the spinach in ginger sauce (I'd put ginger sauce in my cereal to be honest), the sauteed shrimp and pumpkin (this was my original order) and the seafood fried rice. The spinach in ginger sauce was a small serving but with all of the other food, it was the perfect size for five of us to get a bit. The sauteed shrimp and pumpkin was INCREDIBLE. First, the shrimp were cooked so perfectly that they had so much flavor all on their own. The pumpkin was really interesting and just made for a good dish all around. The seafood fried rice was a huge portion and because none of the entrees came with rice on their own, we treated it as a side. The only cocktail they had available that night was the Misty Lemonade.. luckily it was fantastic. Two layers with the uppermost layer being red wine - get it. We skipped dessert because we were told when we were seated that we only had about an hour to eat. I don't really hold it against them because we showed up about 20 minutes late for our 5:30 reservation... still never the best way to sit down for a meal. We probably would have stayed for more drinks and dessert if that time limit wasn't looming over the table. Food was fantastic and the restaurant was beautiful. I'd definitely recommend trying this place out.","Chinese restaurants with modern, mid-century modern decor catering to millennials are now a dime a dozen, but Hao Noodle was one of the earlier restaurants of this ilk to grace this city. Eater and Grubstreet have done some fascinating deep dives into the rise of the upper class in China leading to an increase in international students moving to New York to study at our prestigious universities. This has led to a larger market for Chinese fine dining and I am here for it.The exposed brick and string lighting actually dates this place a little bit, but creates a really cozy vibe nonetheless. The pillows lining the seats against the wall add to the comforting atmosphere. The space is really beautiful.Our group ordered crispy shrimp with peanuts, vegetable spring rolls, sauteed shrimp with pumpkin, dry-fried pork belly with green peppers, braised fresh lamb noodles, spinach in ginger sauce, and seafood fried rice with egg whites and vegetables. Everything was pretty tasty, with the sauteed shrimp w/pumpkin being my favorite dish.You could definitely make the argument that there's tastier versions of this cuisine elsewhere in the city at a lower price point, but I think that's not taking into consideration we're in Greenwich Village, the cocktail list, and the ambience, which you often can't get at cheaper establishments. I think this restaurant is a fine choice for a casual, fun group meal.",Hao Noodle and Tea By Madam Zhu's Kitchen
66,"I really wanted to like Sweet Chick. I've heard so many great things about this place but it may be overhyped because Nas is part owner. It's really dark when the sun goes down and you're forced to eat by candlelight - a tea light candlelight - that continuously kept going out as I tried to pour syrup in the dark. My boyfriend and I were seated at this cafeteria-like bench with other guests which was different, but I would prefer to sit at my own table. I could not decide on what I wanted to eat from the menu because as creative as the food names are, it's just overhyped Southern style food. The food came out before the drinks which is usually a slight irritation for me but I managed. The chicken was good but the waffles were ...not all that. Would I return? Umm no but I wouldn't urge someone not to try it. Maybe it'll be your thing.","It was OK. The wait was incredibly long, so don't go hungry. The food itself: We got the fried chicken and waffles, of course. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. I have a rule for myself: if I can make it better, then place is not worth a repeat visit. This is such a place.",I have to rewrite my review because I dined here this evening and was so disappointed in the service and the staffs uniform. I understand that this is a comfort food place but the hostess was wearing sweats and our servers stomach was out. I was a bit confused by the dress code. It's also hard to determine who's our server when they're all dressed so casual. This is the same problem with the way they talk. It's like they were acting like we were friends. I just think at this location they took casual to the next level. Our food was cold and the lack of service really made this an unfortunate experience. For that I have to go from 5 to 3 stars. -@agirlsgottaeatt,"Been to both locations and absolutely love their fried chicken and waffle. It's a perfect balance of sweet and savory. The waffle is light, warm, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. The chicken is fried to perfection. Crispy and juicy. Perfect seasoning. It comes with three types of butter. Sweet, savory, and plain. Their house bacon is great too.",Amazing chicken and waffles. Id recommend the chicken bucket.Maybe skip their General Tso's...the sauce they use for that is more akin to savory teriyaki than sweet/spicy General Tso's sauce. The pecan waffle is dope.,Good food AMAZING music selectiongood draft beer selection I am def coming back ! Also cute male bartenders,Sweet Chick
67,"Oddly, I marked this lobster place not for its lobster but for its Burger. So naturally, I had to order the burger. My wife ordered the lobster - so we could get a taste of both. Cutting straight to the chase, the lobster roll is a low return on investment. Its a lot of $$ for a small amount of lobster meat. Admittedly, neither one of us is a connoisseur of lobster meat so we couldn't really comment on the quality of that. But the bread was to die for.  BUT I strongly recommend that when you visit, at least 1 person takes the burger. It was incredibly juicy. I definitely rate the burger over the lobster meat. There. I said it. And you get 5 stars because thats not even your main dish. Red Hook Lobster *whispers, and burger* Pound","Really upset.My parents made a reservation for them and my husband and I for their lobster dinner special over the phone, took her credit card info, and did not tell her there would be penalties if we cancelled. My dad, who's almost 70 and has health issues, woke up feeling very sick so we called telling them we needed to cancel. Their response was that they were going to charge my mom's card $100, $25 per head, because of the cancellation. I've never been in this situation before with a restaurant, especially when they failed to mention this policy upon making the reservation. Finally, after an hour on the phone, they agreed to move the reservation to another day, which doesn't work all that well for any of us but we don't feel like we have any choice. Who wants to spend $100 on food you didn't eat? So, I'm going to have to re-arrange my plans and eat at a place, for the last time, that I have really enjoyed in the past. We even had their food truck at my wedding! I understand the policy, but the not mentioning it is inexcusable. And believe me, if they told my mom when she made the reservation, she'd remember because that's just who she is.This sucks.","This restaurant was incredibly dissappointing. We have a place near us in Burlingame, CA which is roughly the same price, larger, and is much much higher quality.  $26 for something half the size of my fist is crazy, especially with the sheer oiliness of the bun. The service was nothing to write home about, and the bathrooms make up in design when they lack in functionality.I was so excited. And this was overall a big let down. I wouldn't return.","MMM seafood.I had their food truck at my wedding, but wanted the ""full"" experience.  Everything I tried was delicious, and if you love lobster, you've come to the right place.  They even have a bloody mary with a lobster claw!  I tried the shrimp appetizer-pretty good, the fried oysters rockefeller-excellent, fish and chips-very good, key lime pie-totally wow, and the funnel cake-awesome...and I thought I didn't like dessert : ).  They also do a full lobster dinner for $25 (great deal!) all day on Wednesdays, which both my parents had and thoroughly enjoyed.  Oh and just a heads up, the portions here are huge so come hungry, like I did.Shout out to the waitress who, when I asked for tea, came back with a glass of warm water with fresh mint and lemon because they didn't have actual tea bags-you rock.","So I went here the other day, Tuesday (9-24-19) for what turned out to be a surprise Dinner for my up and coming birthday and was pleased. Before coming here, I had seen this restaurant on television a few days prior on one of the food networks and mentioned how I would like to go here and so to me surprise, ended up here. Now I would advise before going here to make reservations because even on a Tuesday night, this place gets crowded to where a line is waiting outside of the establishment. Due to not having a reservation, we had to actually wait until they gave us the option to eat outside where a few tables were available. One of the things that surprised us was how attentive our waiter was towards his customers, he really showed interest. Enough of that, you want to know what we had and here it is. We ordered the Connecticut which is a Buttered Lobster Roll which comes with a few different side options such as fries in which I chose, a Baked Potato, Spinach and others. The Lobster Roll was pretty good but it comes only buttered and not with the Mayonnaise and celery and other goods that you are used to seeing on Lobster rolls. We also had the Crab Dip in which we saw on the show was well liked and highly suggested but unfortunately when we had it, it was first too salty to the point where we had to have our waiter take it back and when the new one came around, it lacked Salt and a bit of flavor and the chips it came with was wrong for it due to it being too burnt and with Old Bay Seasoning. Oh well, I guess you win some and you lose some. We had these fried Oysters with Spinach on top which was an interesting mix together which was only OKAY, not the best and probably due to the Spinach being too strong. The Star of the night and the last dish that we had was the 1.5 Pound lobster which was Huge for a 1.5 pounder and even could have passed for a 2 pounder. This Lobster was cooked perfectly and tasted great and BEST OF ALL WAS FRESH! A lot of the times when you go to Seafood Restaurants, the Seafood doesn't always taste as fresh as it should but here, that wasn't a problem. The lobster came with potatoes, and sausage in which we had the option in adding. The Sausage in which they used was good too. As for the price, this place isn't cheap so if you are looking for a cheapy but goodie, this isn't it! These items plus 4 glasses of wine ran us to about 150. Overall, I'd definitely go to here again and on a scale from 1 to 10, I'd give it an 7.5.","I've also been to some of the Red Hook Lobster Pound's outposts, but the original spot is definitely the best. I really liked the poolside cocktail to start, and enjoyed the New England clam chowder, Lobster cheese fries, classic lobster roll, fish and chips and Clam strips. The fish and chips in particular were simply perfect.",Red Hook Lobster Pound
68,"Food: 4.5/5Service: 1/5This place really brings back memories of my time in Japan. Everything was cooked to perfection and so savory. The Berkshire Katsu was absolutely divine! We really enjoyed the food but the service was really terrible!!Our male server was really rude, he came to take our order and that was pretty much it. He didn't show any interest in actually serving us - no recommendations, no explaining the sauces, offering cabbage/rice refills, etc. no interaction from him. After the food was served, we never saw him again. Throughout our entire meal, our waters were NEVER refilled even once.. until the end of the meal when they cleared our plates. How terrible is that..","Not impressed about the thick cut Berkshire pork chop, not tender, but quite dry. Want to try thick cut fried pork chop after watching Japanese show Kodoku no Gourme, dreaming it would be juicy and tasty, but it's very disappointed of the pork chop they made, not even arriving the regular standard curry pork chop in other Japanese restaurant. Don't even want to mention the rude Everest service they provide, we want to share two fried pork chop considering it's quite oily and boring. But waiter on purpose did not even provide extra plate for us, how can we share? We immediately lost our appetite here. Since there are quite lot curry, so we want to have more rice as the menu mentioned that it's free for refill rice and cabbage, but the rude ever waiter said that just you know that it will be extra charge since you guys share the meal?What? What? Just some rice, are you serious? Are you mad we order two meals and one appetizer for three people? Will never return, probably just a tourist shit hole here.",I don't know what happened to this place. I've been coming here for years. The food is always good but the service and experience have been terrible recently. We got there right before the restaurant opened. They gave us a high chair for our son but the buckle was broken. So its actually really unsafe for him to sit in it. They preemptively gave us the check when we weren't even half way done with our meal. We asked for a take our box but the waitress was slow so we asked again and she was very unhappy with us and rolled her eyes. They also were blasting music. Such an unpleasant experience here.,Had a pleasant experience here while waiting for a show at radio city music hall. I got the chicken Katsu udon and Kevin got the pork katsu donburi bowl. Took a while to get the food but that was okay since we had some time to spare. The pork was way better than the chicken. It was crispy and not overdone. I would highly recommend it. My udon was good but blazing hot so I burned my tongue a few times. Don't worry I'm okay now :),Ate here several times for lunch and one dinner. Katsu was very delicious. Crunchy with good texture. Sauce was perfect. The ramen noodle broth was great and noodles a good texture. Friendly staff and quick service.,"Summary:Service is a bit slow, and food can come out slowly. The food is also not particularly all that much better than other katsu places.Food:I got the Berkshire Pork Katsu, with the special soup. They let you grind the sesame seeds that you will use as your dipping sauce at the start of your meal. The katsu is decently made, but not particularly special.It also comes with a bunch of cabbage and unlimited refills for this particular set. It's mostly a vehicle for the dressing that they provide.Service:Service was a bit slow, and for us it was extra slow. That being said the waitress made it up to us by giving a small discount for the slow service.",Katsu-Hama
69,Spicy beef is good. Unfortunately their service and mistakes on orders (twice) remove any kind of positive experience.,The food was great. But the service was a bit poor. At first they were attentive. We got drinks and orders I at a decent time. However after we were served we didn't seem to exist. Not to mention they made me the wrong dish. I received beef over rice but ordered noodles. It was too long of a wait and I was hungry so I just took it. The food was great and tasty. My fiancé ordered the boneless chicken wings with the truffle fries. I even placed an order for fries to go. But they messed that up and brought out beef over rice instead. So I just left it.,"Bomb dot com.No joke, it's so good. I'll for sure be back!!! Good ambiance, somewhat slow service (our guy was a little distracted and generally missed my non verbal cues), but the food really makes up for it. Sadly I don't remember our order details as this was a few weeks ago but, c'est la vie. Try everything. Bon appetit mon cherie xx","So I've been going to this place for a while. They keep changing up their menu. Previously they used to sell really good dishes. Now, they are predominately a fried chicken specialty restaurant in my opinion. I do have to say Even now I still enjoy their food especially during their happy hour where the prices are amazing. Their selection of flavored fried chicken is Also very interesting. I would say  that one of my favorite flavors is called ""yellowing snow"" which I have no idea what it is LOL. In conclusion I would still recommend coming to this place. The prices are great the food taste good and the staff is very friendly.Edit-  FRIES ARE ADDICTING.","This is my favorite go-to bar! I brought my boyfriend here a while ago and he loves this place just as much as I do. THE PROS* a lot of seating area * happy hour is a steal! * chicken wings!!!!! * French fries during happy hour!!! I tried the kimchi fries and the garlic fries at two different times. I love both but my favorite is the kimchi friesTHE CONS * none yet so far! Keep up the good work (:A little tip: Come during happy hour, appetizers + chicken wings with whatever flavor you pick and choose, wine plus beer  uhmmmm yesss!!!","Went here one rainy Tuesday night a few weeks ago with my boyfriend. We were looking for restaurants in Williamsburg and came across this place on Yelp.When we arrived, we were greeted cheerfully and seated promptly. It was pretty much empty inside beside us and another couple. We ordered the silver factory platter (soy garlic) to share between us. The chicken was delicious and my boyfriend enjoyed it a lot. The platter was filling and we had a lot left over. The grapefruit drink my boyfriend ordered was very cool (as seen in the video) and tasty. It was a very chill spot and the service was great. The art was urban and appealing, the vibes were great and so was the music. I would definitely return and recommend.",Silver Factory

And they were close when we went there for leaking problem and they didn't even call us to let us know. That was literally disrespectful and terrible management service. I wish could rate them less then one star. That was terrible experience with them. Call them day before if you guys have reservation with them to be safe.,Lackluster food for very high prices. The Brussels sprouts stand out - delicious. Everything else wasn't worth the trip,"Probably the best spot in the east village.Great food, great ambiance and wine selection.The service is perfect ! I will definitely come back","This place is great for a group brunch. 31+ for brunch plus bottomless mimosas or bloody Mary's. Llimited menu but it's all delicious. Pancakes, eggs, French toast, croque monsieur and madame, etc. great food, great staff, great price. I've been here twice and it's a great deal. Staff is quite accommodating and even pumps the music up for us ~lit~ brunchers. A little out of the way but come here for an all around good time. Bring your cash!!!!","Another great brunch spot in the East Village. I came here with a small group (4) for brunch around 11am when they first open to avoid the long brunch lines. We had the brunch menu with the food + coffee/tea but there is 2 hr unlimited mimosas for those that wanted to drink. Most of us got that brioche French toast which was great. If you love strawberries, bananas, nuts and Nutella you will not be disappointed. Another person in the group got the croque madame which looked good too. The customer service was great and the waiters kept coming over for drink refills. I believe all the waiters are French and definitely look like models. Also keep in my party had brunch reservation and we did earlier time. The only negative was that there was only bathroom where the lighting was terrible so not cute mirror selfies. Also the sink was leaking water.",PMF Pardon My French
71,"2.5. Underwhelming menu, warm beer, mediocre food, shoddy service. We arrived here around 3:30 on Sunday. We saw that it was bustling and had plenty of good reviews on Yelp so we figured this would be a great spot for a quick bite. Well, this is one of those times where Yelp let me down.The menu consisted of half brunch items, sandwiches, and salads. Not too much to choose from, and nothing really sounded amazing. I had no idea what to order. Not because there were so many enticing options, (which is usually my dilemma) but because nothing sounded appealing to me.We ordered the benedict and the croque madame. The benedict was awful. Not much flavor at all. The temperatures were off. The croque madame was a little better. Ham, fried egg, bread and sauce. Not worth the price at all. The sauce had some rich flavor, but other than that it was a very boring dish.I wasn't impressed by anything here. Maybe my expectations were too high. But everything from service to food was poor to mediocre.","Good food, but will not be back. Could not enjoy my meal because of the following:Serves room temperature water with no ice. - 1 starNO AIR during a heat wave. - 2 stars","This place has done it, made a very non confrontational person actually complain about a meal. I arrived here at 9am on a Sunday, being the third people in the restaurant. I ordered the eggs Florentine and my partner got the French toast, after waiting after seeing all the tables around us fill up, eat their food and pay their bills. We informed the waitress of this and she went into the kitchen, then informed us our food would be coming out shortly. We waited another 20 minutes, hoping that at least the food would be good and worth the wait. When my eggs Florentine finally arrived I ate some potatoes, and a few bites of salad that were average. With the eggs Florentine, I noticed the eggs had been cut in the middle, showing that the kitchen had checked the eggs and thought this was alright. The eggs were clearly hard boiled instead of poached. I informed the waitress, and sent my food back. She asked if I wanted to order something else to which I said no, she didn't even offer to comp the meal after seeing it? Weird. To be fair, the waitress didn't make the food so that isn't her fault, however she could have atleast offered to take it off the bill. I was offered nothing as a comp, paid for the meal (minus the eggs Florentine as I sent it back) and left. At least I now i can say I've had the worst brunch experience!","Their BLT is hands down my favorite sandwich in all of NYC. Maybe all of the country. Heck, why stop there? Maybe all of the world. I have tried to recreate this masterpiece at home to which my boyfriend said, ""Pretty good. Rabbithole's is still better.""Scones are good too, especially the Gorgonzola fig.",This place is cute cozy restaurant where is recommended to be good for breakfast & brunch. I came with the group of 6 people. I ordered several dishes to share. Food tastes delicious but took a bit long. The server is ok. I would recommend this place to people who go around Williamsburg area and have no idea where to go for breakfast.,"Cozy spot in Williamsburg with a little outdoor patio at the back. Food was good and the service was great. The host could've been a bit more organized and friendly in my opinion.Egg white frittata - this comes in a hot pan and was delicious!!! I'd give this dish a 4.5/5Lox Eggs Benedict - eggs were well cooked, the salmon was tasty. If you fancy an eggs benny's you can't go wrong with this one. I'd give this a 4/5Lamb burger - the patty wasn't as tender and flavorful although the herbes feta that came with it was so good. Overall 3/5",Rabbithole Restaurant
72,"This was the worst experience. I spent almost $300 just to get unwashed and smelling shrimp and crab legs. Food arrived way too fast and was warm. When we spoke to the waitress, she did not apologize or get us help. I was sick to my stomach. No one from my group finished their food.",Horrible service and rude guard at front door . Very strange makes you feel like there is a dicey bar inside with fights happening not the boil place Would not advise to go to this location especially if you don't like the loud music,My daughter and I was in the mood for some seafood and saw that Claw Daddy's was close to Target. We didn't know we needed a reservation and the hostess was not frat all. She sat us by the bathroom which was not a good impression for a first timer. We asked the hostess if there's was another table and she said no. So my daughter and left to find another place to find goos sea food.,SO much fun!  Went with 4 people for the Claw Feast!  Be ready to work and crack and splash and get some great stains on your clothes!  THE FOOD IS SO DAMNNNNN GOOD!  I recommend 110%,"Not very interested in their food menu for the price, but the happy hour is great. Adult capri suns are tasty (albeit sweet) and they really sneak up on you so be warned! Way stronger than we anticipated. Good spot to grab a few $1 wings, a couple capri suns and kill some time before dinner or an event at Barclays. Unfortunately, due to the popularity in the neighborhood, it's increasingly hard to get a seat and/or is very crowded. Enjoyed it much more when it opened. Heads up that they don't have a full liquor license. So beer, wine, and Korean vodka only. Don't come here if you're dying for a craft cocktail (for that, hit up Sweet Polly!).","I came here with my gals to catch up. I can't recall if we had reservations but it was an early Saturday afternoon and we were seated pretty quickly. We ordered a collage of crab legs, shrimp, oysters, clams, and crawfish with a side of potatoes and corn. Unlike your other seafood boils where each person gets their own sharing; at this location, they placed everything in one bag for the table.We then ordered the adult Capri suns and I personally feel like they weren't good. It tasted like sugar water and bottom shelf vodka; it almost tasted like syrupy medicine. Maybe if they mixed it a little better it would've had a better taste on the palate.I must say the fried oysters were really good; I think they had them as add ons on the menu for $1-2.Although the food was good, the experience was underwhelming. If I ever come back it would only be to try the fried oysters again.",Claw Daddy's
73,"The food was average but the service was below average. The cashier and waitress were rude. Not sure if it was because we went on a sunday and they were under staffed. But regardless customer service shouldnt be this way. The food came really slow and at different times. So everyone finished their meal at different times, defeated the point of eating together. So some started eating while some were staring, then after some finished the others had to wait.","This is an overall experience rather than a single visit. I've discovered Wok Wok a couple years ago and would come from time to time for lunch. The concept Wok Wok seems to be going for is a Malaysian-Thai Fusion sorta theme, though I suppose Malaysian food in itself is already a Fusion cuisine.I do not recall ever having a negative experience with the food here. Their appeal for lunch is the lunch combos. They have sets you can order that comes with an appetizer, and entree, and a drink (I've always gotten the Thai Iced Tea). Don't worry if you don't like the set though, because if you ask the wait staff, they will usually tell you you can pick any entree and appetizer and still get a free drink. I personally usually get their Thai lettuce wrap and chicken satay skewers.The Thai iced tea is meh. Too overly sweet for my palette.The kitchen can be a hit or a miss. I've gone some days where the food would take forever to come out, and other times where it came out timely.","The service is bad. Waited at front desk for 15 miniature before anyone came to greet me. When I tried to talk to one of the waiters she told to wait off. Finally when I got seated and ordered, the server didn't understand my order! She came back and asked again even I just ordered one dish. The food I ordered is lemongrass coconut curry. Okay, first of all, it's not a curry. It lacks spice layers for coccus nor it has any coconut flavor. When I asked the waitress she told me ""every chief in our kitchen cooks differently"". Does that mean as customer I need to accommodate to the cooking skill for a restaurant???It was beyond disappointment. Would never go back again","Love Wokwok for my go-to delivery order. I have a few favorites but I find any of their noodle dishes to be very delicious. They hold well during delivery which is most important to me. I've also tried the beef curry and hainese chicken. All really excellent and fresh.Lastly, in every order, regardless of what I get, I always add Taiwanese popcorn chicken as an app. You can choose your spice level so I always get it extra spicy. It is soooo good and plentiful. Like gigantic in portion size. Easy to share between 2-4 people.","This is my second time trying Malaysian/SE Asian fusion food and it was not a great experience. The best thing we ordered was the original roti with the curry dipping sauce which was very flavorful! That's where the good ended unfortunately.1. The ""pandan"" drink I ordered wasn't actually pandan. It was just soymilk with brown sugar syrup at the bottom. Not even mixed in. I was so confused I asked the server what the drink was and he explained that their ""pandan"" = brown sugar?2. Wok Wok Curry Beef Stew Laksa - my friend ordered this and it was a very interesting dish! We've never had this type of dish before, so it was a cool experience trying this type of curry. Not sure if this is normal, but the noodles were pretty much all broken right when we got the dish. The broth gets absorbed pretty quickly by the noodles, so you'll probably end up with a bowl of soggy noodles and no broth. Not a big deal because it was pretty flavorful!3. Penang Har Mee - Also a dish we've never tried before but cool flavor combinations. I thought it was fun that there are two different types of noodles in one dish! A major setback for this dish was the shrimp, which had a mushy texture and weird taste to it, making me suspect it's probably pretty old shrimp. Overall, Wok Wok is not a terrible place to eat, but I would stick to Nyonya for this type of cuisine! Both places are cash only, but I feel like Nyonya gives more food and has fresher tasting ingredients.","My favorite go-to Malaysian restaurant for a while now. Every time I come back, I realize how much I miss it. The restaurant is located in the basement so you need to keep an eye out for their sign when walking by.I usually order the fish head noodle soup which is a light milky broth with fried fish. This is my favorite bowl when I'm looking for a clean hearty meal. Otherwise the Curry Laksa Noodles are a must.",Wok Wok

Unfortunately, the experience was thoroughly disappointing and I am just glad I did not go for the tasting menu. I was pleasantly surprised that the prices were reasonably low. However, everything else was despicable and I left unhappily.Food:The food was extremely salty. Both the tofu soup (which is nothing more than salty soon-tofu soup presented in a miniature bowl) and the spicy pork ramen were very salty. The soup was almost inedible and when we asked for a replacement, we were just given a bowl of unseasoned broth to remedy it ourselves. The sashimi salad was enjoyable.Experience:An imperfect attempt to mimic upscale dining interior design and service. Both the service and atmosphere were nice but amateur.Price:Would be a very reasonable and low price if the food quality is decent.",JeJu Noodle Bar 7 course tasting menu:Favorite:1: TORO SSAM BAP2: PORK BOSSAM3: TUNA KIMBAP$42 tasting is really cheap. The service and environment is soo good!,"Came here kind of not expecting much. Came with a party of 4 and as a walk in.Got the toro ssam bap , fried chicken, soon du boo, so ramyun and fish coop.Everything was delicious here. Toro with some uni is always a luxurious dish and this was no exception.The soon du boo...I thought it was not necessarily focused on the tofu and I really enjoyed it because it ended up tasting like a soup. There was something interesting in it (I forget what) but I enjoyed it a lot more than I normally enjoy this dish.The fried chicken, was so good. Kind of reminded me of karage but the chicken was in the bones. So crunchy and juicy, was done amazingly well. Tastes good without any sauce and the sauce compliments it well.The ramyun (it's really the same as ramen to me) we're delicious. I liked the SO one better as it was much more rich and am glad I shared it with folks. It's too rich for one person, but split 3 ways makes it the perfect amount. Having the veal pieces was a bit interesting, I didn't care too much for the chicken pieces though. The fish one was a nice bonito broth and complemented the other ramyun really well since it's a much lighter broth. Sharing is the way to go for these noodles IMOAll in all came out to be about 34 a person, which is incredibly reasonable for a meal like this. Also, everyone there is a chef! They just rotate roles. That was one of my favorite parts","I must say this my favorite noodle shop in the city. The Michellin star it received is well deserved as their food lives up to its expectations. I came with with my co-workers around 5pm on a weekday and we were seated promptly. The service was very attentive and our waitress would walk us through the menu with great knowledge and patience. I got the So Ramyun and it was without a doubt the best bowl of ramen I ever had. This is a veal bone broth and the broth was incredibly rich. Very creamy and is on the heavier end which may not suit everyone's preference. As most of my co-workers did prefer the Gochu Ramyun. But for me I thought the So Ramyun was very unique and I love every bits of item that was in the bowl. Can't go wrong with either choice!As far as pricing goes its $19 for the So Ramyun and $18 for Gochu Ramyun. I believe the pricing is fair for the quality of food you are getting and not to mention the preparation that goes through in making these bowl of ramen. In New York City you can easily find yourself paying for much more for the type of service and quality Jeju Noodle Bar has to offer. If you are in the city and you are craving for a bowl of ramen that's different than your most ramen, definitely stop by here. As a side note it can get pretty pack on weekends.","Recently had a great dinner at Jeju Noodle Bar. We were able to get the last table spot for two at around 5pm. The seating does fill up very up very quickly on weekends so do expect to sit by the bar if you arrive at 5pm.As it was my first time there, I decided to try the pre fixe menu for two. The pre fixe menu included their recommended dishes: jeju wings, corn with truffle shavings, tuna tartare, prime ribeye steak with lettuce for wrapping, gochu ramyum and a choice of dessert (ice cream or sorbet). I'd have to say the corn and tuna tartare were my faves. The truffle shavings were a great addition to such a simple vegetable. The fatty tuna tartare was a luxurious dish and was complemented with roasted seaweed for wrapping. Overall, I was very pleased with the selection of food in the pre fixe menu! It definitely highlights the strong points of Jeju Noodle Bar and would def return to try their other dishes.",JeJu Noodle Bar
75,"I really don't understand why this place is always packed and popular. Drink specials are not great, food is good but not memorable, brunch special is typical ... atmosphere is like a collage bar and extremely loud.","Well I had such high hopes for here but they were dashed. Since I was by myself, I was able to get a table, but then I had to wait to order. My food came relatively quickly, and it was ok tasting, but super greasy. Corned beef grilled cheese shouldn't be THAT greasy. So I ask for the check and a box and the waitress just brings over the check and before I could even open my mouth to ask for a box, she walks off. For literally over 15 mins. During this time there are 3 other employees standing there ""checking ID's"" who I tried to flag down to bring me a box, but they just kept ignoring me. So every 5 mins I reduced the tip on the check til finally she returned and I had to ask for a new one. And I asked for a to go box, yet again. So what did she do? Grabbed my food and then walked off for another 5 minutes. Do you seriously think I ate it then? Get it together. And yep, I didn't leave a tip, because that was just ridiculous and uncalled for and that's the second time in my life I've ever done that, so that's saying something. If your service is that bad that a yelp elite isn't leaving a tip, and we ALWAYS tip, you have a serious issue.","Trash, the vibe is cool. But the food...yeah that's gonna be a no for me dawg. #keepwriting #keepwriting #keepwriting","Stopped in right after Pride parade. My party of 6 and I were sat immediately which was a pleasant surprise. Our waitress was great, present and had a great personality. I've always wanted to try a burger with a glazed donut for a bun, so when I saw a bacon, egg, and cheese on a cinnamon sugar doughnut bun I just HAD to try it. The fries were prepared exactly how I like em. Beautiful sunny side up egg. I couldn't taste the chipotle mayo that I believe is hidden on there somewhere. The abundance of cinnamon sugar on the outside of my donut was too messy for my liking. I'm a germaphobe and had just commuted all around nyc, so trying to eat this sandwich without licking my still-dirty-nyc-hands-even-after-washing -them was very difficult. Attempting to wipe my mouth and hands after every bite with the napkin was a huge, messy fail. I would certainly devour this sandwich in the privacy of my own judgement-free home any other day of the week, where I can wash my hands squeaky clean and confidently lick every cinnamon sugary goodness off.",The wait was long but they text you when it's ready so you don't have to stand around. Pretty decent food and a bottomless option which is definitely worth it if you plan on drinking more than 2 drinks. It was busy and they play loud music - prime brunch time - but we had a corner table in the front so it wasn't too bad. Really the only downside was that the server couldn't seem to find his way to the front very often. I think he had some bigger parties in back. I would go again but probably with less people so we can sit at the bar.,"The Flying Cock is a surprisingly good gastropub. The food is just delicious.  The tuna tartare tacos are amazing, and the blackened salmon Caesar salad is great, too.  Their Caesar has these tasty polenta breadcrumbs.  The service is polite and very efficient, and the environment is clean and laid back.  Highly recommended!",The Flying Cock
76,"First meal in NYC was at Freemans! Walked through an alley with graffiti and entered a restaurant with various vintage decor.  I also noticed, upon arrival, that the restaurant was not well lit, which added to the ambiance.Arrived around 11 AM, and was fortunate not to have to wait for a table.Went with scrambled eggs, mushrooms, potatoes, bacon, and beans; the food was seasoned well and tasty.  If you're hungry, I recommend this dish.","Went here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon, overall experience was disappointing so I'll keep it short and simple. - Service overall was poor, no rude waiters/waitresses or anything, just took a while to get initial waters, no specials were given to us but specials were given to the tables next to us. Appetizer came out quickly but entrees took 45 minutes after appetizers to come out. We knew something was wrong because the tables next to us who sat down later than us got their appetizers later than us and their entrees faster than us. We notified the waitress and then 5 minutes later our food came, piping hot - which leads me to suspect that the food was forgotten. - The Artichoke Dip was delicious and probably the only highlight of this place. The English Breakfast and Shakshuka both are easily placed in a ""meh"" category. - Iced Latee - beans had been way too burnt - Regular Coffee - nothing special Walking away with a $69 bill pre tip, I won't return. Usually if the service isn't the best I give restaurants a second chance on the benefit of the doubt that the staff was either extremely busy or it was just an off day for them, but the food wasn't good enough either. Bottom line, whenever I finish a meal, I ask myself, was this worth the value of the bill? And if the answer is no, it makes my decision to recommend and return to that place much easier.","Quality has gone down significantly since I first came here 3-4 years ago. A group of friends and I visited for brunch on Saturday. When we first sat down we noticed that 3/6 forks were visibly dirty so we requested new ones. The fork I got back was even dirtier than the one I returned, it had a small yellow stain on it! The tables also did not look like they had been wiped down in awhile. I gave two stars because the food was decent; we ordered skillet egg, French toast, crab cake Benedict; and the  full English breakfast. The waiter was attentive with refilling our water but took awhile to return after handing us the menu. With the plethora of brunch restaurants opening up, I don't think I'll be returning.","Context:  My friend and I were seated without a wait on a Friday at 1 pm.  The restaurant was not very full at all, but I've heard the wait can get quite long on weekends.  Service/Atmosphere:  It's so fun that you have to duck into a colorful grafitied alley way to get to the restaurant!  Just walk through the bright blue door, it cannot be missed.  The inside is illuminated in dim lighting and covered in vintage decor; the antique visuals gives the most lovely comforting, homey feeling.  The service, however, was extremely SUBPAR.  I would've given it a pass if the restaurant was crowded, but it was half empty and they did not look understaffed.  It first took forever for the server to come take our order after he seated us.  Then when we asked for additional hot sauce, he completely forgot.  He later said he told someone else to do it, but this just illustrates bad communication between the staff.  The bill also didn't come until I flagged down a completely different waiter.  We were just sitting there twiddling our thumbs long after we had finished our meal.  A huge part of the problem was the server never once thought to check up on our table during the entire meal.Food:  As for the food itself, the menu offers very classic American brunch options.  I ordered the french toast and my friend ordered the egg white omelette.  Both were not mind-blowing dishes, but they tasted great for a hearty brunch.  Final Thoughts:  I rate this more as 3.5 stars, a full star docked for quality of service, and half a star for taste of the food.  I would still give this another chance to see if this experience was a fluke.","I had really high expectations of this place since I've seen so many of my friends photos on Instagram here and because it looked SO cute. It's been on my list for a while so when we had an open weekend we made the trip.Freeman's alley is very cute don't get me wrong. However, I wish the alley way didn't smell like pee... not the restaurants fault but probably not what a person wants to smell right before they eat.So we go, we get seated. It wasn't too crowded, thankfully. I was anticipating long crowds because I had called several times trying to book a reservation with no success because their automated system hung up on me - twice. Since 1/3 of their seating was held for non-reservations we went.We ordered the classic breakfast platter and a crab Benedict. Food was definitely on the pricy end in comparison to other brunch spots nearby with similar vibes but we were excited. Whenever we go to well rated foods spots we are usually pleasantly surprised.The food came. Both plates were room temperature. Nothing jumped out at us; not the texture, not the flavors, nothing. My salad felt like it was mildly blanched, which was less than ideal considering it removed any texture it could have had. Dressing was not present. My boyfriend and I were both underwhelmed. We were too hungry to complain about the cold food.We both ordered cocktails, neither were good. One was too sour, so we requested it be watered down with seltzer.We finished our meal, so unimpressed. To wrap up, as we were waiting for the check, a waitress spilled coffee all over my boyfriend. We received an apology, but later noticed that his white shirt was stained -- we just wish they did more.We REALLY wanted to like this place... but didn't. I don't understand the hype and both agreed that it's overrated. We won't be back :(","I never knew that artichoke dip was one of my desert island foods, but Freemans' artichoke dip is other worldly--sharp, cheesy, rich, yum! I can't recommend it enough, even for those who wouldn't normally gravitate towards artichokes. Split 3 ways it's indulgent, but doesn't totally overtake your appetite. Amid all of the hyper modern and generically sleek restaurants in New York these days, it's such a pleasure to saunter down the Banksy-level graffiti-filled alley to the restaurant's charming, patina-filled space. We arrived at 10am sharp for Sunday brunch, and were seated and served promptly without any wait.I supplemented my huevos rancheros with chicken--a tasty add on to an already filling plate. Prices are such ($20 for the huevos plate, $17 for the artichoke dip) that this would be more of a treat spot for me, but I would return for the artichoke dip alone.",Freemans
77,"Decent Italian place that was near our hotel.They started us off with some tasty bread and dipping oil. We ordered the steamed mussels that were in a ""spicy"" marinara sauce, although the sauce wasn't that spicy.We had the saffron fettuccine and pesto cavatelli. The fish in the cavatelli was delicious, and the saffron fettuccine was drizzled with a tasty olive puree. However, the texture of the pasta was not the greatest (certainly different from fresh pasta) and the combination of ingredients in the fettuccine didn't quite work together as the pesto dish.A bit hard to decide on a rating, but the prices were very reasonable and the staff was attentive.",I know it's New York City but this is just an unacceptably small amount of pasta to sell for delivery for $19. The container is practically mocking it. Six twists of the fork and it's gone. So hungry still. Trying to make the most of the bread they sent with it but this is not life.,"So overpriced and noisy.  I ordered the pesto pasta with salmon and shrimp.  The pasta was so over cooked that it was like eating mush.  The shrimp were the size of pennies and I had one bit of salmon filet that had a bone in it.  The salad was good and they made it to order with no salt and with the dressing on the side.  The waitress was very nice however impatient with us as we were friends looking to catch up so everything felt a bit rushed .There were lots of people out and about and it was loud and festive so if you wanted to just sit in a quiet Italian eatery to actually have a conversation with your date, this isn't the place, perhaps only when a few patrons are there but when the place is filled up, it is loud. They do have a choice to eat outside on the sidewalk which we didn't take advantages of on this night .","Visited from out of town, Best gnocchi i've EVER had!!! Lovely ambiance and nice attentive wait staff.","I'm taking a star off from an otherwise lovely restaurant because we made a reservation through Yelp for 7:30 and weren't seated until 8:10! The host was not very communicative and they did not offer us anything to compensate. Everything we got was delicious - don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Decent portion sizes and prices were set at what you can expect from NYC Italian. Also, despite our crazy long wait, the food came out quickly!","I came here as per a friend's recommendation. As a local new Yorker, she said it was the best pasta she has ever had. Of course, I had to come try this place out. I came here around normal dinner time (6ish), and the wait wasn't too bad for 2 people. We were able to get a table within 10 minutes, which is rare on weekends!Their pasta is just the right size. It won't make you feel like you could never eat again, but it will also fill you up for the rest of the night. I went with the server's recommendation of the pesto pasta and it was pretty good! Although it was not super memorable, it was definitely not bad! The bread here is great tho!",Da Andrea
78,"After all of the positive reviews, I wonder if I got a bad taco?? Located in Chelsea Market, this little joint was bustling with people. I stood in the long line just to try one taco that I was told was one of the best tacos in the city. I got the pork adobado taco and topped it with salsa and guac. The meat is cooked on a vertical spit and is carved off onto your taco. Despite how it looked on the outside, the taco did not taste very good. The meat was extremely salty to the point that I did not want to finish it. The salsa was very spicy and overpowered the rest of the taco. I could not even taste the guacamole. The taco was just drenched in the juice and fat from the meat which was not particularly enjoyable. In the end,  all I could taste in this taco was salt and spice. Maybe I got a bad taco or came on a bad day? Hard to say whether I would want to come back and try again though...","I was going to write this review on English but there is a lot of that so I'm writing on Spanish. No hay mucho que decir de estos tacos que no se haya dicho en otros reviews así que lo voy a mantener corto y simple pero con mucho amor.Como decimos en México, estos tacos están huérfanos, que quiere decir esto? Que estos tacos no tienen madre, yo soy de Monterrey y estos tacos es lo mas cercano al sabe de mi tierra. Los mejores tacos en Estados Unidos, el nombre se lo ganaron 100% son los numero 1!!!Si vas al Chelsey Market y no comes en los Tacos numero 1 tírate a Leon, y mejor vete a comer a taco bell. Chavos de Tacos numero 1, síganle con el buen sazon muchas gracias por unos tacos deliciosos!!!","The tacos were indeed good but I did not think they matched the hype or wait. It is possible that reading the other yelp reviews led me to come in with too high expectations. Full disclosure, I am a taco snob.","I had this for the first time a little over a month ago. My girlfriend treated me because we had just come from another spot next to wall street that didn't impress her.So after the walk to Chelsea, I had worked up a small appetite. After her hyping it up to being close to ""real"" Mexican tacos, I was curious on what I've been missing out on.And I must say, the flavor was HITTIN! There was anything overdone. The tacos were a satisfying size but the punch of flavor got me! And I had a drink as well (I forget what it was), but that was HITTIN too! Everything just hit the spot.I would absolutely recommend this place for anyone looking for bomb(really good) tasting tacos with a bunch of flavor. I have to try the new location down next to the oculus soon, that review will be done as soon as I do.","Some very tasty tacos! Line can get very long but the wait is really not that bad. When we got there, the line was past the spices store and it only took us about 20 minutes to order and get our food so, worth the wait. No tables or seats or anything like that. I opted for the cheese shell tacos which is very good and isn't listed on the menu. I also thought that just for changing the type of shell, the price changed a lot. Would still come back and probably just get one as they are fairly heavy.","Stopped by to see what all of the hype is. There was a huge line for it so it must be flipping good. The wait wasn't that bad as ordering food doesn't take too long. There's very limited option, but that's all you really need.I got one Carne Asada taco, one Pollo Asado taco, and one Carne Asada Quesadilla. They had these huge drums with drinks filled and got the Horchata out of curiosity. The quesadilla was essentially just a bigger tacos with cheese so I was disappointed in that. I would have just gotten a variety of quesadillas if I have known that. Besides that, they food is simple, yet amazing to eat. The Horchata is something worth trying as well if you like the taste of cinnamon. Definitely will be dropping by again for my taco cravings in the future.",Los Tacos No.1
79,The place looks gloomy from outside and inside. Waiter/host is rude and looks like he doesn't care about clients.Burgers are overrated. Bacon was tasty.Would never stay at the place if my kids wouldn't be hungry and exhausted to walk more.,This was probably my worst burger + fries eating experience. I waited 45 minutes for a shitty burger and cold fries that looked like they had been sitting out all day. Not to mention zero apologies for the delay in food wait time. The server's friends were also all sitting eating/drinking next to us and were being so obnoxiously loud it was uncomfortable.It had good reviews so I was surprised that the service was so lousy and I left feeling honestly sick to my stomach. Will not ever be eating there again...,"I didn't like this place. First of all, they have false advertising and I'm thinking whether I should sue them for that. I love burgers with pineapple and I ordered a benson burger just because I saw a pineapple in the ingredients description (u can see it in the attached picture). When I got my burger there was no pineapple. I asked the server if they forgot to put it in and he said :""there is no actual pineapple, it's just some pineapple sauce they put on the bun"".  I didn't taste any pineapple sauce either. I got so frustrated about that. However instead of an apology, they sarcastically offered me more pineapple sauce on the side. After that another server was helping us with our orders. I have no idea why they switched, but whatever. So, she was extremely rude. She would always ask if we need something else. It looked like she wanted us to leave so bad. She also was staring at us, so weird. P.s. their burger buns taste horrible.",How did I miss this place?  It's right on Essex and Houston and I'm in the area a lot.  I'm glad I found it last week.Great burgers.  Great salads.  Great craft beer selection.  I sent back again over the weekend and had the avocado smash with was also great.  Recommended!!!,"This is grunge at its best- right on the corner of Essex & E. Houston. We'd finished with an errand in the LES and decided to stay put, grab a quick bite then continue with our night. Online menu was a nice trade off with Salads, Burgers, Flatbreads, etc. Plus hubs liked the idea of their Craft beer selection. When we first walked by Benson's, I just looked at the surface and wasn't sure if I wanted to stay or leave. But I'm guilty and I'm human. I'll leave it at hubs wanted in. Benson's small with enough seating up at the bar, couple of high table-benches and another couple of regular table seating with tile art and paintings. Service was nice immediately and our guy worked his socks off between bartending and serving. Although Benson's menu is filled with a lot of good bites, I really wanted to sink my teeth in their Black Bean Veggie Burger and hubs enjoyed the Bleu Cheese burger with Sautéed onions and Arugula. When everything was said and done, hubs and I had a chill time here and I had a change of heart. Plus their Spotify Indie/Funk play list was real cool. There's nothing fancy about Benson's. In fact, it's the hole-in-the-wall atmosphere (plus food) that'll make me gravitate to this local spot again. Our burgers had major flavor- and I'm sure the rest of their menu is just as tasty. Plus I can tell they put their food right in the forefront.","I went here to watch the second half of the Women's World Cup just looking for a seat and TV, but I was pleasantly surprised with Benson's! There was only one TV but about 10 people watching the game in a great environment. I had the avocado smash ($15) which was filled with avocado, poached eggs, and greens! So yummy and much more food than most overpriced avo toast. I also enjoyed their draft stout for $6. I would most definitely come back if I'm ever in the area. Our server/bartender Dave was wonderful! Don't forget to check-in for 10% off!!",Benson's NYC
80,Came in on a quick lunch break to try to get a appetizer and a glass of wine a before me was a lunch menu as I try to order from it I was told it is too late for that he went to get me a dinner menu came back 60 seconds with the dinner menu once I was ready to order he never checked back on me after sitting there for 10 minutes I finally got up and left. The other bartender checked on the woman next to me and the new bartender coming to come in and checked on the same woman next to me leaving me there holding a menu in my hand hungry angry and disappointed.no punctuation Talk to text run on sentence.,"Dear God I wanted to love this place. I really did.Aesthetically this place is nailing it. That's the end of the good news. Sorry. So here's the set up; full dining room downstairs with full bar complete with a large patio with probably 20-30 tables if my memory is correct. The upstairs is the perfect patio but without food, a clean floor, an occupation limitation, or class. So what exactly does it have? Glad you asked. The upstairs is perfect for waiting 7 years for a drink, getting elbowed by hideously pretentious finance guys, sketchy frat brothers who now work in ""marketing"" and watching excellent sunsets with an incredible view of Jersey... which is totally why we all pay so much in rent in this city right?! To look at Jersey. I don't know who told the investors that a view of Jersey be incredible but they were lied to. It's not that great. We went upstairs to wait for our table because online it says you can't make a reservation, but then found out one was needed for the downstairs. So we had an hour to kill but thought the food may be worth it. After killing half an hour waiting for a bottle of rosé while the up and coming instamodel ignored us, we hunkered down on the balcony and watched the sunset until our table was ready. The charcuterie left a lot to be desired and our risotto was terribly overdone. All in all, real lousy experience for the price point and the schlep. If you just want to get slowly hammered and be hit on by the creeps you swiped left in college... this is YOUR joint. I can't even describe to you how many loud sorority girls were here acting like they were at a college party. It was disgusting. Great spot for sunset, everything else was a waste. Four stars because I feel super bad for the owners who probably imagined their restaurant having a classier feel.","After a no such a good experience at City Vineyard, I was contacted by Alexandria, one of the managers at the restaurant.She apologized for the mishap and invited us back for a dinner on them. The experience, staff , food and service were excellent.I would definitely be back, not only for the obvious, the food and view, but for the way they handled unsatisfied customersThanks City Vineyard!",The customer service here goes above and beyond. We came for dinner on a random Tuesday afternoon and we ordered one of each flatbread and one burger. We opted to order a bottle of wine between the four of us.One of the flatbreads came out wrong and they offered us a whole bottle of wine for FREE for the inconvenience. We weren't expecting anything and the mistake was taken care of within minutes so it was a surprise to us that they would do so.Food was good and then we went upstairs to grab some more drinks. Bartender was quick to give us suggestions when we didn't know what to order.,"A solid outdoor hang out for a date or group of friends. The views are incredible and being right by the water is a really good change of pace.The rooftop only serves drinks, and I sometimes find myself wishing you could have light bites up there as opposed to sitting downstairs for food, but it's not a dealbreaker. The rooftop gets super packed on the weekends in the summer, but I've always managed to grab a table or at least find a place to stand along the railing.My big downfall with this place is how expensive the drinks are. Beers/cider will cost you $8-$10, a glass of wine is closer to $12, and they have a few other options for ~$14. Pricey. But the views are great and it's a chill place to bring friends... so it keeps me coming back.","City Vineyard has the potential to be great, but it needs some improvements. The view of the Hudson River and the New Jersey Skyline is phenomenal, service is great and our server Flor did a good job. The manager was quick to seat us and very polite.Improvements/ Comments:For a place named City Vineyard,  the on- tap wines which aren't cheap at $14-$15 (Cabernet and Chardonnay) are very mediocre. Sorry - but I can buy better wine for $10 a bottle at home. The only exception was the ice cold Prosecco - which was nice and cold and a good pour. The fish tacos were flavorful but served cold.The view inland from my chair of the large screen TV showing ads for CV events and a second TV showing a fake fish tank, and the sloppy  haphazard serving bar view should all be hidden from view for patrons facing indoors from the patio. The oysters were good and well shucked but were presented with no little fork, and no explanation of type of east coast oyster (attention to detail- hello?) The mussels and bread had great flavor but many oysters did not open and should have been pulled from the potEspresso served luke warm at $4.50 for a double shot. As I said, potential- the management should take a trip up to Half Moon Restaurant in Dobbs Ferry to see how it's done right.",City Vineyard
81,"I went to Bubby's for brunch and ordered the Pancake Flight. This was a set of 3 pancakes. They were all large and fluffy, though heavier than I would've liked. The pancake with blueberries on it was tasty, though the one with banana and walnuts was underwhelming because there were only two banana chunks and a couple of walnuts. The third pancake, which had strawberries and Nutella on it, was not much better than an ordinary pancake.The main issue with Bubby's is the price. These 3 pancakes were $25! That's over $8 for each of those not-so-special pancakes! Now you're probably wondering why I decided to get them in the first place if I knew the price, and I'll admit, it was mainly because I had seen pictures of these beautiful flapjacks here on Yelp. They were indeed photogenic, but ultimately not as tasty as I had hoped. In addition, their payment system is a bit sneaky, since when you sign to pay, the system has already chosen a 20% tip (not obviously upon first seeing the screen). This led me to unknowingly pay them this large tip (partly due to my own carelessness which I now regret), which they did not deserve given the average quality of service.Overall, if you're in desperate need for an Instagram photo, then you might want to come to Bubby's for their pancakes. Otherwise, I'd either order something less expensive from the menu or choose a different restaurant altogether. I'm not saying the pancakes were bad; I'm just saying that they're not worth $25.",This was my first time at the high line location. I have been to Bubby's Tribeca before and that location was much better than this one. The complaint I had here was with the service. Our waitress didn't do a good job waiting our table. She didn't check on us about our food. She didn't bother to refill my coffee even after asking for it. I understand the place is busy but that's their job to be attentive towards the customers. I never tip less but after this behavior I had to cut the tip. Food was alright.,Food looked good but bartender didn't like us very much. Got a cocktail and it was ok. Nothing special,I really liked the food and the service I absolutely love pancakes and bubbys hit the spot I'm going back this coming weekend,"I'm so glad a friend recommended this spot. A warning upfront - it is pretty crowded on weekends for brunch, so you will probably have a wait. Tables of two were only waiting about 10-15 mins, but larger groups were waiting over an hour. Come early!That said, the food was amazing. The biscuits were great, and the pancake flight is such a great idea (you get three pancakes with different topics). My friend got an omelet, and she was really happy too. It's crowded, but the service was very attentive.","Allergy Alert:Brought a party of 4 to Bubby's High Line. I explained my shellfish allergy and was told that nothing was safe to eat due to cross contamination during food preparation. I appreciate the server's honesty as it could be life saving for some. This level of candor should be the norm but unfortunately, it's not. I watched the rest of my party enjoy their burgers - they all said their decent sized portions were well prepared and tasty. Hit on rating is the lack of food options for someone with a rather common allergy. I encourage ownership to reconsider having a second fryer and modifying the food prep process.",Bubby's High Line
82,Amazing steak and chicken. You cant top the original. If yoi dont like seafood come here.,"Pros: Fairly dependable. A nice little spot in the hectic Soho & West Village area. Cons: A bit tight and pricey. Overall: It's part of the blue ribbon group, you know what you are getting and paying for","Don't believe the hype. This place is a 2 star restaurant. Nice night, but insanely hot in the restaurant. I was told it was an industry spot, hence the late hours. Who the hell wants to get out of a kitchen and go sweat? Not me. Bread and whipped butter complimentary was good. The salt and pepper shrimp had chewy, over cooked shrimp with no salt and pepper flavor; only some soy like sauce to mask the chewy shrimp. The perrogis steamed were a horrible mistake; despite a recommendation from the server. They were limp and not cooked enough. Wouldn't of mattered as the not quite fresh cheese overwhelmed the taste making the unappetizing texture a secondary concern. The sea bass special on first bite was great; everything you expect from sea bass. But in eating more it was also a little chewy with a fishy taste. Seems ""special"" means trying to dump product here. It was well covered up with a solid amount of butter making it seemingly not that much different from normal naturally buttery sea bass. Overall I would never go back here and can't imagine what these reviews are for.","Great place. The food was excellent. Picked a wide  variety on the menu: fried chicken, lobster, pu pu platter. bone marrow, steak, oysters Rockefeller. They were able to accommodate our party of nine (including my 3 grandchildren) and were extremely attentive.Everything was so darn tasty!Would definitely go back.Note: I didn't like the marrow, but that's just me.","The Original - and Still Going Strong!I can't believe I have never written a review for one of our  favorite NYC restaurants. My wife and I have been going to Blue Ribbon on Sullivan street for twenty years. We love the late night hours, typically going after theater, as we did last night, or after a concert at one of the Greenwich Village jazz clubs that we love.We always start with  a dozen oysters. Perfectly shucked -- no burst bellies and impeccably clean and fresh. What goes better with oysters ?? Champagne! Another perennial favorite, the bone marrow. And last night they had a wonderfully tender and flavorful braised short rib.Service is always friendly and efficient and never hovering at this lovely SoHo spot.",AMAZING. Went here when my parents were in town and we had an incredible time. The food was amazing and their bread was delicious. I loved their oysters. They do a great job selecting a wines too. All the beverages ordered at our table were incredible. What really made it a top notch experience was our server. It was sarcastic and funny all at the right moments. He truly made it an exceptional time. I'd definitely recommend anyone trying this spot out!,Blue Ribbon Brasserie - SoHo
83,Ah... we returned with much higher expectations this time. And now of course I have to unfortunately take back everything I previously said. This place has gone way downhill. I no longer consider it a legitimate BBQ contender in NYC or anywhere else.,"As an addendum, the turkey breast was perfectly moist but took an expected backseat to the spare ribs and brisket in savoriness.","Another visit revealed a more luscious iteration of the beef rib; everything else maintained their consistent quality.  As leftovers the next day, the spare rib, brisket (most) and beef rib were still moist and satisfying.","Omg, talk about game changing BBQ!I came on a Tuesday with the fam because I heard during the weekends this place is packed. It was fairly quiet, but there were still a lot of people coming, and as it got later there were actually items selling out!We got a bit of everything: beef rib, pulled pork, brisket, and sausage. Sides were beans with burnt ends, collard greens with bacon, cole slaw, and corn bread. Oh boy, there was not one thing on that plate we didn't like! Everything was so well cooked and flavorful. My personal fav was that beef rib, I higgggghly recommend!!!!!There is also a bar in the same area so we got some cocktails and beers that perfectly paired with our meal.If you are in or near Brooklyn and you have a hankering for some BBQ, this is a MUST!","I have mixed feelings about this place. First, the inside is a bit ""smokey""...hey that comes with the territory and is what they do, but if that kind of stuff bothers you, or bothers your eyes, etc... then consider that.Next, the food.  I've been here once before on a weekend, and it's crowded.  Again, sometimes I travel with people who don't want to wait.  That was a problem on my weekday, mid-day visit recently.However, I just wasn't wild about my pulled pork sandwich.  With the slaw mixed in and the juices, I really couldn't taste the pork. (it tasted like butter to me)  It's almost too ""creamy"".  I'll get it just naked next time.   The other thing I was looking forward to was the potato salad.   This is more like ground up mashed potatoes that are cold, with a kick of spice.  Not what I was expecting and the consistency I just don't like.   I'd go with beans next time.In general, I should probably be thankful to have my taste buds challenged from the norm, but I thought, if this is supposed to be ""comfort food"", it's not giving me any comfort.  That's just me.Anyway, the staff is friendly and efficient, but overall, I'm going to need to re-visit before I'd recommend it to others.","First of all, I cook meat myself. I grill it, I smoke it, I kebab it. I've enjoyed a couple of Dutch oven roasts. I've got my butcher on speed dial haha. Anyway, I'm not a pro but I think I know meat.Now I know lines too. Grew up in Russia. But this one was WTFL. Way too fnckiug long. That's subjective. But objectively it really built up the hype. And honestly disappointed. Though I'm all about brisket. The other meats we tried were ok, my point is I won't judge those, BUT THE BRISKET WAS OVERCOOKED.And the bill was definitely not a pleasant surprise.Enjoy!",Hometown Bar-B-Que
84,"Third visit back to this restaurant tonight - left very disappointed. Not only were we seated in the downstairs sports bar area (despite us both being dressed up) instead of the more intimate space upstairs, but the service was subpar (took me a long time to even flag down a waiter, who checked on us maybe once the whole meal), they gave me still water when I requested sparkling, the burger was on the very salty side, and the octopus (a dish I order every where it is available) was by far the most disappointing I've had in nyc. Please refer to photo. Incredibly dry, therefore overly chewy texture. I had half a piece and couldn't have anymore. Due to tonight's experience, I am updating this review. Truly a letdown.",Had a nice grilled cheese and tomato soup along with an earl grey tea.  It was good but overpriced for what it was.,"This rustic, dark wood interior gem is a must stop if your in the area. The food is excellent and they have bottle, canned and draft beers of all varieties. This stop I tied the Golden Road Mango Cart. Awesome...  I also had the French Onion soup. The soup was flavorful and full on sliced onion and bubbly cheese. The burger was decent. Not a bad place for manhattan if you're in the area.","This is another pre-game Ipic spot. We came Friday afternoon for a quick bite to eat and a drink, before the movie. We were in somewhat of a rush and the waitress accommodated us by putting a rush on the food....very much appreciated. The decor is my type of scene, it's rustic, stylish and dark. Definitely has that Good fella vibes, if you know what I mean. We were seated at the bar upstairs, but had but a fleeting glimpse of the basement cellar bar downstairs, which intrigued us enough to decide to come back after the movie. We didn't have a chance to, however I will love to see what their brunch has to offer for It's definitely a place I will be bringing a group of friends for food and drinks. Last thing, there our now two places where I can't recommend enough the Lobster mac n cheese. Tradepost is on that list, for sure, delicious!","Came here super randomly on a Thursday after having the week from absolute hell. My fiancé and I sat outside and took advantage of the great happy hour while we could...if you're a basic b*tch like me, you'll LOVE to know that they do $8 aperol spritzs and I'm not kidding, it was the perfect spritz. I hate when bartenders use too much aperol or you can't taste even a hint of the orange rind but this was PERFECT. Our waiter was also super friendly and nice - offered us a happy hour discount even after it was a few minutes past 7. Ordered the pepperoni pizza to share which was also perfect sharing size if you're not starving. Pepperoni was YUM.MY. It started to rain so we moved to the bar inside and had a few drinks there where the bartenders were super friendly and ready to take our order almost immediately desire being swamped!","Dining in the Financial District stirs up images of dimly lit gastropubs lined with rich mahogany where traders and businessmen spend their happy hours after the markets close talking industry and such.The Trading Post lives up to the image of your prototypical FiDi bar: a great selection of Whiskey, standard gastropub fare, and of course- a dimly lit atmosphere.I had a late night dinner of Fried Oysters and the Espresso Rubbed Flat Iron Steak. For both dishes the accompanying sauces were the highlight. The chimichurri with my steak was one of the better ones I've had.With a meal that came with Wall Street prices, I didn't find the Post to be a great value for dinner however the bottomless brunch would interest me for a return visit if I'm ever back in the neighborhood on a weekend.",Trading Post
85,"Dear 5ive Spice,This is not a NY deli/cab. Please pay for Spotify premium. Also, please lower the bar stools. We are all hunched over and I can barely reach my bowl, and I'm only 5'6,"" the national average. Otherwise I really like your Pho.","Came here on a Saturday afternoon with my friend. Two waitress led us to our seat and gave us our menus. I love the chill music that was played.I ordered vermicelli, pho and a coffee. The vermicelli had a portion but they could have provided more fish sauce. There was more salad than there was the noodle. The pho was very flavorful. The viet coffee I ordered was a little bland. Compared to other pho spots, the coffee at this spot was not worth it. It does not taste authentic.",I first came here when I was suffering from a head cold and was craving some pho to help out. The place is small and personable with a quick staff. The food is always on point and the prices are fair.,"This week I went back to 5ive Spice after having a good experience a few weeks ago. After my second visit this has become my favorite restaurant on 5th Ave.I had the grilled corn and chicken pho. The pho hit the spot with perfectspicing, tender chicken and soft tasty noodles. The service was again friendly, helpful and quick.","Myself and a friend who both live in the neighborhood ate here today. Several times a month we get together for lunch and we said today, we wanted to try a place we never ate at before.Between the two of us we have tried most of the places on 5th Ave. and some how missed this place. It was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I had the brussel sprouts and pork chop sandwich. My friend had their classic sandwich which had ham and pork. Everything was nicely spiced, tasty an extremely satisfying. The bill, for both of us, was $23 and at any other restaurant in the neighborhood this would be the price for one of us. The place is adorable,  comfortable and close to everything.The staff was friendly, professional and helpful in addition to getting us our food extremely quickly. I cannot wait to go back and want to try everything on the menu.","their pho is more sweet then savory. you can get a better bowl on canal st . but their pork chop tacos are great , a bit overpriced but it's the rich part of brooklyn",5ive Spice
86,"We were staying at the hotel and try to come for Breakfast and Dinner. Both times, the restaurant was 1/4 full and we were told there was a wait but Opentable had slots available on their site.On the second day, we decided to eat breakfast. I ordered the avocado toast and country breakfast. The food was good but over priced (it's inside the hotel) and the service was very slow. It took 30mn to get our food. They forgot one of our drink orders and brought out the wrong food.Osprey is good if you're staying in the hotel and don't want to venture outside and if you're not in a rush.","This place is all about location, which is truly worth coming to. Brooklyn bridge area is beautiful. Restaurant itself is overrated and simply not good. Service deserves -2 stars worst service ever. My recommendations is... get coffee next door don't waist $ here",The atmosphere is great and I love the location.Cauliflower dish and beets salad were delicious.But do not order steak. It was too hard and not edible. Chicken was ok but nothing special. Desserts were fantastic.I will come here for drinks and desserts not for the main courses.,"The Osprey and Harriet's Rooftop & Lounge at 1 Hotel hosted a Yelp Elite Event here. Had such an A-mazing night!First got to experience the beautiful city views at Harriet's Rooftop! Sat at a cozy reserved area near the pool. Cool attentive staff who greeted us and frequently checked to see if any of us needed another round of drinks.  My pick for cocktail of the event was Noon Glow! The magenta passionfruit color cocktail was a  perfect pick-me-up for the event. Led to Osprey for dinner. But before that we got a little intro to the Osprey outdoor seating area where we had some white wine and finger foods. The outdoor area was nicely lit and the Osprey Chef Denevin came out to show his excitement in hosting the Yelp Elite event. Mingling was especially fun with some fresh tuna tartar on chips and bbq buns. Loved the carrots on the bbq buns that made eat each bite crunchy and summery.Dinner seating decor were perfect with specially printed Yelp Elite event course menu presentably set on the plates. The Osprey general manager Sterling came over to each of us to give selections of the wine for the night which I thought was a special touch of hospitality. Not to mention the dinner course was all soo good! Perfectly cooked scallops with chorizo. I thought the the squid ink tuile was a great aesthetic touch to the dish. The slight bitterness of the tuile complemented the mouth filling scallops. Fossil Farm NY strip was cooked perfect medium rare on a bed of wasabi spinach. Amazing tangy and smoky dish.  Cavatelli was also so flavorful it could have been its own main entree. It was a good mix of flavors that worked so well together and together with the scallops and NY strip. Im so glad they brought these dishes out all at once! Dessert came in a cute oval cup - the spoon that came with it surprizingly scooped an even amount of the parfait like stacked mousse dessert. Not overpowering sugar load but just the right amount of sweetness to end the course. The Coconut Passionfruit was a my pick for the night with slight crunch from first layer of breading to the zesty coconut lemon mousse topped with mango sorbet and passionfruit.Such a memoriable night at Harriet's and Osprey with great group of Yelpers. And ofcourse two thumbs up to the Harriet's and Osprey team!***Came to Osprey another occasion for lunch with co-workers. Awesome large portions! My favorite was the brussel sprouts cooked perfectly. Hen of woods again did not disappoint! Had the Seafood Cobb as entree and added a side of french fries. Portion on the picture is half - I shared the plate with a co-worker due to size. Super colorful dish with fresh seafood assortment next to avocado, crispy bacon pieces, etc. The mix of flavors were great especially with the fries. Planning to be back for another dinner!","Have been to 1 Hotel for their roof top bar several times since they opened and the service is excellent. It's cozy and of course, the view is spectacular. Cocktails are really delicious too. The manager up there and his staff give such amazing service.Also went to The Osprey for lunch today for the first time with my family.  The menu is so so much better now that Denevin Miranda is Head Chef there.  Thank you Elvis Escobar - you and your staff treated us so well. We will be back with more friends and family for sure!  Cannot wait to go for dinner next time! Excited to see what delicious food will be on menu.","Such a gorgeous place to dine at! You can easily come during the light or dark hours and be  astonished by the beauty and atmosphere of this place! When I walked in, it was still light outside and the place looked like the upscaled backyard with quite and romantic feeling. When I was leaving and all the lights and lamps were on, it looked like a magical fairytale. Fresh salad with heirloom tomatoes and peaches is a mix I've never tried before and I'm sure if I order it somewhere else, no other place will be able to top it! Fried shaved Brussels sprouts with sliced almonds in sweet sauce were to fight for! This will be my family dish to prepare for all the future gatherings! I just wish there was a little less oil added to it.Hen of the woods is an amazing way to prepare mushrooms and keep thinking about it long after you are done eating it....still thinking about... yep, still thinking.Cavatelli what a way to prepare pasta! I stopped eating pasta for a while now and just try it sometimes, if someone at my table orders it, because all the restaurant make it so simple and boring that I regret ordering as soon as I try it. This pasta with pea pesto and a light mint and lemon aftertaste is something to dream about when thinking about the ideal pasta meal. NY strip, again I haven't ordered NY steak for year because no matter what restaurant makes it, it is always a good piece of meat..., but so boring! The osprey takes NY steak to the next level with wasabi spinach and puffed buckwheat. Dessert Campfire s'mores and coconut passion fruit were just big enough and diverse enough to satisfy the sweet tooth and not force yourself to eat more than you should.",The Osprey
87,I went twice and it was quite inconsistent.The first time was seriously impressive from a creativity and flavor standpoint.The second time was not great. It seemed like the dishes were rushed and didn't taste that good.I hate inconsistency for restaurants in NYC. There are too many sure options to waste $60 on a failed experiment.,Yo this place is so fire. The moment I ate the berry crumble I had to go outside and take a fat hit of my vape and chuck some clouds,"Easily five stars for food, alcohol, service, ambiance ... except the cake was fucking dry. So definitely eat here, but get a glass of wine (or some Tony's/Archie's) for dessert instead.","Wow is all I could say, this spot is the real deal, food is amazing. Small menu but definitely on point, try everything and drink everything.  Eat, drink and drink some more","This place is absolutely unmatched to other restaurants in the greater NYC area. Incredibly friendly and responsive staff and the food is exquisite, unique, and insanely tasty! Secondly, the restaurant is conveniently located just off the Morgan stop on the L (30 second walk) and close to a lot of cool bars in the area.To top it all off, the place is not expensive at all and the dining atmosphere is top notch. Hats off to these guys.","There is a solitary neon sign marking literally the only thing open on this block. You will have to struggle with the stuck door to get in but that earns you the right to sit at the bar and watch everyone else struggle as well. This beautifully designed and friendly restaurant named after the owners dog is by far and away my favourite eatery in the entirety of bushwick. I sat at the bar with friends, having a somewhat flux number to our party they accommodated us as every turn, we began our journey with the muscles, I cannot overstate how wonderful this dish was, it has a velvety cream sauce with chunks of chorizo that is so good I would re-dip every bite before eating it.We followed that up with the house bread (three different spreads ranging from fig jam to honey butter), a lively green bean salad so fresh it brought us back from a food coma before we dove into a pork pasta so good that a gentleman at the end of the bar said it was better then his Sicilian mother's before apologizing profusely to her. I cant help it if it is true.",Otis
88,"The restaurant itself was great, loved the decor, the food was quite delicious (save for one aspect), and the service was wonderful. I read the reviews and decided to order the highly-rated eel bowl for lunch. My one-star review is that somehow everyone failed to mention how the eel came with sharp tiny prickly little bones in it??? I did notice the eel was a little uncomfortable to chew on when I was at the restaurant but thought maybe that was my imagination. I also didn't want to seem like a bother complaining so I mostly ate the rice, egg, and the mushrooms (which were fantastic btw!). I took home the eel leftovers and it wasn't until the next day when I tried reheating it that I discovered it was just full of tiny, prickly bones! Definitely a choking hazard!!! Either way, be warned that there will be bones in the eel bowl so eat at your own risk. Very disappointed that I paid $25 for a dish full of bones.",Girlfriend and I came in expecting much much better.  The place is small and a little crowded but this review is mainly about the food.  Quite simply: bland.  The spicy tofu appetizer was basically falling apart.  The entrees had no taste.  We're huge fans of flavor and this place unfortunately lacked it.,"The vegetable curry was good and very filling. My friend's katsu don also looked great. We came at 1pm on Saturday and there was only one other party and a patron sitting at the bar. The restaurant has dim lighting even in the daytime but the sunlight from the window was enough. It would probably look cozy and romantic at night, but seating isn't the most comfortable with hard wooden benches and metal chairs. Otherwise the waiters were polite and attentive.","Environment: There are around 20 tables. They have their doors and windows opened (can be chilly~). Also, your food may cool down quickly so make sure you eat fast or just stay away with the windows. It is pretty dark inside so not the best place for photos : | They open at 5:30 PM so no need to wait if you arrived before 6. FYI they don't take reservation. Katsu Curry (Pork) [9/10]: You can't go wrong with katsu curry. There are two types of meat - pork and chicken. The portion may look pretty small in the photo but it's enough for an adult. I think the pork was a little bit dry but you can still get the crispiness outside and tenderness inside. Una-Tama Don [10/10]: My Favorite! Unlike traditional eel over rice, the eel here came with onions, eggs, and mushrooms, which made the dish so flavorful. I felt there were much more toppings than rice. It can be a little bit sweet. But please give it a try if you like to have everything in one bowl. Black Miso Chicken [8/10]: There are two types of chicken for appetizers - kara-aged fried chicken & black miso chicken. For some reason, we ended up choosing this latter one. We were told black miso is also fried chicken, just with more black sesame sauce on the top. Turns out, the chicken was teriyaki style. I am not a big fan of this. The meat was still juicy and tender tho. There are lots of options for dons and appetizers on their menu. A solid choice if you are starving for Japanese dons in East Village and don't want to wait for too long.","Oh my goodness! Benemon is a gem. I came here on a Friday night around 8pm and waited around 20 minutes to get seated. I really enjoyed the open window, dark interior with candles all around, and the entire atmosphere of the place! Great for warm nights.Started off with the Kara-Age Fried Chicken which was amazing with the perfect amount of crunch and tenderness/juice from the chicken underneath. It is definitely fried the perfect amount. The Oyako Don was also so good. All the ingredients were so fresh and the chicken was cooked perfectly! The only thing that it was missing was kimchi but that's just the Korean in me speaking. I usually don't drink sake but we opted for the souden sake which was pretty good!My experience here was irreplaceable and I would love to return to try more of their menu! Service was also very attentive-- which is great.","The food was aromatic and tasty! Great selection of sake. Our table consisted of meat eaters, vegetarians and a diabetic. The service was great because they were really accommodating with our groups preferences/limitations. We were a group of 6 and walked in with no reservation on a Friday night. We waited for about 15 minutes and when most of the group had arrived we were seated.What stood out in the food was the sauces. It really made the dishes tasty and worth coming back for more. The sake selection is also quite extensive and I will definitely be back to try out the others! In the appetizers the Tofu Fire and the Pork Belly was amazing! Also worth checking out are the Edamame Peperoncino, the Fried Chicken and the Anchovy Fried Potatoes. For the entrees we got the Chicken Katsu Curry (curry on the side), the Shrimp & Eel Tempura and the Veggie Tan Don Sake we tried:  Souden and Kagiya Namazume(Sorry no photos because we were too hungry to take photos! )",Benemon
89,"Kong Sihk Tong:Recommendations:1. French Toast with Condensed Milk2. Chicken Wings with Grapefruit Honey SauceOther dishes are also authentic!Authentic, cheap and cash only",Imitation shark fin soup 3.5 starsI came here for the Imitation shark fin soup but it is kind of disappointing. An attempt was made to thicken the soup by adding corn starch. But the corn starch was added directly to the hot soup resulting in lumps and the rest of the soup is still too thin. I would suggest serving with sesame oil. Overall Cha Chan Tan make this soup betterSatay beef noddle with enoki mushroom 4.5 starsI like the overall balance of noddle and beef and vegetables ratio. Nice touch with pieces of pineapples,"Kong Sihk Tong is your typical Hong Kong style cafe and they serve all the classics - baked fried rice (or spaghetti), cheesy ramen, chow fun, butter toast, you name it. Too bad the food is completely mediocre. I got the baked fried rice with pork chop with black pepper sauce - both the pork and the sauce were disappointing. I would also stay away from the drinks here, if the quality of the Hong Kong milk tea I had is any indication. Also, while the menu is extensive, unfortunately like most other Hong Kong style restaurants, there aren't many options for vegetarians.","An alternative to the cha chan tang at chinatown! They offer cheap Hong Kong style food.They have a lot of the options that cha chan tang offers but a little more variety.We ordered several things like lemon+ honey water, peanut butter rice noodles, imitation shark fin soup, truffle mushroom pasta, curry fish balls.The taste of everything was pretty solid. The truffle pasta was very good with the light truffle taste, smokey bacon, and mushrooms. The peanut butter noodles were another fave as they were cheap and filling, I love the sauce!Service was just ok, wasn't amazing, but they did their jobs!Would definitely come here again and I recommend to anyone around chinatown looking for a cheap filling lunch.","I would call this my spot. I depend on this place for Hong Kong café staples such as hk style milk tea and baked pork chop on rice. I've gotten take out and eaten here by myself.. I recommend it to everyone. this was the first time I took someone to this restaurant thinking they'd love it! But on this busy Sunday afternoon they may have been understaffed and let us slip through the cracks. -A table beside us that ordered riiiight before us was almost done eating before we received our TOAST (we had to ask them to check on it for us)-they ran out of rice noodle roll in mixed sauce -the baked pork chop rice was tough and I bit into EGGSHELL in the rice**iced HK milk tea came right away and was delicious as always***they did give us curry fishballs free because of the wait2 stars because I have a soft spot for this place. I will probably return because I believe it's a one off, just not on the weekends.","The dishes here remind me of my childhood in Hong Kong. In particular, the tomato, beef, and macaroni soup reminds me of when my parents used to take me to breakfast in the neighbourhood 茶餐廳 before going to school. The only thing that is missing is a bottle of warm Vitasoy! We've been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and the breakfast deal is a great value. The dishes here are very authentic and the prices are quite reasonable. It's best to call in your order first before picking up because they can get quite busy. Their Hong Kong style milk tea is strong, just like they do it in Hong Kong. Customer service is good too. The staff speaks English, Cantonese, and Mandarin. This is a go-to restaurant for us.",Kong Sihk Tong 港食堂
90,"Poor service, the servers were rude and not professional . And the food was not even good. Will not recommend",Palak paneer was different and I didn't like it. Daal and chicken tikka masala were good.,"Decent Indian food but I wasn't overly impressed. This Indian food was on the pricey side, and for the quality...I probably would go elsewhere. I can see why it does well on Yelp because the stuff IS well made...just not worth it for me. Five stars for the service. My water was constantly full.",My favorite Indian I've had in NYC so far! Granted I've only been to 3 spots. So delicious and quaint. Not many tables and the servers are so nice and helpful. Chicken tikka masala is always my go-to with some garlic naan. I'll be back!,"Their naaaaaan omg. It's so fluffy and good. We got their garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, and lamb biryani. The garlic naan was delicious. The chicken in the chicken tikka masala was also super tender and flavorful. The lamb biryani was good, but it wasn't my favorite. The lamb was tender, but I don't know if I'd order it again. Definitely ordering their chicken tikka masala and garlic naan again though!! Can't wait to go back and try their other curries.","Great find!  We were at a show at the Mercury Lounge and were looking for something good and quick nearby before we went home.  The service could not have been more attentive or prompt.  Great vegetarian options.  The food was flavorful, just the right amount of heat, and unlike some of the places on 6th street tasted very fresh and made to order, despite how quickly it hit the table.  The gobi Manchurian starter was really delicious.  Very slight criticism in that it's pretty loud.I don't give five star reviews to places I've only visited once, otherwise this would get one.  Next time.",The MasalaWala
91,"At brunch, the only item that caught my fancy was champorado ($9.) Pig & Khao's version of the sweet chocolate porridge was made with long-grain rice instead of sticky rice & had bits of bacon sprinkled on. I like bacon in its pure form, not on or in anything. I was, however, a fan of the heavy-handed pour of condensed milk. The order in which the rest of our meal arrived was odd; we sat with only garlic rice for some time & when our bacon came out, it wasn't crispy like some of us requested, hence more waiting. We're aware that this Filipino-inspired restaurant is not going to make their dishes exactly like our family or our go-to eateries, but one of my brunch partners said the langonisa (pork sausage colored red by annatto seeds) was so far from ""the real thing."" 3.5 stars for the champorado, 2 stars for the taste of everything else. Add to that service that wasn't all-too-warm, & we have no reason to return.",Chef Leah and team kills it at Pig and Khao. Each dish we had was full of flavor and portioned perfectly.,"Pig and Khao is a hot new restaurant in the LES specializing in Southeast Asian cuisine. One of the proprietors is Leah Cohen, a contestant and audience favorite on Top Chef. This has attracted a lot of buzz, along with reports of tasty food. I was psyched to try it.Unfortunately, Pig and Khao is a real disappointment, and it once again affirms eater.com-type hype is often just that. The only standout was the pork belly. They were out of pork leg, which was a bummer. Ribs were oversauced and not particularly exceptional, and the baby octupus was downright disgusting (topped off by unpleasant aesthetic: you ever seen 20 baby octupus heads staring back at you?) Half duck is nicely done, but I've had better at tons of places. Overall, a lot of the food is available in Flushing or Jackson Heights -- or my beloved San Gabriel Valley in LOS ANGELES -- and dressed up for a mainstream clientele. Two other things: there is only one bathroom in the entire space, and it has tables next to it. Imagine being the poor soul trying to eat food while having someone's crotch suddenly appear near your face. It happens because the line just starts getting so long. Pig and Khao also plays deafening ""club"" music, making it difficult to have any real conversation. It's part of an annoying trend from restaurants. We suspected that it's motivated by restaurants' trying to turn over as many tables as possible. Why stay longer if you can't converse? Jokes on them, tho, cause I won't be coming back.","This is more of a 3.5 location to me. A friend chose this place for his birthday, called, and was told that he had a reservation for 12. We get there half an hour early, and we figured we should check in - only to be told they don't take phone reservations. Which is fine - but someone on the staff obviously didn't get that memo. At that point, they told us we would have to wait an hour, so we ambled over to Nitecap for a drink to wait. Luckily, in less than an hour, they managed to squeeze some tables together for us. I'm a fan of strong seasoning, but this is HEAVY. It's delicious, but it's no joke - hydrate well and make sure you get that bomb coconut rice. Our server was an absolute doll and ended up comping quite a few dishes for us, but didn't even say anything - just took them off the receipt!We ordered everything on the menu except the peanuts - everything. next time I'd skip: chicharronwould order with a large group: thai mushroom, octopus paksiw, pork belly adobo, pad cheong see ewcan not resist: corn somtom, coconut rice, sizzling sisig, crispy pataOverall, despite some hiccups, I would definitely come back, but for a select few favorites.","Had a really great dinner here. I had an 8:30PM reservation for Wednesday night but came at 7:30 hoping to get seated earlier. The restaurant was poppin so I couldn't get seated until 8. Also the place was really loud so it was hard to have a conversation, but come for the food.The Khao Soi was not my favorite because the noodles were al dente & there were way more fried wonton noodles than my friend and I would've liked. Get the Pork Belly Adobo! It paired really well with the coconut rice. The sauce + poached egg + rice + pork belly combo made for a delicious bite every time.Lastly we got the halo halo for dessert. It was pretty filling in and of itself and had a good coconut-y flavor. I'm so glad this place exists. Thai + Filipino food in one place = great meal. I would come back to try all the other dishes I didn't get to eat in this visit. This place is family style so bring lots of friends if you can and split everything!","I went to Pig and Khao around 8:30 pm on a Saturday. There was about a 20 minute wait although we were quoted 35 minutes. We were seated at the bar (only reserved seating at the bar, no walk ins/first come first serve).Service was good - we were able to order as soon as we were ready. Food began to arrive as soon as it was ready. We got 3 of the small plates, which were all fairly sizable. In addition, we ordered the Jasmine rice which was extremely large compared to other restaurant rice side portions - 2 people can definitely share for the whole meal. We got the Pork Belly Adobo, Sizzling Sisig, and Chili Pan Mee. The Pork Belly Adobo was just okay - not a lot to the dish besides the meat. The Sizzling Sisig was very good - the meat was seasoned very nicely and it comes out very hot and fresh. The Chili Pan Mee was my favorite dish - the sauce was excellent and is almost like a spicy bolognese with an Asian flair. Overall rally great experience at Pig & Khao!",Pig and Khao
92,"We came to Sunday in Brooklyn after seeing it on Instagram lol. The Yelp reviews seemed promising but overall I wasn't impressed by the flavor or quality of any of the food. I got the avocado toast and the portion size was tiny, bread wasn't great, and the spices were lackluster. The breakfast potatoes were similar, potatoes in most forms taste delicious but it was very bland and even hot sauce didn't help it much. The wait staff was great, and we were seated quickly on a Saturday morning. *Please note they are a cash free restaurant.",Ok...so I really do love the food here( although way too pricey and not reflective of the service provided) but I sadly wont be coming back. Once again the atrocious service is almost comical.I made yet another attempt to have a decent experience at Sunday in Brooklyn unfortunately this one was the worst before it even started. 15 minutes waiting for water and a drink order. No attention... literally one other table outside who was also being ignored. After a total of 20 min I walked across the street to 12 chairs and was greeted and served immediately.  I hoped Sunday in Brooklyn could have possibly gotten their act together...sadly this restaurant practices the polar opposite of hospitality.,"I was conflicted returning here. I have to say the food is excellent but the service is atrocious.  The first time I visited was on a Monday for lunch.  Upon arriving there were 4 empty tables outside that had not been cleaned or reset. The host was MIA for about 10 minutes, servers passed yet did not offer a greeting or any assistance.  When the host finally arrived he let us know it would be a 20 minute wait, despite the restaurant being empty and  vacant unturned tables outside...After pointing that out to him we were sat immediately.  The second time was on a Saturday for brunch...We were told it was a 90 minute wait. We stood waiting outside watching table after table finish and leave yet no one turned the tables..5, 10, 15 minutes go by three tables outside haven't been cleaned or sat. Same for inside...on the way to use the restroom upstairs there were about 10 tables that were available. We decided to grab seats at the bar, the bartender was unwelcoming and almost bothered to have to take another order.Possibly they were understaffed that day...but it seemed more like a very clueless C team staff. Drinks weren't consistent between visits  , unbalanced and sloppy incorrect garnishes. I would hope for $120 for two on brunch would come with knowledgeable stellar service..sadly no. I dont think I'll return. Hit up egg shop, slightly better prices, food and drinks are solid and the service is worlds better.","Finally got into Sunday in Brooklyn and now I know why. The food was on point and the service was great! It has a great environment setting and unique cocktails as well. I came here for brunch and would definitely come back again (if its not a 2 hour wait haha). I do want to check out the dinner menu too eventually.Things I ordered:- Avocado Toast / Whipped Ricotta, Toasted Seeds- Smoked Salmon Tartine/ Whole Wheat Sourdough, Everything Spice Creme Fraiche, Cucumber, Tomato, Capers, Onions - Skillet Potatoes","I was SUPER excited to come here for breakfast or brunch.  My wife loves pancakes so I had heard about it on a couple lists of places to go.  We both had a light morning on this Friday so decided to check it out ahead of the normal avalanche of people on the weekends waiting for brunch in W'burg.  We immediately noticed that the menu was fairly limited but had enough for us.  She ordered the pancake and I got the egg sandwich with bacon.  She got a chai latte and I got a drip coffee.The food arrived fairly quickly which was cool.  I looked at my sandwich and immediately noticed the bun was a bit burned which turned me off but I decided not to complain.Her dish looked pretty solid and she was excited to try it since the person next us had one too.  I have seen my wife try a TON of pancakes so I was excited about this one.  She took a bite and didn't really have a reaction.  We kept talking.  I had to ask her how it was.  ""Good"" she responded but not great. Oh well.  I tried.  She did like the butter which she described as ""amazing.""I LOVE bacon egg and cheese sandwiches and go all around the city to find the best one.  I have tried basic ones from the bodega or bagel shop and I have had high end options.  This sandwich was easily the most expensive I have ever had.  It was like $15 or $16 which is absurd.  I bit into it and the bun was definitely overcooked (see photo below) which immediately ruined the experience for me.  I expect a brioche bun to be tender a fluffy.  This was hard and almost crusty.  Booooo.  Finally, the bacon was greasy, really too porky and really salty.  Honestly, I have had better BEC at the local corner store for less than $5.The decor was nice and we enjoyed the open kitchen and layout.  That was really the best part about the spot.  The bar also looked cool.  We may consider coming back for that but likely not for the food.  We waited nearly 10 minutes for our check and I had to go to the hostess to pay directly because our waiter was nowhere to be found.  Whatever.    The bill with tip was nearly $60 for a pretty mediocre meal.  Give me a BREAK!!!!!  Sixty BUCKS!!!  For that???? No way we are coming back to eat here.  Seriously, save your money and time.","I usually tend to only write reviews for places I really like. Rarely for those I don't. I feel the need to write a review here as I feel the reviews don't match the quality of the food. It's simply one warning, one data point I wish I would've had before going here.I went here with my 14-yr-old daughter for brunch. We were both excited to eat here based on the reviews.In short, the food across the board was very average. My daughter and I were both disappointed. We ordered the pancakes, the breakfast sandwich and the side potatoes.On a good note, the atmosphere is great, the service was very solid and food presentation was good.However, the food itself was bland. It was not bad. It just wasn't good. I would never go back or recommend it to anybody else. There are just too many other good places to try.",Sunday in Brooklyn
93,"Last winter, I met someone that ended up getting pretty close to. Fast forward to this past summer, it was her birthday. I wasn't feeling all that well and it fell around pride weekend so I wasn't all that prepared for her big day. However, I wanted us to have a day where we were dressed up and having a nice little brunch so I picked this place. The name seemed familiar so I decided to give this place a try. It took us forever to order because the waiter took his time and more. Not only that, I asked for a napkin a so many times that if I asked again, I would have been begging. Also, I told them that it was my friend's birthday and not a cake or a plate with writing on it. To be honest, I am not sure how the food tasted or what I got because I am still hung up on the service. I heard there was another location in the village that was better... Maybe I will think about giving it a shot, but I do recall not liking the brunch menu so I may go for dinner... Overall, disappointing experience. Solid No for me.","The thing that this bistro has going for it is that it gives you an authentic Parisian tourist trap bistro experience. The food and service was mediocre and the offerings were way over priced; but, you can get a table by the sidewalk. Just like in Paris!",See my review on Boucherie in West Village. Not as high end as expected. Crowded and loud. Food is good but service can be slow. The wine selection is a-okay.,"I normally write my reviews a few days after going to the restaurant, but I just left boucherie and WOW. I'm not sure where to start. The food was unbelievable. Not only was the meat cooked to absolute perfection but the quality of the meat itself was evident. I highly recommend the squid ink linguini if you like seafood. My boyfriend literally licked the dish clean. The ahi seared tuna was also a really great dish! The tuna almost melted in your mouth and was laid upon a really nice salad. The service was extraordinary. We didn't get the waiters name but his suggestions were on point, his humor was refreshing, and his attentiveness was a really important aspect of our dinner. Dessert gets its own paragraph. I think if I could eat the pistachio brownie dessert every day for the rest of my life I'd die happy. It was the waiters suggestion, we were originally going to go with the one everyone gets (the one pictured in most reviews) but best choice of the night. Boucherie is a special place and I highly recommend it to all","I expected a bit more from this place. It could be what I ordered (steak tartar, steak frites and chocolate mousse) cause my boyfriend loved his seafood platter, but I thought everything was a little bland. Nothing really made my mouth water. I didn't dislike the food, but it also wouldn't be a place I'd recommend to a friend looking for a great, unforgettable dinner. Although, I got the la vie de rose (I think?) cocktail, and that was fantastic","I returned to Boucherie another time and the experience was much improved. The service was significantly better. Our waitress was extremely kind and attentive the entire evening. The manager (Chantelle) was on premises that evening as well and was just the sweetest. Highlights of the meal were the choux farci, French onion soup and the crepe suzette.",Boucherie Union Square
94,They had mediocre food. They have too many options so the food they have is subpar. I tried ordered multiple aides and each one wasn't too great.,"Food was delicious until we found a dirty nail clipping in our omelette. We brought it to the server and the servers just took the nail clipping, passed it amongst themselves and laughed it off, and we never got the nail back for a photo. They played dumb and asked us what we think it could be. The servers were intentionally ignorant and did not seem apologetic and did not apologize at all. We had lost our appetite, paid our bill and left. Will definitely not be back again for fear of secret sauce in our food on our next visit.","HORRIBLE & DIRTY PEOPLE WITH CELIAC DISEASE/ GF STAY AWAY!!! BAD & CARELESS ABOUT OUR HEALTH!!!I told the waiter before ordering anything that I have celiac disease and that he should tell me if I order anything that would have gluten. I ordered the burger with GF bread (obviously because I am gluten free), the food came, it was fine. Started eating the fries and I started to feel pain in my stomach. I asked a waiter (not the one I ordered from) if the fires is GF and he told me no it's not. I didn't know that. I asked to speak to the manager, the manager came with extremely defensive/rude attitude telling me that I should know that cross-contamination is possible and it's my fault for expecting that it's GF (as you know, ALL restaurants tell you beforehand if there's cross contamination, they don't wait for you to have pain then tell you. Additionally, I already asked my waiter to tell me if anything I order is not GF) I was explaining very calmly to the manager how careless it is and that's not ok (because he made it seem so fine to make such a horrible mistake). His answer? ""What do you want me to do? Call you an ambulance?"" - this is how rude and careless he was. Couldn't believe he actually said that. It was so beyond disrespectful that I didn't even get mad, we just paid for the rest of the food and left. I still can't believe how careless about people's health they are.  Lastly, I should note that I didn't receive any apology for this mistake. Nothing. Just rude & defensive behaviorNEVER AGAIN!!!","In a City filled with overpriced mediocre restaurants--Tribeca's Kitchen stands out.It's worth the walk to dine here. They care about your health and delivering a quality meal with excellent service.We dined on the lunch menu.  Organic eggs in the Omelets, generous portions, fresh vegetables, and they actually shave a real potato and make their own hash browns seasoned perfectly.  Most places give you the cheapest egg and use frozen hash browns--not here.Excellent accommodating service by our waitress and a nice area of the city.We had lunch here before going up to the top of the World Trade Center. I can see Value becoming an issue on the dinner or breakfast menu due to higher pricing, but for lunch specials--it was a home-run.If you are in the area--check them out.","Yeah this was a great place to get a quick meal. I would say that the food is pretty standard fare which makes it nice because it's predictable. Strangely enough, the standout item for me were their fries. I'm a sucker for battered, seasoned, and non-traditionally-shaped fries!!!The place seems to be full of tourists which isn't a bad thing but it can add a lot of foot traffic. Anyway, this place seems like a very reliable place to hop into for food and give you that old New York diner vibe. I give it three stars because it's ok. I wouldn't come back not because I didn't enjoy my meal but because it's just ordinary and there are tons of other places to try in New York City. If I lived in the neighborhood, I might consider coming back. However, it's not worth the effort if you don't live in the neighborhood.","Solid breakfast place. Coffee was just ok.Service was nice but a bit slow and although they fixed a problem of cold hash browns, it came a si was done with my meal. I would probably not go out of my way to eat here. Tons of great choice in TriBeCa",Tribeca's Kitchen
95,"This has to be one of the worst Thai foods i have ever had. Every dish we had was beyond revolting. From pathetic tomYum, which was probably 90% mushrooms only with no other vegetables to spring rolls (3 for 8$) with no lettuce, herbs or an ounce of love. The worst but not the least was a glass noodle pad thai that once again was so dry and not a gramm of vegetable in sight. Hey guys! Thailand called, they are embarassed for u! Uninviting, stomach turning food. I wouldnt serve this to my dog!!!!! Shame on you!!!","I used to love this place. And it's great in person and the food is good. But their delivery and customer service has been horrific on more than one occasion. They take more order than they can handle and deliver extremely late. When you call, they tell you that they're busy and you should be patient. It's not my job to be patient when I am paying this much money and expecting service.The last time I ordered, and I will never eat here again, the person who answered (Hannah) was very rude. Worse, the manager (Andy) hung up the phone when I asked to cancel my order. Not one person was even remotely apologetic for screwing up. I'm truly horrified at this level of service and the rudeness. I will never eat here again, and even came back to yelp to change this from a 5 star to 2 star rating because of how upset I am with the way I was spoken to. I really hope this place replaces the rude servers and managers because the food is actually good and it's such a shame to be overshadowed by horrific service.",,"I had walked by many, many times without stopping by, mostly because it looks like just another UES hole in the wall Thai restaurant. So last night I decided it was time to finally give it a try, glad I did!The place is actually big and very nicely decorated, the atmosphere is vibrant yet relaxing, making you feel as if you were in a country side stone house. You've got faux rustic brick walls, Persian lanterns, and plants hanging from the ceiling. Despite how that sounds, it actually manages to feel comfortable and borderline romantic (too bad it's NYC and tables are way too close to each other almost rubbing elbows with your neighbors LOL!)Our waitress  was on top of things never letting us run out of water or (God forbid) drinks!! I usually ask myself every time when at a Thai restaurant ""Would I eat anything other than pad thai here?"" and after a quick glance on the menu the answer was ABSOLUTELY! And believe me I did  =]There's a whole menu of dishes worth ordering, from curry puffs to crispy duck, and that's what helps separate it from your typical hole in the wall Thai. Appetizer - Curry puffsMinced chicken, potatoes, onion and curry powder, served with sweet cucumber relish.Main -Massaman curry (GF)Potatoes, onion, avocado and peanuts, with coconut milk.*From Chef's signature menu* Up Thai fried rice claypotSea scallop, shrimp, chicken, Chinese sausage, onion, scallions and shiitake mushrooms.Verdict: food and service are excellent! We ordered everything to share. Definitely a place I would recommend!","Definitely one of the best Thai restaurants uptown and priced reasonably for the quality! Some of the dishes are hit or miss. Loved the crab vermicelli and the Up Thai rice clay pot as well as the black sticky rice. The pork chop was a little dry and the khao soi noodles were soggy. The cocktails are good though. Tip: sit at the bar! It's first come and sometimes there are empty seats when the wait for a table is long. If you're looking for a casual meal uptown with or without drinks, I would recommend this place.","Delicious food, quick service, cheap prices! Can't ask for much more than this! I came here during lunchtime and they have a great lunch special in which two people can get their own appetizer and entrée for about $26. You can't beat that type of affordability. I assume the great prices is because there's so many lunch options in the area. If you are trying to figure out which one is the best, you won't be upset if you choose this one.I hade the Massaman curry with shrimp (contains nuts). I hate nuts so I picked each of them out lol but it was sooooo flavorful and the potatoes were so good! It was worth the extra labor of picking out the nuts LOL.The interior has a beautiful design, the bathrooms are nice and clean, and the seats are comfortable. There really isn't any reason why you shouldn't stop by.",Up Thai
96,"I know I am late to the party, but it was my first time visiting this establishment! I took my mom for her birthday and let's just say, now I know why everyone raves about the FOOD! We even took ordered food to take home for later!",Pros- just about everything on the menu taste amazing. I have no complaints at all when it comes to the food.Cons- way too smallDrinks are weak (atleast to me)Long waits Honestly everyone should give this place a try. Its def not good for large groups.,"First time trying Nashville Hot Chicken and boyyyyyy when they say hot, they mean HOTTTTTTT. Place was very busy on a Friday morning so we sat at the bar. Service wasn't that friendly but in such a small place that packs out easily, I can get it being stressful. Their brunch drink specials were nice and affordable. I got a Nashville hot chicken sandwich while my boyfriend ordered some sort of breakfast platter with fried chicken as the main, he got his extra hot. Food was tasty but we both wished they gave us bigger plates, had to remove dishes in order to eat our orders more comfortably. Meals were a bit pricy but worth it. We had terrible stomach aches at the end of the night, but also ate elsewhere during the day, so we're unsure of where we got it from. Just mentioning it in case someone comes & has the same issue.","How did they get it so perfectly crispy?? What is IN the aioli? It's so good. The buns are also perfect, they don't get soggy while you eat the sandwich, and I felt like I was finally an adult capable of eating a real burger / sandwich without it becoming a sloppy mess.We waited about 15 minutes for a table, and got the perfect cozy corner by the window. Everyone seemed to know everyone else. The sweet potato fries were my favorite side. The ""hot"" chicken was the perfect amount of spice. The cornbread was dry, but we felt like the sandwich made up for it. Our server was great. The only issue was that I couldn't stop eating because the texture was just too good. It's sort of expensive (ah, NYC sandwiches for $17) but hot damn it's worth it.","Saturday evening at about 7pm with a party of 4 we did not have a wait.  Seated promptly and the service throughout was nice and attentive.  The food however was a let down.  The breast on my chicken plate was dry (not brined?) and bland as was the cornbread.  The worst part also is that I was provided a wing as well one I asked for a mixed plate.  Word to the wise: wing is white meat, not dark.  Best part was the sweet potato fries.  My friend's mac and cheese was gritty, as if the roux has not been whisked enough.This is an example of why people like Anthony Bourdain enjoys places like Popeyes as they are consistently good when compared to hyped up places due to mass media coverage.","This place is good if you like Nashville hot chicken!Loves:+ No or short wait for Sunday dinner (some of us can't be waiting hours for brunch, ya know)+ Chicken is tasty (hot = hot!). I'd splitsies with a friend one regular and one hot.+ Nice staff.Not so love:- Mac & cheese was underwhelming- Cocktails could have been strongerI know people who live and die by this place. I'm not one of them, but still worth a visit here if you love chicken.",Peaches HotHouse
97,==loved==soba==liked==miso soupegg custard==meh==hokke yuan==disliked==oyakodon,"A solid dining experience. Good variety in the menu from apps to sushi to cooked dishes. I got a clay pot dish with fried chicken and egg. Unfortunately, the server mistakenly gave my set to someone sitting next to me and that guest proceeded to eat it, so I had to wait for the kitchen to make it again. Not the best move there, given I was on a time crunch. It's fine though because the food was filling and the space is nice. Tip is already included. This makes it so much easier.",Good foodReasonable price at busy vacation I will come back next timeLove Japanese Sakeselections,LovedSukiyakiLikedGyozaMehChicken vinegar thingThe sukiyaki was delicious. Excited to try kaisendon and yakitori next time,Visited Ootoya with a reservation for 6pm. The restaurant was pretty full but the service was attentive. The menu prices were a little bit pricier than I expected but the portion sizes are larger than you would expect so that somewhat balances it out in my opinion. I got the beef negimaki which was really tasty and the scallion and the beef together was excellent. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food very much.Pro tip: all prices include gratuity so there is no need to write in an additional percentage for tip. (Perhaps that accounts for the seemingly higher menu pricing?).,"It's a nice place with a high end atmosphere! My favorite thing about this place is that everything from tax to tip is already included in the total. My friends and I came here and decided to eat family style. We ordered 4 dishes and 1 appetizer, all which was very delicious but too much salt (in my opinion). The portions were generous for the price. Our waiter was very attentive and polite. He constantly made sure we had water and would often come by to pour some more without having to ask. They also gave us warm hand towels before our meals.",Ootoya Chelsea
98,"You can always count on a good meal at Westville X. I say ""X"" because, if you didn't already know, Westville is a small local chain with locations in Chelsea, FiDi, East Village, Hudson Square, Dumbo, and the West Village (duh).If you eat out a lot in New York City, you know it can be tough to get your veggies in. When we feel this way, we know a cure is to be found at Westville. Whether for brunch, lunch, or dinner, our favorite thing to order here is a plate or two, or three, of 4 market sides to split with the whole table. We've had just about every fresh veggie on that list, and the seasonal rotations are great too. I am not a die-hard vegetarian or vegan or anything like that, but these veggies are just _that_ good.When we are looking for something else on top of the veggies, you can't go wrong with their Mac & Cheese or Burgers, but seriously, get some market sides too.Only downside is that the prices, while not super high, are not super low either.","I would usually give Westville a 5 star rating for food and service, but today's experience is the exception.  My husband and I eat here at least once a week and for today we were seated outside. I did not know that they allowed pets outdoors.  There was a couple across from us who allowed their dog to sit on the table where they fed it.  This was not a seeing-eye dog.  I get it people love their pets, but for those who have allergies to them, they make me feel very uncomfortable.  I let one of the servers know but she did not tell them to not allow the dog on top of the table.  I finally let the 2nd server to ask them to keep their dog on the back side of them and she asked them to do so.  It's just unsanitary to allow pets on top of the dining table outdoors or not.  I hope that servers sanitize the table before the next diners are seated at the same table.Overall, they should put a sign that dogs/animals are allowed in outside seating area so customers are aware so to avoid eating outdoors.  I see more and more favoritism to animals than people --go figure.","BEWARE: they fry their French fries in the same oil they fry bacon and fish!!!!! I just spoke to them and the manager said that it was the case.     I ordered a vegan quinoa burger for pickup and they put French fries in same container and all over my vegan burger which has no indication on the menu about coming with fries. The fries taste nasty, and are non-vegan.    To top this off, they did not bother to offer me a refund or anything of this kind. They've lost a me as a customer, I used to go to Westville a lot, in the village mostly, but because of absolutely horrible customer service and misleading advertising I cannot make myself eat there again!","I like westville dumbo. There are lots of place to eat near dumbo, but not so many place good to go. Wedtville dumbo serves comfort american foods. Seating outside and drinking beer is my favorite.I visited last night with my friends. We ordered burger, nacho and fish and chips + two picher of beer! Burger was good enough and Nacho was really good. Chicken and cheddar cheese good match my beer. Staff were very kinds and frendly. We will be back!","Great place for some comfort food, especially after day-time barhopping in DUMBO. We visited Westville as a party of six and were able to get a table pretty fast (and without a reservation). I had the fish n chips and ordered a side of mac n cheese. Both dishes were absolutely amazing. The fish n chips were perfectly fried and not at all super greasy. Also, I do not believe anyone had anything negative to say about their food. Plus, Westville has a bunch of veggie options. All in all, a great dining experience was had by all. This is definitely a great place, with decent prices, to dine in DUMBO.","Rating: 3.5/5Westville's ample selection of vegetable laden dishes and farm to table motto make it a great choice for someone who's embracing a healthy, sustainable lifestyle. This location has a covered, air-conditioned patio in addition to an outdoor seating area. I decided to go all out with the vegetables since that's what Westville is known for. I had a market plate of roasted cauliflower with tahini, pesto mashed potatoes, and mixed mushrooms with leeks & herbs. It's a pretty impressive platter of veggies that definitely fulfilled daily fiber requirements. What was less impressive was the flavor of the vegetables. While they were very fresh, they needed a lot more seasoning. I found myself sprinkling more than Salt Bae would onto my mushrooms and cauliflower. The pesto mashed potatoes were definitely my favorite, although I would have liked the pesto flavor to be stronger. I added generous amounts of Tapatío hot sauce to give it a nice kick. The cauliflower tasted undercooked to me. It had the crunch of a carrot.Overall, Westville was a bit disappointing to me. I think it's a good option for a healthy meal, but not amazing.",Westville Dumbo
99,"Stepped into Paesano's... for outdoor dining.  Not satisfied that we had to ask for water, then ask for bread after ordering...asked for more wine after dinner. Waiter slacked.  Table to my right seated after us... got water and bread in minutes.  Food was delish... too bad on the service","My family went to dinner last Friday night on our family trip to NYC. Of the many restaurants we could pick Paesano looked great. It was extremely disappointing. The service was terrible and it felt like you were a real bother to ask any question, for more water or an extra fork or anything. There was plenty of staff but none of them were interested in serving our family and none of them were friendly or had a smile. The food was ok except for the bread which was stale. The restaurant seems tired and dirty. I would not recommend this restaurant for any reason. It was extremely disappointing as we had come a long way and planned this trip with all of our family. I felt that we really picked the wrong restaurant.","Awful. I'd say their motto here is 'just get em to sit down, then it's fair game'. After hounding you like carnival barkers to get you to sit, they try to upsell you everything. Lousy and overpriced wine selection. The bread is just terrible with only butter packets as your option, no oil/herbs. The food was awful. Most inauthentic tomato sauce I have ever tasted. Ordered veal and they brought me chicken. They had a ton of lower-price ""specials"" but check your bill because I gave them my card before they brought the check and they charged us full-price.Dime-a-dozen conveyor belt Italian food here. Nonna is rolling in her grave so much she could power half of California.","So this gem, I spontaneously tried while cruising through Little Italy. Luckily I was not disappointed. The hospitality and service was great from start to finish. My sister arrived early and they gave her a glass of red wine on the house. Everyone at the table was extremely satisfied with the entres. I had the Carbonara, my sister the Eggplant Parmesan, and our third guest the Spaghetti Bolognese.Speaking from the perspective of an individual who went on a pasta marathon in Italy, the pasta at Paesano's tasted identical to what I had across different Italian cities. The pasta was perfectly cooked and fused perfectly with the sauce, meat etc. I highly recommend Paesano's. You taste the passion and authentic flavors in their food.","Unbelievable service. Food is affordable. Great setting. Very nice, attentive waiters.Thumbs up for a tourist experience in Little Italy.","First time trying a restaurant in little Italy, walked In and got seated instantly, with the choice of indoor or outdoor seating. (On a Friday night)started off with the calamari, was crispy and delightful. Drizzled lemon and with the spicy marinara, lovely.Had the penne a la vodka, came right out of the oven. Pasta was fresh and cooked perfectly, sauce was delightful as well. Overall, the service was quick and great, dinner was amazing and the ambience was amazing.",Paesano of Mulberry Street
100,"TLDR: like other reviewers have mentioned, the service here is R U D E. Food was generally good at brunch, but would I suffer through for the sake of their brunch? Nay, I say.This is a review of their Sunday Brunch. I have never been to their dinner seating, but I cannot comment because my poor brunch experience leaves me hesitant to make a trip back.***Food: 4/5Ambiance: 4/5Service: 1/5Overall: 2/5***The good:- We had the taiwanese pancakes and they were good - authentic albeit overpriced (by $$$ a lot)The bad:- Came here on a Sunday for brunch. Not a soul in sight, as nobody comes here for brunch. Server ignores my friend who arrived before me, who had to try very hard to get seated.- Server proceeded to try to get my friend to leave after she had been waiting at the restaurant for me due to traffic. Server could not be more delighted to get off her shift, and kept telling my friend the store is going to close / last call for lunch / etc. What a service experience, amirite?- Basically, server was trying to kick us out the entire time so that she can sign off on her shift. She proceeded to place all the chairs up on tables in preparation for closing her shift, while we were still eating.***The verdict:- I wouldn't come here- There are 10000000x options in New York. Why waste your precious time and money on a meal that does not bring you joy?- Don't go here","This place is a mess. We waited by the door for 10 minutes with no greeting, the hostess was nowhere to be found. All of the waiters made an ACTIVE EFFORT TO IGNORE US.Once we were seated and food started to come, i don't know what system this restaurant has going on but all the waiters were confused and had no idea whose food was whose. The lo ba beng had bad pork in it and stank up the whole dish.The drunken clams were over seasoned and THEY DIDNT CLEAN THE CLAMS WELL. There was so much sand in the clams!The oyster omelette was cakey. And the cold sesame noodles stank from having tooooo much vinegar. Horrible system. Alright food.","I literally just had the worst delivery experience in my life. 886 uses paper bags and plastic containers for delivery, which is fine if you order dry food (like the sausage party). But they still use the same containers when people order food with more liquid (water spinach with shrimp paste) So today, hungry in the office, I ordered water spinach with shrimp paste from 886 on caviar. They food was delivered appx 45 mins after I ordered. The liquid from water spinach, I assumed, was leaking already in the restaurant and damaging the whole bag. So when the courier handed the food to me from his bag, the food just slipped off from the wet bag and everything dropped off to the ground. How disappointing it is (considering you are hungry, working late in the office and have been waiting for your food for an hour) This is not the first time this happened- I've order multiple times from 886 for delivery and every time when I received it from the delivery person, the bottom of the bag was always wet, like the sauce was already leaking from the plastic container. But I guess I was lucky before that my food didn't slipped off from the wet bag and got damaged right in front of me. I contacted 886 and was really disappointed with their self-righteous attitude. While explaining what happened today, the staff told me that this rarely happened and tried to blame it to the staff who did not close the container tight enough (which to me, is some bs excuse; how did you even find out the staff did not close the container tight enough after the food left the restaurant) And yea, I am just SO UNLUCKY that this happened to me in one in millions chances.","Great authentic Taiwanese food! I've been a few times with different groups and people and they've always liked the food as well. Favorite dishes are definitely the clams, minced pork rice, and the fried rice. I went on Saturday at 1 and didn't realize that they had brunch special on the weekend! Was perfect because I was SERIOUSLY craving some youtiao and fresh soy milk which tasted great and was super nostalgic of eating breakfasts back in Asia. Also love the vibe of the place and all the servers are great as well. All round awesome restaurant!!","Service is super nice. The hostess was very friendly and she called me by my name so I felt super valued. We got lychee bomb, chicken sandwich, oyster omelette, sausage party, and the Lo ba beng. They all tasted soooooo good. Lychee bomb - 4/5 super easy to drink, super tasty but it costed $13..........Chicken sandwich - 4/5 great size of chicken, very flavorful. Only complaint is the bottom bun is soggy from the oil/ sauce. Oyster omelette- 4/5 oyster taste good but the overall taste is a little dull even with the red sauce. Their food is very spicy especially this oneSausage party - 4/5 $8, the cheapest item on our order but the tastiest. Only complaint is the sauce in the middle is very short so after two bites, there's pretty much the sticky rice sausage left. Lo ba beng - 4/5 very tasty and good portion size. But almost 90% of it is completely fat. Very guilty and if you don't like the texture of fat, it's not gonna be pleasant. Very flavorful tho. I think their food is generally pretty spicy. The omelette and chicken sandwich got me struggling a little bit but they are all very tasty and flavorful. However, my bill end up being $80 with tips and tax, a little bit on the pricier size. When you compare it to actual Taiwan price for these food, it's a pain to think about.","The rating is based on the fact that it is a Taiwanese American restaurant, and therefore, I didn't knock out one more star for not being super authentic.  The flavoring reminded me a lot of Win Son in Brooklyn, where both places take a new spin on household snacks and dishes that all Taiwanese grow up knowing and loving.Dinner dishes that we would recommend are 1) Sausage party and 2) Crispy silken tofu as starters. Skip the oyster omelette, it was drenched in so much sauce that we can barely taste the omelette itself.For entrees, the two of us shared the Water spinach and shrimp paste and Hsinchu Mifen. Both reminded us of home!If you are in a mood for beer, try the mango flavored Taiwan beer. Brunch menu looks interesting, will return for that!",886
101,"There are many varieties of Korean ready-made lunch boxes. And I went with the buffet by lbs. was a big mistake! I felt sick and I knew it wasn't clean there. The reason is , they have no space to place the tongs , so is laying on top of the food, and people's hand grab it and place it back on the food.I bet they will not passed inspection for that buffet. The tongs are also slimy and  sticky.Go with hot food all well packed in the back area.","If you're looking for the cheapest meal in KTown, this is it! Woorijip is one of the few places in KTown that has all of its food ready made. Everything is in a takeout container, or you can put the hot food from the buffer in a takeout container.Everything is super cheap, and the food is actually pretty decent! It has a cafeteria vibe, but that's what the place is going for. It's full of drunk high school and college students on Friday and Saturday nightspot since it's cheap!","Convenient and quick, Woorijip offers decent lunch food. You can choose to pick a box and filled it with various food items or pre-package lunch boxes. I think the pre-packed ones are cheaper. The other option allows you to pay by the total weight of the food that you got.Overall, a decent spot for a quick and easy meal.","Awesome spot! My friend requested we find a late night eats spot and he said it looks good and affordable so I agreed on going. The place was packed with post partiers, academias, and under 30s. The food is all located on a shelf where you pick whatever you like. There was bulgogi, honey garlic chicken, various sushi rolls, noodles, seafood fried rice, porridge, rice bowls, octopus, literally everything! I wanted everything we ended choosing a few different things and pick at all of them. You can't find this type of Korean food anywhere.Tips: If you dig around you can find some half off platters. Cold items tend to be cheaper if you want to take home and heat up.Just nitpicking it's pretty crowded so finding a seat is tough. Also caught a splinter from the chocksticks, that's never good.","Oh my goodness, what a gem. My boyfriend and I were walking through Koreatown after a movie and were hoping the food court would be open for a quick snack. Unfortunately, but fortunately our movie got out late and it was closed. Although we initially planned to continue our walk to the subway, we, by the grace of god, stumbled upon Woorijip. At first, we thought it was closing as we couldn't see any food nor was there a menu outside, but we took a risk and walked in anyways. Big risk, big reward. We were met by a treasure trove of prepared Korean meals. Even better, since we walked in so late, some of the food was 50% off. Ddokboki for $4, kimbab for $1.75 (50% off), kimchi chiggae for $4, you name it, they most likely have it! Also, it seems as if they have a hot food bar going throughout the day. In addition to the amazing food, there is a fridge full of kimchi and banchan (side dishes) you can purchase to take home. Also, there were a plethora of Korean drinks and snacks alongside flavored sojus and Korean beers. I'm telling you, this is the jackpot. There are plenty of tables to enjoy your meal at and it seems as if it's a popular spot to grab a bottle of soju with friends and enjoy a drink with a meal! Highly recommend this spot as it offers Korean food at a very affordable price! And, it's open till late! 2 am! Closed on Sundays!","Oh gosh. Woorijip is what I was looking for. It is what I wanted.I was so craving kimbap. I got it. My favorite too. Spicy Tuna Kimbap.So many options. Seriously. I wish I had enough stomach to eat everything. I wish I drove to NYC instead of taking the airplane so I could take all this food home with me.There is a hot bar too. I got some food there too. See, I cannot make up my mind.Food is cheap. Lots of variety. Delicious.I also got the gingseng chicken soup, along with other stuff. I just want to eat everything. Plus they are open late. Like really? I love Korean food. I love Kpop. I love Kdramas. I love Korean food. I need to go to South Korea.194/2019",Woorijip
102,Reminds me of home-cooked Chinese food I used to have growing up! Great place for when you're craving Chinese but not looking for something on the healthier side - the clay pots taste incredible and aren't super oily. They look somewhat small in the photos but the pots actually come with a lot of rice and toppings (and you can choose the number of toppings you want) The inside isn't too large so I wouldn't come here with a group larger than ~4.,"Bao zai fan otherwise known as clay pot is a new concept in town. So far, I think, this is the only place offering this concept in NYC. I went for the clay pot with beef and veggies as toppings. Rice gets cooked right in front of you. The beef was very tender and flavorful. Scraping the burned rice from the bottom of the pot is an interesting activity. I added a lot of soy sauce, Sriracha and garlic to my clay pot to bring to my level of flavor. It was really tasty. Pan seared shrimp was also very flavorful.This is a tiny restaurant. There are limited number of seats inside. There is no big name plate outside. So it is a bit difficult to find this spot.","we saw a mouse running around the floor and my boyfriend got very sick. we told the staff, they did absolutely nothing. real disappointment, as it was my boyfriend's first time having bo ji fan.","Fairly affordable Chinese food in East VillageOverall: 4.25/5 Food: 4.5/5 Value: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Decor: 3/5We had a variety of dishes including a 3 kind clay pot with Chinese sausage, veggies, and pork belly ($15), scallops ($7.5), vegetable of the day ($5), quail eggs ($4), and squid ($6). The squid was nice, really tasty although quite garlicky. The scallops I wouldn't recommend since the pieces were really small and just wasn't outstanding. The quail eggs are adorable presented and it's such a novelty to peel and eat such tiny eggs! The clay pots are the star dish here and it's quite good - a portion of rice chock filled with tasty ingredients. I do wish the rice had been a bit more seasoned since when eating it, some parts are pretty plain if you don't get toppings in the scoop. Overall a nice home style and authentic place. It's not super fancy but the price point reflects this. A solid spot for a quick and easy meal!","3.5/5, but I'm more inclined to round down than up.1. Prawns - super flavorful and delicious. The shells were on but I didn't mind at all - that's actually how you keep the flavors in.2. Clay pot - very bland and disappointing. I've had authentic clay pots in Hong Kong and this was nothing like what I had expected. The whole point is to have crispy rice at the bottom, but this just tasted straight up like fresh rice with toppings. I had to add lots of sauce myself to combat the blandness, which is something I one off-putting when dining outside.My search for authentic clay pots continues...","this place is small- but fits more people than meets the eye. i came with 3 friends to catch up over dinner and we did everything family style we got pretty much every appetizer (6?), one everything clay pot rice, and i had a house wine for myself (not bad for 5 bucks?). the bill came out about $85-90everything tasted pretty good, but these are tapas sized dishes so everyone only got maybe 1-3 bites of each. the clay pot right was $18 and smaller than anticipated. i think we were all pretty full because one friend had an upset stomach so didn't really eat, only had tea and gingeralei would definitely come back here as a fun place to catch up with friends over a small bite! but if you have a large appetite, this might not be for you unless you want to spend a bit more.",Clay Pot - East Village
103,It sucks you can't alter the spice level for the dan dan noodles. They looked so good so I got them anyway and they were just too spicy for me. I forced myself to eat them until I got full so I didn't spend $13 on noddles and leave hungry but I didn't enjoy them. Even the other noodles I looked at getting you couldn't alter the spice. When your feeding such a large variety of people it seems ridiculous you can't ask for more mild of sauce.It was the tingly lamb cumin. That was the other dish I was interested in getting and was told I couldn't alter the spice level.,"My friend and I ordered the spicy cumin lamb dry noodles and at first bite, it was good until we kept eating and it went downhill... We realized that the noodles itself were too thick and the dry noodles were extremely oily. The combination of the texture and oiliness made us so sick of the dry noodles so we ended up not finishing it. A couple of days later we tried Xi'an Famous Food's spicy cumin lamb dry noodles to compare both places and we actually preferred Xi'an's. If we ever do come back here, I'd probably try the dan-dan noodles or the spicy beef noodle soup but overall I thought this place was okay.","This place was disappointing given the overwhelming positive reviews on here and its presence of customers at the time. The sauce of the dan dan noodles was ""heavy"" so the noodles were super sticky. I was NOT given the option to choose a spice level, and i can handle spicy food pretty well, but these noodles really went hard with the spice. The amount of pork was in a small quantity. It was just tiring trying to finish it so i didn't. The taiwanese beef soup was mediocre. The soap was REALLY salty and concentrated. Noodles didn't have the smoothness or chewiness that wide noodles should have. I've had better in a lot of places.The black milk tea was slightly bitter, not a good indication of good tea leaves. A lot of the tapioca balls were stuck in clumps of 3 or more so my straw was stuck every other sip.Maybe my taste buds are just different, but I'm Chinese, so I've had these dishes a lot and this place is definition not amongst the top ones.","Literally the best thing I've eaten all week and I believe these noodles cure all ailments!So my friend and I were both sick and wanted something spicy to help our sore throats and stuffy noses. Luckily for us there is Very fresh noodles. We ordered the spicy cumin lamb soup and the Dan Dan noodles with beef along with a Tsingtao beer. You get the see the entire process of how your noodles are made right before your eyes. The guy slinging them is an artist and the noodles themselves are so tender and super flavorful. The spicy cumin lamb soup was amazing , delicious and spicy with tender bits of lamb, even though it was spicy we couldn't stop eating it. The Dan Dan noodles are a bit different as it is a dry noodle but it is equally as delicious with a myriad of spices rendering an amazing flavor profile. Both paired well with the Tsingtao beer which helped with the tingling tongues we had from the spices. Let's just say we walked into very fresh noodles sick and walked out cured. If you haven't yet definitely check them out!","If you want to enter into a happy food coma, order the Taiwanese beef noodle soup. For a soup, it is dense and luscious. Like eating a thanksgiving meal, you'll want to cuddle up in a ball and take a long nap after. The flavors are perfectly balanced and the meat is oh-so tender. The pudding wasn't for me. I'm accustomed to a sweeter lighter pudding and this was authentically bland.","The freshest noodles you could get in town - like for real - there is a guy pulling the noodles and boiling it right there in front of you. It makes a worlds difference in the taste. I ordered the spicy vegan noodle - you have the option of choosing this in either soup or dry form. In my opinion, spicy foods taste best with the ingredients soaked in sauce rather than broth. The spice sometimes took away from the tasefulness of the vegan ingredients. Shiitake mushrooms and a sour tofu filled in as pseudo-meat with a side of bokchoy. I enjoy the ingredients combination but wish the spice didn't take the attention of this dish as it took away from the noodles freshness. I highly recommend enjoying with a nice cold beer! Overall, such a great experience!",Very Fresh Noodles
104,"If I were to compare their pork chives dumpling to a car, it'll still be a Ferrari. Why?Because a Ferrari does not need any advertising",I'm going to keep this short and simple. Get the pork chives dumplings (10 for $3.50). Why?Because a Ferrari needs no advertising.,Cheap and fresh dumplings. I got 6 dumplings for $2.50 and they came out in a matter of minutes. The dumplings are boiled and the skin is on the thinner side (Vanessa's dumplings are too thick for me).,"Omg.. their dumplings are so good! 6/$2.50 - I only tried their small order of pork & chives dumplings but I regret not ordering a large! Lol, their meat wasn't salty (compared to Vanessa's on the same block) and the skin was a slight chew, soft and perfect thickness for me. I'm definitely going to go back and try other things!The store was fairly small, don't recommend large groups but definitely had enough spots to sit in and enjoy the food. It's not those fancy, top notch looking sort of place so I feel like it's easily under looked but give their dumplings (& more) a try! (Tbh I've walked by it often when I used to be in this neighborhood a lot).","Cheap, quick, and tasty considering it's price. I thought the Wheat Noodles w/ pb sauce ($2.50) 3/5 for me, 5/5 for my friend. The Pork and Chive Dumplings ($2.50 for 6 pieces) were simple. I liked how the skin was thin and didn't feel too heavy. 4/5","Best dumplings in NYC by far. I went around 1 on a Saturday. There was a line almost to the door but it moves very fast. It's a cash only establishment so definitely come prepared. Food is ready within 5 minutes of ordering. Prices are truly amazing - 10 dumplings for $3.50. The quality is incredible - they are perfectly cooked and the quality of the noodles is extremely high. Even when it's busy, there is room to find a place unless you're an extremely large party. Overall excellent dumplings -  very good for a quick takeaway meal!",Shu Jiao Fu Zhou Cuisine Restaurant
105,"I don't know what has happened at Friedman's, but it has changed. This is our normal breakfast stop before we head to the airport.  There were no servers, the toaster didn't work, and the hot food was cold.For a Sunday morning at 9:00 I expected more and always received better service prior to todayDid they change owners?  We won't be back",Great  breakfast  Pancakes Omg you gotta check it out but there's a waiting time. Call in advance,"I really hope my disheartening experience at Friedman's does not happen to someone else.A friend and I came to the establishment around 8:30 a.m. on a Tuesday morning and it was packed. We were quickly seated by a kind hostess and waited a few minutes for our server, Matthew. At first, I did not think nothing of Matthew forgetting to introduce himself to my friend and I; he simply asked how we were doing and what we would like. I ordered the French Toast which was super decadent, soft, and nicely topped off with berries/jam. Perfect way to start off breakfast! My friend ordered the eggs, potato hash, chicken sausage and wheat toast (she thought it tasted too healthy, lol). As our meal progressed, we noticed that Matthew kindly introduced himself to the table next to us and repeatedly checked on another table to the right of us. I literally felt my blood boiling due to the lack of service we received that could not be explained away aside from our melanin. Every other individual at the restaurant was given additional attention but ours. I felt as if I couldn't enjoy my delicious French Toast without wondering why there was so much deliberate inattentiveness from our server. I literally tipped the server next to Matthew (his name is Ryan) because he attended more to our table than Matthew! Ryan even handed our check to us instead of Matthew (btw it was not packed by this time, so there wasn't any ""he was swamped"" excuse). Once we left, I had to call back the restaurant at once and find out the name of our server because I was so infuriated with my experience! This should not ever happen to anyone and it's upsetting to even complete this review. Lost a customer, but if you do go, say Hi to pleasant Ryan!","Its Rosh Hashanah! A beautiful Happy New Year to all( Shanah Tovah). So what do you do to celebrate or rather start the Celebra schionnnne- spend two days in Manhattan and make the first stop Friedman's on 31st!! I got a lovely welcome and a big smile from the host Josh when I walked in. Seated at the counter where I was immediately greeted by the very cool, bubbly and happy Tania( sorry if I got the spelling wrong). Started off with some strong put some more hair everywhere coffee.Loved the atmosphere in Friedman's.The staff was chill and having fun. Loved it! Loved the tofu, egg scramble with avocado. The potato side or hash was really tasty! Wheat toast perfecto!Tania was on the ball and kept my coffee cup full and checked on me frequently.Josh also walked over to see how things were going. Made a new friend from Seattle who was my neighbor. She just got in on the red eye.This was fun!  $27.22 for really generous and delicious portions, solid service and unlimited refills on the stellar coffee was a sweet deal!! The menu looked pretty appetizing with some interesting items like the eggs Benedict w Salmon. Definitely be back soon! Shanah Tovah!","Came here on a whim with a friend for a quick lunch. It wasn't crowded at all (Thursday afternoon) so we were seated right away. I was craving a BLT so I got Friedman's version of it, called the B.E.L.T. I'm a sucker for sourdough bread so this was perfect for me! It also came with a runny yolk which was the icing on the cake. Overall, great service (waitress kept coming back to refill our water) & food. Will definitely come back!","This is my favorite breakfast stop in NYC partly because of its close location to Penn Station but mostly because I love the food and friendly service.  My recent visit was excellent as always.  The decor has a cozy but busy atmosphere.  The serving staff is always friendly and accommodating.  There are no reservations and your entire party must be present before they seat you.  For this visit, I chose the egg white omelet with veggies and wheat toast.  It was yummy and healthy but also filling.  I'm not normally a coffee drinker but decided to try the Dirty Chai as a latte.  This was a Chai latte with a shot of espresso.  WOW!  Definitely give this cafe a try if you are in NYC..",Friedman's
106,This place absolutely hidden germ in Lower east side.. The ambiance is so authentic and cosy that makes you feel you are on vacay! And  I ve never seen Nachos like this!,"Small cramped place (or cozy if you look at the bright side) right by the Williamsburg bridge and off the Essex St stop on the M line. We came on a Friday night around 10Pm and were seated right away. The wait staff was very friendly and very prompt - they get an A for that. We ordered fish tacos and pollo Poblano which we shared between ourselves. Before the dishes came out, they brought out a plate of chips and salsa (not the chunky kind) and tap water (they ask you if you are ok with tap). The batter on the fish tacos was pretty good and the chipotle aioli salsa on it was a great compliment to the taco. Overall good tacos, but probably not $14 kind of good.As for the pollo, the chicken was tender and the mole was bomb. The fish comes with a base of plantains and rice that reminds me of maduros and grains. No regrets about the food, some reservations about the price and disappointed by the space.",Service is bad..the restaurant is too small to have such horrible service. The Fish tacos appear to be a nice size but it was full of batter and very hard would not recommend those.,"La Contenta is second to none and I mean it. It's an honor and a pleasure to give this restaurant five stars. Right off the top, it's a small place but don't get it twisted, it's very popular and for good reason. The music and staff was pitch perfect. I found the vibe and energy of the restaurant to be very festive and fun. I arrived a bit earlier then my friend but they still sat me and that's highly unusual. I was prepared to either have a drink at the bar or wait outside. So I was seated and the lovely waitress promptly served me the freshly made chips and salsa. I order a drink off their drink menu and I have to tell you, the bartenders at La Contenta really know how to make a drink. Between my friend and I, we tried four drinks off the menu and each one was amazing. For dinner, I order their shrimp enchilada with the red sauce and grilled brussel sprouts. My goodness what a meal. I couldn't finish it all. La Contenta is definitely one of those restaurant that you would pass and say, wow, I'd like to try that place out one day. Make that one day - today and get your life. You won't be disappointed.","This is a great find, cocktails, food, service and ambiance were all great. This would be an interesting place to take an out of town friend.We had the oaxacan and the easy rider cocktail and both were great. I'm always concerned with spicy cocktails, but these had the flavor of the spice without overwhelming the other flavors.We had the ahogar (drowned) sandwich which was my favorite thing we had. Generous guacamole, mildly spicy sauce and fully drowned so we could eat it with a fork and knife.  I had the shrimp enchiladas which were great. Shrimp was tender and it was a big portion. Also the Brussels were really good too.  We also had the mole chicken which was good but nothing different.Do nite that this is a good two person place as it is a very small spot. More than two you will have a longer wait.",What a small space with some good food!! And the drinks were even better. Although it's very tight inside. Not that many tables. Very small space they make it work! Food was tasty. They never asked us if we wanted the sauce that came on the fish tacos... which we found to be a little strange. Good thing it wasn't bad tasting. Happy to have stopped in for the experience.,La Contenta
107,"I'm writing not about the food - because the food is wonderful, but the customer service. I just got a call from L'Artusi for a reservation I stayed up until midnight to make a month in advance for my birthday dinner, which they cancelled less than 2.5 hours before due to an equipment failure. I get it, equipment fails but the service afterwards is my issue. My friend called the restaurant after I got the call to see if there was anything they could do since it was my birthday, and found that they only canceling reservations up until 7. (Our reservation was 6:30.) They were not willing to make an accommodation and were pretty ungracious about the fact that they were ruining a night that we had had planned for nearly a month. I don't think I will be returning here after this experience.",L'Artusi does not meet the hype:1. Pasta: The bolognese sauce was very bland. Piccolo Cucina has way better pasta dishes2. Coffee: probably the worst coffee I've ever had at an restaurant. Extremely bitter3. Service: pastry basket did not come with butter knife; coffee did not come with teaspoon; we were interrupted and rushed by 5 different waiters whether we were done with the meal when we were clearly still eatingOverall - do not recommend.,"I came to L'Artusi for a second time for a 7:15 reservation for two people. Upon arrival we asked for Nick to be our waiter and the hostess told us Nick was on vacation. It all went downhill from there. Our waitress was extremely rude and condescending towards us (tall woman with curly reddish-brown hair pulled in a bun).We had trouble deciding what to order for our mains but knew we wanted the beef carpaccio  to start. When we asked our waitress for a minute to decide which pastas we wanted to order she said ""she couldn't give us any time"" and ""she could not place our orders unless they were placed at that very second"".  And we had to order everything for our entire meal at that exact moment. The beef carpaccio came out suspiciously fast.  It came out at fast food speed. We received the beef carpaccio legitimately 5 minutes after placing the order. On top of that, the waitress didn't give us bread with the beef carpaccio. The rude waitress just slammed the plate down. We had not even finished half of the beef carpaccio, but the waitress decided to put both of our pastas on the table. We asked if we could have the pasta after we finished our appetizer (aka can she pace the meal instead of rushing us...). She said no, she would not take the two dishes away EVEN to be kept warm in the kitchen. Our waitress was insistent that the pastas had to sit and get cold on our table while we finished the appetizer. For a fine establishment, shouldnt the meal be paced properly? Why should a guest at their restaurant be reprimanded ?PASTAS: Wild Boar Ragu- we substituted the cavatelli for garganelli.  This was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I wish I could order delivery of the wild boar pasta and eat it every night for the rest of my life.","Till this day, L'Artusi remains my top 3 among the myriad Italian restaurants in NYC. Amazing food served in a casual-elegant environment with attentive service at a decent price. I don't enjoy dining at Italian restaurants as much as before, as I frequently find myself peeved by the food being either too bland or over-seasoned. L'Artusi has become my safe bet over the years as it has never disappointed.As a mushroom lover, I always order the roasted mushrooms with ricotta, pancetta, and fried egg. The texture of the mushrooms is simply perfect. The rabbit gnocchi is my favorite but you really can't go wrong with any of the pasta options. The olive oil cake is simply divine. I still remember how weird it sounded to my ear three years back, but it has since earned my unwavering loyalty. In fact, it's so good that I've never even bothered taking a look at their dessert menu.Reservation is not the easiest to procure even though it's available via Opentable.

108,"The Breakroom is small and tucked away. I order the spicy pork, fried tempura, mint lemonade (tasted more like lemon water) and steak taco (my least favorite). Service was fast! I wasn't impressed with the tacos for the price. It wasn't bad but it wasn't all that either. And the music they were blasting, I couldn't stand it! Calling women B's and sluts, I'm not with it at all. In the background you can hear Spanish music (not sure of the genre) I would have preferred them to blast that! I can skip taking my break at the Breakroom.","My mother used to have manic episodes and ""Breakroom"" was pretty much what she would do on a regular basis.As it turned out I did not actually go to Breakoom which was a shame because I wanted to.

When I have someone with me that wants to share a medium-to-high price burger.",The fish burger is the best! We came here for lunch and tried two types of burger. The chicken one is a little too dry for me. But the fish burger is so crisp outside and tender and juicy inside. My only complain is the lunch burger sizes are a little small.,Been coming here for the past few years for lunch. Mg go-to favorite is the fish tempura taco platter. Sooo good! Perfect size and just filling for the lunch hunger. I've recommended it to others and have had no complaints to date. Super small space so I wouldn't show up with a large crowd expecting to have seats. The few tables available are first come first seated type situation. The house sauce is awesome as well. God customer service quick and efficient.,"Very friendly and helpful staff! Casual burger spot hidden in Chinatown. Breakroom Burger - very good, lots of layers and tasty sauce. It's way too big that I ate it the deconstructed way... Tomato - pork belly - patty - lettuce - onion ring - egg - bun..... Not sure how people can the whole thing together... Pork Belly Taco - very tasty and enjoyed the pork belly a lot as it's not your typical taco option. Fish Tempura Taco - pretty good too but same to me in all other good taco place. Thai Chili - not sure why it's called Thai, just like regular Chili for me, my least favorite among what we ordered.

That said, I'd definitely go back because the food is that good!","Space: Extremely tiny, the table must be pulled out in order to allow a person to squeeze in.

I ended up sharing 1 dish with a friend. I ordered the Wild Boar Ragu pasta. And it was really delicious! Excited to try their other pasta!Tip: Don't forget to ask the staff for their bread! Soo good!",I'm reluctant to review this place but with nearly a perfect score and almost 500 reviews I guess it's safe to say word is out.This is one of the best Italian I've had in the city. The pasta is made fresh and you can tell. Delivered to you in a hot from the stove pan you might think you can't eat the full serving but one bite and you realize you can and you must! Can't wait to come back. Highly recommend the boar ragu.,Piccola Cucina Osteria
110,"The food was good, but the service is another story.Not only did the waitress make a mistake in our order, but imposed a 20% gratuity on us (for a 2 person brunch...) AND THEN proceeded to short change us. Will not be going back.","Inedible food, combative staff. Why bother?Came for a weekend Brunch. Waiter couldn't have cared less and seemed like he wanted to be anywhere but there. Seemed annoyed that we had questions on the menu. Got eggs and a breakfast pizza and two iced coffees.I'm not sure how you mess up an iced coffee that bad, but holy heck that was terrible. Probably the worst iced coffee I'd had in my life. Watery, off-flavored.Waiter drops on our table a ""bread basket"" that was TWO end pieces from the loaf. Pretty sure you're not supposed to serve that piece at all, let alone two of them.Food was cold, but also somehow overcooked. Not just un-hot, but cold. Would have loved to flag my waiter down and tell him that it was cold... but he left the building. Like just got up and went outside. For fifteen minutes.When we decided we had enough and wanted the check, I had to flag down the bar tender to grab our waiter from whatever he was doing outside the restaurant.Told the waiter our food, bread, and coffee was way, way off and bordering on inedible. Halfway through me talking about it, the guy just ran away to the bar. Like partway through my sentence, he left. When he came back, he was incredibly combative and asked us ""what the hell do you want me to do about it"" and that ""we should just pay and leave, we're not welcome"". Suffice to say, I paid for my overpriced, crappy food and left.This meal was so bad it made me want to get a Yelp account.I had actually really wanted to go here for a while, shame that it was so bad. Never going back, would tell anyone and everyone I know to avoid it like the plague.","I have been here six or seven times. The food is pretty good and the ambience is cute and cozy. Happy hour is awesome, great cocktails for 8 bucks.I will not be back because the service, at least from the ladies on the wait staff, ranges from cold and surly to flat-out awful. Most recently the person who had our table barely spoke to us, spilled water on my belongings (no apology), wasn't around when we needed her, and was all-around unpleasant and rude. I'd say it was just an off night, but this is a frequent occurrence whenever we have one of the women waitstaff. I don't know what the deal is, but if you don't like people, food service is a hard job to master.Our other waiter was very nice but very drunk (which he told us immediately upon coming to our table) and spilled about a quarter of my friend's drink all over the floor as he brought it to over. His whole hand and arm were dripping with it when he put it on the table with a flourish. Then he neglected to put one of our three dishes in as an order. When I told our grumpy server she said ""Oh yeah, looks like he never put it in."" That's it. Uh, ok. No problem. It's fine, we didn't want it anyway.Honestly, she was so rude it kind of ruined the evening.Bye-bye, Bijan's. I will miss your yummy random pasta dish, and the salads!",Stumbled across this gem of a place when searching for a place to eat at the odd hour of 3:30 on a Sunday. The ambience was super cute/vibey- the $20 special was awesome (cocktail plus entree)- and the owners Sepideh and Bijan were so warm and friendly! The food was awesome! We got the burger (meat was juicy and delicious) and the chicken salad sandwich. Definitely coming back here next time I visit Brooklyn!,"Delicious food, grossly overpriced. We got the Persian noodle soup ($14) and two side dishes of roasted eggplant and garlic yogurt ($7 each) and were very disappointed in the portion size. The soup was super yummy, but small for $14 and the two sides were RIDICULOUS for $7. It was basically robbery, it was almost disrespectful to give such little food and charge so much. Cute place, but probably won't be back due to high prices and small portions despite the food being good.",One of me and my better half spots!!! Food is always made to perfection..The drink are always great good music !! With Popeye playing and the sounds of Ray Charles!! I'm a happy lady.. The husband and Wife are always welcoming and pleasant!!,Bijan's
111,"We were here for lunch and was first greeted by a very unfriendly waitress. She seemed like she doesn't want to help us and told us in a mean and unpleasant way that we can't get a table with a outside drink. It was a hot summer day and it's is quite normal for me to grab a drink while I'm walking around the city to keep me hydrated. She could have told us the in a nicer way. We then got seated in a table inside and there were only about 2-3 other tables seated. Not very busy at all at the time we arrived. Then a male waiter wait us with the same attitude as the waitress at the door. The way he hold his table cloth to wipe down our tables and the table next to ours seemed a bit not ""customer friendly "" as if he didn't want to do the job and a bit rushed/no patience. He seems also stoic/ unhappy with serving our table. Both waiters/waitress makes us feel so unwelcome. We ordered the five spice tofu and although it looks very pretty the taste was lacking. The good thing is that tofu inside tasted very fresh but the skin should at least be season more. We also got the seafood pancakes which is bad. It's is basically a Chinese oily scallion pancake with really cheap and in small amounts imitation seafood. The meatball soup was ok, the base and meatball is flavorful, noodles bouncy. But nothing special that makes me want to come back or recommend to anyone again. The bathroom is a decent size and cleaner than most Chinese restaurant. Overall the interior and Visual look of food is nice, but the service and food is terrible.","Very very very mediocre, forgettable Chinese restaurant with exceedingly high prices. We couldn't finish our meals, which is not like us! Their sister restaurant (look it up) is the same deal.","Their garlic fried pork Katsu is really good.But service is not as good. A male waiter ask us to wait for twice, but never took our order... he just always tried to pretend not seeing us","This is one of my favorite restaurants now. The experience was amazing - quick walk to the table, food arrived fast, and the quality of the dishes - 5 stars. We ordered six dishes:- rice cake skewers- fried smoked sole in special soy sauce- steamed pork soup buns- eight spices crispy tofu - fried spices pork intestines with green peppers- steamed pea shoots with garlicHighly recommend if you're looking for a nice dinner that isn't incredibly expensive, but still very delicious and fun. The presentation of these dishes are so creative and elegant, very beautiful!","It baffles me why this place doesn't yet have a Michelin star and more recognition. I absolutely love the decor inside--well lit, yet romantic and airy. The food is also well thought out with high quality ingredients. The menu includes dim sum, noodles, entrees, inspired cocktails/drinks, and a very exceptionally creative dessert section to boot.Of note: - Soup dumplings: I found the soup dumplings (xiao long Bao XLB) impressive. The skin is chewy and doesn't break so easily that you can't enjoy the soup inside. Love it. - Soy pudding Dessert: soy pudding with early grey shaved ice. This wasn't exactly what I expected, but in fact exceeded my expectations. This was my favorite dish all evening and I could come back here just for this (and to try what else is on the dessert menu). Subtle soy (tofu) flavor with smooth silky texture. This is not overly sweet. There's orange/citrus in here and toasted rice for added interesting texture. Absolutely fell in love with this! - Lapsang Suchang tea: Smoky fragrant tea was a pleasurable complement to the meal I can't wait to come back here. It's now one of my highlights of the city.","Came here for lunch with 6 people. Service was pretty terrible and extremely slow. Asked for share plates and took forever. Ordered tea and never arrived till the end of the meal even we asked 3 times during our lunch. Didnt seem like the waiters cared and they think they deserved a 20% tip which auto added to the bill, well, NY rule I guess.Pea Shoot in Chicken Broth $18 - healthy fresh light plate of veggieSauteed Beef Cubes with Walnut and Black Pepper $32 - flavor was good but though the beef was a bit tough. Expensive for the quality and portionEight Spices Crispy Tofu $15 - interesting pretty tasty and complex in flavor Soup Dumpling $6 - delicious delicious Dan Dan Noodle $12 - spicy and garlicky in flavor we all love it!Hot Pot Beef Noodle Soup $22 - least favorite dish feel like artificial flavor and a lot of spicy oil, wish it's a stewed dish.For the price they asked for, it's overall a not so good experience.",Hao Noodle Chelsea
112,"I haven't written many bad reviews. It's not my thing. This in fact may only be my 2nd. so they don't come easy. I was so excited to go to a historic Italian Resturant while in NYC for a few hours after a cruise. Much to my surprise, the quality of the food was average. Nothing special. We were offered a special of the day (every Sunday) 4 pasta dishes on a large platter. Veggie lasagna, Manicotti, Gnocchi, and Bolognese. All this for $60.00 which wasn't too bad. $15.00 per portion. When we got to the manicotti it was actually rotten! I mean actually tasted like it was made with spoiled milk. The waitress was informed and she came back with the manager. They both apologized and agreed that they tasted it and it was in fact spoiled. What was even more surprising than getting rotted food but their idea of ""Taking care of the customer""... we'll take off $10.00Astonishing! Where is customer service. They didn't offer to comp our meal let alone comp the cost of the portion of the meal that was rotten $15.00",Although I was really excited to try this place I went there with the family Tuesday around 6:30 in the evening they told me there would be an hour wait so I put my name on the waitlist but unfortunately they never text me that my table is ready. Needless to say this was a complete disappointment as we needed to now find somewhere else to eat and the kids were tired and hungry,"We went there to celebrate a BD, had reservations for 6:30 and was seated around 6:50...not bad! But waiting was not very pleasant...the Place was so crowded that some people were standing outside on the street!This is a very big restaurant & very loud place...more like a big market place restaurant! The signatures big 'shareable' plate are big...I was not very impressed with the quality of the food! If you planning on having a long quiet conversation with the people you share the food...good luck!The prices were on the high end as well...I'd rather spend my lonely in a small quieter place, probably will pay less!","We came here for a coworker's bday. Our office is nearby so I know the restaurant is crazily full pretty much all the time, so make sure you get your reservation before coming here to skip the wait.The restaurant offers Italian family style food, which means everything is HUGE in portion for sharing. We had the steak, seafood pasta, fried calamari, meatballs, etc... too many dishes I don't remember them all. In general the food was good, very tasty, but I think they were a bit on the oily side. The one I enjoyed the most was the Titanic - yup, that gigantic dessert was my pick! It has everything you want to satisfy that sugar crave! The chocolate was so soft and tasted like happiness, with ice cream, whipped cream and other toppings. It's great to order if you are here with a big group, cuz this thing is going to put a big smile on everyone's face.","After seeing a Broadway Show I decided to go grab a quick bite at Carmine's. Since I was alone, I didn't have to wait on the long line. I sat at the bar and was waited on by the awesome waitstaff.  Let me hurry up and get to the food. The wings were awesome as usual. I couldn't stop eating them and licking my fingers. I was also able to try the zucchini fried thanks to a nice young lady next to me. I'm so ordering them the next time I go as they were so delicious. Carmine's I'm seeing another show in two weeks and will be back for more wings and zucchini fries.",First of the portion are huge! Too much for two people even at just one salad and one entree. That's the main reason for a star deduction. It was such a waste as we couldn't take the left overs with us. They need a serving for 2 people. FYI they don't have a frozen Bellini.The Caesar salad tasted okay. They put too much sardines or perhaps it was because they put a lot of dressing. The salad serving was enough for 4 people. The lasagna was the hit of the night. It tasted great. Not acidic for a tomato base entree. Not sweet either. Not too much meat or cheese. It was surprisingly light for lasagna but just right.We had Italian cheesecake that a couple next to us shared because once again the servings are huge. This was cold unlike another restaurant I hade tried one at before. My wife hit the nail on the head to describe as powdery. It was a bit dry which gave it this texture. Second deduction due to salad and dessert. I would love to come back to try other dishes however would need 3-4 people and we would need to agree on the one dish we want to try. Tony D's or Serafina's will be my likely options.,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Times Square
113,"Unfortunately I was not satisfied with my meal. I ordered the 16oz ribeye. It tasted like they accidentally spilled the whole container of salt on the steak. I also ordered the fries with were very salty. My cholesterol felt high afterwards. As for the drinks, I ordered the signature martini that the waiter suggested and it tasted like poisonous cough medicine.","Nice atmosphere and people at this place. Unfortunately though for me, the food was just okay. In my opinion, not worth the price. I probably won't go back.","Good place for lunch, dinner, or a drink.  The food is good and the staff is friendly.I do think it is overpriced, but it is on Park Avenue.","This review is specifically for the quinoa veggie burger.  I came here recently for a work lunch (this place would otherwise be out of my price range for a weekday meal).  There are not many menu options for vegetarians, but their take on a veggie burger is actually worth ordering. It comes with burrata (!!!), roasted tomatoes and pesto. I've never had a veggie burger with burrata before and it was a game changer.  Price wise, the burger was $16 and didn't come with a side.  An order of french fries will set you back an additional $7.  Welcome to Park Avenue! I think everything is overpriced in this neighborhood, so I don't think I will be back until it's time for another meal that's billable to an expense account.","The rare occasion when I'm so impressed with service that even if the vegan options are pretty meager, I can't rate an establishment less than three stars. Park Avenue Tavern, you're doing something majorly right!We were in a massive time crunch yesterday evening and needed a quick dinner close to Grand Central so that I could meet my fiancé after work and before seeing a Broadway show. In general, I try to avoid dinner in the theater district, so I searched Yelp and found Park Avenue Tavern, with its impressive 4 star average and hundreds of reviews. There is definitely an after-work crowd, as you'd expect. Lots of suits in their 30s/40s and it's louuuuud. That said, it's a well-behaved crowd and not annoying as one might expect. It may not be my scene, per se, but I can hang. I have to wonder if it gets more chill as the suits drink their fill and head home? I did like the ambiance otherwise and the space is huge with two floors and an enormous bar in the center of the room. We were seated in the back (glad I made reservations). As I mentioned, the service here is standout. In a place this busy, I wouldn't expect to be so well attended-to, from our extremely nice waitress to the bus boy and food runner. There was also an equally attentive blonde lady, possibly a floor manager, who walked the room to make sure people had their drinks coming. Experts. I have to hand it to the manager of this operation.I also appreciated how the menu indicates allergens. I checked with our waitress to see if the hummus was vegan (it usually is, but some places might garnish with feta) and she checked with the kitchen and informed me that while the hummus is vegan, the pita is not, so they substituted cucumbers, which I prefer anyway. The hummus is tasty, nothing earth shattering at $12 for an app size, but good enough. Like I said, nothing on the menu would really have me compelled to return, except for drinks (and not the sangria, unfortunately, as it tasted like sweetened rosé). They have a Prosecco by the glass that's pretty decent.In closing, as others mention, the prices are pretty much what you'd expect in this area, so although I doubt I'd go out of my way to return here, I do appreciate the amazing service. My experience was overall positive and I'll leave it at three stars for a decent option just two blocks away from Grand Central.","Amazing bottomless brunch and amazing service. Found this place on Pulsd, where I find most of my brunch spots! Bought a $49 bottomless brunch voucher for 2 and was delighted by the food and service. I ordered the spicy grilled chicken sandwich and my brother got the steak and eggs. Both were absolutely delicious, flavorful and well portioned. As for the mimosas- they were amazing and free flowing, we didn't have to ask for a refill once- our waiter was that attentive! Will be back here for dinner or another weekend brunch.",Park Avenue Tavern
114,"I am giving 3 stars not because there was anything necessarily wrong with this place but it was just ok to me. I've been to Spain so maybe I am biased when it comes to tapas. I will say the wine seemed to be a hit when it came to others in the restaurant the same time as me as while bottles were being ordered maybe I missed out by ordering the strawberry ""sangria"". This was not sangria but simple a strawberry syrup with some kind of sparkling wine served in a regular glass. Nothing specialAbout it definitely not worth the $12 I paid for it. I had the shrimp in white wine sauce, now hear me out I get tapas are a small dish but for $13 I expected more than 4 shrimp on my plate I would've been ok with 6 and let the price slide. Lastly I had calamari which I didn't finish as it was too chewy and had a fishy smell which I have never experienced with calamari before. As stated in other reviews the place is tiny and does get crowded quick I got there 3 minutes after opening and by the time I left about 45 mins later it was packed. It was a cute restaurant but definitely not the taste of Barcelona I was hoping for.","We came with a reservation for 5, not knowing how uncomfortably small this restaurant was. It was so small that we had to move the table just so other diners could get up from their seat throughout the night. The food and service were decent, but I wouldn't at all recommend coming here with a larger group, as it will not be comfortable.","Eh.  Not sure I'll ever come here again. Maybe for the sparkling strawberry sangria...The tapas menu didn't really *wow* me, and it's very small, not to mention pricier than most tapas.  Not so much intimate as pretentious.  Hey, when you're next door to a divey Mexican place (with a divey taco place on the bottom floor) and a divey Spanish place, your pretentia doesn't really mesh here.",Love this place! Their sangria is the best and the service is always top notch!Can't wait to come back,"GREAT deal on tasty sangria. It makes sense to get the pitcher vs. just a glass.Food was very good, I recommend the shrimp in the white wine sauce or the beef skewers. The empanadas are really good too!","This was a so-so tapas experience. The strawberry sangria was very tasty but the food was just okay. The flavors were not that intense and everything was very buttered up. I liked the cozy feel of the restaurant and fast service. Our food came out pretty quickly.I tried:-Sparkling Strawberry -Chipirones Fritos (calamari)-Banderillas Con Chorizo De Pato (duck sausage skewers)-Langistinos (prawns)-SpinachAll the dishes came out at the same time and they were nothing to write home about. I was still hungry at the end of our meal.When I came in to ask for a table the staff seemed flustered and gave me a 25 minute wait time. Shortly after, a couple came in after me and was also given the same time but then seated before me.",Las Ramblas
115,The food here is really good. But this is the third HD site I have experience of -- also Brooklyn and Philly -- and the service is brusque verging on hostile. And this one is really noisy. Order takeout.,"First, let me be clear by saying that everything about this place was great except for what I am about to mention. Only reason this place deserves a 2 instead of a 4 or 5 star rating is due to the woman/host (person who brought us to the table) rushing us. We (party of 2) arrived around 6pm. We noticed that over time, the place started to get crowded quickly. Needless to say, we had no idea that the overcorwdednss would be the reason for the host (person who took us to the table) to rush us SEVERAL TIMES by saying ""there's people waiting so you have to hurry up"". Who does/says this?! I was still having my drink and I tried telling her this twice! To make matters worse, our table had to be shifted by HER twice to make room for the tables adjacent to us. And she had the nerve to rush us!!! Due to this poor and inconsiderate service, we will not be returning! Manger: pls train your employees properly and teach them how to cater to customers. This event occurred on April 11, 2019.","Walking by this restaurant many time, always curious in there, from day and night there are always crowded and noisy, unlike the next doors Chinese joints this place are full of locals, I mean more western faces than just Asian faces. Today at lunch we decided to give it a try. Around 12:30pm was supposed the peek of serving time, we got a only table that was left.Serving by English speaking servers, foods we ordered were somewhat similar to traditional Chinese dishes. The spice fish filet came with 4 pieces off the lunch menu, deep fried, and on the greasy side, pork belly slice were also ok.In all just average place, $$ signs, on the pricy side, place is very noisy.there are two more chines restaurants back to back, if I have to choose for flavor, authenticity, that place would be on my 3rd last option.","Clearly this place is known for their DAN DAN NOODLE.Verdict: I agree. Easily one of the best and most authentic tasting dan dan noodles I've ever had. The noodle texture has very high quality, but it's really the sauce (which they mix in for you) that really makes this dish shine. I usually start getting tired of dan dan noodles after a while because the sauce starts giving the noodles a slightly dried out texture, but the one here didn't have that problem at all. The only issue is that it lacks a little meat. If they served it with some more ground pork for a little more money, I think it would be perfect.","Han DynastyDouble cooked pork was more like double cooked two weeks ago pork... man the pork was dry, it will cuts your throat as it goes down. U see, I am ok with high priced Chinese restaurant , you should charge higher because good chef is pricy, good ingredient cost even more! but Wow, the food remind me of some cheap Chinese take out. My man! Charge me an arm and leg, I am ok with it, if money was a problem, I would not be in manhattan. I thought The Bao on St markt st was poor man's foodHan is just bad!!!!!! 宫保鸡，u can say F U to me if I ask you to cook something so call traditional, ~~or something taste the same from China, which so many fu*king American born Chinese always like to say. I feel u, people don't know sh*t ! Dude, make your own Version of it, be creative, bring it to another level . But! Just ! Don't be fu*king lazy! Your version of Kong bao chicken was more like sesame chicken from cheap take out but add some green bell pepper and peanuts to it ! Dude, and don't tell yourself that I just made this for white people because it is something they will like! Please! Just please!! Chef ( u are not chef, I call you chef just to be polite, u only cook! ) do better, yes u can, I know u can, go on YouTube and take a look of any video of how to cook a basic 回锅肉 and 宫保鸡丁 please ! Or don't call yourself a Chinese restaurant! Extra star for those front of house!","A few updates: The service has gotten friendlier, which is cool. Unfortunately, the quality of the Dan Dan noodles has diminished (particularly at lunch) and is a bit too wet now. Don't get me wrong, I still order them here and there, but it used to be a go-to. There are plenty of amazing options and I'm still obsessed with this place. I recently moved to DC and sometimes I'm not sure if I miss Han Dynasty or my fiance more.

It's so heavy and rich.The Cuban sandwich I thought was good and simple, not an expert here but wasn't sure how different this was from a ham and cheese panini with some mustard though ‍","Came here on a Sunday afternoon with my bf for a drink and a snack. It wasn't too busy -- lots of open tables. So we sit down at a little corner table which happens to be a 3-top. Soon after, one of the waitresses comes by and asks us if we can move to one of the 2-tops just in case a party of 3 comes in. It seemed a little silly considering how empty it was but we agreed and moved down to a 2-top.A few min later another couple walks in and sits at the corner 3-top. The waitress comes by, hands them menus and doesn't ask them to move! So when she comes back to us I ask her why they are allowed to sit there but not us, and she mumbles something about how they'll need to move too and rushes away. Soon after, the waitress takes their order! They had a bunch of bags on the third seat so clearly weren't waiting for a third. Wtf? No explanation was given to us even after I acknowledged the situation. At that point we walked out, totally appalled at the situation. Thanks for discriminating against us, apparently.","This was my favorite go to place and I've been here since 2013. Whenever I was in the area, always I tried go to this place for eat but I was disappointed at this time.

Some of side was cold or just warm.If we're there for eat our corn, I will return our corn to them. We were walked away and eating on the street.

I ordered the Cuban sandwich and my sister ordered the roast pork entree. The grilled corn was DELICIOUS!!! If you come here, definitely get the corn!!! The sweet plantains were also pretty good! I really liked the Cuban sandwich. The bread was toasted perfectly, and the sandwich was pretty big! It also comes with a side of fries. The roast pork entree comes with beans and rice, and it tasted pretty good as well!

Fantastic selection of drinks for just $8, including several pisco sours, all served with complimentary yuca chips and sauce.The food itself is good but hardly mind-blowing. The Arroz con Mariscos was hearty but too salty, and the Lomo Saltado (my litmus test for Peruvian restaurants) was a 7/10.

But the food is just okay and very pricey considering the service and food quality.. the service is really really bad. They are not organized at all and often times three waiters would come to your desk asking the same questions. Then they never served me water until we finished. Desk was very messy the entire time since they didn't clean it up. I am very disappointed.,updating based on my last experience. i came alone again for a late lunch. i was seated and went to the rest room to wash my hands. upon approaching the restroom i was approached with hostility by a man behind the bar (looked like a manager or owner). it was such an uncomfortable experience that the woman that sat me had to come up finally to stop him and allow me to pass.maybe he thought i was gonna steal the toilet seats... pick your battles more wisely dude...anyway when i came out of the bathroom they were all watching my in a line with the hostile guy eyeing me down with a face of disgust. i literally was in there for maybe 1 min to wash my hands but the walk of shame after was very uncomfortable...i still ate there out of principle (i know i should of left but this guy obviously was upset a black women was going to the bathroom that he thought was not a restaurant customer)....i will not be returning because the treatment of all people is important to me and at the most basic levelif you own a restuarant you should respect all types of people (whether or not they look to you like theyd sneak a free bathroom use ),"The service was pretty good and they were nice. Didn't rush us when we didn't know what to order. We ended up ordering the 99 bucks combo set. I don't think it's worth it. Just order separately and the amount of food is probably double what we got with the set. The fries and calamari that was part of the combo set all came in 1 little bowl. I thought it was going to be 2 separate bowls. One for fries and one for calamari. They gave me a same of their house special sauce to see if I can handle the spice. Very thoughtful of them. We also got the fish dish. Skin was very crispy but the big plate it came in looked deep and big but it was very shallow. For the amount of seafood we got....it wasn't worth the 99 bucks. They gave free watermelon in the end. And because it was my birthday, they gave us complementary beer. The lady was very kind.",I went here for the first time last weekend.My boyfriend ordered the crayfish. The sauce was pretty good and the he enjoyed his meal.I ordered the king crab leg boil with the mild Cajun seasoning. It came with corn and potatoes. The sauce was absolutely amazing and had me wishing for the recipe. The crab however was lack luster. It was mostly joint pieces with only one easy leg piece. I've been to places that give less food but more actual legs and I much prefer that to struggling.The food is good. The staff are friendly. Just don't order the King crab seafood boil because there has got to be something easier.,"A perfect fusion of Chinese styled Cajun boils. We got the shrimp boil with konjac noodles, potatoes, and corn. The sauce we got was the house special. The Sauce - If you can imagine Szechuan and Cajun styled sauces together this is it. There is a lot of minced garlic in this sauce and I would put some on my peeled shrimp to enhance the flavor. It does it spicier over time starting off at mild. Having water helps keep the dish from overpowering your senses.Potatoes - They didn't get a lot of the flavor of the sauce but they were good at cooling down the heat from the sauce. Konjac Noodles - Highly recommend ordering this! This is probably what makes the seafood boils shine because it captures the flavors of the sauce perfectly. There is some bite to the texture of the noodles that really makes it fun to eat here.",Sup Crab
119,"I'm not sure if I remember Buttermilk Channel very fondly (ate here many moons ago), or if my experience this time was meh, but I left unimpressed. Wife and I reserved dinner at about 5:30p on a weekend, and were seated in a dark two-top right at the kitchen pass. This has happened so often lately (in other places) that I'm beginning to think it's a thing - give rezzies the bad table b/c people over-reserve due to FOMO. I can't fault restaurants for doing that per se, but if that's a problem, then don't take reservations. That's just guesswork, but the takeaway is that our seating left a lot to be desired, and there were better options.Speaking of the kitchen, it was slow. Which would be fine if the food was worth the wait, and sadly, it wasn't - my steak was unevenly cooked. To be fair, the seasoning was on point, but that's the hard part, or it should be ...I will say that our peach galette dessert was perfect. Not sure if it was made in house, but it tasted like it.Lots of vegetarian options, too. I'm not a vegetarian, but IMO a restaurant should have plenty of veg options if they want to be taken seriously.I think it's noteworthy that there was a ton of kids here. Like, eating usual everyday dinner (must be nice, but then again, this is Carroll Gardens).I have two of my own, so I'm used to kids, but there were so many that it was almost odd.Buttermilk Channel was not as good as I remembered it, but I remembered it as being phenomenal. Our dinner was fine I suppose, but not outstanding, which is what I expected.Five stars with a loss of one star each for bad seating/poor lighting, and a slow kitchen with uneven cooking.","Just ok is not ok . Not bad , a very nice space and the cocktails were good . The chicken was a bit salty as was the corn bread.",The Pecan Pie French Toast is outta this world The pricey eggs and bacon as a side  not so much. If you charge 15 bucks for french toast you should make breakfast staples like eggs and bacon cheap if your going to charge to have them as a side my only complaint.,"You're always going to have a quality meal at Buttermilk Channel whether it be brunch, lunch or dinner. You'll pay a Brooklyn premium for it, but it's actually worth it. The food is always mouth watering no matter what you order (though the fries and popovers are TO DIE FOR). I'm also partial to their pickles (which they sell to go too). Drinks are well made, if not a little small on the pour/price ratio. Bonus on kids' meals are the clown sundae (upside down ice cream cone with ultra premium ice cream). Service is consistently friendly and upbeat (read no snobbery) and water is continually filled throughout your meal (extra helpful as fries can be salty). I'm so glad they've been able to stay in the hood for a long time as they're certainly a staple. If you haven't checked them out ever - what's wrong with you? If it's been a while, make it a point to head back while the outdoors are still perfect!","Drive by here a lot back then, remembered there was always a long line. So i decided to give this place a try with couple friends. Got seated pretty quick on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. Not too impress with the food, more towards the plain side, no seasoning. Drink is disappointing. Thought i ordered an cup of ice or something. 80% ice in my drink, and 20% i don't know what it is. Shouldve follow my mind, not to order drink and stick with tea or something. Or maybe its me, im comparing the drink to cocktail bars. Overall, mehh experience. Nothing special. Only think good is i got seated quick, food came out pretty quick, and the servicer was pretty nice. Done.","Recently came to Buttermilk Channel for Restaurant Week and wasn't disappointed. The ricotta was out of this world. I would eat that for breakfast, lunch and dinner! The fried chicken and waffles with balsamic syrup were delicious. You don't taste the cheddar in the waffles and the slaw didn't have much flavor though. The pecan pie sundae was the perfect way to end the meal. We brought our own wine since there's no corking fee in Tuesday's, but they also have their drink menu available. The restaurant is typical of what you find throughout Brooklyn, limited space and a lot of tables in close quarters. The exposed brick makes it feel cozy and inviting. However, they could use some extra lighting at night since it got fairly dark inside. Service was a bit slow and we got a new waiter half way through dinner which was unusual. Overall, we had a great meal and will definitely be going back to try some of the other dishes.",Buttermilk Channel
120,Decided to come here for dinner for some authentic Italian food. After trying the lasagna and fried calamari I was sadly disappointed. The dessert was pretty good but I won't be returning.,Waited 20 minutes before I walked out. Menu or water weren't served. Bearers walked by didn't even bother to acknowledge. While the nearby restaurants were swamped. This one hardly had a full patio. I went to this restaurant based on yelp reviews. Total no go.,"From the outside, this looks like your classic hole in the wall Italian spot, and I really wish it were that. It's small, quaint, cozy and a little off the main stretch of Little Italy. Simple decor, nothing extravagant, long and narrow. What first threw me off was that it was a Thursday night, and it was empty. The next thing that was surprising that the waiters/bartenders were not Italian, or anything remotely close to such. The one good thing was that they extended the happy hour deals just for me, even though it was after the end time. I asked what to order, and they basically said everyone gets Fettuccinie with mushrooms/ truffle, or the Oxtail Pappardelle, which neither were something I was willing to try. I then saw they had a Gnocchi special and the waiter spoke highly of it, so I went with the gorganzola Gnocchi. I normally don't love gorganzola, so that may have attributed to why I didn't love my meal, but I overall was not impressed. I also was slightly concerned as the meal came out less then 5 minutes from when I ordered it... which either means its really really fresh, or that its really not. Maybe when you come here you have to get one of the options they are known for, but I just wasn't impressed.","This is my new favorite Italian place in the city. It's cheap, good, and the service is great. I made a reservation because I thought it'd be packed after work hours for happy hour, but it was pretty empty. It filled up later though! Came here with one of my girlfriends and we didn't realize how generous the servings would be, and we ordered way too much. Ordered the kale caesar, penne vodka, and two things from the specials menu: gnocchi w/ this truffle cream sauce & mussels in white wine sauce. Everything was so good, and even though it took us I think almost 3 hours to finish it all, they didn't kick us out. We even used the check-in for free dessert. We chose the cheesecake and wow, it was a freaking fat slice. And of course, the wine prices just cannot be beat. $22 for a carafe during happy hour? In NYC? Officially in love.Would probably order less next time, but any time I'm craving Italian, this will be my go-to.","This Italian place off the main action of Mulberry Street is a sleeper hit that is both cozy and of good value. Little Italy gets old fast with tons of tourists and posted menus with $25 spaghetti and meatballs.  Pepe Social has $10 lunch specials, a good happy hour with $4 beer and wine, and pasta plates starting around $18.   Staff is friendly and swift.   Happy hour wines are of decent quality and $4 is kind of amazing for Manhattan, yet the place remains quiet during happy hour.  The home gnocchi was pretty damn good and shareable for two.   This little cafe isn't fancy and the food is very good as well as reasonably priced.  If you want to avoid the tourists in little Italy for a laid back meal or want a cheap happy hour downtown - this is a great choice.","Cozy and intimate Italian restaurant with attentive staff.My friends and I went to Pepe Rosso for a get-together. We enjoyed the appetizers and the mains which were traditional cooked Italian dishes.Clams were cooked perfectly with delicious sauce, some in our group went for clam dish mains after the appetizer.One minor criticism, the burrata wasn't as flavorful due to lack of balsamic.I would recommend Pepe Rosso if you want some authentic Italian dishes.",Pepe Rosso Social
121,"The service was great! But I'm rating this place on the food and I was a bit disappointed that there weren't many vegetarian options. So really I was stuck eating something I really didn't want. I recommend this place if you are a carnivore, but not if you are a vegetarian .","I'm sad to write this review as I used to really like this place, but I feel that the quality of the food has really fallen.I went last night and we ordered the shrimp jeon, fried chicken, and the ddukbokki hot pot.shrimp jeon: no issues. cooked pretty well so the crispy exterior remains intact.fried chicken: greasy. there were four pieces of JUST fried batter included in our order. the chicken itself is un(der?)seasoned so you are forced to use the dip (too sweet) or dip in the salt/pepper yourself. why not just s&p this before it comes out??ddukbokki hot pot: this is where i'm really confused. it's called ddukbokki, but there were literally six pieces of dduk in the entire dish. i'm also not a fan of the taste as it's not spicy and it's more of a mixture of gochugaru and jjajang sauce. it's peculiar and not that appealing.i've tried to give this place a fair try, but i don't think i'll be dining here again and there are better korean options just a block away.",,"My favorite restaurant in NYC! This place serves some seriously good Korean food, and some of the best banchan (side dishes) I've ever had. Very friendly staff, high quality dishes, great banchan and the perfect ambiance makes this place a must-try in K-Town. I always look forward to the banchan that is served when dining at a Korean restaurant, and this place has some great banchan. You're not just getting your typical low quality dishes, but you're getting a lot of  banchan that is typically not served in restaurants. Some of my favorites were the braised pork + egg and the sweet shrimp. I couldn't tell what the rest were but they were good! I really could have a whole meal with nothing but rice and their banchan. Don't forget to ask for your free refills!On to the entrees, they're superb. We ordered the fire-grilled pork, Korean style pancakes, and the seafood japchae. If I were to recommend one I'd say the pancake - it's tasty and will fill you up for a good price. Each dish here is of such high quality and there are so many choices to choose from here. Prices were pretty fair considering the fact that you also get unlimited banchan.Also huge shoutout to the staff. The staff here is very warm and welcoming, and were always refilling waters or bringing more banchan. That, along with the restaurant's presentation and the overall vibe made it a perfect choice for a dinner out.Overall, Her Name is Han gets my vote for best restaurant in K-Town. If you're craving Korean food, I'd recommend this place over any others in Koreatown.",Very nice polite and friendly staff. Food was great and simple and very tasteful. My mother does not like too salty food but she loves how the bossam tastes like. Strongly recommend this place.,"Weekend brunch looks good. Taste wise? Meh. Go for the weekday lunch specials. I was trying to decide between having soba or this. But I got off the train late and went here instead.Started off with the dumplings appetizer - I got full off of that almost. The dumplings were way better. I got the hamburger but it honestly had the taste and texture of Italian meatballs. Not a fan. There isn't anything Japanese about it. It's pretty firm, not soft and fluffy. Go to Ootoya for Japanese Hamburg. There's onions inside it. The sauce tastes straight up Italian: kind of sour.The waitress recommended the bulgogi- I wish I had gotten that or even the grilled mackerel instead. :( I like the weekday lunch specials better. There's more on the menu and there seems to be more for the side dishes. Weekend brunch: arugula salad, 2 pieces of cauliflower, kimchi, lackluster soup, half a deviled egg, lotus root and potato salad. Thank god I ordered the dumplings! I ate half my meatballs. Weekend menu feels really fusion Asian cuisine. Next time I'm getting soba instead...",Her Name Is Han
122,"The Hive not only has amazing food and drinks but their service is INCREDIBLE. I ordered take out from there and went to pick it up. When I got home I realized my salad was wrong so I called and was cranky of course after a long day. They felt so bad and realized they read the take out order wrong. They refunded me and within No joke, 5 minutes someone came to my apt with the right salad and A ROSE! This has NEVER happened. Thank you Hive and thank you so so so very kind person for bringing this with a rose as well!You guys are the best!","The service was great the food??? I ordered Chicken N Waffles. I've never had Where  the breaded coating was falling off the chicken. Normally you fry chicken with flour.!The table we sat at was too small for 4 people. We asked to be seated at a bigger table. Request denied & mind You the place was particularly empty. We did a brunch there 10:30am. I chose The Hive b/c it was a woman run restaurant. That's what I get for being biased. My Mom said she didn't enjoy the Hive Burger, when I asked her to explain her response too average. Oh, well.","The service was great the food??? I ordered Chicken N Waffles.

I always believe in second chances.","This is a nice bar to grab a few drinks with friends (especially during happy hour), but I feel compelled to warn you:You don't need to upgrade from a regular order of fries to a table share for four people with a flight of four dips. First of all, they are steak fries, and not quite as crisp as this man would like for the purposes of lots of dipping. Secondly, this giant bucket of potatoes is way, way more potatoes than anyone need ever eat. I suppose there were only three of us, but we all walked out in considerable pain. And while the dips were solid (although the super spicy mango habanero"" was not very spicy, let alone super spicy), we did order some ketchup also because some things just go together. The brussels sprouts are excellent.","This spot was definitely a good selection for lunch during a stroll through williamsburg.  The staff was friendly and quickly accomodated my guest and I.The food was pretty decent also.  The flounder with lentils was absolutely flavorful, and the chicken sandwich was good as well (was a little bready).  Especially the sauce that the chicken was covered or fried in definitely gave it a yummy kick!The cocktails were delicious as well.  The cocktail with sorrel infused mezcal was one of a kind that I would definitely return for.  The entire cocktail menu looked stellar and was well presented as far as how the cocktail would be delivered.The interior decoration was well balanced, neutral, and had intriguing accents throughout.  The only thing is that although it was named the hive, there are artificial spiders located which is a slight throw off. LolOverall a good experience and would definitely recommend.","With all of the great restaurants in this area of Williamsburg, I expected better from this place. Food was very average, drinks were above average, but the service was absolutely terrible. We were in for brunch on Sunday, and it wasn't terribly busy - there were plenty of open tables. Once we sat down, it took us about 20 - 30 minutes to get our drinks, including our coffees. I can't remember a time I've waited so long for a drink other than at a craft cocktail bar...It then took another hour for us to receive our food. During that time, only once did our server check in on us to ask if we had not yet received our food (uh, duh, do you see any food on our table?). We waited a good 20 minutes after this check in for our food to actually arrive - no apology from the waiter, no more check-ins, not even after we did actually receive our food. When our server was rushing by us another 20 minutes after we had eaten, we asked for the check. He appeared miffed by this request, and when he returned with our bill basically threw it on the table. Overall, don't waste your time. Plenty of other, much better options in the area.**Update** After I also left a review on Resy as well as here, the restaurant reached out to me to let me know they had heard there had been problems with service the day of my visit, and hoping to get more info on my experience to solve the issue with their staff. They also offered to have me and a guest come back in free of charge to give them another shot. It sounds like this was an out-of-the-ordinary case for them, and they are very concerned with ensuring they improve, and I will be (hopefully) updating this review once I have the chance to make it back in!",The Hive
123,"$32 for a good Japanese breakfast.  $32!!!!!! And I had the Spanish mackerel, which costs less than $10/lb, probably $5-6. So for $32 I got a 4 oz piece of mackerel, a miso soup, rice and a few veggies. A meal that at the same restaurant cost $12 four years ago. It's obscene. I will never go back there again. And anyone that is willing to pay $32 for that breakfast is part of the problem. Gentrification on steroids. A price that only 20% of the neighborhood could even consider.","I want okonomi for breakfast everyday. I think that pretty much sums it up. Other minor details include limited seating, being a bit out of the way in terms of location. And if you're not a fan of rice, seafood and veggies , you probably won't like it too much. I appreciate that the flavors of the food come from the ingredients it self.","This place is apparently one of the famous restaurant all Korean celebrities go to when they come to New York, so my sister and I decided to check this place out. The food was delicately prepared and the server was great in striking up a conversation with us. The place was smaller than what I thought it would be, but it didn't matter. The food portion, when you look at it first, it's not that much. But when you start eating it, you'll realize that it is plenty for a women. I'm not sure about a man.","OKONOMI serves the perfect breakfast.The rice is slightly nutty, every individual grain is cooked to chewy perfection, and the grains stick together just enough to be edible with chopsticks. The bowl is remarkably consistent throughout, with no overcooked or undercooked spots. Mix the onsen egg in for a slightly richer, creamy blend.The rest of the breakfast consists of a slice of fish and a variety of little sides. Each side, from the sweet, light tamago to the greens with mayo and pepper, is a delightful little world of flavor. Both the striped bass and the mackerel are tender and flaky with a subtle marinade and crispy skin.","Honestly, I was disappointed.After an hour wait to get in (they're walk-in only) we were given mostly cold/lukewarm food. Our rice was cold, the egg to put into the rice was cold, and the only thing hot was the soup.The fish was good, but not great. It just tasted like salty fish. No amazing flakiness or special preparation, just lukewarm fish.Did everything taste good? I guess. Was the experience at all what I expected out of a breakfast-warm, filling, tasteful?No. I was really disappointed to wait an hour just to have incredibly bland, cold food. Maybe we just came on an off day but man, for $32 a person I was pretty sad.","Okonomi serves great Japanese breakfast at an expensive price tag. The place has 2 tables for 8 and counter for 4. The place is relatively small, and waiting in line is almost always required (no reservation). Our wait was around 30 minutes. Parking was easy to find on weekend noon.Okonomi serves the traditional Japanese breakfast with two add on options: ikura $6 and poached egg $2.5. The set itself is $32 with a selection between bluefish and swordfish grilled with miso paste. The set also came with a bowl of rice, miso soup, grilled eggplant, corn salad, marinated vege and beans with mustard paste. Although I liked the swordfish over the bluefish, both fish were extremely tender, you will not be disappointed by the flavor, gotta love that miso.We also liked the tamago and eggplant. The tamago was very sweet. Overall the assortment was great seasonal selections. At the price tag, we were very surprised about the portion, yes, very light. Everything was lightly seasoned and cooked, and the poached egg went extremely well with the rice. No doubt the quality of food lived up the standard, but the portion (or price) did not. No tip required, service was great and on par. I would consider it a one time try, no need to return often. Came in with high expectation looking at all the great reviews, results came in lower.food 3.5/5value 2/5ambiance 4/5service 3.5/5",Okonomi
124,"Damn, I really wish I could've given this place more stars. My friend from out of town came for her birthday and I had hyped up this restaurant for a couple days. We let the host know that it was a birthday dinner when we made the reservation. Unfortunately, our waiter was missing during the whole experience. We got a single drink and then he didn't come back to our table till we were long done eating. By then, we just asked for the bill. Also, the gratuity is added and totaled into the bill but that was never mentioned? We weren't even offered a birthday desert. Guys, wtf? The food is good. The staff is aloof :-(","It's always sad when a place you used to love becomes a place you'd rather not return to. I came here two years ago with a friend. We absolutely fell in love with the inferno pizza for its amazing flavors and extra spicy kick. So much so, that I would crave it for days after eating it. Two years later, still having fond memories of the pizza, I came back with high hopes. Not sure if the recipe changed or the chef changed, but the inferno pizza I received today was nowhere near as good as when I first had it in 2017. After a few bites it tasted like any regular old pizza, I thought maybe they forgot the chili oil that makes it spicy so I asked the waitress for extra oil. Even though I doused my slice in it, the flavors were still bland. So disappointing :(","Not very good service. That was a big turn off. Not friendly and not fast. I was turned off. Had the Brown Butter Gnocchi with braised lamb, hazelnuts and cheese. Pretty good. Sauce was goodness cooked well. Hazelnuts is nice touch. Coffee ok. Clean. Salmon tartare was good. Crowded. Same waitress was really friendly with the table next to us (all guys).","Let me start by saying...I lovedddddd this place. Okay, now that you know where this review is going, let's get to reviewing, lol. Two old coworkers and I get together every few months to catch up and we love wine so typically we choose a place with a great wine selection, perfect choice. We had three starters for the table, meatballs, and two of the Bruschettas: mussels and the truffles honey. Both were super delish but the mussels one was my absolute fave. We also ordered three main dishes to share amongst the table so that we each get a chance to experience more of the menu. The food was absolutely amazing. I didn't get a slice of the Margherita pizza but I did experience both pastas we had, the pesto and the bucatini. Our waitress was super attentive at all times. The place was fairly empty when we got there and was all filled up by the time we left. If I had to duck any points it would be for the busboys. I know they're trying to be helpful and get items out your way as much as possible but they were being too hasty. Touching utensils before someone says they're done is a no no!! 10/10 would recommend this place especially considering the prices are super reasonable!!","This place looked really nice especially the outdoor seating. So I wanted to experience the dining here & im so glad I did!I always have cheese plates with bread & fig jam. So when I came across the Quattro Fommagi pizza with fig, white truffle & Aleppo honey in the menu, I knew this pizza was my calling! The fig & honey gave the pizza a great sweet taste that went so perfectly well with the whipped goat cheese, fonita cheese, mozzarella & Parmesan. I was in cheese heaven! My taste buds were dancing! This is definitely a great place to grab delicious bites and drinks at in the heart of little Italy. Their Rose Sangria is my absolute favorite drink! So fresh crisp & delicious!","This place is amazing! The atmosphere is so nice and relaxing! Food is delicious, priced well, and good size. Will be back soon!",Gelso & Grand
125,"This place is a very cool all-things Italian store. It is a lot of fun to walk through and look at and experience. 5 stars for the atmosphere and viewing experience.5 stars for the cannoli bar. I had a Sheep's Milk cannoli (the Sicilian way!) with pistachios blended into the cannoli cream; it was insanely delicious! Just the idea of a dedicated cannoli bar blows my mind. Unfortunately, my other experience was not so great. I sat at a hightop table and ordered from a limited menu with some friends. I ordered one of 3 pasta dishes available. It was supposed to include prosciutto, which was completely missing. The only items that appeared in my bowl were pasta that looked like spaghetti, ground beef and olive oil. No sauce, no herbs, no vegetables. The bowl itself, though it was priced as an entree, was a small-medium sized bowl. I was starving and ate it, thinking that I made better pasta at home. The pasta was stuck together and clumped in more than one part of the bowl! I would have stopped to show this to my waitress but she had disappeared once again. My waitress was very busy and could not refill the water pitcher on the table, nor ever offer any of us ground cheese or pepper. The mixed drink I tried to order was no longer available. I asked where the prosciutto was, but I was just told it was in there. Somewhere, mysteriously!","The market it self is a nice area to walk around and pick up authentic Italian ingredients to prepare a dinner back home. Such as hand cut pastas, dried cured meats, cheeses, etc. The reason why the one star is for the service we received at Il Pastaio. We were a little hungry and sat at their wrap around bar and the time had one other couple sitting there. They seemed to know the chef and manager because they both came out and were talking to them for a while. After the lady kept talking to them she went by the counter to talk to her employees and never came around to us. The chef stayed talking to them. The manager came back to talk to them and never acknowledged us at this point we knew what we wanted to order. Another couple sat down and they received water and put their drink order in before us. The employee walking the bar seemed hesitant to come to us and we were only about 6 chairs down from them. We decided to just get a drink and went upstairs to serra where our experience was made up for.","This place has become a typical NYC tourist trap....everything is overpriced and the staff have gone from bad to worst....they just don't care about you!Been visiting the restaurants here often as I live in the neighborhood, but recently, my experience has been v unsatisfactoryFor example, yesterday I went to eat some pasta, and they sat me and my friends at the bar even though half the space was empty...ok no probI ordered the spaghetti with a side of the burrata, they dumped a piece of burrata IN the bowl with the spaghetti! ick! like red orange burrata...yuckThe server gave us a really hard time too, he was not interested in working at all....we got a basket of bread after asking thrice, and we reminded him 5 times to refill our olive oil, but it never happened and we paid our check and leftThe pasta was not al dente, stuck in my teeth and the sauce as frankly tasteless....all the line cooks were mexican cooking Italian food lolFor $50 bucks a pop, with a glass of wine....this was a worthless experience....just gotta stop going here..","I've never had a bad thing here....the only annoying factor is the 2.3 catrillion people that walk through every minute!Whenever I'm in NYC, I follow those 2.3 catrillion people to grab myself a beautiful cappuccino, gelato, or a sniff of Italy.  You can get anything Italian here-last I saw, you can even get a plane ticket to Italy.

It's the most delicious combination of coffee and ice cream I've ever met.  If you're a hot chocolate lover, you will never regret trying the hot cocoa here. It's decadent, thick and rich....oh la la!","I went there to buy pastries and a fancy meal for my family for a Friday night champagne and sandwich movie night. I have friends who swear by Eataly, ordering prosciutto and cheeses for their fancy cutting boards. But the truth is Eataly is impressive at branding and nothing else. The space is luxurious and makes a patron feel as if they are in the know about the most elegant Italian options. But the pastries and sandwiches I ordered, spending over $100 on four sandwiches, a tiramisu cake, and eight mini pastries, were so underwhelming and boring. I felt ashamed and angry that I had let my family down for what was supposed to be a small, comfortable, Friday night celebration. There are much better venues to purchase these items, that add flavorful ingredients like salt, pepper, lettuce, tomatoes, hummus spreads, avocados, capers, peppers, and a variety of cheeses to their sandwiches. For example, I ordered a Mozzarella Prime Rib Panini that only came with the sliced prime rib on a piece of hero bread. The cheese was barely detectable. There were NO OTHER INGREDIENTS! The sandwich cost $15.90 plus tax. I could have done better myself shopping at my supermarket. The pastries did not compare to my favorite bakery, Veniero's, except for pricing. If you never had Veniero's, then I guess their pastries would be acceptable. But I have. I imagine there are items at this store worth purchasing, but I won't be finding out. I have great stores that aren't spending so much on branding that deliver every time. Milano's on the Upper West Side has sandwiches that will put weight on your bones, and I can shop for great cheeses at Westside Market. I won't be fooled by branding again.",Eataly NYC Flatiron
126,Worst ever the delivery took 2 hours food arrived cold I called it and complained they said very busy time that's what took so long it was a Tuesday at 3pm like seriously,"Let me say this has been my FAVORITE joint for soup dumplings.However I unfortunately have to share my unpleasant experience- last nights order I found a thick metal ring in my lo-mein pork-shrimp noodles (never going to order that again) It was so hard it could have cracked my tooth. Which is terrifying. To have the metal ring in my mouth was beyond shocking - the metal wasn't a small one. However once I called and complained they were very gracious & accommodating, they sent me 2 more dishes of my choice (soup dumplings & shrimp chive dumplings ) on the house & it was delivered very quickly! (ps- personally I'd just stick to the soup dumplings & regular dumplings) that never disappoints & that's what is the best. Shanghai 21 - I've been your biggest fan for your food- but it's so disappointing to have such a horrible / scary experience- please do a better job in your maintenance & reputation.",Ditto the other reviews. Truffle soup dumplings. Need I say more??? Cash only and very busy at all times of the day,"We came here on a Friday at around 2pm and there was about a 20 minute wait for 2- and it was definitely worth it. This place is awesome!We started with the pork soup dumplings and black truffle soup dumplings, both of which were amazing. Every bite was bursting with flavor (literally). While the black truffle was delicious, I don't think it was worth twice the cost of the regular pork soup dumplings, so I probably would just go with regular pork next time.The shanghai spring rolls were very good, as was the kung pao chicken and the pork fried rice. The serving sizes are generous, so come home hungry! Cash or Amex only.","When there's a long line or wait for a place to eat, it's usually either a very touristy/hyped up place or it's actually really good. I would like to believe it's the latter for Shanghai 21. Always have the soup dumplings and noods cravings and this is the spot my friends and I always have on mind, also closest to everyone. And I wasn't joking one bit when I said long wait because after you put your name down, you're looking at around at least half an hour to 45 minutes, if not longer if you have a bigger party. I've been here several times and it always hits the spot and satisfies all cravings. I really like their soup dumplings because the soup in those dumplings is so good, practically like (meat/chicken - I know there's no chicken in there) broth and it's not your typical oily soup. I mean, some people probably really love the oiliness of the soup in their soup dumplings but I rather go with these. It's served steaming hot in their bamboo steamers, six dumplings in one. The skin is extremely thin and not at all thick at the knot, and with a little ginger vinegar, it seals the deal!The stir fry/pan-fry noodles are always good as well. At times I would consider it too oily, leaving quite a layer of oil on my lips. But you're already there to stuff your face, so who cares? It's always good to go with a few other people and share multiple dishes and sides/appetizers. I usually get the sliced beef perfectly marinated. I often get the scallion pancakes to share as well, best to split with four people, one slice per person. There are plenty of other dishes on the menu to choose from if you're feeling unsure about what to get. The place is not the cleanest but tolerable and ok to overlook a bit for the food. The service is a hit or miss thing but nothing unacceptable. And it's usually a quick meal anyways. Definitely would recommend for those with strong cravings for Shanghainese food, especially for soup dumplings. I personally would keep going back and fight off all hangriness but if you're super hungry, I'm not sure if the wait is for you.","Came here for a date on Saturday morning and it was thankfully not super packed. Although when we left, it was starting to get very crowded. The ambiance of this place is nice and they take American Express (no other cards) and cash only. The service was pretty fast and good. We came and got an order of fried dumplings, soup dumplings and the Shanghainese fried noodles. The fried dumplings came in an order of 6 for $6.50ish. They were OK. The soup dumplings came in an order for 6 for about the same price so not that bad. The meat though for both dumplings tasted sour. I don't know what it was but it really turned me off. I couldn't finish the food and I always finish food. The Shanghai noodles though were very good. They were like lo mein noodles but fried with a nice sauce and gravy on top. There was a hefty portion of meat which was nice. Overall, an OK place, but those dumplings really made me nervous eating here again.",Shanghai 21
127,"I had heard such great things about Buvette, so I figured why not take a friend visiting from Seattle here for brunch? Biggest mistake ever. After waiting 30+ mins for a table, we went inside, made our order, and were finally presented with two tiny plates of food. For the price of nearly $20 an entree, I guess I was expecting more than a piece of toast with some college dining hall scrambled eggs slapped onto it. I legitimately could have made the Jambon Cru in ten minutes in the comfort of my own home instead of paying an exorbitant amount for half a portion size. I give this place 3 stars out of acknowledgement that that dinner options are probably far superior to the breakfast/brunch menu, and because of the cute aesthetics (that I would have enjoyed far more had the food been satisfying). However, my experience here did not live up to the hype, and my friend was seriously not impressed with the New York brunch scene afterward -- brunch in the city is almost always overpriced and overrated, but the portion size at Buvette just really killed me. Take all the ranting and raving over this place with a grain of salt.","A very cozy and slightly cramped French restaurant in West Village. I came here on a Tuesday morning for brunch with a friend and so I didn't have to wait for a table. Even though the restaurant wasn't busy at the time, service was not that great. The waiter wasn't attentive and had a bit of an attitude/was not very friendly. Portions were smaller than expected.","I've been here twice. The first time I waited around 30 minutes and thought the food was quite good but the portions very small and expensive for what they were (as many other reviews will touch on). It was a nice enough experience for me to want to try and come back. The second time was a disaster and we didn't even get to eat the food. We put in our name and waited nearly an hour. We kindly asked the host where we were in line after a woman came out of the restaurant laughing about how she had accidentally erased all the names of the waitlist. He said that we would be up shortly but largely in an annoyed manner. We continued waiting for another 20 minutes until we noticed people who had walked in after were getting seated before us. We then again kindly asked the host for where we were in line to which he angrily stated that our name had already been called. A COMPLETE LIE. We were literally sat by the door waiting and waiting for our name to be called and it NEVER was!! The fact that he insinuated it was our fault that we had waited nearly 1.5 hours for a table for 2 (when we were told 25 min when we put in our name) was insulting and rude. it was clear that he had lost the original order of the list or perhaps never even wrote our names down. While that can be excused as we all make mistakes, the fact that he was so rude and nasty towards us put a horrible taste in our mouth. Never coming back....",@buvettenyc is a cozy little French restaurant located in West Village. I had the signature Jambon Cru. The steamed egg is pillow-like. It doesn't seem that they add anything extra such as butter or cream but they just turn the simple egg into ultimate goodness. You can also have typical French dishes such as croque madame and beef tartare here and I guess you won't disappoint. Note: the dishes are super small and expect a long wait during weekends!More pictures，check out ins@xuxinyi_nancy,"A perfectly quaint cafe/bistro in the West Village with flavorful, fresh French food. I would have given this restaurant five stars for its food and ambiance, but have to take a star off for the service. Without reservations, expect to wait for a table here almost any night of the week. We waited about a half hour. Once we were seated, while the ambiance is quite lovely and seems reminiscent of a French cafe, the tables are very small and close together making for a cramped experience. All of this would have been fine, but once we were seated we asked for some guidance on the menu and were given cursory answers. We ordered the tomato tartine but were instead given a tomato salad that wasn't even on the menu. When we informed the waitress, she didn't offer to replace the dish, but instead informed us that we could order the other in addition. We kept the salad, which although was not what we ordered was tasty. We also ordered the mussels in curry with fries which was equally tasty. However, both dishes were small and not quite satisfying for a dinner. Given the prices, we would have expected slightly larger portions. We finished the meal with an apple pie dessert with whipped cream. This was a surprisingly large portion and satisfied our remaining hunger. I might come back for the French food, and will just be prepared for a little side of attitude (maybe it just adds to the atmosphere :)).","I went to Buvette with a party of 4 at around 1 pm on a Sunday. The restaurant does not take reservations. I would not recommend coming here at prime brunch time on a Sunday with a party of greater than 2 - we watched many smaller parties that arrived after us get seated before we did. The restaurant is small and cozy with tables pretty close together. Service was very fast - we received our food within 15 minutes of ordering. The jambon cru was almost soupy in composition - the prosciutto on top was amazing. The Belgium waffle had a great composition - it was fluffy and the fruit on top was very tasty.We also ordered the Watermelon Lemonade spiked with vodka. The drink was not strong at all - we could not taste any alcohol. It was delicious regardless, but I wouldn't recommend opting to make the drink alcoholic if you're looking for a stronger drink.Overall good food, but not great for large parties during prime time. Would only go back with a party of 2.",Buvette
128,"One of the hardest yelp reviews for me, is at Gramercy Tavern. Let me tell you my pros first...We LOVE this place. Normally we sit at the bar, which we love the process of getting seated. Say goodbye to the stalking of bar seats. When you arrive, tell the bartender you want to sit at the bar and they will put you on the list to be seated. So just order a drink, and hang out! You will get called over when your seat is open. Also the pros- the drinks, food and service! Martinis and wine selection are amazing. The char grilled oyster recipe changes frequently, but whatever it is - GET IT. You will send me a message thanking me later. The bartenders are hospitable, attentive and all around great people! Now, I hate eating this anything less than a 5. We have always had amazing experiences here, but this needs to be noted. For my birthday, I wanted to come to Gramercy for drinks since it is one of my favorites. We go with a few friends, order drinks and some apps including the seafood tower. My husband is allergic to nuts, so naturally I look and make sure that nothing includes nuts as well as alert the person taking the order. When the tower arrives, there was an arctic char seafood that had some questionable toppings. I tasted and immediately asked again to the bartender - are you sure this isn't nuts?? He said no, it's mustard seeds. Another friend of ours did the same thing and also questioned. My husband then had a bite, and at that point the bartender went back to the kitchen to double check (after we said something 3 times now) they were mustard seeds....he comes back a few minutes later and it turns out the kitchen changed the recipe and instead of mustard seeds, they are now PINE NUTS.  I'll let this sink in, and for anyone that has a loved one that is allergic to nuts im sure you are saying - WTF. I am really sad I need to give negative comments here, but allergies are incredibly important! I have no idea how the kitchen changed a recipe to include nuts but didn't inform the bartenders?! Or the bartenders didn't pay attention!? But honestly - Doesn't anyone realize that nut allergies are life threatening???Needless to say, my birthday was ruined. Not happy given I normally love this restaurant, but not sure if I can get around the fact that they were so careless with nuts",Went their for our 6 month anniversary on a Tuesday early dinner mission . It is hard to get on weekends. Spectacular! The bread to die for...the goat butter uuuufffffThe red ruby shrimp....the pork belly...lamb shoulder ...the service.....the dessert!!!!! One of our best meals in NY to date!,Oyster raw and cooked to perfect.. peppers were average but the accompanying sauce was dangerously good... the burger was cooked to perfection and the chocolate pudding is what I want to be incorporated into my last meal!,"Ate in the tavern. Please note that not everything in the dining room menu is available in the tavern.The service in the tavern was AMAZING! At least 8 people worked our table. This may be due to the no-tip policy. It made for a magnificent experience.If you look at the prices on their web-site, this is worth keeping in mind.","I had a lovely dinner experience with friends at Gramercy Tavern. The food is fresh and delicious, quite reminiscent of the food-to-table restaurants of Greece and France. Our table went for the three course meal and it was as if the food was prepared for the gods! The tomatoes were just right and the chicken spoke to my soul with its flavor and tenderness. The service provided by our waitress and our sommelier was charming and kind. They made us feel as if they were old friends and I recommend you dine here for this reason alone!","Gramercy Tavern was absolutely unreal. Went for a business lunch with a client and did the seasonal tasting menu. First off the bread they serve you is incredible. I don't know what kind of crack they're putting in it but the dough is the perfect consistency and taste and they too it off with a goat cheese spread instead of butter. I almost cried from happiness. First course was fluke with Apple and radish. It was SO good as a cold dish with a good sweet and savory flavor. Second was halibut with cannelini beans and kale - the sauce was so good I literally spooned it into my mouth when I was out of solid food. Third was my favorite dish, the squid ink pasta with Brussel sprouts and some crunchy breaded thing. (??) It was SOOOO tasty that I again spooned the remaining sauce into my mouth sans pasta or sprout or crunchy breaded thing. The final savory dish was roasted duck with confit. I can be picky with duck and this was probably my favorite duck dish to date. Lastly we got three desserts - an Apple cidery sorbet that was like cold icy applesauce and so good. We also had these delicious passion fruit chocolate bonbons that looked to be beautifully hand painted and coconut lime jellies. The main dessert was strawberries and cream and was absolutely delectable. All in all it was a fantastic meal. Drinks and tasting came to almost $600 for 5 people. Service was great (although a little slow at the ordering but we were indecisive the first time they came around so understandable). Highly recommend!",Gramercy Tavern
129,"I've been here three times and it slowly gets worse and worse every time. The food is delicious which is why I keep coming back, but the customer service is severely lacking. The hostess is not friendly whatsoever. Acted like I ruined her day when I asked for a table. The worst was my server. Short blonde haired girl. Came to the table 10 minutes after we were seated and said ""what do you want?"" There was no ""how are you"" ""have you been here before"" ""Can I start you with something to drink"". Super unfriendly. Never came back to our table to check on us or ask if we wanted another round of drinks, which we would have if she had been more attentive. It's a shame because I really like the food, but I just can't get over the rude customer service.","This is the best Taiwanese restaurant in New York, but the owners are confused about the heritage and cultural identity of the restaurant.The food here is great. I love the lu rou fan, beef roll, zhajiangmian, and pretty much everything on the menu. It is the only place I know of that serves stinky tofu within 30 mins of Manhattan. In fact, it's one of three full service Taiwanese restaurants around Manhattan. The cocktails are an exciting fusion of Asian herbs and western liquor. The decor here is modern Scandinavian crossed with Brooklyn hipster.What's missing is a feeling of Taiwan. Food is a HUGE part of Asian culture and it is very evident in Taiwanese daily life. From the night markets to the 7-Elevens, there is amazing food on every street corner and every block. Sadly, the only connection to Taiwan is the Chinese characters on the cans of Taiwan Beer.The restaurant opted to dumb down Taiwanese culture to make American diners comfortable instead of creating a dialog. The menu is completely in English with no Chinese while a lot of meaning is lost in the translation. What in the world is a ""nutritious sandwich""? The waiters and waitresses completely butchered the pronunciation of ""zhajiangmian"" and warned me that the sticky tofu is stinky. (Yeah no shit, that's why I want it). Am I supposed to pronounce the Chinese ""lu rou fan"" with an American accent so the wait staff can understand my order too?Dear white people: When the Asians at the table next to you order stinky tofu, please do make a disgusted face and add a snarky comment about how strange it smells. Your opinion is definitely appreciated.The missing star is for the missing soul of this restaurant.","It was good, wouldn't say great. Wait times for a table can be rather long, grab a seat at the bar and forgo the torture of waiting.Jeff was great for service and attentive to both his dining and drinking customers plus mixing for the rest of the restaurant.Portions are mixed bag for size and can feel overvalued. Pea shoots are done well with the fried garlic toppers. Turnip cakes are very dense and don't quite scratch the itch. Make a reservation if you care for a table and enjoy the L train!Interestingly they are inconsistent about naming their dishes on the menu and how they serve it. The zhejiangmian (lamb noodles) were tasty but served with a different label. The same likely goes for any Chinese named dish. Cultural neglect? Maybe.","This is a very solid Taiwanese restaurant. I came on a Sunday night and it was pretty packed. There was already about 10 people waiting outside. They have both inside and outdoor seating, in addition to the bar. The food is very tasty. I ordered the sesame noodles, scallion pancake, and the pork buns. Everything was very fresh and flavorful. The scallion pancake was crispier/crunchier than I'm used to, but still wasn't bad. I would definitely come back if I'm visiting NYC.",Win Som is a brooklyn gem and great for dates and experimenting with unconventional dishes. The drinks here are bomb and the beer is a great pick for first timers. The wait is usually a bit long on a prime day like thurs - sat however worth if it u order a great dish. The fried chicken dish was very messy and a little disappointed.Oh and the music is always good!,"Came here on a Sunday around 11:20am and waited maybe 10 minutes to be seated for 2. They have a small bar at which you can wait and order drinks. We ordered a small iced green tea, which came in this home-brewed canister, large enough to share. It was delightful!For food, we ordered:Tian Dou Jiang (sweet soy milk) - B+O-a Jian (oyster omelette) - A-Sesame Noodles with egg - A-I'm giving them 4 stars for the TASTE of their food alone. However, expect to pay a lot if you like to walk away full, because their portions are much smaller for their prices than in American brunch. Sesame Noodles was a good sized dish (no meat.) Also the Big Chicken and Waffles looked sizable.I probably wouldn't come back for brunch, but still interested in trying their dinner menu!",Win Son
130,"This is the REAL DEAL!I have waited on that line and ALWAYS wroth the wait - My fieance chose THIS place for his NYC birthday dinner - anywhere in the city, his choice and this was it -Need I say morechicken and rice with red and white sauces!Done!","Review #500 has to go to the OG of street food. You don't understand what you've grown up with and taken for granted until you move away and have to eat the crap quality all these other franchises put out.Remember the steaming plate of chicken, beef gyro (what happened to the ""lamb??""), rice, pita and lettuce isn't supposed to be the best. When you need a filling, cheap meal and/or when you're out late at night, THIS is the best. Drench that ish in their mysteriously seducing white sauce, but watch out for the fiery hot red sauce.Also when did they jack up the price to $9?? I remember when it was a $6 steal, the hike to $7, then shanking us at $8 when I last left NY. $9 is a kick in the nuts...I'm still begrudgingly going to pay though. I'm always looking forward to visiting this spot when back in town.","Update:  stopped in yesterday to grab some dinner and in less than a year(?) they raised the price from $8 to $9 for the combo platter..  has the taste changed? Nope! You still get the same portion and same unseasoned meats.   Of all the years I have been coming here, the taste and portions have never changed .","LOVE IT! I'm a fan back home in LA so I was ecstatic to try the OG location in NYC! And it DID NOT DISAPPOINT!! Chicken platter $8 with fresh meat + unlimited white sauce = heaven. Workers are also very kind! Love that they're not stingy with the sauces either. Back in LA, they charge you extra for white sauce. Here, you have the ability to pour as much as you want. Love itttt!","So happy I got to try Halal Guys in New York!!! It taste so much better than the one in California. There's something about eating it here that made such a difference in quality and taste.Since it was raining the night I went, there was barely any line! I decided to get the large combination plate which was about $9. It's half chicken and gyro, salad, rice and pita bread. Don't forget to get extra white sauce because that's one of the best part of this dish. The chicken and gyro was flavorful and cooked just right. The rice and salad adds a nice touch to the dish. I wish they gave more pita bread slices.Honestly, I should have brought some back to CA because now I'm craving it.",I actually came here in my wedding dress at 5AM - before heading to the hotel.My husband still loves the 6th ave spot - and gets excited when we see them pop up in new cities (he travels a lot)KETO friendly for those of my friends and it's still great the day after,The Halal Guys
131,"Someone highly recommended this place to me and so I decided to come here with a couple of friends to check it out.The restaurant itself is quite small and their seats are not comfortable and worst off, our table kept on wobbling because of the uneven floor. Either case we started off with their wings that came in four whole pieces. I thought the wings were good but not for it's hefty price tag of $16 because there wasn't anything usual or unique about it. We then went on and tried their devil eggs and for $5, they only give you one egg that's cut in half with pickled rhubarb and herbs. The egg was cold as if it was just taken out of the fridge. I felt they could have at least warm it up a bit before serving it. We also had their pickled jarred veggies and that was just terrible. There was some awful after taste smell and it should have been served as a garnish rather then an appetizer. For our main dish, we then ordered their smoked goat neck with curry/cherry rice. We were all excited about this dish but once again, a bit of a disappointment. The meat had no flavor and was just mushy all around. As for the rice, I did not taste any curry flavor and it was super oily that I barely even touched my dish. Our waitress though was very nice and attentive. She kept on refilling our water and answered any questions we had. But unfortunately, this is not good enough of a reason for me to want to go back to.","I saw this place had really good reviews and the photos look great but when I came with friends here for brunch our experience was very sub par. First of all at opening time Sunday, it was empty which usually means better service and food at most places before the brunch rush comes.All the food plates came cold, bland, and service was none existent. Yes we could of sent it back but then back in your mind your thinking they will do something bad to it.I had the pumpkin waffles which was drowning in butter, bad syrup and cream so couldn't taste any pumpkin at least the fried duck on top was decent but all of it was cold.The buttermilk biscuits weren't buttermilk they definitely were scones and the butter had zero honey flavor. I had this many times at other restaurants so yeah this failed horribly.It was extremely disappointing and will not be returning again.",The goat neck is a must. Tender to the point that the meat just run off the neck. Duck tasted good. The oak wood smoked rib need a little more work on it as I can hardly smell the burning wood smoke. However the ribs is tender enough.,"I came here on a Wednesday evening with a reservation. It was not that crowded and I feel like even without a reservation, it would have been fine.I was given the option of sitting inside or outside and both options looked lovely.I tried the ribs, the mussels, and the collard greens ($11). The ribs were to die for; honestly the best ribs I have had in nyc. They were so juicy and tender. There was a lot of meat on the bone. Each of us had one rib and we were very full from it. I packed one rib to go and it was filling enough to be another meal the next day. I loved the sauce on the rib as well, which made it unique rather than a typical bbq flavoring. The mussels were pretty nuanced as well in the sense that they had already been ""de-shelled"". I loved how they were dipped in oil. They came with a delicious bread coated with a nice, creamy dip, which I had not been anticipating! The only part of this meal I did not particularly enjoy was the collard greens. I just felt they were overpriced as they could have been even $5-6 instead. I was very full from this meal and was not able to order the beignets but in the future, I would love to try them.The service was great here as well- prompt, and the waitress was polite.","Pretty damn slammin' dinner. We went with some friends and had a great meal.Try the goat neck, seriously.The nori chicken was also delicious.Cocktails were also pretty good and the waitstaff was pro. We had a party member whom is allergic to onion and they were nice enough to check with the kitchen and mark up a menu that gave us non onion options.","- Made a reservation for dinner- We split the smoked whole goat neck (it is for two) and it was quite filling- I was curious as to why it was so popular...answer: it tastes so good - The meat was very tender and there was so much flavour! - However it is a bit oily- The restaurant was packed when we went, so we had to yell across the table a bit, but the energy is amazing - Tables are very close together (would be hard to manoeuvre in the winter time)- The sliding doors were all open and there's seating outside- May come back to sit outside for brunch",Ducks Eatery
132,"Yummmmmmm!  Tie dye pizza is one of my favorites.. I was really excited to try the artichoke. They do not serve this on the lunch menu, which made me come back another day for dinner. Disappointing. The flavor was meh. The other appetizer we got, some kind of meat wrapped with cheese and in red sauce (can't remember the name) was absolutely spectacular!!","The most over priced restaurant I have ever eaten at. The portion of spaghetti was so small I ate it in literally 3 bites.. not an exaggeration, it literally took me only three bites. I'm typically not one to leave a bad review, but it was so expensive for the portion that I had to warn others.","The food is great here.But the service was average or even below average.  We got here 10 minutes before 5 PM and they told us they only have pizzas on the menu. We didn't realize that after 5 PM their menu would change to dinner menu and when we asked if they had any pastas available we were just told straight up no. We then told the waiter that we will just leave in this case. As soon as we step out of the restaurant we noticed the sign on their menu outside that their pizza hour is about to end, so went back to ask about it. Literally by the time we stepped back they already started seating others with the dinner menu just a few minutes before 5 PM. It was such a weird and disappointing experience. Then they couldn't give us our table back (although no one was sitting there). Later on during our meals they paid little to no attention to us when we tried to ask for salt etc.","I'm usually not a huge pizza person, but I thought Rubirosa would be worth a try because of all the buzz I've heard about it. WAITThey take reservations, but there's definitely ample space for walk ins. I checked in at the restaurant around 5:45 and our table was ready by 6:30 on a Monday. The pizza itself takes a while to come out if it's during a peak time. Our pie and pasta came out in 40 minutes. FOODWe started off with a calamari that was pretty solid. Nothing amazing, just a standard calamari. The dish was fresh, but I think there's only so much you can do with calamari. The Tuscan Kale Campanelle was amazing. The garlic cream sauce compliments the pizza's vodka sauce so well. The pasta itself was perfectly al dente, and the mushrooms offered a great crunch. Would definitely recommend giving this one a try. We decided to split our large pizza into half vodka and half funghi. The funghi was great, the arugula offered a nice sharp contrast to the mushrooms and garlic. We decided to split the pizza for variety, but honestly should have just went with the vodka, which was probably the best pizza I've ever had. The decadent vodka sauce is just done to perfection. It's got the perfect amount of sweetness, and the cheese just makes it that much better. Just get the vodka or tie dye pizza. OVERALLI hate waiting for anything, but this was honestly worth it. Just look at the reviews.",Came in here for lunch around noon on a Wednesday. Wasn't too busy got sat right away! The food was great but the pizza is delicious!! Way better than some of the highly recommended places in NYC! We got the supreme and it was definitely well worth it! P.s As we were leaving around 1 the entire bar and front tables were full. Does get a bit busy for lunch.,"One word review: overhyped This place is good and I'd say worth a visit if it didn't have such a long wait. I'm not sure I understand the hype at all. It was fine, but not at all something I'd go out of my way for. Nothing was bad and nothing was spectacular. We tried 4 of their pizzas, a pasta and the eggplant parmigiana. The eggplant parmigiana was the best thing we tried by far. The noodles were too thin on the cacio e pepe pasta but would have been great had they used a bucatini noodle or something like that.Honestly if you can't get seated here don't feel like you're really missing out that much.",Rubirosa
133,"Extremely disappointing food. Nothing note worthy. We ordered Shrimp & grits and FriedChicken & Brookshaw biscuit dinner. The quantity of shrimp & grits was tiny and tasted basic. The chicken was all sort of bland.  I don't even know how one can spoil the fried chicken. It was dry, shriveled and tasteless. So agree with the 1-2 star reviews. They have live piano in a very tiny space; gave me a headache.Oh and the service was extremely slow even though the restaurant was empty when we arrived.","Oh gosh! Where to start??? I made reservations for Sunday brunch, which based on photos from Yelp it seemed would be a gospel brunch (it was not). I got a text reservation both from the restaurant and from the platform I booked on confirming everything. I called the restaurant to push it back 30 mins as we were a bit delayed. However, when we got to the restaurant they somehow did not have our reservations... I still can't figure any of that out. We asked about the gospel brunch but the hostess/waitress had literally no idea what we were talking about. There were performers there, which we were seated right next to, except they were VERY loud for the atmosphere and size of the restaurant, which was unpleasant and in no way gospel, just sang about Jesus a lot. I ordered the pre-fixe brunch special. The starter for me was the green salad, which was fine although a bit wilted in the dressing. For my entree, I ordered the chicken and waffles- the waffles were ROCKHARD and cold and the chicken was very oily, pools of oily were on the plate making the breading very soggy. The scrambled eggs were bland and there was no biscuit served, even though it is on the menu as being included. We had to request salt and pepper as well as hot sauce (what Southern restaurant doesn't have hot sauce on the table). Also none of us received the ice cream that is part of the pre-fixe. The chef/owner did come over to say hi, which was nice.","The service was good, the staff was friendly, and the sweet potato hush puppies were good but that's about it. I ordered the fried chicken with broccoli mashed... the chicken was very bland (I honestly don't think they seasoned it at all before frying it) and dry; the mashed potatoes were so so, nothing special but there was no broccoli, it was just plain mashed potatoes,  I was confused about that. My husband got the fried meatloaf with the same fake news brocolli mashed. That too was both bland and dry. While we waited for our check, I overheard the party sitting behind us asking for some type of sauce because his meatloaf was also dry.",Ok first off the service is what sets this place apart from anyone else. They are sincerely the nicest there. They try and get to know you and have an actual conversation.  Very endearing. Secondly. The food is phenomenal. Once again no pics from me because I was too busy devouring it. I recommend going with a friend and sharing dishes. Beyond that the drinks were great as well. The bartender even took the opportunity to ask me if he could just make me something off menu. It was delicious.I would easily return anytime.,"Huge letdown. After reading so many great reviews, our experience was a bad joke. We went for brunch on the day before Memorial Day. There appeared to be a drunk person being led out shortly after we got there...the chef perhaps?Granted, the two servers, both of whom were making the drinks as well, were doing the best that they could all things considered. The food was just awful and none of our orders were complete....skipped our appetizer and some of the sides never made it to the table as well. The waiter comped our drinks when we suggested that it's the least that they could do. He was very sweet and clearly embarrassed. Bad days happen, but I will most definitely skip this place on future visits to the city.","Wanted to try this southern food place which had high reviews. Place had very nice decor and even a pianist playing past 7pm. Was a bit disappointed.There were some really great dishes - the fries with gravy, Mac and cheese. The gravy had lumps of meat in it which made it really tasty. Highly recommended. I added the Mac and cheese as a side. That's $9 for a cup on the side. It was very good, but $9 is a bit steep. I had the fried chicken, which was smaller than expected but probably a regular sized chicken. It didn't have the southern flavor I was expecting. Maybe it's a different part of the south. I thought southern food were all big sized and this looks more French sized. The broccoli mashed potatoes were interesting. Edible but not too much flavor in it. The meal comes with a biscuit so don't have to order extra, which I did as an appetizer. The biscuit was dense inside. Never had anything like it. Was decent with the jam though. I like corn bread better.  The shrimp and grits tasted like something out of a diner. Did not have the strong southern flavor.",Spoonfed New York Country
134,The bar was very crowded but one I told them I had reservations I was taken to the dining section and the service and food was exceptional. Although a bit pricy still worth a night out.,"The boat is dope and location is decent, good for pics and whatever. But the prices are INSANE. Regular cocktails were around $15 whatever it's New York. But for a house tequila soda it was $19 really? We asked why and the bartender snaps at us ""it's New York and it's summer and we're on a boat obviously it's going to be expensive"" and rolls his eyes. Nahhhhh mate you can chill Jose Cuervo doesn't cost $19 at the Plaza so f*** your boat.","Food and service was great~ atmosphere is perfect for sunny summer day~  the lobster roll was fresh and not too mayo-y .  Next time need to try the oysters.  One thing i would have to point out is if you are prone to seasickness/motion sickness, be warned.  I forgot im not too good with boats.  Soon as i got on, immediately felt dizzy and unsettled.  It couldve been the current on that particular day, but besides that, food atmosphere service was great~!","Years ago, one of my best friends suggested this place as a meetup spot for after-dinner-drinks. Since then I've been back on at least two occasions for meets. It's off to the West Side of Manhattan, so it's a walk BUT I like that it's a little off the beaten paths of the concrete jungle. I think the drinks are great. They've got a list of their own cocktails. The bartenders seemed really proper. If you're ever there, try ""The Permanent Vacation."" That drink is made with two types of rum. You'll love it!I haven't tried all of their food options but it's a great place to watch the sunset. If you're in Brooklyn try ""Pilot"" the sister restaurant to this one. None of these restaurant boat set sail but the are susceptible to the state of the water/waves so people with motion sickness beware! Bottom line: Go. You won't regret it!","This place is unique and so cool and definitely a place you need to check out!Grand Banks is literally a boat that is docked in the Hudson that you can eat and drink at. It is docked permanently, so you don't sail around, but you do feel it moving so keep that in mind if you are going here. They have sit down tables for dinner, which I haven't had, but they also have a bar and open seating for drinks which I recommend. A rally great place to come on a nice day and a great place to bring people, especially if they're from out of town. Drinks are on the pricier side, but give the location, it makes sense! Great views and vibes!",My wife and I discovered this great dining experience during our visit to NYC.   The restaurant is a ship on the water with a view of the Statue of Liberty.   I had the sea scallops and my wife had the crab claws.  Everything was delicious.   The staff was very professional and friendly.   Highly recommend eating here.Author David Moon Books on Amazon Zomosapiens Scales of Justice Pickle's Pickle,Grand Banks
135,"Meh. More like 3.5 stars out of 51 Star for very cheap price1 Star for very quick service, the food came out minutes after we placed our orders1.5 Star for food presentation.Other than that, the staffs were not attentive, there were about 4 staffs and the place wasn't crowded at 5pm on a Friday. You have to wave down to your server to place your orders. I got the curry soup and it was okay.... It was kind of bland so I wasn't too impress with it. The salty crispy chicken wasn't salty and barely crispy. I probably won't visit again. One good thing is that they are open 24/7.","Wife wanted to try this place out today. Went during lunchtime hours, & the place was almost full. We got seated quickly, & given menus. We both went with the original. You get a huge tray filled with 12 different ingredients (that you will add to make your noodle soup), a hot bowl of broth, & a serving of their noodles (i believe all the dishes used the same type of noodle). You are told to add the meat items 1st, & continue till you've added everything in your bowl. Additionally, there are (6) extra toppings you can order at an extra charge. I ordered the pork, & fish balls ($2.99). The way I would describe this place is, that, you're cooking your own food. The noodles, and the broth, by themselves, are bland. After you have everything in the pot, &, let it simmer for awhile, it gets tasty. I would definitely recommend stirring the food, & letting it sit for 10 minutes, before eating. Don't make the mistake i made. This place is open 24/7. Note, the Yelp check-in is no longer valid. Why the restaurant doesn't remove it is beyond me. Also, note, you can get extra noodles at no charge; but broth is $1 more.","I like their soups - tried three different ones now. Tomato, mixed mushroom, curry coconut. It's neat how it comes with small dishes to add to your broth. It's a bummer that you can't switch meat plates that comes with the soups to a veggie one in case you don't eat meat. I wish there a veggie option of plates and a meat one!","Tasty. Quick. Cheap. And 24hrs. It's a fun rice noodle concept.  You pick a broth and flavor of your choice. It comes with 12 mini side dishes. When they bring boiling soup broth bowl, add the sides in first, then noodles. Oh yea, noodle refill is free! The beef slices, tripe and ox tongue was really good!! Other side dishes were okay.","I don't think this place offers the authentic rice noodle, but nonetheless it was a very yum and fun experience.For just $9.99 you can choose from most of the soup base options on the menu. All come with a plate a rice noodles and a beautifully assorted toppings tray with 11 different toppings! They serve the soup to you boiling hot, and it's then up to you to add in the noodles and toppings. Since the toppings include raw pork slices, you should definitely put that in the soup first as soon as you receive it. The porks slices are super thin so you shouldn't have any worry of undercooking it. After that, feel free to add in the rest of the toppings and finally the noodles.I got the shredded pork and pickled cabbage soup base. The broth was very flavorful and has the perfect hint of sourness from the pickled cabbage. My friend got the tomato soup base, which to me was not a traditional chinese noodle soup base choice, but I gave it a try and loved it immediately. It was rich but not overpowering due to the sourness of the tomato; would definitely have to get it myself next time. Despite the already amazing value you'll receive from just $10, I was very surprised to find out that they also offer a free rice noodle refill. So definitely don't worry about leaving with an empty stomach!(BONUS: they serve their water with reusable plastic straw; that gets an upvote from me!)","Yunnan rice noodle is not a new thing and there are many places in New York offers the same. But this place actually the ingredients looks very fresh and the soup base actually really thick and tasty. If you ordered the regular is only less than $10 very affordable; which comes with basics that you put in when the soup is still boiling in front you. I added the beef for $2.99 but didn't see much beef added. Which is a bit disappointing. Free noodle refill tho, unless you won't leave empty stomach. The place is very clean and bright, waiters are very friendly the service is fast. Minimum $10 for credit card so basically means you can use credit card. I hate to take a star out of this amazing place. The appetizer  I ordered ""shredded tripe"" comes in a big portion. Big portion of shredded vegetable but little tripe. I felt like I got ripped off for paying $8 for shredded vegetable. It is supposed to be spicy but only just red oil with no c All other appetizers are also very pricy.",YunShang Rice Noodle House
136,"Came here for a quick lunch.My husband and I sat at the bar.  Lunch menu is really limited - lunch specials were just eh.  Nothing exciting.  We both ordered the burger - and it was just an average burger.  Nothing to complain about but nothing stand out'ish.Bartender was very amusing which was great.If I were to come back, it would only be for dinner (THAT menu looked much better)","Great experience, music, and overall experience. The food wasn't the very best, but it wasn't bad. I was a bit sad about the actual taste, but everything else is 5s","Friday night wasn't too busy and we were able to get a table without reservation. Drinks and food were okay. The male manager was very rude and impolite though it was our fault. We ended up leaving because he made us uncomfortable. Instead, he could have tried to increase the sales. Surprising that he is working in such industry and exhibit unprofessional attitude. It seemed he wanted to fight with us and that was unncessary.  Atmosphere is okay but this place doesn't deserve thr average 4.5 stars.My friends and I would NEVER go back.","Great customer service, cocktails, ambiance, and food! Will be coming back for sure!","I arrived here around 10pm. The cocktails were amazing. I recommend The Black Pearl. It comes in a tiki cup with candied cherries as a garnish. It was so delicious but very strong. The pricing of the drinks are extremely reasonable for NYC.  The craft cocktails are 15 dollars each and the average price of a cocktail is usually 20+ around that area. I would check this bar out if you are looking for a social place with good music, great drinks, and a sociable crowd.","This is a perfect pre-theater location with a couple of caveats. The drinks are well made--my martini was exactly the way I like. There are lots of choices for food--from burgers and tacos to salads and entrees. For dinner I had the lamb burger with a side salad--quite delicious, the well-seasoned lamb was cooked medium and salad was a nice side.I really liked the people who work here. The receptionist sat us immediately at the table of our choice (we had a reservation) and the server was friendly, not at all rushed. Runners bring the food and bus boys take away your plates--so there's never a wait for anything. Located right off Eighth Avenue at 47th Street, your theater is within easy reach.So what are the caveats? The lights are so low you can't read the menu. Also, be warned -- this place is LOUD!! Tables are right up against the long bar, which is full of SHOUTING people. No conversations here, just YELLING. Plus there is music playing over loudspeakers! All the surfaces -- wall, ceiling, floors -- REFLECT SOUND and nothing absorbs it. It's not just NYC restaurant LOUD. It's ROCKET ENGINE ON LIFT OFF LOUD. Hence not recommended for your parents, kids or someone you want to talk to.On the whole, I liked the place. It's stylish and delivers. Just bring ear plugs.",Dutch Freds
137,Eh. Pizza was average. Dough was chewy. Sauce was minimal. Oh and this was my $14 caesar salad. With no croutons.,They lure you with their famous burger then take it off the menu at 7 pm so that you get to sit next to everyone eating the burger but you're left eating pizza. The pizza is ok but ultimately just pizza with too little cheese and too much sauce.,"Hands down, best pizza & burger! Came here with a group 5 for dinner and had to wait a bit over an hour for seats. It was last minute for us to head down there,  so make reservations if you know you're planning to try this place out. I watched an Insider video on Facebook on how bomb the burger was, but still hesitant to try since most of these videos hype up the food more than how it actually tastes. Not this one, I can say that without hesitation that Emily is a must try. When we finally got seated, the waiter informed us there were only 4 burgers left and immediately ordered 3. It was only an hour and half of opening and only 4 burgers remaining. On top of the burgers, we ordered a Colony (red sauce, pepperoni, pickled jalapeno, honey) & Emily (mozzarella, crushed pistachios, truffle sottocenere, honey) pizza. Who would've thought adding honey can enhance the flavor of a pizza? There wasn't too much honey; just the right amount to give its pizza dough an extra level of goodness.","Even though this place does a large pizza business, I came here for the Emmy burger. I was not disappointed. The burger patty is extremely quality and the melted cheddar & Emily sauce make it very decadent. I ordered medium and my wife ordered medium well and I'd say they both were less cooked than requested but we both really enjoyed how they came out.  They only make a certain number of burgers per day. I got there a little after 6 pm on a rainy Wednesday and got the last burger of the night!  Less than an hour after opening!  The fries are good shoe string and come with ketchup and an aoli. I looked around and everyone was getting a burger but they were still pumping out pizzas for their delivery business. The pizzas that I saw did look good. I wouldn't recommend this place for a group. Two is ideal but they do have a few tables for four. Every table is filled. Bathroom was clean and the staff in general was friendly. Good, but limited, beer on tap. High end wine list. The burger was a little pricey but was definitely a top burger I've had in NYC. Will definitely go back.","I have to agree with the person who was here on the same rainy Wednesday I came. I sat at 5:45 so I didn't experience running out of burgers an hour after opening. I have to imagine running out of the signature dinner an hour after opening just feeds the hype. No way in the world the Emily burger is worth the 28 dollars it costs! It's rare to see a restaurant mobbed at 5:45. They've got their hype factor machine working overtime! Thank social media for this nonsense. This experience is on way too many top ten lists. It doesn't bode well for top ten lists...I saw a couple share one of their small pizzas and a have a burger each. They were early thirties and had a baby along. I was surprised they went for it! Each had two cocktails @ 14 dollars each. So, they went for about $150! I know this sounds like a lot but It is entirely realistic. I had the burger (no substitutions) and two cocktails for $58.69. plus a 10 dollar tip with no pizza. That much money could have netted them so much better value! Arguably better food as well. The place is cramped. The chairs were just wood, no upholstery. The staff was aloof. I don't get it. The idea that this is the best burger in New York is subjective and it was lost on me. The pretzel looking roll was not particularly pretzel tasting. The grease factor made it a self inflicted wound, especially as oversized as it was. Tiny little gherkins just upped the snob factor. The waffle fries in earlier reviews are gone. Too bad, I'm a fan of those! They've been replaced by a much less festive and less labor intensive shoe string version reminiscent of McDonalds. I would be guilty of being caught up in sheer hype if I recommended this experience.","The ambiance and service were great. The drinks were great. The pizza was amazing. But the burger here is arguably the best in NYC! We split 3 pizzas and 3 burgers as a group of 5. We tried the signature Emily which is a sweet, delicious truffle explosion and also the The Big Ang and Olympus Mons. The latter of which were both savory but not too heavy and not greasy. The crusts are crisp and thin-- perfect starters before our burgers.The burger is sweet, soft and melts in your mouth... the party is absolutely delicious. Definitely make room for this!We finished with a snore calzone and a banana pudding-- again both delicious. The banana pudding in particular was great for me as I don't have much of a sweet tooth.Visit this place!",Emily
138,"I came back here because my boyfriend really loves this place and I can't deny him anything. We walked in having made our reservation and were promptly seated outside at our choosing. The service here is fine, a little cuts, but is to be expected.We ordered the only redeeming dish here at this restaurant, the pork buns. This time, they weren't even that good and I was again disappointed. The bread was really soggy and almost wet and not from the normal delicious pork sauce.Boyfriend again ordered the spicy tonkatsu and usually is really excited and raves about it, but this time he was more quiet. I asked him about his dish and he picked up a piece of flaccid, crumbly, and viscous (gross) slice of what is supposed to be pork. He was crestfallen. He did not think the broth was as good.I ordered the vegetable Japanese ramen, which I didn't have high hopes for, but hoped that this time I wouldn't be poisoned. I received my dish very lukewarm. It tasted as though the base curry was from a box. It was overpoweringly salty, yet had no flavor. I would actually probably prefer the box. The vegetables were soggy and not at all fresh.Overall, I continue to be disappointed by this place and again, do not wish to return. This location in particular has gone down in service and food quality. If you really want to eat their food, I would recommend making the trek to 125th street.","For a restaurant that has consistently been on the Bib Gourmand list year after year, my experience was unbelievably awful and disappointing. To start off with the food...do we really think the ramen here is top notch? All the broths were overly salty, with very stingy toppings, and altogether mediocre -- in short, very Americanized offering. I didn't bother finishing my spicy tonkotsu because somethings are really not worth the calories and sodium intake. The only redeeming item was the Chicken Nanban starter, which were perfectly fried. A bit embarrassing for the namesake dish to play second fiddle to appetizers. We came here on a Sunday, a bit before the lunch rush, and got our orders in quickly, with me confirming multiple times that they can swap out the noodles in my spicy tonkotsu to house noodles; obviously, the waitress promptly forgot since she didn't bother to write down any of our orders. In fact, she likely forgot to put in 3 of the 4 entree orders because after the chicken nanban arrived, we waited...and waited...and waited.......as bowl after bowl of ramen came floating out of the kitchen only to be served to multiple tables who arrived way after we had placed our orders. It took half an hour for the first bowl of ramen to arrive, then another 20 minute gap before the waitress realized that something was wrong. I'd be inclined to excuse the wait time if ramen weren't something that is just ASSEMBLED, with minimal cooking. Then, as my friend dug into her vegetable ramen and chewed...and chewed...and chewed.......and spat out a wad of plastic wrap. Goodbye.(To be completely fair, after this they took off the cost of the vegetable ramen and gave us a discount, but too little too late. GOODBYE.)","I have been to Jin a few times.  It is located on the UWS / Harlem area.I don't eat meat, so I always get the Vegetable Ramen.  It's always been fine.  The broth is okay, the noodles are good, and the accompaniments are fine.  Definitely a solid bowl of ramen, but it is not my favorite in the city.If you're in the area, I would say you should stop by and check it out.  However, if you also don't eat meat, there are better places you could go.","Saturadas late lunch spot -- was pretty empty. They had a special/ separated menu which has more choice of appetizer or main dish. I ordered a beef donbury out of the menu and they really put a lot of different ingredient in the dish. I know I know, haha, you probably gonna say that I came in for the ramen! But this rice dish will never let you regret. It has tofu, enoki mushroom, onion, pinched egg and also green onion. The tofu combination is the first time that I ever had and it is wayyyyyyyyy better than my expectation. We ordered spicy miso ramen, and it's quite good since we would like some spice but not too strong. To be honest, this is not the best ramen that I ever had, I would give it 6.5/10, considering I have a really high standard for ramen. Pork belly bun is always our to go no matter what, and I really like how Jin Ramen make sure that their pork belly isn't too oily. Ps. I have been too place that their pork belly really need to be cooked/ fire gun a bit longer. Overall great experience, I think this place is quite close to the Columbia forum and campus, so it will be a good place if you would like to have a meal around campus or just chat something a bit formal. Make sure you give a try.","Came here without too much expectation other than knowing that this is a place I wanted to try. Came in to get the Japanese curry noodle and the volcano tonkatsu ramen.The japanese curry ramen, was meh. It wasn't anything special in either direction. What was really good was the tonkatsu ramen. Wow, I really loved the noodles there. (They use two different noodles between the two dishes). The noodles were were not too firm, but still soft enough to slurp down. I was really pleasantly surprised. The broth had a ton of flavor and there was a circular mount of spice in the ramen so you could help control when and how much spice. The pork was ok in it, but the noodles and broth were just so good.I'd come back here for the ramen no question. One of my favorite spots in the city","A favorite of mine in the UWS!! Space is tight, but the vibe is great, the service is fast, and the food is delicious. There's indoor seating, bar seating, and outdoor seating as well.My go-to ramen here is the Shio Ramen (I love the kick); otherwise, my other go-to dish is the Sake Ikura Don (salmon sashimi rice bowl). Pork buns are a strong choice for app as well.Jin Ramen never disappoints!",Jin Ramen
139,"I go here with my girlfriend almost every week as is our tradition. There is enough of a selection and good portions to not over eat. But it is easy to get sick of it if you do over eat.The server is a hit or miss, sometimes they get all the scum out, sometimes they even get all the chili oil out.The music can be random at times","Came here on a monday with my mom because it was her birthday. I joined the waitlist about 40 minutes before i even arrived (7:40pm) and i still had to wait. Initially i wanted separate pots but the receptionist said that is only available after 9 so i just settled to share a pot. I did hot pot and bbq but the combo isn't worth it in my opinion because they use the same weird seasoning for all the skewers and they came out cold. The staff is very attentive which was nice but one of the waitresses splashed hot soup on me while passing by with the refill pots and didn't even apologize. Although a lot of people i know seem to vouch for this place, I think it is quite generic.","This place gets busy on the weekend so be sure to make reservations! You have the option for hot pot, BBQ, or both! I've only been here for hot pot and was able to have individual pots as not all tables have the smaller burners. There's a 2hour time limit, which is plenty of time to fill your belly with unlimited meat, veggies,and seafood. The cuts of meat are pretty good and the vegetables are fresh, but you're not guaranteed to receive everything you ordered and you'll most likely forget until your belly remembers you've been waiting for it. Then you order another round of fatty beef.","I'm always down for hot pot regardless of the season. It's such a simple concept in theory, but there's more work and effort that goes into it than you might think.Laojie Hotpot is one of the best AYCE options around. They have so many great broths to choose from, and really fresh, quality ingredients, especially the seafood. The gargantuan clams look like they're on steroids, in the best possible way. I'm a sucker for the cuttlefish balls and Fuzhou meat-filled fish balls. They also have fish balls with fish roe filling, which I've discovered are one of the best hot pot ingredients known to mankind.Bonus points for the free bowl of pudding with milk tea that you get at the end of your meal. It's pretty damn tasty.The space is large and very clean, even the sauce station, which almost always attracts spills. The service is friendly. The ingredients are incredibly varied and very good. Really, the only downside is its distance from the nearest subway station, an obstacle I view as getting my steps in and clearing up more stomach room.","I mean Jeremy Lin was here so of course, I had to come try this AYCE hotpot restaurant.  I read from previous reviews that the wait can be long so on a Friday night around 7pm I put my name on the Yelp waitlist.  I was glad I did this because when we got there even though I was on top of the waitlist we still had to wait about 30 minutes for a seat (however, I was a little annoyed that we had to wait even putting myself on the list).  This was much better than the quoted time for people who were asking without the yelp waitlist they quoted 1 hr and 30 mins to 2 hrs!  I think some people were willing to wait, which is crazy to me. The music in the restaurant was quite loud and played old school Chinese Pop.  There is seating upstairs and downstairs.  The downstairs area is much larger.  We were seated downstairs and right away the waitress came to take our order.  We decided to get the black chicken and pork broth.  Both were flavorful!  This hotpot place is definitely much better than others in terms of service.  The waitress actually gets your order right and does not forget any items you listed, unlike 99flavors who always I mean ALWAYS forget one thing or is skimpy when you ask for more.  Also, they have a lot more variety here, there is a lot more seafood options including crab which you do not need to pay extra for.  The waitress will come once in a while to add broth and remove the top layer of the soup that is no longer good. And at the end, we were given a delicious jasmine tea pudding. Overall a great AYCE hotpot restaurant in Brooklyn. I will definitely be back!",Still my favorite place in BK for AYCE! The waitress are all nice and patient! The waitress always comes back and ask if you want more when they see your low on food. Food is good for what it is. The jasmine tea dessert at the end is amazing! I always ask for more.,Laojie Hotpot
140,"I'm from the culinary capital of the world--New Orleans, so I know delish.  SOCO has nice decor, ambience, and ample street parking, however, tables are cramped together, service lacked mere basics, and food was very bland. Fried pickled oysters ($12)--bland, seemingly 3 oysters cut into halves, though the pickled pineapple salsa was tasty; cheesy jalapeno corn muffins ($5) no cheese or cheese flavor and too sweet; pecan crusted pork chops ($19), tasted pre-boiled, bland and no sign of pecans or pecan flavor with too-sweet collard greens; pan fried (or rather seared) very lightly-battered catfish on a bed of veggies and black-eyed peas--all bland. The Mardi Gras cocktail ($14) tasted like punch, even the remake. The food at SOCO is OVERPRICED for LACK OF TASTE. It looked good, smelled good, as if it had been well-prepared, but... was terribly bland.","Let me start by saying the food here is delicious. I've been before and loved it which is why I brought my mom, who is visiting from out of town, here for Mother's Day dinner. It will also be the last time I visit. The stars are for the food and our replacement waiter that did the best he could. But even he couldn't make up for the owner's poor service. 1. The owner stood off to the side of our table the entire time overseeing the dining room but never once came over and asked how the meal was and ask how we're doing. Basic service I get even at Applebee's but fine. I'll move on. 2. After receiving our appetizer it was almost 20 minutes before anyone came to check in us. Why? Our waitress left mid shift and no one bothered to send anyone over to our table to fill in. And yes the owner is still standing there unapologetic saying nothing. Not checking up on his guests. Not apologizing for the oversight. Not comping an iced tea for the wait nothing. But again, moving on. 3. The kicker: I spilled my iced tea on the table. It spills all on me, the table, the floor. There is a puddle on the floor and I'm scrambling to soak up the tea on the table with my 2 napkins and still he does nothing. Servers step over the puddle on the floor. I see him look at me as I'm trying to blot my pants and nothing. Finally he comes over. (Yay). He picks up the lemon that fell on the floor from my glass, hands it off to a server and returns to his post to watch the dining room. WTF!!! Didn't grab extra napkins for me. Didn't even ask a waiter to grab me napkins. Nothing. Worthless. He has a customer trying to dry herself in front of him and the only thing he cares about was a damn lemon on the floor. Pork chop,while delicious, wasn't worth the money paid for crap service. I'll take my money elsewhere.","""It tastes like someone took my Mac and cheese, chewed it up, spit it out on a plate....and threw it away, then gave me mashed potatoes"" - my sisterWe've been bamboozled out of s'mores cakes and been served whipped cream instead of ice cream.","Haven't been here in a few years and decided to come here for brunch during Labor Day weekend. I personally love the ambiance of Soco and the staff here is very friendly! My boyfriend and I opted to order the rum punch carafe. Wasn't a fan too much of the cinnamon flavor, but it wasn't too bad.As for our meals, I ordered the steak and eggs which came out in a huge portion. My boyfriend ordered the soul food chicken sandwich which was amazing. Of course, we ordered a side of Mac and cheese which is one of the best I've had!","I hope my mom never reads this butttt Soco has the best Mac and Cheese Ive ever had. I'm not sure who Aunt Cruz is but bless her soul. Ive been to this location twice and have yet to be disappointed, I just wish they were closer to my home. The service is amazing, staff very friendly and hip. They have an awesome music selection that'd have you ready to buss a wine one second and ready to sing your heart out the next. My first time here, I had the F-Que Wings and a side of collard greens. The wings were alright but nothing to get excited for. The greens were great and packing flavor but they were even better on my most recent visit.I'm not sure how much I can stress it but if you ever come to Soco, the Mac and Cheese is a MUST. It was so good I took some to go but nothing is as good as it coming out fresh and hot in the little cast iron skillet. The collard green have delicious as well with a little sweet kick to them. If you think the Popeyes Chicken sandwich is good, YOU HAVE TO TRY Soco's Soul Fried Chicken Sandwich. I can go on and on about my experience here but you have to try it for yourself.","I have no complaints.I have been dying to try this place, and finally. Made it happen. I know this place is a staple in the neighborhood and finally got to try their famous Mac and cheese recommend by the waitress. We ordered: jalapeños hush puppies, Mac and cheese, shrimp and grits, and jambalaya.I CANT EMPHASIZE HOW MUCH I LOVE THE SEASONING OF THE DISHES. Shrimps were so freaking good. I should also say this is my first time having grits, and you know what? It's popping. Everything was perfectly made and just hearty. I think my fave was the jambalaya though. The shrimp was def more type of flavor than the lobster and shrimp and grits entree. The lobster needed a touch of lemon or something. But great dish nonetheless. My boyfriend inhaled it...Where have I been?! (Apparently not to the South or eating right!)Oh, and the music.... R&B ALL DAY. Damn. I was dancing the entire evening in my booth.",Soco
141,"Reasonably priced, for the quantity of food. But nothing was good about my experience here. I guess maybe it could be good for a group drink and bite, but only because its spacious and not overpriced.Dry wings, I ordered the chicken wings with the dry rub. Which turned out to be mostly corn meal, I was imagining a spice rub. No flavor either. I asked for some hot sauce, the server said yes but never brought it. Server came a number of times to the table, asked if everything was ok, but didn't  wait for a response and was gone by the time I turned around.The chicken tenders had the same dry rub as the wings, but I think they were brined beforehand so they were actually tender and seasoned.My wife found a hair in her salad. These things happen I guess, but on top of everything else it really made us want to leave.Drinks were ok, nothing remarkable I had a gimlet and the wife had a cider. She got a reasonably sized drink. Mine was served in a small highball glass with a large spherical ice cube, not much drink in there.I wont be going back. I dont understand why they have such high ratings.","Post-Theater summons libation in hopes for merriment for a happy ending to a Saturday evening.  It was 5:30 pm when I entered a semi quiet bar in the Theater District.  Hooks are available under the bar counter.  I had to request for water rather than being provided to customers.  Tanner Smiths is a dark, dingy bar.  There is a large TV displaying a vintage silent film that is viewed on a continuous loop sequence.  I was hoping for pigs in the blanket or shrimp or salad for small plates.  The wine list is limited.  Drinks are excessively overpriced.  I do not believe Happy Hour is offered.  Business cards are available for grabs by a wall near restroom entrance.Cabernet Sauvignon, (Joseph Carr, California) $15Subtle and good finish.  Average. Utter dismal price.French Fries gf $8Gluten free and served piping hot.  Average.It was 6:30 pm when I departed a hustling busy bar with abundant customers.  My male server was average with his customer service and social skills with customers yet fending a disgruntled meaningless life attitude and displaying a nonchalant tone as he worked sifting through the evening.  My male server visibly noticed my seat empty as I went to the facility and I started a tab with the bar holding my credit card.  When I returned to my seat it was occupied and my plate of unfinished French fries and finished glass of wine were removed from the counter.  The dude blatantly assumed I was finished, but behold he still has my credit card keeping a open tab.  The male server did not have the courtesy to hold my seat voicing ""someone is sitting there"" nor the woman sitting in my seat notice my tote bag hanging on the hook.  I feel I was ejected possibly alienated as I did not spend a lot of money or I was alone without a party or the social injustice or perhaps is it something else?  I refused to continue my experience standing resulting from my seat was occupied and my remaining unfinished food was removed without my request, ergo I have taken my leave for the evening.  I retrieved my belongings and closed my tab intentional leaving a small gratuity for this reason.  The bottom of the bill embeds ""suggested tip"" of 18%, 20% and 22% ergo patrons do not have to calculate the arithmetic sequence.  I departed dispirited and utter dismayed.""Bye, Felicia!""""All hope abandon ye who enter here.""-- Dante Alighieri's ""Inferno""","An intimate atmosphere just a few blocks off Time Square. The cocktails and beer list are solid. Our food was tasty but not amazing. The food wasn't very hot when it arrived. We got the hot chicken sandwich, brussel sprout hash and the pork sliders. I would recommend the sliders but skip the other items. Everything on the menu is around $15.","Breakfast review: Avacado smash with salad started off the day with a good choice! Salad wish simple, but tasty. Pumpernickel was well-toasted, eggs were perfectly runny inside, avacado was dressed with a little lime. It was delectable! Simple fare done extremely well. Service and ambiance were great. We were seated in the back and the a/c was a little high, but that's just a minor gripe.We came back the next day and had that delicious Avacado smash again. Mentioned the A/C issue yesterday and they remedied it. Happy we came back.","This place is a place to go for drinks, absolutely. I hate to give low star reviews but the food was bad, even though the staff was amazing!The dry rub wings came out and the rub is so basic not spice and oddly enough, not any real flavor. The wings were also poorly cleaned, with multiple having feathers and extra skin. The manager was wonderful and took them off the bill.The lamb sliders were fresh and needed seasoning. The Mac and cheese was undercooked. It was not al dente it needed to be cooked more. The slow roasted pork that was an add on was surprisingly dry for 10-hour slow cooked pork. Come here for the drinks and go get dinner elsewhere.",I wish we came here for dinner instead of the other place we ended up at before our show! After our show however we wanted a night cap so we went to Tanner Smith's for just that. Very cute cocktail place! Great music and very welcoming staff. We ordered drinks and some late night munchies. I ordered in cahoots which is a lemony gin drink which was delish (not worth 17$ but whatever when in Rome) and my friend got a Moscow mule. We also go the Thai curry deviled eggs and some fried eggplant chips. I didn't try the deviled eggs but they looked yummy! The eggplant chips were amazing! It came with a honey dipping sauce which I would never think to pair together but it worth really well. Bravo! Must come back here for a real meal one day! Super fun spot :),Tanner Smiths
142,Ummmmm.... nothing to write home about. Sub par service. Sub par food. Chicken was dry. Barely seasoned. If at all. Candied yams were yams with sugar and cinnamon thrown in. Was in the area so thought this would have been a cool spot for dinner. But I would have rather gone to a lil Jamaican spot uptown. Very Blah,Very disappointed with this location. They weren't fighting it's customers. Had I notice it sooner I would have left.This is a place where food is prepared beforehand and then presented to you quickly unfortunately that means that the food has been sitting for hours cuz and it's anybody's guess if it will be prepared properly. For example I got smothered pork chops presentation wise that looks great.And when I fit into the first pork chop it was okay. But the second pork chops have been sitting in there Baker for hours on end and that's results Not only was it try was overcooked and you couldn't even cut into it. Very disappointing.We're not quite sure what the jerk chicken was but it wasn't jerk chicken. Buyers beware before going here!!,"This soul food spot is out of this world  their fried & candied yams, macaroni and cheese be having me say  Wait a minute in Kevin Hart voice","Tasha (the little one ;) has an amazing energy and hopefully you're as lucky as I was to get her as your waitress. Their brown gravy is better than my mommas. And as a Texan, it it worth mentioning, they have SWEET tea, and damn it's good. I got the rev. Al Sharpton (chicken and waffles) Mac and cheese, and after my plate was dropped off to the table one of the two girls at the table next to me order the EXACT same thing. I might take a nap and then go get a slice of sweet potato pie.

Al Sharpton (Chicken and waffles) with a side of baked mac and cheese and I've got no complaints whatsoever.Chicken was fried perfectly and whatever seasoning they use is top tier, definitely hit differently than any other fried chicken I've ever had (and I love me some crispy fried chicken).I'm so glad this spot is located In my neighborhood, which makes it a shirt walk away and a local gem.Thank you Amy Ruth's for the great food and Tashiii (our server) for the pleasant service.","My friend and I visited NYC for Memorial Day weekend. We wanted some soul food Saturday afternoon, so we did a quick Google search and came across Amy Ruth's. The reviews looked good, so we decided to give it a try.We walked up and there was a short line, so we put our name on the waitlist. We were called and seated in no time. As soon as we sat down, a server came and greeted us. We ordered mimosas and waters to drink and then ordered our meals. After putting in our order, the server came back with a bread basket which was super good! The drinks were okay, but nothing to rave about.For my meal, I ordered The State Senator Brian Benjamin, which are the fresh salmon croquettes. These were some of the best salmon croquettes I've EVER had! Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside...so great! I ordered macaroni and cheese and collard greens as my sides, and these were less than desirable. The macaroni and cheese had a weird, almost sweet taste and the greens tasted a little sweet too. They looked great, but the taste didn't match how good they looked. I ate a few bites of each, but completely finished the croquettes.This was a cute place, but I don't see the hype...maybe because I'm from the South and have tasted some of the most amazing soul food. But off the strength of the salmon croquettes alone, I'll give this an okay rating.",Amy Ruth's
143,"The Clover Club SnubGave Clover Club another go yesterday.  My friend and I arrived to a full bar but empty seating.  We intended to have dinner and drinks but the waitress refused to situs at a larger table we requested because my friend had a broken arm.  I asked nicely a few times and explained our situation but she snubbed us and was super adamant about not giving us a more comfortable table and insisted all of the empty table were reserved for 4 or more people. We were so annoyed that we finished our rounds of martinis and went to Nobu for dinner instead.  Clover fails again.  Too bad, we would've tipped her at least 30% if she had been accommodating but I'm not going to spend $500 on a night out in a place that treats me like a second-class citizen.  The martinis were good though, even though the service left a bad aftertaste.We got the ""Clover Club Snub.""",The brunch here is delicious! We had the Bacon Tasting as an appetizer. Who doesn't love 3 kinds of bacon! I also tried the Wildflower cocktail. Such a refreshing drink. As our entrees we ordered the baked eggs with chorizo & manchego and the prime beef burger. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because there's no way 2 ginger ales should cost $8.,"This a great spot on Smith Street - nice ambiance, low lighting, and even when busy, it's never felt uncomfortably tight when having drinks at the bar. And I'm not sure if it's a recent addition, but just had dinner there for the first time, and the food was excellent (I could be conflating this with another place, but I thought they only served small plates - now they offer a selection of entrees). The staff there was also very nice and helpful - we had put our names down for a table, hung out by the bar for about a hour before correctly assuming they had forgotten about us. We let them know, and they promptly sat us and a round of drinks on the house. Not ideal that they dropped the ball - but when a place is quick to apologize and make it right, no harm, no foul in my book.PS: I ordered the Prime Beef Burger... A+","My hubby and I threw a baby shower in the beautiful private Parlor Room in the back of the Clover Club and we had a very good experience.Pros:- Beautiful, elegant, and tasteful space with 1800's decor and furnishings. We didn't want to just rent a regular office space and this venue really stood out- No hourly/day space rental fee!- Attentive and friendly staff. We worked with General Manager Justin and Susan with all logistics and they were always responsive. Our bartender Ashley was super outgoing and friendly and my guests all really liked her. - We ordered Deviled Eggs, Cheese Board, Cured Meats, Pulled Pork Minis, Caprese Crostini, Stuffed Mushrooms. All the food was fresh, flavorful and came out in a timely manner. Our friends raved about the Pulled Pork Minis and Caprese Crostini. - Wide variety of fun and delicious cocktails and mocktails. Cons:- The minimum gratuity starts the time your party starts. So if you wanted to order a round of drinks for your friends who helped set up earlier in the morning, that would not count towards the minimum. Our bartender was sweet enough to allow an exception and set it up once she got the bar ready - If anyone wanted to order additional dishes from the regular menu, you have to move out of the Parlor Room and dine in the front dining area, which is frustrating because you don't want to leave the party Details for Parlor Room (Sun-Thurs/Sat Afternoons)- 45 people max capacity for private parties. - The requirement is $300 guaranteed minimum gratuity on all beverages. This means a total bar spend of $1500 assuming guests tip 20%. Drinks can be rung as a cash bar (each guest pays for their own drinks) or open bar (host to pay the entire tab.) At the end of the party, the host must guarantee that the minimum gratuity on all beverages reaches $300 or that the difference is met from cash bar tips. All drinks are rung based on consumption.- Food orders, and signed food contracts are due one week in advance of party. Please note that food is subject to 20% service charge, which does not apply toward the gratuity minimum on beverages.- Saturday & Sunday afternoon events must be cleared by 6pm. You can get there as early as 10:30am to setup. - You cannot use anything that punctures any surface, also no glitter, confetti, stickers, and no duct tape (or equivalent) on any finished wood.- Tall ladder is supplied but not tall enough to reach the ceiling. Tall enough to reach high up on the walls though.- Must supply the source and speakers if you want to play your own music at a reasonable volume.- $25 cake cutting fee covers two small-to-medium-sized cakes or one really big cake. There is no fee for desserts like cupcakes and cookies, and they are happy to arrange them on one of their platters.Food Details- Recommend ordering 2-3 platters of stationary hors d'ouevres, plus the following amount(s) of passed hors d'ouevres. - 4-5 pieces of passed hors d' oeuvres per person is considered light eating. 6-7 pieces per person is considered medium eating. 8-10 pieces per person are considered heavy eating, or enough for each of your guests to call a full meal.   Finally, we ended up spending $1096 for food (medium eating), $115 on bar gratuity difference (in addition to $175 for drinks to treat our friends who helped out). Everything came together, everyone had a grand, well-fed, and drunk time and I highly recommend Clover Club for private parties! Thank you Justin, Susan, Ashley, and staff for helping us host a wonderful and memorable baby shower!","Beautiful atmosphere, highly recommend for date night/first date. It a big bar yet intimate and quaint with candles on all the tables. They have a very reasonable happy hour that I took full advantage of. This place is elevated bar food, I loved the chips with tangy creme dip. I would discrediting humanity if I don't address their breading pudding. It is ridiculously good. It has a subtle sweetness. Honestly could eat this everyday for a year and be happy. Make room for it!","What an incredible spot! - Cocktails are AMAZING; my friend called for a very old school drink off menu and they made it no problem. The frozen drinks are out of this world good.- Atmosphere is way cute and the service is spot on. This is an excellent date spot, absolutely no question. - Food is really really good! If you like Brussels sprouts, these are a MUST. The duck fat crisps were pretty good but honestly less exciting than I expected. Burger was perfection, and the steak was a solid 8/10.

144,"Good matcha latte, but uninspired and slightly grainy-textured smoothie bowl. I don't think I'd come back.","Really friendly service and delicious breakfast! Would have given 5 stars (the food is super tasty!) but was let down by a lukewarm, weak hot chocolate (despite looking beautiful).",My plate was good apart from the poached eggs which came uncooked. And my bf said the hallumi was very cold,"Banter is a modern cafe that serves a healthy menu that delivers on both flavor and nutritional content. The servers were immediately friendly and seated us right away. We ordered the mushroom toast and the banter bowl with salmon. The mushroom toast was delicious, the mushrooms themselves were cooked perfectly and sat atop a bed of cheese which I normally don't like but the ratio and flavor profile mixed well. The bread was good.The banter bowl was chock full of vegetables and the salad dressing had an slight Asian influence that I loved. They provide plenty of smoked salmon and the freshness of the bowl hit the spot.While most restaurants offer foods cooked without your health in mind, Banter provides a respite from these heavy foods by serving light, yet filling, dishes.","Added myself to the Yelp waitlist (Definitely do this! So much more convenient than waiting in person) on a Saturday morning for brunch. I had to wait around 30 minutes on the Yelp waitlist but was seated quickly once my name was up.They had a full menu of brunch/ lunch items. I ordered the grilled chicken burger and my partner ordered the fried chicken burger. Both were decent but not the best we've ever had. The sweet potato fries that came on the side were quite tasty.The service was quick, if perhaps a tad too quick- while they didn't rush us out, we did feel like they were trying to move the tables along to seat the next people waiting. Understandable during a busy weekend!Overall, I liked Banter but wouldn't go out of my way to come here again. Stop by if you're in the area and can get on the Yelp waitlist ahead of time!","Good food, and an aesthetic yet cozy feel to the restaurant space. Got the golden folded eggs and the house-made granola. The eggs were some of the best I've had; so fluffy! The guac tasted really fresh and the peas and prosciutto paired surprisingly well with the eggs. The granola was good but not sure if I would get it again for the price. Service was a little slow but understandable because it was very busy when we went!",Banter
145,"We ordered delivery so maybe take this review with a grain of salt. On the other hand, our criticisms have nothing to do with the freshness of the food. So I take that back... you can 100% rely on this :)...We had the chicken, paella, meatballs, potatas bravas, etc. All A-OK but nothing to write home about. Perhaps the homey ambiance that I've heard so much about in the other reviews makes the food taste much, much more special...But prolly, nah... strictly okay food...","This place lives up to the hype. We ordered the dip platter, brussels sprouts, Spanish style shrimp, and pork paella for the table. Everything was killer the food here is delicious. A heads up that this place does get busy on weekends and they do not take reservations for smaller groups so be ready to wait.","I have never written a review for a place I did not actually get a chance to eat at, but I really have to comment on the rude way my gf and I were treated there today. I guess since the food is apparently good the staff feel they can just be plain rude. If you still fill the tables and get away with that, good for you.  We tried to grab a table around 3 and I guess they close for an hour form 4-5. We asked to put our name down without asking how long the wait would be. First the hostess said ""Well the wait is going to be very long, prob 30 min.""  We didn't care we said.  ""Well, the kitchen will close at 3:50 so that would be cutting it close.""  I'm not sure how that's cutting it close.  We put our name in anyway as we saw other names on the list only minutes in front of us. The host huffed and wrote our name down. There were 2 seats on the inside by the door where the host took our names down to sit down, so we sat down. The hostess said nothing. We had walked about 6 miles and my gf was exhausted and just wanted to sit for a few minutes. About 5 min went by and the hostess came back and said in a frustrated manner ""Excuse me, we have chairs outside for you to wait at"".  No please wait outside; no I'm sorry we need to keep this area empty. Nope, just ordering us out the door. Then another party came in and asked for the wait and she said its too long for you to wait-again trying to shoo them away.   Here's the thing:  1. I get it. You apparently close for an hour from 4-5 in between brunch and dinner. You don't want people to keep coming in so they're still there while you shut the restaurant down. Here's a tip: Just say you're not letting anyone in anymore after say I dunno, 2:45. That's better than trying to talk people out of putting their names on the list.    2. Perhaps even though you have 2 chairs in a waiting area by the door, you apparently don't want people to wait there.  You could say in a gentle manner, I'm sorry we're really crowded, would it be ok if you waited at the chairs outside?  That goes over a lot better. Again, i get it. You're stressed out. You're busy on a Sunday.  But I worked at restaurants when I was in college and I would never have spoken to a customer in this way or gone out of my way to use every excuse to talk them out of putting their name down.  That's simply not done.   I'll chalk this up to a stressed out hostess with no tact and maybe try to visit again sometime since apparently the food is top notch. I suppose it must be.",I can legit say that I ate at this spot every week during the summer. My good friend whose a regular there put me onto this spot & I am totally obsessed.

It was super crowded so we had a bit of a wait and they wouldn't seat us until the whole group was there which is one of my least favorite restaurant policies. We got the bacon wrapped dates, dip trip with hummus, feta cheese/roasted red pepper, and beet dips and they were all good. Especially liked the feta and roasted pepper dip. Also had the patatas bravas and puréed cauliflower as apps. The bacon wrapped dates were a little overdone but I still ate them and would have eaten more lol. For our main meal we had the paella with pollo which was delicious!!! I absolutely loved the flavor of the rice and the chicken was well seasoned. Heads up: my friend I went with has a severe gluten allergy and could not have the bacon wrapped dates because they were made in the same fryer as items with gluten. We could also not get the chorizo or chickpeas in the paella for that reason, and likewise could not order the fried Brussels. Hopefully helps anyone who is GF and looking for tips.",Olea

I had a very high expectation about this place since their sister restaurant The Dead Rabbit are considered one of the best cocktail bars in the country. Went here after dinner at The Dead Rabbit and only had one cocktail which ended up being a classic mojito. Which to be fair it was the best mojito I've ever had. Will be back for more next time I am in the city.,"Beat cocktails on the planet. Worth every cent. Havana Cuba themed, and just such an epic experience. GO.","What an amazing vibe! This places oozes positive energy, warmth and charm! Like time traveling to 50's Havana! Live music every night by some talented singers and musicians playing Brazilian jazz and such.The bar has a beautiful mural as a backdrop and photographs line the walls. The drinks - interesting concoctions - a book of cocktails - I went with the traditional daiquiri - it was (not surprisingly) the best I've ever had. They do their cocktails well here. On to the food - a variety of Cuban favorites - I had the delicious and filling beef empanadas. And for dessert, the most divine tres leches cake on earth - period. Get it and get to BlackTail now! Be sure to make a reservation, as the place fills up fast and was hopping even on a weeknight.","A coworker had recommended this place to me a few weeks ago and I was curious to see what it was about.A friend and I decided to go on a Saturday night, we didn't have reservations , but we were still able to get a table which was awesome. The host was very kind, once she seated us she explained the menu, drinks and how to go about it. They even have postcards , which if you fill out , they'll mail it out for you. They had 2 menus, one was a small pamphlet which had seasonal drinks and food. The second menu was a book, which consisted of 5 chapters.As we were looking through the book, our waitress came and started us of with free daiquiris , it was delicious! I ended up getting the pina colada  which was strong but delicious and Mary Pickford which was a fruity punch. My friend ended up getting the nacional, mint condition and a beer. Her drinks were delicious as well, and strong.To eat we decided to get the Cuban crispy fries, which were yuca fries and plantains, along with the chicken lollipops and the pork skin. The food was great! I wish we were able to the burger as well. All in all for $18 a drink it was worth it! The service was amazing as well as the food and drinks. Will definitely be stopping by again soon!","It's always nerve-racking when you're met with a bouncer sporting an earpiece at the door. We had no reservations and no connections but were hopeful in at least getting a spot at the bar. The bouncer was super friendly, and told us we would have a table in a few seconds. And that's exactly what happened. The hostess gave us a rundown of the vibe of Blacktail. It's a speakeasy with Cuban flare. They even include a postcard in your menu that they'll send to anyone in the world. They have cigars on the way to the bathroom. We received a complimentary frozen daiquiri to start off with which was cold, refreshing, and had a good bite to it.We sat down and flipped through literally like 12 pages of cocktails. There are 5 chapters that are divided by how concentrated the alcohol is in a drink, with each ascending chapter increasing in concentration: Highball, Punch, Sour, Old Fashioned and Cocktail. Each chapter has a glass on the lower left side that shows you how each drink on the page will be served. To eat, we had the Cuban Cripsy Fries, the Chicken Lollipops, and the Spiced Chicharrones. As a whole, the tapas were flavorful and delicious but I recommend not coming here on an empty stomach as the portions aren't huge. The Cuban Crispy Fries come with plantains and yuca fries and are delish! The Spiced Chicharrones are only fried pork skins but the seasoning is awesome. The drinks: the Nacional, Mary Pickford, Mint Condition and Piña Colada were all amazing. $18 for a drink is always a little scary but the cocktail portions here are extremely generous. The Piña Colada was one of the best and strongest I've ever had. The Nacional and Mary Pickford are fruity but rummy. The Mint Condition is definitely on the sweet side. Steer clear if you are not a fan of the overly sweet choices. We tried barely 2% of what Blacktail had to offer tonight. I hope to make a trip back soon to explore what else they have. The service was fan-freaking-tastic. Everything came out fast and we were constantly checked on. As an added plus, the bathrooms were spick and span! The outdoor seating opens next Friday. Do yourself a favor and check it out.",BlackTail
147,"We ordered the Chicken ShawarmaLamb Kabab and Humus.Delivery Time: Under 30 minutesThe Lamb Kabab was very good, moist and full of mint and Mediterranean spices, not too spicy full of flavor. Unfortunately they were only 3 tiny little balls, smaller than a golf ball larger than a quarter. They provided a very generous portion of yellow rice, and chopped salad with a dollop of tahini sauce, which was very tasty. The Chicken was about 4oz or not quite 1/2 cup chopped and it got lost in the rice, also generous and the same chopped salad and tahini. We loved the small container of humus, smooth and rich in flavor. I'm guessing we ordered wrong, this is a pita sandwich place and if you order a platter like we did you get the same pita size protein and they make up for the bread with rice, not what I had in mind. But I imagine if you ordered this all assembled in a pita it would be great. So we spent too much for what should have been pita sandwiches.It was worth a try, not sure I will order again, mostly because I expect more in a platter and that's what I want in take out.",Not for me. I stopped by for lunch and got the Kruveet in a pita. It was a small portion with odd flavors.,Ordered a quick lunch from here. I went with the lamb pita. It was small but filling. There is a lot going on here in terme of flavors. It has both a mediterrean and middle eastern taste to it.  Although the flavors were complex it still hit the spot. The lamb was cooked well and the pita was the perect vessel for it. We picked it up to go and ate it in a nearby park. I didnt try anything else but was pleased with the lamb pita. Will definitely keep it in mind for lunch in the future.,"I ordered delivery from here for the first time and it was so good. My order arrived hot and in less than 15 minutes.I ordered the Hummus Bowl with pita and a side of pulled pork (with no bbq sauce). Honestly it was some of the best hummus and pulled pork I've ever had. The hummus is creamy and amazing and the pulled pork is juicy and cooked perfectly. The pita was also delicious. You should definitely order Taboonette if you're in the mood for hummus or surprisingly, pulled pork haha.",Fast service. Delicious palette. Vegan friendly. Great portion size. Perfect for a quick fulfilling meal before going to see a performance at the Daryl Roth Theatre! Great location.,"When here for a quick post workout meal with my friends. The decor is rustic, the food and ingredients seem fresh, The hummus is exceptionally good, and the chef signature sweet potato falafel is definitely worth a try. We were pleasantly surprised by the lightly sweetened freshly brewed tea beverages in peach and hibiscus. An interesting twist was the vermicelli noodles if you order a pan. They're basically an eggbased noodle shaped and cut and cooked as yellow rice. Definitely worth a shot for a hole in the wall.",Taboonette
148,"Such a cute little spot for brunch. My coworker came here 4 times in the last month. I ordered the chili scrambled eggs. It was a little spicy, which I liked. The smashed avocado was perfect on the side. There was one chair that was broken and the waitress even said it's a safety hazard but still sat us on it. The group next to us had their bags on one of the not broken chairs. Instead of asking them if it's okay to switch, the waitress still let us say on the broken one. Very odd","Not a hole in the wall at all (disappointed?). Modern vibe and simplicity. Food was what you would expect at a nice brunch place, though they do have more options for drinks.","You serious? What's not to love! It's literally a hole in the wall with a whole lot of delicious food to fill you up! I had the chili scrambled eggs and aussie iced coffee and loved it! Never had an aussie iced coffee before so when I saw that vanilla ice cream scoop in my coffee, I was in heaven!! My wife had the whipped waffles and it's on the sweet side but so am I! That was bomb too!! Defintely coming back whenever I'm in the city next time!!",Really cool spot. Went here for a business breakfast.Ordered the avocado toast which was excellent. My colleague ordered the scrambled eggs which were also delicious.Tables and chairs inside and out are modern. This is a great breakfast spot that I would return to.,"Love this brunch spot in FiDi - super easy to get in the waitlist via Yelp which cuts down on your wait time once you arrive. They do have outdoor seating so we were able to bring our dog, which is always nice. I ordered the chili scrambled eggs with bacon and it was absolutely perfect for brunch. The eggs were so soft and rich. Staff was super friendly and attentive. Definitely a hidden gem hidden away in FiDi!","Cute little Hole in the Wall restaurant in the Fidi area. This place exudes west coast vibes in every aspect: chill -laid back environment, Cali style decorations that make you feel like you're out of town, and staff makes you feel appreciated and not rushed like some NY establishments. Not to mention, their bathroom's always clean; small, but clean. Brunch is so good here and their Brioche French toast is literally to die for -- but, please don't go nuts if they run out (*heads up* sometimes they do run out of it if it's a busy sat/sun!). With that said the name says a lot about the size of this place -- it's pretty small so, not the best for large groups and I do recommend a reservation or early brunch/breakfast (or call before stopping by to check out wait times). Some of my menu faves from here are: the brioche French toast (duh), avocado toast (a must), eggs Benedict (with a side of smoked salmon), and their wild mushrooms (so filling!). Oh! Their drinks are also really good ... my carnivore friends love their bloody Mary's because of the thick piece of bacon that comes in it; I just stick to my regular old OJ, green tea, mimosa, or Moscow mule. Overall, one of my favorite breakfast / brunch spots in NYC!",Hole in the Wall
149,We are planning to stay at the One 15 Marina soon and really looking forward to experiencing Brooklyn.  We have been scouring the internet looking for bars and places to eat near the Marina.  I have to say that JTHT sounds like a place we can't wait to visit!The petty ridiculous comments here by frustrated writers and food critics are all we need to know!  See you soon for brunch and dinner!!!,"I've never felt so discriminated against, especially on pride weekend. We arrived for dinner last night, and it was fairly empty. The hostess was extremely unwelcoming and sat us at the furthest table, in the back end of the dining room, behind a wall, away from all windows, next to the food runner doors, and bathrooms. We all felt awkward and unwanted, hoping we'd be able to switch tables. Instead, we waited almost 10 minutes for someone to approach the table, even with water. It was painfully obvious that we were victims of discrimination, so instead of begging for waters from a bus boy, we left. No one said a word to us on the way out.","Weeknight quiet cozy spot to have dinner. However, the tables are too close together, and we heard every single word of others conversations who were sitting 2 tables away. I had the steak and hubby had the chicken. We were disappointed at the price of the half chicken since it was almost as much as a steak. I buy organic chicken all the time and I know that its definatly cheaper then a steak. Also, they did not include the wing. They do have Oregon Pinot Noire which is a great wine. It's a nice neigborhood spot, and I suggest y oi u stop by in you are in the area.","I was put in charge of finding a place for brunch in brooklyn heights recently when meeting up with some high school friends, which was surprisingly difficult, since there seems to only be one other place in brooklyn heights that does brunch. JtHT takes reservations, but upon trying to make one, I found out that you need like a party size of like 6 or more in order to make one. Whatever though, they said that they wouldn't be that full at 11:45 on a Saturday, and they were right.When we arrived, it was probably only half full, and by the time we finished (1:15?) there were still probably 1 or 2 more tables left. It's pretty casual in here, but it feels comfortable, and I enjoyed my time here. Our party only ordered two dishes: the beef hash and the eggs benedict with salmon. They actually have some sort of funky fried oyster eggs benedict which looked... interesting, but I passed on it.My eggs benedict was fine. You don't get any sides that come with it, but it was enough to eat, so I had no problem with it. The salmon is kind of... well, it's not smoked salmon exactly. I mean, technically there is some, but it's actually a blend of cooked salmon and smoked salmon, and the smoked variety probably only makes up like 10% of the mix. It's kind of an odd choice, but it still tasted good overall, so I was okay with it.I don't have much more else to say about this place. It feels more like a 'breakfast' spot rather than a 'brunch' spot, if you can understand what I mean, but it'll work just fine for brunch needs.","What you find when you walk across the Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan and type in ""Happy Hour Nearest My Location"".  What a fabulous place.  The happy hour was reasonable and generous.  I paid $7 for white wine.  Every item on the happy hour menu was tasty, both drinks and small plates.  The Mac n' cheese was so good.  I think it's the best Mac n cheese I have ever had.  Creamy and with bread crumbs on top.  Great flavor.  I had the meatballs on Greek yogurt too.  It was wonderful.  The bartender and even the locals were friendly and funny.  Just really enjoyed the ambience.  I would come back in a heartbeat.","A consistently reliable, welcoming spot. Delicious food, solid wine list, good room. Have been a loyal customer for over a decade.",Jack the Horse Tavern
150,"An OK place. Stopped by for brunch, lured in by good Yelp rank, but experienced a rather sub-par meal. If you rarely have cash on you, be prepared to pay 4% extra for using your credit card here! I was really appalled to see that info on the menu and I find it really disgraceful in today's bitcoin dnage... Our server was very quiet and though not entirely lethargic, it took forever to order, get a beer and especially get the check (which would have never come if it wasn't for the other server who was much more efficient). This poor service had a lot to do with the poor impression of the place.The place itself is old and in a desperate need of fresh coat of paint on the dirty walls and ceiling. There is only one co-ed restroom.The food is OK. My husband had a carbonara, which was good but the portion was small.I had the sandwich with scrambled eggs, bacon, cheese and veggies on a brioche bun. They ran out of avocado, so offered to sub with spinach. When the sandwich came with no spinach, I asked and they brought it as a side 10 min later, when I was half through my meal.After all these hiccups, there is no need for me to go back.",The eggs on a cloud was the best dish here and the $8 dollar bellinis/bloody marys/mimosas were a steal (especially for the pricey Dumbo area). Also there was no waiting time when I went (Saturday at 12) which was a plus.Lighting was a bit too dim for brunch so I took off a star.,"We arrived in Brooklyn on a Friday afternoon after visiting Ellis Island and, based on Yelp reviews, we decided to eat here for a late lunch.The restaurant is not large, and had been crowded at lunch time because we got there late and most tables were still taken.  It's a fairly noisy room given the high ceiling and lack of anything that resists noise.We had the caprese panino, the farm salad and the chicken marsala.  The panini lacked much flavor - it needed fresh basil (a tiny piece there), which the restaurant could have grown by the barrel given their huge sunny windows in front.  The rest was good, not great. My glass of wine (Donnaluna) was expensive. Overall, an ok stop but nothing really special.","For residents of DUMBO, AlMar is an institution. A joint. A place where one can escape the throngs of selfie-obsessed tourists down the block and enjoy an inventive, well-crafted meal at surprisingly affordable prices in a casually chic environment. A place welcoming enough to bring your screaming toddler, yet cool enough to bring a date and order off the menu. Dear Basic Bettys and Chads of Yelp who complain about the 4% credit card surcharge: I welcome you to the economic reality of small business in 2019. Did you rent go up? AlMar's probably did, too (except unlike you, daddy doesn't pay their rent). Most restaurants simply build this credit card surcharge into the pricing rather than give you the choice to bring cash, and if the extra $1 on your perfectly cooked ribeye is a deal-breaker, you need to go back to the McRib (no shame in that, by the way!). On behalf of DUMBO, I can assure you that we won't miss your minty vape smell, VICE-driven political hot takes about countries you couldn't pick out on a map, and the loud chatter (while I'm trying to eat) about your Rumble Boxing class or why he won't call you back. (I just met you 3 minutes ago and I'm sitting 5 tables over -- I can tell you why he ghosted).This is New York. Appreciate a restaurant like AlMar. It's why you live here.","Good brunch place. A quick walk from the Cliffs at Dumbo if you're looking for a good place to eat after bouldering. At around Sunday 1:40pm, we arrived and there was a 20 min wait to get seated. I got the smoked salmon panini which taste very good and was healthy. The atmosphere is chill with plenty of seats. Even when it was fully seated, conversation was easily made and heard. Note that there is a 4percent upcharge from the prices that you see on the menu if you pay with credit card!","Bland food and mediocre service. Not a place I would bring visiting friends. The restaurant is large and food is reasonably priced but I was extremely disappointed by the quality.Came for Sunday brunch and was told they couldn't seat three of us at a four person table for fear of ""messing up the flow"" even though there were many tables available. Egg in a Cloud: We came to try (and take photos of) this. I was impressed by how fluffy they made the egg white. It really looked like a cloud. It didn't have much taste but the bread, ham and cheese below were good. The spinach on the side was also super bland and watery.Burrata Salad: Lots of olives, super bland, salad had no flavor but burrata was okay.Crispy Risotto Cake: The risotto was super tasteless and extremely under salted. The presentation was unimpressive - a risotto pancake blanketed by two sunny side up eggs. We couldn't taste the butternut squash at all.Bellini: The bellini was decent for $8, a little strong but manageable.All the dishes had very basic taste profiles so they shouldn't haven't have been hard to get right but every single one was disappointingly bland in its own way.Besides the food, the waitress also didn't tell us that there was a 4% processing fee for credit cards. We didn't find out until they'd already processed our cards.",AlMar
151,DO NOT GET SUSHI HERE. ORDER HOT DISHES FROM THE KITCHEN. THEY ARE SO. MUCH. BETTER.Each dish from the kitchen was so incredibly tasty. I was disappointed they ran out of uni so no uni pasta but the crab pasta was extremely satisfying nonetheless. Also enjoyed the grilled octopus and the oyster tasting. My boyfriend who got the sushi tasting was so jealous of all my dishes.,"Made reservations for my birthday with my significant other for my first full experience of omakase and was honestly disappointed at the quality of the hand roll and the food poisoning we both got afterwards.We both ordered the Domokase and had a wonderful time trying out different starters and different types of nigiri until the handroll came. The fish was cold, almost as if it was taken out of the fridge and hadn't defrosted in time... the entire set was great except the handroll, which i was looking forward to as I love toro.. but was entirely disappointed by what happened next. Both my significant other and I had food poisoning right after, we were both constantly in and out of the bathroom and no we did not have anything after this place. We went straight home and the stomach pains on the ride back were entirely unbearable. Honestly, I might believe it was the handroll because it was entire cold... I wanted to come back to try the sushi course, but not so sure about that now... 3 stars because we had a great time and it was for my birthday celebration, but sitting in the bathroom for 3 hours was way too painful.","When I first tried this place a few years ago,  I was pretty impressed with their food. Came back this time and was very disappointed with just about everything from their omakase. Majority of the fish was not fresh. And when you can get past the fishy taste, the fish was tasteless. They did not marinate the fish for the sushi at all. The only raw item that was fresh was the uni. Dessert was a hit or miss.  The hojicha pudding was just OK. The black sesame panna cotta was very tasty. I think that was the highlight of the entire dinner, sadly since I came here for fish and not so much the desserts.I never cared much about decor, but theirs is really bad in the omakase corner. They used fluorescent lamps all around and put some sort of masking tape over it, so it appears to look yellow mellow. It's ugly. Really ugly. The frosted glass panel that's surrounding the chefs' prep area was not clean. It had splatters all over it. I'm just very unimpressed by everything there this time around.  I haven't been this disappointed in sushi in the longest time. $85 for their omakase. You get what you pay for. One extra star because of the really good panna cotta, but I won't be returning.","A girlfriend and I came in on a Saturday night with prior reservations made (highly recommended) and were seated right away. The exterior and interior of the restaurant are a big stand-out, with the modern fix on traditional Japanese dining. I honestly loved everything about the environment the moment we stepped inside.We both skipped out on the Domokase and ordered a la carte. I started off with a Momosa, which was good and strong so it was perfect for sipping throughout the meal. We shared an Agedashi Tofu (hot dish)- it tasted amazing and was a presentable appetizer.For the bulk part of our meal we sampled their various hand rolls. It is recommended to eat them right away so I went ahead and did so. The lighting inside made it difficult to take decent photos of the hand rolls, at least on my phone anyway. We tried the following; salmon, yellowtail, scallop, snow crab and blue crab. Not filling by any means but delicious and quality hand rolls overall! The yellowtail was my absolute favorite and I could honestly eat 5 of those!As for the price-point, we payed a little more just to snack and sip on a few things but the quality and environment make up for it. Definitely coming back to try their Domokase next time.","Heard a number of people, whom I usually respect, praise DOMODOMO. Rather than explain the disappointment,  the negatives and the very few positives, let me give all of you so called sushi experts some advice.Go up to  East 20th street to Sugarfish, and see what a real fabulous sushi experience can be. And, you don't have to spend hundreds of dollars like some of the overrated omikase sushi joints!!!Please let me know if you think I am correct.","Went here for a business dinner. I typically like traditional omakase but tried their Domokase and was pleasantly surprised given the price. They started with oyster tasting (2 oysters) and then an amuse of some sort of mushroom pudding (I was not a fan) and something else that was down with bamboo shoots (pretty tasty).Next they brought a plate that had a sample of the Korean fried chicken (AH-MA-ZING), black cod miso (very food and flavorful - I wanted more), a salmon tartare on a crostini (has nice flavor and crunch) and a scallop risotto (okay, but nothing to ride home about).After that they presented I believe 8 different sushi tastings which were okay. The portion of fish wasn't super generous, but for an $85 meal, I didn't entirely expect it to be. The service was food as was the food so id recommend giving them a try.",DOMODOMO
152,"I was looking forward to finding a great place in the neighborhood that I could regularly stop in for a decent meal on weekdays. Unfortunately I left disappointed and later a bit infuriated. Starting with the food, I ordered the prosciutto and pickles to start with the short rib and polenta for the main. Although the restaurant was almost empty it didnt stop the servers from rushing me out the establishment. Both my short rib and prosciutto plate arrived the same time, ok cool they're in a rush. However, the short rib was luke warm, lacked salt, and the polenta was watery with no texture and minimal flavor. Ok maybe they had a bad day I would normally give them another try. What was upsetting and why I will not give them another try is the service. The staff was not remotely friendly and seemed like their main aim was to get me in and out very quickly. I came to the restaurant around 6:30, which is happy hour for drinks until 7. Throughout the course of the meal (which lasted 50min) I had two drinks. When I received my check at 7:20, I noticed only one drink was HH. I asked the waiter if the second should be on the HH price he said no its after 7. Again, irritating but I'm completely fine with that it's their policy. What made me upset is when the waiter swiped my card he included gratuity as if I would not have paid him for his service. I have rarely been treated with such disrespect  at a restaurant and will not being going back, I'd  advise others to do the same.",Incredible Italian food with an equally cool interior.,"I can't speak for the food because we didn't even get to sit down, but I can say the service is the absolute worst I have ever encountered. And that's saying a lot, not even in 3rd world countries is service so unprofessional. We arrived around 8:20pm. The hostess told us it would be a 15/20 minute wait. Being a Friday night, it's normal that there wouldn't be an open table, and after a minute of deliberation, we decided to stay. Soon after, hordes of people began arriving, and waitress asked us to confirm if we were staying, I said yes. I even asked to view a menu while we waited. The waiting space is tiny, practically non existent, but nonetheless we waited patiently. Please note that given the tiny space, the hostess could see us standing there. She even smiled at a us a few times while we waited. I noticed a few people who arrived after us were shown to a table immediately. I let it slide, figuring that they had reservations. Then, about 25 minutes of waiting, I asked the hostess how much longer for a table. She acted surprised we were waiting for a table, and said she thought we were leaving! When she specifically asked if we we would wait, we said yes, and we waited for 25 minutes right in front of her and she still had the audacity to say she thought we leaving! Who in their right mind would think we were leaving when I asked for a menu and then waited for 25 minutes?At this point, we were visibly upset, waiting around for 25 minutes like idiots, while she had shown people that arrived after us a table. Never in my life did I imagine a restaurant with such high reviews to have such an incompetent hostess.Edit in response to the owner:When you asked to confirm if we staying, neither of us said ""no."" We both said yes. That is why I asked to view the menu! Who would ask to see the menu if they were not staying?!?! Better yet, who would wait in a tiny space if they were not staying?!?! Don't worry, after the terrible service, we have no intentions of coming back.","I love this place, I've come here with co-workers, friends, my wife, family-- it seems to work for every occasion.  It's a nice atmosphere, warm and cozy.  The food is fantastic-- I love the arancini balls which they only serve during the week. I wish they would have it on weekends too. It's definitely a must try.  All the pastas are good, I have worked my through their menu and they're all unique in their own way.  In general I've yet to have one bad meal here.As far as deserts go, the donut holes with chocolate or the olive cake are exceptional.","Best happy hour in Greenpoint. Okay, second best after El Born. They give you a choice of their most popular appetizers for ridiculously cheap and in addition to discounts on wine and beer, they have a few cocktail specials for only 8$. I dont remember the bartenders name, but he's always there and he makes an excellent four roses manhattan in addition to the rest. I also strongly recommend the Oaxacan, wow.For food it is hard to go wrong. The meatballs, calamari, burrata, and any pasta. My suggestion if you wanna save a few clams while eating some is hit the bar for the apps and a few drinks then share a main dish from the regular menu. You will be full, happy, and not quite broke.","Great place!! The inside is beautiful, food is good! If you get a chance, get the beer! It's so good!",Naked Dog
153,"Bougie basic brunch place.Food: 1/5I ordered the avocado toast ($20..??!!) thinking it'll be hard to fuck up such a basic dish, but I was wrong: avocado was not nicely mashed, very lumpy, and unseasoned; bread was over-toasted, completely dark, hard to cut, hard to eat.Service: 4/5waiters were attentive enough, food was served fast, but nothing amazing.The wait: 0/5Be prepared to spend 1.5 hrs waiting for a table if you choose to come during brunch hours on the weekend. Spoiler alert: totally not worth it!Overall:Great place for an IG shot, but that's pretty much all you are getting, unless you also wanted a nice piece of furniture.","Before you head straight to the glass elevator to get to the rooftop, why not meander through the first four floors of the furniture showroom and fantasize about owning it all for yourself?The best part about the RH Rooftop Restaurant is the decor, as you can imagine. It's dim, with sexy and architectural mood lighting, and marble tables. Sure, I'll pay $22 for raw vegetables and a dip and $24 for 4 slices of prosciutto with some bread and grapes if I get to hang out in this swanky restaurant.There's a sizeable outdoor area with lounge seating as well, but unfortunately you cannot eat outside.",Very overpriced but food is really good.The only negative point of our visit was that they were still selling romaine the day the Ebola news is out and we also b didn't know and we all had romaine that day.......... A bit yuck,"So I have never been into Restoring Hardware store. Heck, I don't even hangout in Meatpacking district much (anymore)...but I had to come check out what the buzz was about. First of all, the building is gorgeous. It makes you feel important just walking in the building. I was greeted by a beautiful/really nice hostess while taking in the atmosphere.My friend and I got there around 5:30pm on a monday so we didn't have to wait but I could see the place quickly filling up especially after 6.The rooftop is romantic and gorgeous. It is a perfect place for drink with coworkers, dates or girls night. Ok...it is a bit pricy but average for a decent rooftop bar in the city. Both the peach bellinis(not too sweet just the way i like) and tempranillo I had were great. Charcuterie was pretty good with good portion.I am definitely going back to Meatpacking for this spot.",Omg this restaurant is soooooo beautiful. The decor is absolutely gorgeous inside and so classy. The rooftop outside is also lovely with great views. My friend and I came here for a quick drink and app and had two glasses of rose and the cheese plate which was so delicious! I also had the kale Caesar salad and it was a good one. The only reason it's not a 5 for me was the service. Our service was quite slow and we kept even forgetting which server was ours which means she wasn't doing a great job. Maybe we'll get better service next time.,"Five star for the ambience and three star for the food. The restaurant sit on the 5th floor of the high end furniture shop with high widow ceiling and comfortable lighting. It has a terrace too that you can hang out while waiting for your seat. The by bottle wine list is a one pager but selection is good. We went with one of the three old world whites. Nothing stood out in terms of food but not disappointing either. There's also a wine/coffee bar on the third floor of the furniture shop where you could order and take to the terrace. The glass elevator to the restaurant is pretty cool to experience the grandeur of the place. It could be casual or dress up and it's suitable for a variety of occasions: catch up with friends, date, business, etc. An amazing New York experience.",RH Rooftop Restaurant
154,This place was okay. We came as group of 16 people and while the waitress was making room for us she got yelled at by her boss. Kinda felt bad for her. Also we made reservations in advance but they made us wait for the table. We got the margarita in a pitcher and it tasted like lemonade. We told the waiter this and so he got us tequila shots on the house which was pretty cool. I also got the espresso martini which wasnt so bad. Overall the place wasnt so bad but I dont think I'll be coming here again.,Had an amazing brunch. The mimosas were timely and packed with champagne. The staff were mad nice. I had the hang over plate witch was epic. Reminds me of a Rochester garbage plate.  Saturday at 1pm is a perfect time to stop by. You should disregard reviews of Lauren M and Stefan M because they were too intoxicated and the owner rightfully refused service. We were seated next to them and their reviews are unwarranted.,"Ordered the salmon. It came out fully raw. We sent it back. After try number two we cut it in front of the manager and his only words were ""wow that is still really raw. We will comp it."" What a disaster of a place. Salmon is simple and easy to cook. Save yourself time and money and go literally anywhere else in this city. We left and got cheap pizza. Smh.","***Highly recommend, Delicious food, Make a reservation***I highly recommended trying this place out if you're in the area; it does get busy so I recommend making a reservation especially if you're a large party. They have seating in the front and back of the restaurant. There are a lot of food options  and you can definitely split dishes.","Found a spot east midtown-ish so the commute to GCS wasn't going to be much. Required: good drinks, some apps. HandCraft hits hard on both requirements. What a great place to catch a drink and some apps. Try the ""nachos"" with tater tots to blow your mind. The tequila lemonade hit the spot not being too sweet or tart. Solid happy hour rounds it out for after work and makes your dollar go further. I'll definitely be back to further explore the rest of the menu.","Came here for work leaving drinks on a Wednesday evening. We took the front half of the bar, ample space for all of us. Ordering at the bar took ages during the peak of happy hour but it got better. The bar/restaurant offers different happy hour deals depending on the day. I ordered a side of deep fried Brussels Sprouts and also fries which I thoroughly enjoyed. Would come back here again just to have a side of the sprouts!Tip: book via Seated app and there's an additional cashback on your spending.",HandCraft Kitchen & Cocktails
155,Very unimpressed with their service. Got our bill wrong and brought out my order incorrectly twice. Very loud and not a lot of space on the tables. Cute atmosphere and food tasted good,"Horrible service, my food took so long to be made and it was just a yogurt bowl and the most ive ever paid for a side of bacon- something like 8 dollars for three strips- the granola bowl didnt have granola and just a horrible ratio to greek yogurt and toppings. The place itself was also so hot so I was sweating and the waitress came over to ask if it was good in the creepiest way i've ever been spoken to- so awkwardwill not be going back","I ordered the Everyday Salad, but with lettuce instead of kale. See my picture in the gallery. It was horrible. Just shredded lettuce and carrots. Completely dry, none of the toppings listed on the menu. Huge rip off. They put a head of iceburg lettuce through a paper shredder and charged me $20 for it.","Dropped by around 9pm on a weeknight with a buddy for dinner. The place was busy but there were a couple of two tops open so we were seated immediately.Emmy was our server and she was fantastic. It seamed like it was just her, one other server,  and a busser manning the dozen or so tables but she (and the busser) was still very attentive, friendly, never seemed rushed, and had a positive attitude the whole time.We started with a few raw oysters and an order of shishito peppers. The oysters were fresh and tasty although I wasn't a fan of the mignonette sauce. The shishito peppers were good but needed an extra pinch of salt.I also had their house old fashioned (they call it something else). The rye and bourbon blend is served separate in a capped spherical jar infused with smoke similar to a floral sheesh smoke. Pop the top, pour, and enjoy.The cheeseburger looked a little on the small side when it arrived but it's misleading since there is a second thick patty on it. The patties were cooked perfectly! Perfect seasoning, temperature, and flavor. It's served with fingerling fries that needed no condiments as they were buttery and perfectly seasoned with a salty garlic blend. Delicious meal.","2.5 Got the Grandma Anna sandwich and friend got the Pulled chicken sandwich with pancake. I did NOT like my sandwich at all - honestly the broccoli and kale just threw off the taste of the entire sandwich and I was so so disappointed. I tried the chicken from my friends sandwich though and it tasted really good. Otherwise, ambiance of place is nice. The tables call for a tight fit if there are others seated next to you. Not sure if I'd come back but honestly overall just disappointed since it's got such good reviews.","Nice hidden breakfast spot in the meat packing district around the corner from the Whitney Museum, which is where we're headed. BTW check out the Whitney it is incredible. I had the Grain and Egg bowl which was surprisingly yummy as I just begun looking this ancient grain thing. Hubby had blueberry corn cakes which he seemed to enjoy. This joint reminded me why I like New York so much. Great fairly unpretentious food in an old building tucked away and still packed. I do think we aged up the place a bit. I hadn't been to the meat packing packing district in 20 years, since my single party days, though I've been to NYC many times since. Christian Louboutin around the corner, what!? Changing nature of the city",The Wild Son
156,"I went to this place a few months ago so maybe things have changed, but it essentially had the vibe of a new place getting its act together. For example, we were ignored upon entering (there's always time for a ""We'll be right with you,"" but once we were accommodated, the staff was great. The place was a bit harried and small, but as you can see in the pictures it's got a killer interior design. The food was delish. We had sweet potato fries and romaine wedges.  They missed an order, which we didn't remind them of, as we were full, but they also switched out a drink I didn't like, because it tasted like soap, at no additional charge. Once this place gets going - it may be now for all I know - it'll be gangbusters. Just say hello to a gal when she walks in. Makes her feel special and want to stay, regardless of a soapy drink.","I wish I could give this place two ratings:1) the decor and ambiance is 5 star! Perfect for Instagram photos and to feel cute and flirty.2) The food is NOTHING special. I very rarely write bad food reviews, but this place truly broke my heart. I caught a cab from Central Park down to the place, hoping to be blown away with brussel sprouts, bacon and yummy cocktails. WRONG!Bacon - thick, tough, lack luster and sadly the crispy bits are TOO crispy making the tough chewing but crispy bit just wrong mouth feel. Brussel sprouts - BURNT! Even the table next to us complained as the server walked away, it was a waste. I left $120 lighter, still hungry and really disjointedness. For such a nice place, I am so sad the food is so far off.",Ambience is cool and hip. Food though was so so. Took a while for the tea and half and half to arrive.,"Went there on a summer holiday weekend, so it wasn't crowded but it is also located on a more quiet block. I loved the nature themed decorations with the trees and the chill atmosphere. It's a good place to go for a date or to catch up with friends. Popular music plays in the background but not so loud that you can't hear each other.  The servers were attentive. Cocktails are a bit on the expensive side since I got there after happy hour ended (happy hour seems to be half off). It also wasn't very strong for the original price. I would go again though for happy hour.","Went there last night to grab a drink with a friend. Granted it was July 4th weekend, so it wasn't crowded but it is also located on a more quiet block.

My partner and I were seated immediately once we walked in (with no reservations), which was fantastic because we were both starving! One awesome thing The Cabin does is that they have themes. The theme for this fine Sunday was a throwback to the nineties (nineties music and nineties themed food names). The DJ had a lot of great songs from 10+ years ago, and it was certainly a blast from the past! The decor is fantastic and beautiful. It gave off a very whimsical vibe to it, which I adore! It's not the biggest restaurant, but we were still able to move around comfortably.As for the food, there is an add-on option where you can get your choice of 3 drinks (cabin lager, mimosa screwdriver, or bloody mary) for $10 more. It sounds like a good deal, so we went for it (along with the Impossible burger and chicken & waffles)! The mimosa was mostly just champagne. There was a lack of orange juice to it. The next drink was a bloody mary. It, unfortunately, was just plain tomato juice and vodka. There was no seasoning at all. Needless to say, it was very bland and boring. The last drink was the screwdriver, which I would have to say was probably the best among the ones I've had, but even then, it tasted mostly like old orange juice and vodka. The Infinity burger was great, but it was missing a special something (like a sauce). We needed ketchup and mayonnaise to fix it, but aside from that, the tomato, onion, and arugula were yummy add-ons. The chicken and waffle was delicious overall! The waffles were perfectly cooked and fluffy (not dry and gross like a lot of other restaurants do it) with powdered sugar dusted on top. The whipped cinnamon butter brought the waffles alive even more. The fried chicken was crispy and flavorful on the outside and cooked PERFECTLY on the inside, but could do with being more flavorful on the inside. The hostess/waitress was very friendly! But the food took quite a long time to come out, considering how slow the restaurant was doing at the time, I expected them to come out in a more timely manner.",The Cabin NYC
157,Was impressed by the bun last week so I went in today just to order 3 orders of buns. 6 have burned bottom. I just threw them away.,"I usually don't leave feebacks, but this one And Momofuku ssam bar were my dinner and brunch next day  in a row... very very disappointing.... and I am feeling what a waste a waste of  time and money.... I don't like to wait 40minutes for disappointing menu and taste... and I can't believe this is Michelin Star restaurant.  Ambiance is of 3 star restaurant and the menu is very limited... taste of chicken feet was gamey and texture felt like undercooked.. iceberg veggie dish was disappointing as well, sauce was too bland.. I liked the short ribs but the portion was smaller than other dim sum restaurants..Shumai i was also disappointing and so small... Service was good but the styrofoam boxes stacked in corner table was not "" Star approved "".  Very tacky.","Not worth waiting at all. Worst Dim Sum place I have ever been. Maybe I am being over picky but, seriously there are tons of Dim Sum restaurants in New York, Brooklyn, Downtown Manhattan, Flushing/Queens which are way better than this restaurant chain and much more selections. Eg, always ordering chicken feet at every Dim Sum spot at this restaurant chain however, the feet taste gross and disgusting. People like me came here literally because the name brand I guess that is well known in HK based. Wont come back ever again perhaps, maybe HK flagship store for another trial and hopefully will bring a totally new experience. Besides the pork bun is tasty and crisp, others are flavorless and below average.","UPDATE: Mom was visiting and she loves Chinese food and Dim sum. We ordered pork bun, congee, and a few more dishes. There was on wait when we get there. We food took 10-15 minute after ordering.The pork bun came at room temperature. Everything else was just okay. I mentioned about the reimbursement of the pork bun. The server quickly grabbed the manager. I told her politely that I simply need to reimburse and the bun weren't hot.She decided to picked up the bill. I appreciate her hospitality and responsibility.","I'm originally from the bay area and i've had plenty of dim sum, this place lived up to the hype but it wasn't mind blowing. A few things my friends and i ordered:1) baked pork buns - my favorite. Comes in an order of 3, around $6. They're gooey, sweet, salty, and flaky. The bun itself is so delicious. I wish there was more meat than sauce, but overall this is a must try. 2) Shrimp rolls with chives - not a fan of the chives, but good portion size3) Shrimp dumpling (4), pretty good. The skin should be thinner, but the shrimp itself was pretty yummy. Not a whole lot of flavor, I've had much better 4) Steamed bean curd - very very good. So flavorful, authentic, and the textures are amazing. I would highly recommend. Overall, I'm not a fan of the order from your placemat ambiance. It doesn't give the same dim sum experience that you would at other places that have traditional carts. The menu is VERY limited, although most popular dishes are on it, I would still like to see more variety. Pretty $$$ for dim sum. For 3 people, we ordered 5 things to share, and it ended up being around $50 after tax and tip. Nothing too crazy, but if we wanted to walk out completely full then we would have to double our orders. I would recommend trying it if you're in the area, but it's not worth waiting over an hour in line for dim sum.","Skip everything and get 5 orders of the baked pork buns. These buns are soft, flaky, salty, but has a hint of sweetness to them - truly worth the hype! We put in another order after we finished our first. We also ordered a slew of other items:- chicken dumplings - way too ginger-y for my taste- sticky rice - so oily, wet, and mushy (bleh!)- steamed rice and beef - this was good but nothing special- steamed rice roll - again, so oily, did not enjoy- egg cake - good- beef balls - mushy, I don't recommend it- we also ordered the turnip cake but were glad it didn't come (would've probably been too oily as well)All in all, I do not recommend this place. Over-priced dim sum for oily food. Come only for the pork buns but you could get good buns for cheaper in Chinatown.",Tim Ho Wan
158,"Not set up for two people on a date. They have a rule that you need 3 people to a table. Unless you want to be shoved into a tiny corner with a wall jutting out into you with another couple you're practically on top of, where the tables are so small they barely fit one plate .The issue becomes apparent when you look around the restaurant and see empty booths and tables everywhere.On top of everything, hostess was indignant, which lead me to write this review.Summary--Bad for date night--No seating, no space--Bad for couples--Bad service","I came here for lunch recently, and it's still a decent spot. I got some sort of cuban fried rice.. damn, what was it called again? Anyway, I got a lunch special and I think it was like $13.50 or something before tax. It was decent, though not a very large portion. I also go a flan, which was really nice, and I think cost about $7. I think I might come back here in the future just for the flan, since it's one of my favorite desserts, and because I think these guys do it well.Coppelia's customer service is also suspect. I emailed them recently through their online portal, asking them a question about the menu. It's been a week, and no one has emailed me back yet. Sad.","The most disrespectful door man on the face of the earth. Told us it would be a 30 minute wait and then accepted another group as walk ups without asking us for seating. When speaking to the manager it was apparent he didn't care about the quality of the clientele and allowed the horrible ""bouncer"" to run the restaurant. This is NOT a proper Manhattan restaurant and should never be considered for anyone in living in or visiting Manhattan.","How to describe this place? The best? Heaven? Sanctuary? IdkWe're at a bar and a fight started. It was too late to find another bar, and too early to go home.My friends were going to take us to an Ukrainian cafe that opens late. I couldn't let that happen so I yelped what's open and I saw this place! We made the right decision. The food: literally the best Cuban sandwich I've had, that was my sister order. I shared 2 plates with a friend, we wiped them clean. Our friends ordered and finished their plates in no time. It was so good that we came back to it later the next week for a decent meal and we were not disappointed. I remember ordering drinks, but the food was too good that I couldn't get drunk again.","My favorite spot in NYC. Comfortable, staff is friendly, and always great food. Half off cocktails during happy hour 4-7pm on weekdays. Been going for 4 years now!","Love this place! The exterior is dressed to look like a classic French lunch spot, and the interior feels like an old-school diner with a Cuban twist. The employees are so welcoming too. The food is delicious. I highly recommend the Mac & Chicharron to share. I love how they place a Cuban influence on a traditional American mac & cheese - the creaminess of the sauce pairs perfectly with the crispiness of the chicharron. The Medianoche was good but not outstanding, as the pork was a bit dry. The Havana salad was delicious and refreshing, especially with the heavier dishes we ordered. Overall, a great place to stop by if you're in the area. I'll definitely be back!",Coppelia
159,"Back again and upping my review to a solid FIVE STARS.On a cold night in October, I'm back again for 2 Canitas and 1 Carne Asada.Dispense with the chips and brought my own water this time.OFF THE FREAKIN HOOK GOOD!!!Love this place.",The line was crazy!!About 25 mins wait to order the toco.you got to choose corn tortilla or flour tortilla.  got one beef and one pork with corn tortilla. Both meat were very juicy and tender. It's around $4 each with tax.Try not to come at rush hour to escape the long line!,"Very crowded, obviously very popular. Limited places to eat and you have to stand while eating. I guess that keeps the crowd moving. The food was good no doubt, better than most places. It was an interesting experience but I'm not sure it was compelling enough to get me to go back again when visiting the city as there are so many choices",Not a huge taco/Mexican food person - not because I don't like the food but rather because it's hard for me to find great spots BUT I was not disappointed coming here!! It deserves the reputation it has Unfortunately the pork (adobada) was out but I got the carne asada quesadilla and the meat was extremely tender! Don't forget your squeeze of lime and the drops of spicy sauce on top I also got the pollo taco which had a nice char flavor Overall quesadilla was $4.95 and taco was $3.75 Inside it was standing room only but I managed to find a spot after getting my food,"Wow.  Awesome Tacos made with love.  This place is a hole in the wall and that's how I like it.Perfect street tacos served warm on flour or corn tortillas with cilantro, onion, salsa and guacamole.Perfect with a Strawberry Fanta and some chips and salsa.Right across the street from the every tacky Harry Potter theater in Midtown.  Run for that bastion of fakery and to the loving arms of Los Taco's No. 1. Because this is as real as it gets.",Came here Saturday night around 6:30 before wicked. Very crowded. Long line outside the door. But the line moves fast. They are very efficient inside. I went with my husband and someone we were meeting. Terrible place to meet someone for the first time. You stand at counters. You have to smush in there to get a spot and very loud. Hard to have conversation with someone. So woops! BUT THAT BEING SAID. The tacos are delish. They definitely look bigger in the photos. They are small. Corn tacos were good. (Didn't try flour). But they didn't fall apart. I think the best were carne asada. I tried my husbands chicken and it was also really good (I totally regret not getting one) and then the pork. Also good but I thought the other meat ones were better. Pork was the spiciest. We made the horrible mistake by asking the lady who worked there about the cactus taco (whose ever heard of eating cactus??). Anyways she raves about it so we said we would try. Yuck. Disgusting. My husband and I couldn't eat more than the bite we tried. So all in all affordable tacos like 3.75 each? The meat ones are delicious. Again I got two and really regretted not getting more. They are small. Like I had to get pizza after (was not waiting in the long line again). No alcohol. I would def go back with hubby.,Los Tacos No.1
160,"After watching a video of the place and their huge bowl of noodles a while back, I finally decided to try this place with a friend. I went with their shrimp tempura udon ($17) while my friend chose their wagyu beef udon ($21). The waiter asked if we'd like the big or small portion, in which both cost the same price. It was a no brainer that we'd opt for the bigger size. However, we unfortunately confirmed my suspicions that it wasn't that the portions were huge, but the bowls that the noodles came in. My shrimp tempura set came with vegetable tempura too, which is nice that it wasn't just shrimps. Thankfully it was tasty, but the portion for the price was a little disappointing -- especially the way it's advertised and phrased. I felt hungry after finishing the meal and think that maybe the cost is what it is due to the appeal of the huge bowls.","Disappointing, to say the least. Our waiter told us that there was a smaller bowl and both would be the same price. I asked for the regular, assuming it wouldn't be the smaller he mentioned. I believe I was given the smaller portion... The noodles were okay, but there were exactly two tiny cubes of pork belly in my pork belly spicy tan tan udon. At that point, I just didn't care anymore. Not sure if I'll come back to try something else.","Everything about this place is huge. Huge menus, huge selection, huge bowls of udon. Although it is incredibly filling because of how gigantic the servings are, the food quality is pretty average. You can choose between thick and skinny noodles and regular or large portion of noodles (same price). They recommend skinny noodles with cold broth. Even if you get the regular portion of noodles, it still comes in a big bowl.I got the seafood jjigae udon which came with a couple of shrimps, scallops and clams. The broth was quite spicy! It was a reliable and good bowl of udon but not so amazing or unique that I would wait a long time for.","The theme of Tsurutontan would have to be their HUGE udon bowls. The large size here is definitely one of the biggest servings of udon I've seen! Here you can get a regular or a large size for the same exact price. This is reflected in the pricing, as each bowl will cost around $20 or more. We had the wagyu truffle udon and the tuna tartare cones. Not only does their udon come in large offerings, but the flavor is great! The broth is a 10/10 to me, as it's very rich and flavorful. The noodles are of excellent quality, and the toppings are tasty. I do recommend avoiding the tuna cones though. It's a pretty bland tasting dish for the price.The service here was excellent and attentive. I also enjoyed the presentation of the food. It's not crazy fancy but it really does elevates Udon. The menu can be a bit overwhelming as there is so much to choose from, but luckily they highlight their best sellers and even dedicate a whole page to them. Overall, as a lover of Udon and huge portions, this place does it right. The servings here are can be really big, but you're getting quality and not just quantity. Be prepared for a bit pricier dinner than your typical udon restaurant, but if you're dining with someone else, a large bowl can easily feed two. I would definitely recommend Tsurutontan.","The ambience was pretty goodService was great The uni creamy udon noodle, however, was too heavy and sweet...The truffle wagyu thin noodle was pretty good but the beef was SO chewy and greasy... doubt if it's real wagyu The spicy tuna roll was pretty awesome tho The proportion was big but it was 90%noodle and 10% of actual ingredients foods. Price should be a bit lower considering the quality of foods","Great place for udon noodles. We walked in early on a weekday evening without reservations and got a table right away. The seating decor is  partly done in bamboo Japanese style and it's very nice. There's 50% off on all drinks if you hit the happy hour which is before 6PM and also sit by the bar I think, not sure about that part. Coming to the food, we ordered seafood udon large and spicy pork belly udon regular. The latter had two small pieces of pork belly for $24. I am highly dissatisfied with the portion of protein in the udon. I do not recommend this dish, if you don't want to feel shortchanged like me. I have had $15 udon with better portions in malls.",Tsurutontan Udon Noodle Brasserie
161,Definitely was a disappointment. I'm sorry but the food wasn't worth anything we paid for. This place was packed when we were there so I guess the people in the area like the vibes more than anything c the ambience is cool and the staff is great.But the food wasn't worth it at all esp the lamb was a huge disappointment and the burger was dry as hell and the fries onions were so hard to bite thru I'm not sure why. Their house hot sauce is really good though.,"Brunch in NYC has been such a traumatic experience especially with big groups. This place rocked! The hostess, our waitress, the cooks and the striped shirts really knocked it out of the park. The price was right! Big tip because they deserved it.Thank you. I'm only going here for brunch from now on...","This was my second visit to their restaurant, one in Chelsea and the village location. The shashuka was incredible in comparison to the eggs benny. The eggs benny pictured definitely had a Mediterranean spin of the classic Benedict with house sauce and ditching the traditional English muffin. The pink eggs benny was good, but I am a big critic on eggs Benedict's and this just wasn't my style. Any new guests- I suggest the green shakshuka. I know I'll order it again!","Very good brunch. Went on an off time, Friday before a long weekend. Food and drinks were great. I hate paper straws so just ask if I want one before giving me one. I'd rather drink my Bloody Mary from the glass than us that ineffective straw.Food and service was great and it was quick without feeling rushed","OVER HYPED.When I arrived I wasn't sure if I should seat myself or not because there's no host stand.  So I stood in the doorway awkwardly waiting for someone to notice me while pretending to be deeply interested in their menu, even though I already knew what I was going to order thanks to Yelp images.I ordered a latte and the Madame Freda.  My latte arrived then my server brought over a bottle of Worcestershire sauce.  She was like, 'it's for the Madame Freda.'  I mean, yeah?  I'm not about to pour it into my latte!  She was very friendly though.The Madame Freda was delicious, but it took 30 minutes to arrive after I ordered it.  This was a Friday morning.  The restaurant was about half full.  In the time I was waiting I saw 3 tables receive their orders, eat, pay, AND leave!  But the duck prosciutto was delicious.  It came with a side salad, but the salad had no dressing, not even olive oil.  Was the egg yolk supposed to serve as the dressing?  I'm still not sure but that's what I did.  Wish there had been an explanation about the lack of dressing rather than the Worcestershire sauce.Overall, expensive.  Over hyped.  The Madame Freda was great.  You may wait a long time.","Beautiful place with a good atmosphere and delicious food- although small portions and a bit cramped for seating room. I've been excited to try Jack's Wife Frieda for a while and I was left content, although not too full. The poached eggs with grilled tomato and haloumi was an especially small portion. Also, I ordered a hot matcha latte and it came in a glass (not cup) with no handle... which I thought was odd since it was hot and I couldn't really hold the cup to drink it. The shakshouka was a group favorite!",Jack's Wife Freda
162,"Shuka was the last spot in the Bowery Group (Cookshop, Vic's and Rosie's are their others) that I hadn't visited yet, and it didn't disappoint. My friend and I went for the Feast and it was amazing. Only thing I didn't care for was the pana cotta dessert (not my cup of tea). The mezze dips and kebabs were the standouts for me.","Loved the food and ambiance of Shuka! We came for lunch and were seated in the refreshing green ""sun room."" We ordered the Chickpea Salad, Spit Roasted Chicken Shawarma, and Mediterranean Plate.- The Chickpea Salad: simple (had just a few ingredients: chickpeas, kale, celery, a poached egg, some dressing), but delicious.- Spit Roasted Chicken Shawarma: The chicken strips were tender and flavorful. I was not very sure how to eat this dish--it was a little difficult to eat the chicken and pita all together. The pita was too thin and soft to be cut into pizza-like slices. If not sharing with others, it probably can be eaten as a wrap.- Mediterranean Plate: The falafels in the were very well-spiced and had a few crunchy chickpea pieces in them. The pita bread was very fresh.","Fun place butOne of the more un-accommodating chefs/kitchens I've experienced.We ordered hummus with flatbread. For our dinner entree they wouldn't substitute the bread for rice. I couldn't even buy a side of rice. (They have a rice entree on menu) It was offensive that I even made the request, completely shut me down ""no way"". Very strange. We left, there is another Mediterranean resultant a few doors down.","Wow. That's really all I can say to encapsulate my brunch experience at Shuka. The wait wasn't too long for a bustling Saturday, and the service was lovely too. We were seated in a cute little corner at the back of the restaurant, which, by the way, is a lot larger than one might expect. Everything we ordered was delicious and uniquely put together. We ordered two cocktails, both with very interesting flavors. We then had the Shakshuka and the Tunisian Breakfast. So many flavors were bursting in my mouth, and I just wanted more. This was my first mediterranean brunch, and it definitely set the bar very high. I enjoyed the sauce and the dips within each dish, and everything felt healthy and light despite being very filling. Not to mention the interior decor is absolutely stunning. I will definitely come back if I ever get the chance to!",I really enjoyed my time hereThey did a great job of bringing the food out on timeI would try to avoid the brunch rush that starts around 1130 if you can. Try not to sit next to the windows because the cold draft wind can be really annoyingMusic choice was really poor-80s music does not vibe well w the Mediterranean fee of this place and really distracts from the experience along with the enjoyment of the food.The food itself was pretty good - I really enjoyed the authentic shakshuka(red one) more than anything else that we tried on the menu. Try to avoid the appetizers as they're nothing special - and available at whole foods anyways. The cinnamon rolls were not very different from any other cinnamon roll at a higher end bakery.Their cappuccino was a little warm and bitter. There's a lot of foam but not much volume. I will try to avoid this place in gofer alternatives like Café Mogador for brunch. I think the experience other places is more authentic and enjoyable.,"One of the best Mediterranean restaurants in the city - can be a bit of a pain to reach by taxi/Uber depending on where you're coming from, if for dinner, since the holland tunnel seems to clog almost everything in the area. I found easiest to be either getting off Canal on A,C,E or Houston on 1,2 and then walk about 5 mins or so.Make a reservation if you can, otherwise the wait can easily climb up to 2 hours, especially on the weekends. A sweet spot os about 530pm, if you can make it.A good alternative is to just sit at the bar, if you are just meeting 1 or 2 people (they serve the full menu). A group larger than that will be challenging to pull off. Half the bar is people just having a drink while they wait for a table, so if it looks like they're not eating and about to finish their drinks, hover nearby and be ready to pounce on the seats before someone does half a second later.The menu is short and to the point - one page. Pretty much everything is good. Obviously, we typically get the hummus as a starter. They're a bit seasonal, so expect some kind of seasonal toping/ingredient on it or also on the labne. Speaking of which, this is some of the best labne out there. It has a thicker consistency, which I like, as opposed to something thinner like a light watery yogurt.The kabobs are great, but careful... the skewer comes hot! Just watch out for it.The cocktails are so good and have interesting flavors... plus some of their glassware is ornate and pretty.Two thumbs up so please go check them out for great Mediterranean.",Shuka

Never cared for British cuisine until this place proved it can be done flavorfully.Atmosphere was calm, food was good, drinks were surprisingly tasty, and service was friendly and attentive. Has vegetarian options on the menu, but everything is a touch pricey. (as to be expected) Would definitely recommend if you're in the area and looking for a restaurant with a pub feel.","In the passage of my travels summons a British pub for lunch in Midtown West, Manhattan.  Since I am unable to travel to the UK, the UK comes to NYC.  Yelp mobile has the ability to make reservations even within then next twelve minutes.  I am lured by previous reviews of Cock & Bull's renowned Cod and Chips.  Four stars due to the very minimal customer service experienced as it was not very busy nor crowded on a Monday afternoon of 1 pm.  Cock & Bull is the standard sports bar of a British flair of Victorian decorum and British cuisine.  Where are the British pomp and pageantry? TV's are available affixed to the walls by the bar for eyes to be engrossed.  They do carry an extensive craft beer selection - ergo, mate do not request for Coors Light or Heineken.  Upon being promptly seated I immediately placed my food order, but took my time to decide on a drink and the waiter would return to take my drink order.  Forward.  I waited for the waiter to return to take my drink order.  I waited, I waited, I waited and I waited for any waiter or wait staff available for customer service.  Waiting for resolution.  Waiting for absolution. Waiting for salvation.  I scanned the entire business for a staff to seek assistance and finally flagged from a distanced my designated waiter.  In visible antagonistic acquiescence he obliged to heed my drink order of one glass of white wine.  One measly glass of wine does not require concoction of mixing ingredients nor the time required, but only obtaining the wine bottle and pouring.  During my meal I saw a party of three walked in without a reservation for lunch as they were dressed in business casual attire and the wait staff immediately serve them without hesitating or waiting.  I believe it is discrimination for social injustice and deliberate maleficence for a party of one inattentively serviced vs. a large party of three and larger to be immediately served.  Full of malarkey.  An atmosphere of malaise.  Bad customer service is my cock and bull story mate.  No mindful consideration for a party of one.  This business is conveniently located within the vicinity of Grand Central Terminal.  Business cards are available for grabs.  The computerized bill is served affixed to their postcard.  I do not see cheese seftons, custard pudding, or trifle on the dessert menu as these are all traditional British Victorian desserts or sweets.Cod & Chips $23.95Fresh Ale battered cod fish & minted mushy peas with bacon served with tartar sauce, lemon and hand cut thick chips.  This entree is a huge meal extensive for lunch.  Fresh Ale battered is not usually my cup of tea as I prefer breaded or fish fry.  The mushy peas is my first exposure to authentic traditional British cuisine as a traditional accompaniment to fish and chips.  I like peas alone and find this format was okay.  It was too green for me like Elphaba Thropp, a fictional character in ""Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West"" by Gregory Maguire.

Off with the Royal chef head! Fuming mad as you demand his butt in front of you. Instead of shivering in terror, this Royal Chef sauntered with a plate of TINY SHANGHAI Truffle XLB. One top nibble bite of this fragrant dumpling, your anger dissipates.... slurps down a tasty morsel.... you are in pure glee! Next thing you know, you ask sheepishly for more. And that royal chef? Full pardon and a trunk of gold coins! Next visit we'll venture out and try other dishes.... but XLB pulls me back in!","We came here on a weekend. It's in the middle of Little Italy. - soup dumplings: this came as the last dish. It took them over half an hour to serve us this. The skin was thin, and plenty of soup inside. The best dish of the night and competitive with other Shanghai soup dumplings in Chinatown. - Shanghai stir fried rice cake: too oily- wine/drunk chicken: the wine taste is not bad. But the chicken is too raw. The bones are too bloody - scallion pancake: too oily.Tldr; unlikely I will come back, given that there are much better options few blocks away. Overall, the seasoning is off and the food was too oily.","It's a nice, cozy restaurant. Food was average...not really memorable. Don't think I'll be going back.","Very surprised but thankful for the meal I had here. We ordered a variety of goods, including soup dumplings, beef scallion pancakes, baby Shanghai bai choy, and pan-fried buns. We also ordered sesame noodles but they were so good we forgot to take a picture before digging in. I would definitely recommend those!The soup dumplings had a slightly thick skin, but the soup was flavorful! The bok choy added a light and crisp air to the meal, as it was only slightly seasoned. I missed my green vegetables. The pan-fried buns were the only let down, as they were not fried enough and the skin was definitely a lot thicker than I had wished. Quite a nice little gem in the midst of Little Italy. The restaurant had a very homey vibe, and the service was friendly too!","Good food. Kids are more than they normally do, but it didn't stop us from still over ordering. Tasty dumplingsGreat fried soft noodlesNothing witty to say, just a good meal that wasn't chicken fingers, Mac n Cheese or a burger.","Pretty solid soup dumpling spot in little Italy. They can get busy, but wait time is never a issue. I really enjoy their truffle pork soup dumplings as well as their pork and crab dumplings.schezuan wontons are a great choice as well, perfect balance of spiciness and sweetness. Great service!P.s it's cash only, but they will also take debit cards.",Tiny Shanghai
166,Not a bad place here. Ramen isn't bad. The drinks are okay. The appetizers is okay. Would recommend anyone new to give this place a try. I got their bone marrow ramen. It's good but it's not amazing. I would come back for just a bowl of ramen,"Surprised about the high review. The bow marrow ramen is of course rare, but the concept probably overweighs the food itself. Neither the noodle or the soup tasted good, and the two pieces of beaf were dry and had no flavor. Then there is mostly nothing else in the ramen soup unless you add additional yourself. The other Raman we ordered, spicy tantan, was whatever too.Also didn't quite like the service. The waitress seemed to be rushing us all the time even when they were not busy at all.","The staff here is super friendly and I had no problem with the service, but I'm so sorry.. this was probably the worst ramen I've ever had. The broth tasted like water, salt, and fat. There was no real pork/beef flavor. My boyfriend got the bone marrow beef ramen and I got the regular tonkatsu. I don't know what kind of bone marrow we got, but I tried some of it and it was just so bad. Neither one of us could finish our ramen because the broth literally tasted like salty water and oil. I was really disappointed because there were fairly good reviews on yelp and I was expecting some really good ramen.",What a wonderful evening! We had Ramen there and it was a very very good one. (We try a lot of ramen all over the world)The beer also was a good and authentic one und we would recommend this Restaurant,"Located inside the Wyndham Garden Hotel. A bit small inside. Yelp check-in gets you a free bowl of edamame. I arrived around 6:30 and was seated right away. My friend and I accidentally ordered the Born Gold Junmai Daiginjo. We accidentally ordered this due to both of us misreading the menu (lol oops). It was a delicious mistake in the end.For apps we had the shishito pepper, pork bao and edamame. Pretty standard apps. I don't think the pork bao is worth the price though, even at happy hour price. Probably because it only comes with one bun.I ordered the Shinka Tonkotsu ramen. I'm not sure if my palette is refined enough to tell the difference between broth cooked for 14 hours or 5 hours. Nonetheless it was very tasty. The chashu was tender, porky flavorful and just enough fat on it. I also love soft-boiled eggs, especially when the yolk mixes in with the noodles. Yummmmm. The noodles were cooked perfectly and had a good bite to it. My friend ordered the Beef Bone Marrow Gyukotsu. The broth was very creamy and luxurious tasting. If you enjoy bone marrow, this is the ramen for you. The ramen/broth here isn't overly salty either! I didn't have to drink a liter of water afterwards to quench my thirst. If you did, the bathrooms are through this door next to the entrance and downstairs.","Five stars for the happy hour drink menu. 50% off Dassai 50? Yes, please! Three stars for the ramen itself. The bone marrow ramen had a flavorful both but the noodles were nothing special. The duck ramen was fun. They bring it out with smoke. The duck itself was a bit dry. That kind of sums up this place, more show than substance.That said, if you're looking for some fun Asian inspired cocktails between 5 and 7 p.m. in the Chinatown area, Shinka is the place to go!",Shinka Ramen & Sake Bar
167,"I don't get the hype. We got Belgian Waffle and Pulled Pork Benny. Waffle was over sweet and there was nothing salty or savory to compensate the sweetness. Worst Waffle I every had. The benny was not even warm. The eggs were not poached properly. Pulled pork tasted like it was frozen. Whatever sauce they had on there was overpoweringly vinegar. We couldn't even figure out where the chipotle sauce was. Potatoes were not mashed. They were not ""garlicky""The space itself was loud and noisy. It wouldn't have minded this if the food was good. I have no idea where all these good reviews are coming from. And if you're here for brunch like we were, you'll be disappointed by portion. Idk maybe it's not a brunch place but portions are small. I wish I took pictures :/","Not often do I have an experience like this with one of the rudest servers of all time.  I have done over a thousand reviews and this one takes the cake.  This server was on fire with the attitude and had an attitude the whole time we were there. He didnt even let me open my laptop to check something for work. Apparently it is not allowed here. I could understand if I was trying to camp out for hours but I wasn't. I literally opened my laptop for a second and he pounced. Laptop police!!!This terrible service ultimately ruined the whole experience for myself and my guest. As for the food, it came out very quickly which was also troubling. I went with the quinoa bowl with smoked salmon. It wasnt bad but not the greatest. My guest had the waffle which she said was good but was a very small portion. This rating would have been a lot better if it wasnt for the server who woke up on the wrong side of the bed. It is a shame because this place has potential. Too bad this is NYC so many other places to go instead. The only reason they didn't get 1 star is because the food was decent.",Wouldn't let me sit down since I was waiting for someone....even though the restaurant was empty. I just said screw it and went elsewhere.,"I've been to Citizens of Chelsea a few times and decided to pop into the Gramercy location last week. The menu is exactly the same at both locations. They make great coffee, which you can also get to-go at the front of the restaurant. The staff is incredibly friendly, and the food is consistent. It isn't incredible, but it's good and the environment and staff make it worth the trip. I prefer the decor at this location, but it is a little cramped, so it probably isn't the best spot if you like to have a lot of room.","If you love brunch and are into Instagram aesthetics, you'll need to make a visit to this cute spot. My friend and I started our day here on a Monday, so it was not crowded. Once I walked in, I was obsessed with the decor and can't really imagine it being a brunch location, but so glad it is. We ordered the Pulled Pork Benny, the Salmon Eggs, and of course, mimosas! Out of the two benedicts, I really liked the Pulled Pork and thought it was pretty flavorful, however, my friend really liked the Salmon Eggs since the salmon were smoked very well - super super fresh! Honestly, after I found out about this place, I wanted to come here to take pictures, but not only does it give off California vibes, the visually pleasing presentation and the taste of the food blew my mind. To all NYC tourists and travelers: add this to your itinerary!","My goodness, what a good find this place is!After getting done at the VA Medical Center nearby, I searched for a good place to eat on my Yelp app. Lo and behold, I found Citizens of Gramercy.I walked in to this brightly decorated restaurant. The staff was friendly and attentive. I sat down and sipped on coffee while I went through their menu. I decided on the avocado toast, with beet hummus and poached eggs. The food was delicious! And the coffee had the right amount of caffeine I needed to carry out the rest of the day.I chatted with the staff here a bit, and it turned out that the waitress was also from California. Pretty cool, I've ran into quite a few people from home here in NYC already.This place set a good impression. The next time I go to the VA, I will consider stopping here for lunch.",Citizens Of Gramercy
168,"Food was delicious but service was a huge downer. 2 things.First, we had reservations at 6pm--fairly early to get a glimpse of the view while we eat our meal. The place was basically empty but the maitre d' sat us at the booth in the back where the sun glare was so strong. During the whole meal, a lot of window seats were empty.Second, it's so disappointing to see that a Michelin star restaurant has servers who never smiles. I came with my boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary and I politely asked the server to take a photo for us. No response but a sigh as if we asked something so difficult. He didn't even bother checking up on us throughout our entire meal. We literally waited 20 min each for the entree and dessert to come out. Spent nearly 500 for a mediocre service with no view. I wouldn't come back here.","The food is good.The service is good, as long as you're willing to wait a while for deserts or the check.But after 4 years of going there, dozens of time, we still never got a table next to the window. Always in the back. It's up the the Maitre D to decide who sits there, and given there is at least one table sitting empty the whole service half of the time we went there, it's becoming impossible to not take it personally anymore. Today there were 5 tables next to the window. Nobody sat on 2 of them the whole service.Very disappointing, killed the fun of going there.","Racist, pretentious restaurant with overrated food. They take advantage of tourists from abroad by upcharging them discreetly. Immoral business practice that needs to learn that having a Michelin star doesn't mean you can do whatever you want.","Some things in life are worth dressing up for, and a visit to the illustrious River Cafe is one of them.  Known around the world as a culinary destination, it's the most enchanted landmark eatery in the City and nestled under the Brooklyn Bridge.  Offering gorgeous views of Manhattan, the setting is boundlessly romantic.  However, they don't rest on their looks alone.  A prestigious roster of chef alums includes Charlie Palmer (Aureole, Crimson & Rye), David Burke (David Burke Kitchen) and Rick Moonen (RM, Oceana); ingredients have always been the finest available, and the kitchen team inherently understands what goes with what.  Succulent pork belly with scallops was a favorite until i discovered the glistening duck breast with sweet potato spatzle.  This restaurant may possibly be my all-time favorite. The words iconic and epic fall short in describing the experience.  If you've never been, make it a bucket list item!","If I could leave less than a one star review I would. My partner made a reservation for us to celebrate our engagement here. On our way to the restaurant we got caught in the rain so we dropped our blazers off and called the restaurant to make sure that it would be fine for us to dine without our jackets. The woman on the phone assured us it would be fine. Upon arriving at the restaurant we were treated with more disrespect than I have ever felt from any restaurant. Ever. The doorman didn't greet us, he just asked us if we had a reservation. He didn't even open the door. When we entered, (the empty cafe) the hostess would not seat us because we were wet. We informed her we had called ahead and were told it would fine, but she didn't even go speak to someone else. She simply made us leave. The deep unkindness with which we were met speaks volumes about this establishment. No number of Michelin stars, no food, no matter how delicious, is worth the disrespect we felt upon stepping foot in the river cafe. Save your money. Eat elsewhere.","We decided to come here after our marriage at city hall to celebrate and we were entirely underwhelmed. The place was extremely stuffy, I expected this, but it was a bit more than I thought it would be. The food was outrageously priced for what it was and as a resident of Brooklyn, I've had so much better throughout Brooklyn and Manhattan. We ordered the scallops, crab cakes, lobster and branzino. All was good, but lacking in flavor. Everyone was there celebrating something and everyone got the same treatment, so we didn't really feel special. It's such a great location, but think the whole place could do with a little modern kick.",The River Café
169,"Went to Toloache-50 for dinner. Thought we'd be clear with a later in the evening reservation. Arrived at 9pm figuring it would be after the happy hour crowd. Uh-Oh. The place was noisy, very noisy. Did I say it was noisy? Yes, that noisy where conversation with dinner partner was to say the least strained. Forget about being a nosey neighbor...I could see the lips moving on the people at the next table but couldn't here a sound of what they were trying to say to each other. We were close enough that I should have been able to hear what they were saying.Ok, moving on to the food. We had tacos and fajitas. good but could not be enjoyed fully. Why you ask, the noise just didn't make for a relaxing meal.Are we going back? Probably not....Why you ask? The noise.","So the venue and ambiance are nice.  The service is great from the bar area.  But the lunch tacos were disappointing.  The price was waay too exorbitant.  I mean the two fish tacos come with rice and beans, but I don't think that really justified the price.  More so contributing to the rent prices there.  With that being said the place is compact and I don't recommend sitting at the bar as it is uncomfortable as hell to eat and maneuver out to use the bathroom.  I could tell the gentleman next to me also felt uncomfortable as the party to my left was contributing to the uneasiness by blocking the area.  I don't see myself coming here as the prices are too much for Mexican food.","Have visited this place a number of times, the food is decent enough, just doesn't justify the price...I do not buy the rent thing, as there are several nearby mexican places that are much better bang/buck",D-LISH-US!Found this delight while visiting NY and staying at the Renaissance Hotel. Walked in at 7:30p on a Sunday evening. Were greeted by to lovely hostesses and sat immediately. Service was fast and delightful,Pretty good!!!! Food was tasty and fresh. Angel was our waiter and he was awesome. The service is courteous but fast. They know people are trying to get to their shows.Don't miss the crepas for dessert.,"Came here for a team lunch and was excited to finally try the fancy Mexican restaurant next door to my office - I've always seen this place packed for lunch and dinner, so I think that may have heightened my expectations? I was underwhelmed with the food and service but I do hope to try it again soon and try something else that appeals to me. We started with a trio of guac which was actually really good. I think it's good for a group of 5-6 people, cause then everyone gets to try all of them. They're unique and well seasoned. I ordered the short rib bone marrow quesadilla and was underwhelmed. I expected a lot more flavor, especially with the marrow but I feel like it was not there. Also, I think it's a bit overpriced for the serving size and   the flavor. My boss got a caesar salad and it looked like 3 pieces of romaine with some dressing... she enjoyed it but I feel like I would've been really disappointed seeing and getting that.",Toloache 50
170,"Not the Vanessa's Dumpling I knew from years ago when they first opened. The dumplings weren't what I remembered it to be, the filling fell right out the skin after one bite and the skin was thick. The hot & sour soup was also at par. I didn't get the reminiscing taste of what they used to be! I was a little disappointed. Despite that, there were a few tables to sit at and high tops by the entrance/exit with a few soy sauce and sriracha bottles. The service was quick and it was filled with diverse customers.","CATFISH LEVEL: 5/5: Looks good, tastes terrible, couldn't even finishThis place used to be a staple for cheap and good dumplings. Unfortunately, not only has the quality of their food gone down, the service was absolutely terrible. We were a group of 4 but only received 2 forks, so I asked for more, was given a nasty look, and then the forks were thrown onto my tray.We ordered 2 orders of dumplings and a sesame pancake with peking duck. The dumplings used to be super juicy with a nice thin and crispy skin and were cooked to order. Now, they are made in advance and left in a pan to stay warm. The skin was super thick and soggy, and very disappointing. The duck inside the pancake was so cold, it seemed like it came right out of the fridge. I went to the cashier to tell them, and the woman took it from my hand and kept touching the pancake trying to say it's not cold. I asked her to make it again so that it was hot, and she put the pancake in the microwave! I was so upset and disappointed!! Not only did we get terrible service, the food was underwhelming. If I could give zero stars, I would. Fix the attitude and make hot food that is meant to be served hot.","Maybe it's because I just came back from China, but wow, I was so unimpressed and disappointed by Vanessa's. First of all, the place is so cramped and dirty. If you're with others, it's going to be so frustrating to find a place to sit. And don't even get me started on the most disgusting bathroom I have yet to encounter. My shoes were too good for that bathroom.Second of all, the food was awful. The beef pancake was so plasticky. The edamame was unnecessarily drenched in salt. The dumplings were doable, I guess, but nothing worthy enough to be their namesake. The mango shake was pure sugar and tasted fake. It was left unfinished. Last, it took over thirty minutes to get our very basic order of food. To stand there and wait the the whole time for some simple dumplings and edamame is ridiculous and a waste of time. If you're in Chinatown, you're surrounded with so many better options within the same price range. Don't go here just because of the name.","One of the top cheap eats in the City. Unassuming interiors but consistently good dumplings.Must tries are the boiled shrimp dumplings in spicy sauce and the vegetable dumplings. Sesame pancakes are decent too. They have a $10 card minimum, which at this place you can be at real risk of being under for a meal.They also sell frozen dumplings to go, but those don't quite have the same magical preparation as the ones in store.Overall great place for a good, cheap and fast meal. Becomes addictive too...",Their dumplings are amazing. This is the king of dumplings in NYC. Their dumpling skin is a little on the thick side but I'm totally down with it.My favorite sesame pancake is actually the SESAME DUCK PANCAKE. The meat is super tender and delicious. You have to get this!,"TLDR - Nothing says authentic like repurposed Sriracha bottles, poor air ventilation, and a cashier that definitely makes you Google about child labor laws.On a walk through Chinatown, I just stumbled into this place after finding out they had 4 dumplings for $2. These puppies were as good as anything I could ask for. I got some standard pan-fried pork dumplings and they tasted exactly like what I get in China. Delicious filling, dough wrap that's not to thin and not to thick, and a great dumpling sauce to pair. Dumpling sauce is in the Sriracha bottles and I'd recommend taking it to go if the weather is nice out, because the ventilation ain't the greatest inside. If I weren't staying so far, I would absolutely come multiple times a week, but maybe I'll just stick to once a week. Seems like a family run business that makes the gamut of dumplings, pan-fried buns, and other Chinese ""small eats."" 10 out of 10 would recommend to anyone who's a fan.",Vanessa's Dumpling House

Affordable place when you want to try Mediterranean food.",Walked by this place a few times before deciding to give it a try. Very dimly lit which makes it ideal for an intimate dinner. Food is very delicious and consistent. Would recommend the Chicken and rice bowl!,"Dar 525 was fantastic. The portions were great, the flavors were delicious, and the brunch prices are super enticing as well!!! The Mediterranean open face omelette was super filling and super sizeable. The shakshuka was delicious and the eggs were cooked nicely as well. The pita they serve you is always super fresh, toasty, and puffy with steam! Be careful of your hands when you tear into that steam filled pita pocket! The flavors were good, food was delicious, portions were generous, prices were good. All in all, would recommend everything I got!!","In the short time I've been living in this neighborhood, this is the only place I've come back to. First time I went was during a weekday for lunch and my partner and I both had the falafel platter. Not only is it delicious but what a bargain! For 10 bucks you get a legitimate platter that you can barely finish and everything on the plate is a win. Went back for brunch and got the Mediterranean breakfast and it didn't let me down. The za'atar bread was delicious and the salad and eggs also A+. And again, SO MUCH FOOD. It's unbelievable and so tasty. On top of that, the staff is super friendly and appreciative of their customers. Their Driggs location is a great neighborhood spot and I see myself returning over and over.",Dar 525
172,"Crazy good chicken biscuit sandwich and oyster po boy. The po boy is authentic New Orleans style with just lettuce, tomato, mayo, ketchup and hot sauce. None of that zesty/house sauce so many places use. It's also dank because the friend oysters are soo juicy and breaded just enough.The fried chicken is moist inside and not ridiculously crunchy. It has a little kick too, which balances well with the gravy. The biscuit is dense & not super buttery which makes for killer sandiwch","I enjoyed the flavor of the beef sandwich, very juicy.Cons:- Portion seemed a little small for the price- The chicken biscuit was too messy in my opinion, but tasted alright- Wait times are looong here bc there's generally just 1-2 people working at a time. So the register is often abandoned while cooking- Minor, but I wanted to try their po boy but they were out in middle of lunchtime. I'd recommend calling ahead in the future",Kind of hole in the wall. Very limited seating. Not kinda friendly. No space to park stroller inside or outside. No high chair.

We happened to be in the area and decided to get a snack (fried chicken sandwiches can be snacks, you know). Seeing how highly reviewed this place was on Yelp we decided to give this place a try.We nearly walked right past this place - it looked like a dingy hole in the wall. But hey, I love that vibe if they can serve up some good food. We ordered the fried chicken biscuit sandwich, which was smothered in gravy and topped with a red cabbage slaw. Biscuit was ok, chicken was very moist, I don't think it was as crunchy as I thought it would be, the gravy and the slaw were a nice touch. Overall it was a solid sandwich, but I wouldn't make the trek out there just for it. What really dinged me however was that we found a long, wavy black hair right in the middle of the sandwich. I get it, its a divey kind of place, but ew. No thanks.",Cheeky Sandwiches
173,"Arrived at 7:15p for our reservation and was seated within 5 minutes.  Ended up ordering the RW fixed price menu within 10 min after flagging down our waiter. 30 min pass and still nothing - not even bread.  We asked one of the servers for bread and he brought it finally to the table.  Another 15 min pass before they finally bring out the appetizers (they had to ask if we had already gotten them!).  The ravioli with truffle was delicious- the pate was not.  After about 20 minutes our entrees came out - except they we're the wrong ones.  Ended up having to wait another 10 minutes but at ke I st our waiter let us keep the erroneous entrees.  The hangar steak was not bad - the fish however was very bland.  The cornish hen was also just okay.  For desserts, they ended up bringing out the wrong ones again - again our waiter let us keep the erroneous desserts.  The banana brulee was okay and ditto for the profiteroles.  The croquant was tasty however.At the end of our meal our waiter told us there was an error in the system with the kitchen basically replicating the order of the people who sat at out table before us.  That's excusable I suppose, but what isn't is the fact that our meal, all told, took nearly 3 hours!In summary:Service: 2/5Food: 3.5/5Ambiance: 3/5 (super loud)Value: 3.5/5Had the food quality been better, we would give it another shot.  Unfortunately it was not and we will not be back.",Booked this restaurant for French Restaurant week. I was excited as reviews were impressive. We didn't get a good vibe as soon as we found the place. The waiter or server was unfriendly and not welcoming. He basically just leave the food on the table on a rush and not give us description about the food he was serving. Bread was stale. Water was warm. Food was mediocre at best. Foie gras was not cooked all the way (and I had a lot over the years-never experienced being cooked this way).Service was slow also- although we noticed old patrons get entertained and took order first before we did even tho we sat first. Pricey for a mediocre food and bad service. Very disappointed as it was our first night in New York. We could have ate dinner somewhere close to our hotel. I do not recommend this restaurant.,"I thought it would be a fancier restaurant, but it seemed like a tight family runned restaurant. The staff seemed unfriendly. Ordered a set of food for one person because we ate beforehand and the waiter questioned us as to why we didn't order more. Seemed like he was looking down on us because we couldn't afford more?? Really ashamed because we has high standards for this restaurant.","Came here for restaurant week with a party of 5. For some reason, they won't allow more than parties of 4 to book a reservation online, but I called and it was easily handled and we were able to book the time we wanted! I ordered as an appetizer the watermelon salad. It's a simple dish, but nothing wrong with it and I quite enjoyed it. Basically watermelon cubes with feta cheese and maybe some herb seasoning. It tastes light and healthy, but still delicious. For the entree, I got the rabbit. It was quite good and it was a LOT of food. I thought the flavoring was perfect - it wasn't too salty. I would highly recommend it. This was my first time trying rabbit and I thought it would be really gamey, but it ended up tasting just like very tender chicken. Don't shy away from it if you've never tried rabbit because it's definitely very good.For dessert, I got the banana creme brûlée. It tasted very similar to the magnolia banana bread pudding but creme brûlée version. By this time I was extremely full, but even for someone who was so full and doesn't love creme brûlée, I thought this dish was excellent!!! A great way to finish the meal.I heard the foie gras here is the bomb dot com but I didn't get to try it. This place has great food and great service - 100% worth a try!","Came here for Restaurant Week and was super excited given the rave reviews. Unfortunately this place did not live up to expectations. The inside of the restaurant is nice and cozy, but a bit loud. Service was very very slow, it took 30+ min after ordering to get appetizers and even then we had to ask for it and ask for bread. By the time we got our first dish, we'd been in the restaurant for an hour already. If the food was amazing, I would have been fine, but unfortunately the food was just okay.Ravioli - this dish was quite good. Small bowl, but very delicate and had a great truffle flavor. Pate - the overall dish was very big for an appetizer and the flavors were good for the pate. The side salad that came with it was a little bland and a bit weird that it came with chunks of mango in it.Roast chicken - the skin had a great crisp to it, but unfortunately that was about all it had going for it. Overall the dish was a bit plain. I'd almost prefer a grocery store rotisserie chicken.Fish of the day - avoid this dish, it was very bland and flavorless. The fish was cooked fine, I just wish it had a bit more herb or butter flavor. I'd settle for more salt.Steak - the steak was good, buttery and juicy like the other reviewers mentioned. It just wasn't mind blowing or that special.Banana brûlée - the dish was interesting, it tasted almost like a banana pudding. That being said, it wasn't good enough to be worth coming here for.Overall, I really wanted to like this place given the story and the reviews, but given the slow service and the unremarkable food, I can't in good conscience recommend this place.","If you don't mind dining practically atop the entrance ramp to the Holland Tunnel, La Sirène is a great choice. My party thoroughly enjoyed the house Bordeax, Salades du Marché, Cornish hen au jus, duck with Michigan cranberry glaze, and the hanger steak. All entrees were perfectly cooked to our specifications, and the Cornish hen was especially well-seasoned and juicy. The family-style sides of haricots verts, carrot puree, and two types of squash came in a unique presentation and complimented the entrees well, even if some of them were not particularly French. Service was polite and attentive. The chocolate lava cake with coconut sorbet and fresh whipped cream was a triumph. All in all, it was a close-to-perfect birthday dinner.",La Sirène-Soho
174,"Just had a very unfortunate, horrible customer service experience here. I had called ahead to see what the wait was and the girl that answered said that they could not make a reservation for me but that I could call in 15 mins ahead of arrival to see what the wait was. Following her advice, I called in 15 mins ahead of arrival to inquire about the wait time and she said there was no wait time. On this information we decided to walk over, and arrived there 15 minutes later. Suddenly, the wait time was 45 minutes. The host at the restaurant was very confrontational, unapologetic, did not believe what I had been told over the phone, promptly aborted our conversation and rudely dismissed me. I had a hungry family and a young child with me who could not wait this long, which is why I made a point of calling ahead. Very disappointed, as we had been looking forward to eating here for quite some time.","Worse service ever. The restaurant was half empty, however the waitress kept us waiting at the door while dillydally making drinks for several other tables.  She totally ignored me and my friend, didn't even seat us first. We left after several minutes more waiting. Have never encounter such situation before!",On August 10. Our family enjoyed seafood at Claw Daddy's. It was a busy day that day. We booked a table for 12 people for six o'clock. It was ok for waiting more than half hour for table.. We were enjoying our food and seafood.. but the lobsters we ordered was not so good. There were too much water inside the lobsters body.. And after dinner. We wanted to cut the birthday cake. The servicer talked to me that They would charge four dollars for  each guests? 11 people would cost $44.. I said forget about it..这家店95%都是黑人在吃海鲜.. 龙虾不要点[难过]都是水份的..其它海鲜都ok..6人以上都要被加上18%的服务费.. 我们要切蛋糕，他们说要另外加每人4美元服务费我的天哪！,The food here was absolutely delicious. Make sure you're prepared to get a little messy! So worth it. They have a delightful variety on the menu. Plus mix and match options in the menu.Drinks were on point too.Our waitress was so fun and personable.Highly suggest having a reservation- this place gets packed.,"I really enjoy eating here.Service was very great, food was incredible. Everything I got tasted fresh. With any restaurant of this intent, be prepared to get a little ""dirty"" but that's all part of the fun. The adult ""caprisun""'s are delicious and super fun. I'm not sure how much alcohol is actually in them and they will run you around $12 each, but I think one or two are still worth it. (I definitely want to come back for the HH when these drinks are $8)They give great portions of food; it will definitely fill you up. The flavors are really effective.  The Claw Daddy's special seasoning is BOMB. Get ready to claw your way into some good food. I can't wait to come back on an empty stomach. 4.5/5","Employees could have been nicer and the vibe is a bit pretentious but food was great. My friend and I shared grilled oysters from the happy hour menu, plus crab cake fritters, Cajun fries and king crab legs. Everything was very tasty and it was definitely enough food for the two of us. However: I liked The Boil more. Don't @ me.",Claw Daddy's
175,"I came here on a Wednesday night with my family. I had a reservation placed but when I got there, they said they never received my reservation. But they still seated us. We waited a bit to order our food, and the waiter practically rushed the order. I asked him for some specifics on what I was ordering and he was so unwilling to explain. You can tell he didnt wanna spend another minute taking my order. At the end of the meal, we realized they didn't put down one of our main courses, even though that was the first thing I ordered. the food was mediocre at best. We ordered the spaghetti with the truffles and I asked the waiter if there was meat in the other dish because it didn't say on the menu specifically if there was any any meat included. But I guess he took it as, I wanted something with no meat and had told me to get the other dish instead. That had no meat. The waiter who initially took our order probably felt bad he didn't pay attention to our order since he forgot one of our main dishes and gave us 2 free desserts. But we still left mad hungry. Also, got bunched a shit load of times by mosquitos the hour we stayed there.","Basically a hole in the wall that serves decent food and way over priced wine.  The cheapest bottle of wine on their limited list was $48, and this mind you was something that they paid $6-$7 for wholesale.  Their most expensive bottle on their wine list was $660, which is totally obscene for this caliber of dining. Okay so that is my main gripe.  Service okay and zero ambience and smallish food portions  all add up to just an okay dining experience.We decided to try this establishment because we were visiting Russ and Daughters on East Houston St.  But, seeing the area in general I think it's back to the West Village for us where things make more sense and the hole in the wall joints are not looking to take a deep dive into your wallet.  BTW did I mention this is a cash only business which makes it even more of a poor choice and overall value.  Bottom line: We will not be returning to Supper for supper.",Supper Restaurant --a very popular Italian restaurant for dinnerRecommendations:1. Osso Buco(Braised veal shank served over risotto milanese)2. Pappardelle with lamb Ragu3. Tiramisu,It's homestyle Italian food with a great atmosphere and great food.  The space is cavernous so each area has its own feel.  I went for my birthday last night and there were 4 other birthdays there too.  They do a tasteful slice of tiramisu with a candle.  You can sit at the bar right in front of the kitchen or shared tables or your own table.  Everyone I have taken here now goes with their own friends as one of their favorite spots.It's very tastefully designed with low lighting and kind of a shabby chic style.Great local regular spot for me and my friends and visitors.,"My friend and I visited Supper on a Saturday night with a 5:15pm reservation. We were the first customers to the restaurant and I found the service to be slow in spite of this. We ended up ordering the sautéed broccoli, risotto Milanese and the Timely Priest Stranglers.We were served a nice complimentary bread and bean dish which was very nice and tided us until the main courses were served. Our dishes all arrived at the same time. The broccoli and risotto were nothing special unfortunately but I was very impressed by the Timely Priest Stranglers. I will be back to try more pastas for sure but probably will avoid ordering from other parts of the menu.",I'm so glad I got to check out this place finally. We got seated near a bookcase for brunch and guess what? This bookcase has a secret door that let's you into a secret dining room! That was super cool! I would totally do a private dinner there sometime. As for the food I did the 3 for 1 price drinks. I had the bellini and the screwdriver. Initially I was only planning to have 2 drinks but I didnt want to waste the third drink!  I ordered the polenta with poached eggs and it was delicious. The polenta was made well and the eggs were poached like they were supposed to. They gave us a complimentary tiramisu which tasted good. Our waiter was friendly and attentive and the ambience felt intimate which I really loved. I am definitely planning to come here again.,Supper
176,"I'd rate this place a 5/6 out of 10. I've had better steak before. I ordered the Atlantic Salmon. It was a nice size but I mean, it tasted like the salmon I get from Black Angus  No joke. It was whatever. Nothing special. Same with the steak. My group ordered the steak for three and I tried some. It was whatever. They're known for their French fries (I don't know why) but they were basic. Thick cut fries. Again nothing special. What I disliked was that their soft drinks came in little bottles. I hateeeeee restaurants that do that. Like why can't you get a soda machine. I honestly felt like I was in the Titanic. The place looked old (which it was and I guess what they're known for). The bathroom was tiny. Our waiter wasn't all that great either. Not enthusiastic at all. He was so bland. Mostly older people as waiters. I saw one shaking his head to a family. I won't be back here again. Sorry!",Want a good steak? Come here and you'll get served a pretty damn good steak! Rib steak is my go-to cut. I've tried the porterhouse. It's good but the rib steak is where it's at. You need to make a reservation. Tried to walk-in the other day and was told no.,"This place was fairly expensive and oily. We went as a group of four and got a Caesar salad, three slices of bacon, steak for 3, creamy spinach, and onion rings. It was A LOT of food and we were unable to finish them all. The Caesar salad was not very special but was necessary due to the amount of grease everything had. The bacon was very good--even better than the steak-- but also extremely pricey. The steak for 3 was extremely oily. I believe that they just soaked it in a lot of oil. It was really difficult to finish three servings even when splitting between four people. The creamy spinach was delicious and would highly recommend. The onion rings were really oily and they give you a mountain of it, which quickly became cold and gross. The dinner was so greasy one of my family members ended up getting a bad stomach the following day. We made a reservation 1 month in advance. However, when we go to the restaurant at our reserved time, the waiter still made us wait for almost 30 minutes, which made me wonder why we made a reservation in the first place.","Having grown up in Chicago, I have eaten many a good steak locally, across the United States at very well known establishments and around the world including the magical Kobe in Japan.After almost cancelling our reservation due a great but exhausting few days in New York, we decided to suck it up, fight the traffic and make the trip to Brooklyn to the renowned Peter Luger steakhouse.  What a terrific decision.It was already hopping at 5:30pm, but we were promptly seated in a ""quiet"" corner.  Aloisius was our server, and he made our evening special ~ courteous, helpful, a great sense of humor and most of all, his love of his job.  We started off with their famous thick cut bacon which was unlike any bacon we had ever enjoyed.  Offered by the slice, one apiece was a terrific appetizer.  It was absolutely delicious and full of flavor.  We ordered a mixed green salad with Russian dressing (no collusion) and chock full of crumbled blue cheese ~ scrumptious.We had already decided to split a Porterhouse, but tried to preview the menu which front and center had Steak for 2, 3, 4, but except for a ribeye, had no other cuts offered, and a few fish dishes tucked at the bottom.  Aloisius explained Peter Luger dry ages its own Porterhouses, which is their signature steak, so our decision was simple.  Also ordered were the German potatoes which with the grilled onions, was very good.  A big surprise was their creamed spinach which arguably was the best we have had.  It reminded me of the old Berghoff in Chicago.The Porterhouse was simply prepared, but utterly tender and delicious, not overpowered with spices or butter.  It looked regal sitting front and center, nicely carved and tilted so the butter/oil could flow into its own pool.  Their steak sauce was also a nice accompaniment, not too powerful and really brought out the delicious flavor of their prime meat.  Of note, their dry aging did not add ""that"" extra scent or taste which detracts from the pure flavor of the steak.Aloisius gave us some complimentary Schlag which is a heavy pure German whipped cream with a chocolate drizzle.We joked with Aloisius saying we were eating ""like we were going to the electric chair!""  He countered with a story about two men who ordered steak for three which would be their last meal before going up the river to prison for a few years.This truly elevated Peter Luger to the very top of our all time favorite steakhouses and experiences. We cannot wait to return for another wonderful meal.","Read so so many amazing reviews before coming here and I was surprised at how good the burger was than the steak (in my opinion!) RESERVATIONS: RESERVE! We reserved a 11:45AM time and thought we were really early - who eats steak that early?? But we were wrong. There was already a huge line for when we got there, and those who reserved were seated pretty much immediately. It was basically full house! Can't imagine how long the wait took. I would definitely recommend booking wayyyy ahead. FOOD: We got the single steak because we also wanted to try the burger. I can definitely see why everyone loves the steak, the medium rare came with a slight crispness on the outside and extreme tenderness when you bite in. Dip it in the sauce Peter Luger gives you and it's not a bad combo!Personally, the burger was better! Maybe it's because I can't just eat meat only... we added all the add-ons: onion, tomato, and bacon. The burger patty was sooo juicy and flavored. The sides made it even better. Slide the bacon onto the burger and it's perfect! Also, the bread that comes before the meal.... wow. I had to force myself to stop eating the bread, because otherwise would've been too full to eat the steak! They ask if you want to take it home at the end of your meal if there's any left, or they toss it away. I thought asking you before throwing it away was a nice touch. SERVICE: excellent. One of our waiter's, Felipe, recommended a couple pretty dope places around Brooklyn, and even told us the best way to get to where we wanted to go. Earlier, we wanted to go to the vessel but because we looked into it too late, there were no more reservation times. Felipe pulls out his phone, tells us to take a picture of a QR code, and it was the Vessel admission for same day! Shoutout to Felipe for hooking it up :) Definitely made our day and the meal experience even better.","i've been to the luger location in greatneck and must say the brooklyn one is so much better. maybe its just me? LOLmy boyfriend and i came here for lunch for my birthday. i picked lunch because i really wanted to try their burger! i heard such good things and WOWOWOW. legit the best burger i've ever had. must get the bacon too and put that in the burger. mind blown. so juicy, and meaty and just honestly the perfect bite. burgers dont need to be fancy this was just a simplistic burger and it was done so well! and lets be honest how do you go to lugers and not get a steak? so we also got a porterhouse for 2 and shrimp cocktail. you can honestly never go wrong with the shrimp cocktail cooked to perfection and so meaty. peter lugers has always been my top 3 steak houses, because it's so tender and buttery. but for the first time, i tasted the that ""dry aged funk"". in the great neck location i never did, it just tasted like a fresh piece of steak, but in the brooklyn location my boyfriend and i were like wait WHAT, we loveeee that funkyness of dry aged steaks and wow it was SO GOOD. we normally go to delfriscos because you actually taste the dry aged in those steaks, but wow we were blown away that we finally tasted it at luger and it was delicious. ive been to lugers quite a few times, and never have i tasted it the way, maybe cus its brooklyn vs long island? who knows but makes me only want to go to the brooklyn location from now on =P",Peter Luger
177,"This used to be one of my favorite spots in Chinatown. My best friend and I come here all the time but unfortunately, the past few visits were very disappointing. The quality has slacked so much. Some of my usual favorites are the claypot rice, pork/crab soup dumplings, wonton mein, hk styled lo mein. Flavors has been so off. The service here is your usual unorganized/rushed ""what do you want?"" Chinatown standards. The furniture here could use an upgrade. It's getting old, feels dirty and uncomfortable.","This place makes me like XLBs. I never really cared for it before because previous places I went to makes bad XLBs. I order the 124. Steam Crab Meat Soup Dumplings and 61. Shrimp Wonton, Shrimp Dumplings, Cilantro & Black Egg Dumplings Soup.The XLBs were hot, juicy, and explodes in your mouth. Remember to wait for it to cool down a bit. The skin is soft, unlike some places that make their skin tough.For some reason, I always crave for wonton (noodle) soup. I was too full from eating all day, so I just ordered the mix of different wontons and dumplings soup without the noodles. They are so good! The soup was also very flavorful. I think I tasted dried seafood in there.I recommend trying this place at least once.",I literally just went to order just the soup dumplings as someone I follow on Instagram had posted. She proclaimed them as her favorite soup dumplings in NYC. Boy was she right!! Smaller than other ones I've had but they packed such immense flavor. I could have eaten over 30 if I wanted. Go for the soup dumplings if you're in China town.,"Easily one of my favorites in the city. Brings me back to my childhood. I've had almost all of their noodle options, congee, and of course the spicy cuttlefish. Everything tastes so fresh and homemade! Service is consistent bc there's a fair amount of servers. Expediting is smooth despite the volume. I would definitely get almost anything from here. I just wouldn't recommend the soup dumplings + brisket (more tendon than actual brisket), they weren't my favorite in terms of the filling and broth. But for the price point and consistency, this is definitely a 4* establishment. Also! Try to dine in on weekdays for 5% off your bill with a Yelp check-in.","This is another restaurant definitely worth visiting if you're just exploring Chinatown. The size of the restaurant is pretty good, it's not too small that you feel like you're having dinner with your neighbors, but also not a huge place where you won't have to wait for a table during meal times. I ordered soup dumplings and pork/shrimp shumai, shumai is similar to normal dumplings, but with less dough on the outside compared to normal dumplings. I really enjoyed the soup dumplings here and highly recommend trying them out. If I compare them to the other soup dumplings I had at the Shanghainese restaurant I went to, the ones I had here at Noodle Village are a bit better. The dumplings are infused with so much juicy soup that you can see the pretty glaze of it from the outside. My friends ordered shrimp wonton noodles and I have never seen her enjoy a meal more than the way she ate those noodles. She went to Hong Kong this past summer and said that it tasted just as good as the shrimp wonton noodles she had there. So if you're in the area give this place a try if you're in the mood for some good dumplings and noodles.","I'm from Montreal, and I've pretty much lost hope on Chinatown food in Montreal because it straight up sucks . Now have you ever lost hope on something then one day discovered your saviour? This place is my saviour...amen. I'm feeling like Zelda trying to seal Ganon for over 100 years, and then all of sudden a boy in his underwear wakes up from his slumber and glitched straight to Hyrule Castle and saved the day.   I came here on a hot summer day in July, and I'm writing this on a cold, no sun and  greyish day in Montreal, and now all I want is to get back there and eat until I hate myself. Now, enough non sense, here's what I ate. Noodles, dim sums, and a weird piece of pork ( I'm guessing the remains of ganon). Delicioso. 5/5. Good day,",Noodle Village
178,So good,"I really expected more given the rating that this place has. It's really not good. The mac and cheese tastes like it came straight out of a box, and my pulled pork sandwich was okay but had some fat chunks in it. Definitely do not recommend.","I should begin by saying that Mabel's Smokehouse was a disappointment.  The waitress was more interested in cleaning underneath the tables than attending to customers...the whole restaurant setup was disturbing, so you go in you look at the menu after you decide what you're having from the menu you take a walk to the bar and place your order, second I think that for a bbq establishment there should be wet naps on the table for messy hands and mouth we had to walk to the back of the restaurant where they had a large farmhouse sink, I could just imagine in their busiest night the line at the bar to order your food and the line just to was your hand and wipe your mouth. The food was bland, the drink was good I had the San Antonio Sling...We didn't bother to order desert.",Far from touristic points but worth it.The attendance is pleasant.Ambience clean and different.The food is excellent.Not expensive.If I have a chance I will come back.,"Mable's Smokehouse has to be for people who don't like seasonings.A phrase that comes to mind is ""Williamsburg Mc-BBQ""I split the 3 meat sampler with my boyfriend and it was a let down.The macaroni and cheese was on Kraft straight out the box level.  The yams had marshmallows in in...like is this food for adults??  It was way too sweet and not even good tasting.  The collard greens were undercooked so they had a weird bite to them.The meat itself... everything came-out luke-warm.  For a smokehouse they seemed like they were afraid to use the smoker on the ribs.The brisket was okay and edible.  Not tough, not tender.The pulled pork was the best of the three.  But pulled pork is really easy to make, so I wasn't impressed.You pretty much have to serve yourself.  You go up to the bar to place your order, you get a number and the food arrives.  You have to grab your own drinks and your own water.  The staff doesn't ask you how you think the food is, but it's Williamsburg, so I'm sure they expect a tip for ""something"".","Pros: Very good location. Friendly customer service. Gorgeous cashier (he has impeccable style). I met one of the owners and she made me feel very welcome. The bartender made sure I had everything I needed and she was a beaut! Cons: the food coma ain't no joke. It will happen to you!Overall: I definitely recommend this place. Their ribs, brisket, Mac n cheese, and yams are amazing!!!",Mable's Smokehouse & Banquet Hall
179,Loved this Asian fusion restaurant. The edamame dumplings are to die for!!! Could literally just order that and eat those. Another amazing app is tuna tartare egg rolls. Wild mushroom chow fun is so flavorful I would def recommend getting that as well. Only downfall was that my friend and I found a hair in the noodles  they did comp it but still it was kind of gross,I had reservations here for my birthday on a Saturday. They made it seem like it was hard to get but I was shocked to arrive at an empty restaurant. My first impression was that it was way too dark but I guess over time your eyes can adjust? The ambiance itself was nothing spectacular...or at least the top floor wasn't. Service was okay. We ordered:- Tuna tartar spring rolls (3/5): Good but way too small. You get 3 cigarette sized spring rolls. The tuna was slightly fishy. - Oxtail dumpling (5/5): Delicious! It was full of REAL oxtail meat and the yuzu soy sauce was not overpowering. At one point I did bite into a piece of oxtail bone but no complaints. - Lobster fried rice (1/5): Was the chef in a bad mood? I completely missed the hype. This came in a large portion with plenty of lobster meat but it was bland and boring. The texture of the rice felt old and stale. We barely touched it. - Fate cocktail (1/5): Very disappointed. I don't think there was any liquor in it. I skipped dessert cause at this point I was no longer interested in trying anything else and they brought out complimentary ice cream with a candle! Very sweet gesture. Other than that my experience was average.,Was hanging out in Tao across the street and was told this was a big competitor so we decided to check it out since I don't come to the neighborhood often. Was able to sit at the bar but that turned out to not be a good thing. The bar is flat up against the stools so no where for you to put your legs. Also the bottom of the stool where you put your feet is lower than normal so your legs hang causing discomfort and your kegs to fall asleep. The bartender agreed and we thought maybe management used these type of seats so no one sat for long periods of time and occupied the spot for a good rotation. Either way it was no good! Drinks were poured well and staff was friendly so that got that right. We took a tour of the place and I just didn't get it. Tao is so much better I don't know how this could be competition.,"Buddakan was on my list for a while. So happy we went. We had a reservation for 8:30, we had to wait about a half hour for our table. Not complaining, we found a table in the crowed lounge area, and had drinks. The restaurant is huge. 2 levels. The upstairs was a little dark. We ate downstairs. Not an empty table, in the restaurant the whole time we were there. It amazes me how they can provide you with such excellent service! But they do. The food comes out so fast! We started with the Tuna tartare spring rolls, short Rib scallion pancake, General Tso's dumpling, lobster fried rice, ma la chicken, and the mushroom chow fun! Everything was top notch! Service and food all Five Stars!!","I took my parents to this restaurant for a nice New York dining experience. I really liked the neighbourhood it's in (Chelsea market, Starbucks reserve) so it's a fun place to have dinner. The restaurant was a little disorganized in the beginning, we were told to sit and wait for our table but when we got into the restaurant the restaurant was almost empty. The food and dining experience itself was quite good. The waiter was fast and efficient. The food came quickly and was delicious. I would recommend overall!","10/10 excellent across the board. Pricey for sure, but food and service was great! Broken chili chicken 10/10 highly recommend; recommend combining it with a rice or noodle. We did the vegetarian rice General Tsos Dumblings were fantasticCauliflower lollipops were filled with melted cheese. So good.",Buddakan
180,Really bad attempt at some sort of Korean fusion food. Overpriced and misguided at best.,"I have frequented the two Barn Joos, and I prefer the one in Union Square.The Union Squre restaurant is more spacious- although both restaurants get extremely loud.We ask to be seated on the 2nd fl. for grilling, and the service is also very attentive. Something you do NOT get in K-town one.Their signature dish - Uni bibimbab - has consistency, but can be a bit on the salty side. I usually take out the seasoned/pickled radish to balance it out.","Haven't tried it but wanted to have their happy hour which says 4-7pm everyday on their website. Came around 6:40pm and now they say they ""just"" changed it to 4-6pm, really?! What a bummer. Even their menu at the door says 4-7pm. Too bad, lost business","Started out at the bar for happy hour, there's not a ton of space, and it took forever to get the attention of the bartender (poor guy was overwhelmed) whenever we were ready for another round, but the cocktails were sweet and delicious. Note that you do need to close out your tab before moving on to dinner.1-Thyme: Soju, St. Germaine, thyme-infused syrup, grapefruit juice - may be showing my age, but is this a nod to the old school hip hop group 1TYM? If so, I'm a fan. This was sweet and fruity, and didn't taste alcoholic at all, but remember - soju creeps up on you.Dinner service was much better. I had made a reservation, so to the joy of one of my girlfriend's, she got to spin the wheel and won us an order of  free croquettes.Truffle fries - I will never say no to fries, these were hot crispy, but light on the truffle flavor. croquettes - pretty standard, but perfectly crisp on the outside and buttery inside - also something I never say no to.tteok & cheese: rice gnocchi, sweet corn, quinoa, fontina, cheddar,parmesan cheese, truffle essence, garlic bruschetta - it's sort of a fusion of italian/korean/murica, like a delicious fancy mac & cheese, but with pillowy nuggets of gnocchi.tuna mayo tartare: tuna, pickled radish, chives, mayonnaise,sesame oil, garlic bruschetta with honey drizzle - this was a sleeper hit, initially my companions were not impressed with the appearance, but soon they were fighting for the last biteUni Bibim Paella: rice on a sizzling hot stone plate topped with uni,cured shrimp, capelin roe, pickled radish, kimchi,quinoa, egg and seaweed puree - this is DELICIOUS! the texture variations! the contrast between creamy uni and tart kimchi - if only the dish was larger.We also had garlic shrimp tacos, bulgogi steamed buns and duck steamed buns - all on point and satisfactory.The only disappointment was the Chef Jin's Egg Souffle: egg, topped with quinoa, chive, 3 different types of roe, which wasn't bad by any means, it just wasn't at all memorable. This is a decent place for catch up dinners over korean tapas, and they also do korean bbq, but I'd probably skip the happy hour next time. Reservations are easy to make and the tables upstairs do give you ample space to chat with your friends. Solid choice for casual dinners.",Spicy seafood japchae ( low carb and delish )Uni bibimbap ( amazing classic )Volcano egg (overrated)This place is always crowded and lively - always thriving and warm like a well loved local favorite ; I found out there is an upstairs . Also great value for your $$ and very filling without being gross or heavy,"Barn Joo has become a bit of a staple for me whenever I find myself hungry and in Union Square. It has a huge bar, plenty of seating inside, a small outdoor area and a Korean barbeque setup upstairs. The decor is great, it is very stylish, and the service is good although there does seem to be different staff here every time I visit. It's a great place to come with a big group as it is so large and also because the food is very reasonably priced. There are lots of set price lunch options and a good happy hour.The food itself is what I would call casual modern Korean and there are a few pub-style staples such as tacos and burgers on the menu too. The portions are all very generous and you can upgrade your meal for $4.00 and get a kind of bento box setup with pickles, salad, potato fritter and the best silkiest savoury egg custard ever! I'm sure you can find something here for even the fussiest eaters, all the seafood options are great as is the burger. Korean Burritos are like a giant sushi roll and the truffle fries are to die for! I've not tried the barbeque, but I definitely will do soon because Barn Joo is getting a lot of repeat visits from this happy punter!",Barn Joo
181,"The below reviewers must have been paid for their positive feedback. Do not attempt this place unless you have many hours on hand and enjoy average food paired with bad service. The appetizers came before the drinks, 20 minutes after we had ordered. These women are sleeping at the wheel, watching them move around the restaurant is a slow motion picture.I'll summarize. They got our drink order wrong. We had to steal utensils from other tables. They got our appetizer order wrong. My entree came out 15 minutes after everyone else's, no apologies, no update on if or when my food was coming. I paid $30 for five pieces of shrimp, white rice, on a questionable orange sauce. Just don't.",Ceviche wasn't fishy at all well marinated and very fresh! Jalea... The fish used to fry was sooo good you can taste thats it's fresh fish and not frozen! Excellent customer service! Only complain was no AC and drinks were a bit weak!,This restaurant doesn't deserve a star or any at that. Everything is overpriced and the food is in very small portions. I'm peruvian so this is a disgrace to peruvian cuisine. Terrible experience I don't intend on coming back.,The lunch grilled chicken sandwich is amazing! I Pair it with sweet plantains and even put it inside my sandwich to give it that sweet and savory taste! I've tried the rotisserie chicken sandwich with cheese but literally it's just bread cheese and chicken... to plain for me! Let's not forget my fave margaritaaaaaaa!!! The causa rellena is a great appetizer and the empanadas with cheese so yummy!!! The octopus is the perfect spice and served cold as ceviche with capers .For dinner I get the chicken saltado! Super delicious !,"To me a 3 means I got what I expected. Food, service & drink were all OK., But the employees should have better communication  with customers in what's available. They need to work on their service too, Way too slow. Great chicken no doubt about it. Just my concern in about the service, Hope they can fix that","I was craving something like pollo campero and as a Miamian in NYC, I naturally looked for a Peruvian restaurant and stumbled upon Pollo D'Oro in Downtown Brooklyn.The place was decorated nicely and the ambiance was good (a lot more high end that the Peruvian restaurants I had been to in Miami, which are more casual) only complaint is that when we went the Peru - Brazil game was playing and it was extremely loud! Husband and I had to scream at each other. Husband ordered the Lomo Saltado with fries and I ordered 1/4 of a chicken with french fries. The taste of the chicken was good but only the top skin, the inside was very bland. Husband said his Lomo Saltado was good, although not the best he has had. The prices were reflective of any restaurant in DB. We had a decent experience and the menu had a lot of variety so we may come back again.",Pollo D' Oro
182,"I have heard about this place for quite some time, and would recommend it personally as a drinks-only type of establishment. The menu didn't appear to actually have a large number of French cuisine type of items on there, despite the name of the restaurant. The sliders, which for the price point, were seriously the size of a half dollar/Ritz cracker. And the side of chips was Ruffles potato chips (which I enjoy!) but for the price point, it left me feeling mehhhhh. And frankly still a little hungry. The bar/space itself is cozy and in a really historic part of NYC, and that in and of itself earns the stars/worth the visit. But I'd just order a drink and skip the food.","Decor 3 stars, bartender 5 stars , cocktail 5 stars , food I want to give 0, we order 2 tapas they came small and we didn't finish, no flavor at all , very bla.","Came across this restaurant on yelp and decided to try it out for our couples date night. The bar is teeny tiny and uncomfortable it's literally one hallway full of small tables and the chef preparing food on the right side. The ambiance is okay if you like to feel crowded.  Our server was talkative, slightly overbearing,spent the night interrupting our conversations and rushing us. I guess because the place is so tiny they need to get people in and out. Not a fan of this by the way. We want to spend our time and enjoy the evening especially with the kind of life we have in NYC.. always in a rush. The food is tasty but expensive for the portion sizes which are incredibly small like the place. We were definitely hungry after we ordered 4 dishes. The drinks aren't memorable and the server put her fingers on my straw right in front of my face... not her best work. I came, I saw, I tried. Done.","Excuse my French is definitely a hidden gem in the LES. From the interior decor to the menu to the service to the food are sure top notch!We had an order dinner reservation and we had got there even earlier and we were seated right away. The server seated us by the window next to the fresh flowers. I love it!!The waiter was so friendly and nice, he took care of us so well. He explained the menu to us and told us about the drinks and food courses. Checked us on constantly to see if everything was ok. Thumb up!The champagne and cocktail we had were on point. We shared 3 tapas, the portions were just right, not too small and delicious! The scallops were so fresh! Brussel spouses and the foie gras lollipop were good too! We were impressed. I hope you'll find my review helpful and enjoy your happy hour and dinner here like I did!","This place is honestly underwhelming when it comes to the staff. My friends and I goggled the ""best happy hours in NYC"" and this place popped up. When we walked in we were greeted with blank stares, and confusion as if seeing a person of color was absolutely strange in this place. The only thing that greeted us was the extreme fish market stench. We were told that everything was reserved, and it appeared that the staff did not want to seat us after explaining they couldn't seat because of reservations in an extremely empty restaurant. Our waiter Bill made us feel comfortable in this space. Eventually, we were served our happy hour drinks. I recommend the sunflower champagne. My brother highly recommends the Old Fashioned. This place definitely is a gem but for a place with LGBTQIA+ flags outside there needs to be a training in cultural diversity. I'd give 2 stars for the drinks only.Excuse my French Cet endroit est honnêtement décevant en ce qui concerne le personnel. Mes amis et moi avons gogglé les ""meilleurs happy hours à New York"" et cet endroit est apparu. Quand nous sommes entrés, nous avons été accueillis avec des regards vides et confus, comme si voir une personne de couleur était absolument étrange à cet endroit. La seule chose qui nous a accueillis était la puanteur extrême du marché de la drogue. Nous avions l'impression que tout était réservé et il est apparu que le personnel ne voulait pas nous asseoir après avoir expliqué qu'il ne pouvait pas s'asseoir à cause des réservations dans un restaurant extrêmement vide.Notre serveur Bill nous a mis à l'aise dans cet espace. Finalement, on nous a servi notre apéritif. Je recommande le champagne de tournesol. Mon frère recommande vivement le Old Fashioned. Cet endroit est vraiment un joyau, mais pour un endroit avec des drapeaux LGBTQIA + à l'extérieur, une formation à la diversité culturelle est nécessaire.Je donnerais 2 étoiles pour les boissons seulement",So good we ordered drink after drink plate after plate. Amazing one man show that keeps the food coming and thoughtful hospitality. Making plans to try every single plate here.,Excuse My French
183,"My first experience was amazing. We decided to do the Chef's menu both times and had different experience each times.First experience - food came out on time & was on point. Everything was amazing. Second Experience - The first five plates were great. But everything went downhill after that. We waited 15 mins for the next plate & it was the exact same thing they brought out for plate #2. Server apologize and took the plate back. 5 mins later, same thing happened. He brought out another plate & it was the same as plate #3. We also mentioned no pork as dietary restrictions - there was bacon on the ice-cream!Overall- Disappointing Experience.","Had a bad experience at this restaurant last night and do not recommend, particularly for anyone with food allergy concerns. My friend is severely celiac and, upon arriving, informed the waiter who spoke with the chef (one of the co-owners) and provided a marked up version of the menu indicating which dishes were gluten free. As she was eating the first dish (which, as noted above, was specifically recommended to her by the chef as being safe to eat), she began feeling ill. We took a good look through the dish, realized it contained rye, and flagged it to the server who promptly apologized and went to check with the chef. The chef proceeded to insist the dish was in fact gluten free and only after some back and forth and a google search did he come to the realization it was not. The fact a chef and co-owner of a restaurant could be so misinformed about his dishes and their contents is concerning in itself, however our biggest disappointment was a phone conversation that happened afterwards with the chef's wife, Heather. While Heather could have apologized on behalf of the restaurant for the mistake, she was defensive, confrontational, and overall left such a bad taste with us that I can't imagine ever returning to Traif or to Heather and her husband's other restaurant next door, Xixa.",Service in this restaurant is really bad. My parents and I had really bad experience in this restaurant.,"Really delicious tapas style restaurant- we were recommended to come here and definitely glad we did. Food was amazing (well cooked and well seasoned), and our waiter was super friendly. He recommended we order 2-3 dishes per person so we actually ordered 6 at first (we were hungry) but then were able to cancel one of our dishes after realizing that we had definitely over ordered! To start, they gave us free little soup shots which were very tasty. Then we got:- shishito peppers with watermelon- definitely worth getting, not your average shishito dish, very flavorful and not too heavy - tuna tartare- exceeded my expectations, it was paired perfectly on fried eggplant, not too oily or saucy- cauliflower bowl- tasty and quite hearty and filling, comes with cucumbers, tomatoes, rice crisps, etc- fish dish - forgot what kind of fish (maybe flounder?) but it was so perfectly cooked and came with a side of pan fried bao (like Chinese buns); I actually think I would've preferred steamed buns instead since the fish itself was fried. But still so flavorful and probably my favorite dish!- scallop risotto- again cooked perfectly, at this point we were unfortunately getting pretty full but it was delicious, had some corn and tomatoes in it tooOverall we really enjoyed every single dish.. favorite was the fish, least was probably the cauliflower - not because I didn't enjoy it though, just everything else was even tastier! Ended with some complementary pineapple bites. Yum.","We visited Traif on a dreary night and were hoping to get some cocktails and some delicious food. We ordered two cocktails off the menu- this is where the biggest disappointment came. Honestly the entire cocktail menu needs revamped- they are all heavily suite options and just not appealing. We really were disappointed with our cocktails, so much so that we did something that I have never done, we asked to have something different- they were seriously undrinkable. We ordered two plates- they are bigger tapas (definitely sharable). We needed something to put the taste of those cocktails in the past! We were surprised with an amuse bouche which was a curried carrot soup and it was INCREDIBLE it was our best part of the entire meal and it was a tiny serving. We both agreed that if we could have had a bowl of that, we would have been pleased. Our burrata, bacon jam and bbq potato chips was unique. The texture of the burrata wasn't typical (I am kind of a burrata enthusiast) so that was just ok. The gnnochi with a pepper sauce and chorizo was ok as well, nothing to write home about. Towards the end of the meal the bartender made his own cocktails for us, which the gesture was so kind, but honestly they were not great either and we were just trying to steer clear from the cocktails. Again though the service here, they are trying to make it work and be really helpful and receptive to their patrons.If you go here, definitely stick to wine- the cocktails are a no go.I would return only for that carrot curried amuse bouche.","As long standing patrons of Xixa we were interested in seeing what Traif has to offer. BTW big up to Jando for the recommendation. We made reservations over the weekend and had an amazing experience. It started with the nine course chefs selection. I will break it down from my favorite to least. I must disclaim we bought a bottle of white wine, so my memory is a little hazy=). 1) Spicy tuna tartare (delicious!!)2) Strawberry-cinnamon glazed baby back ribs3) Dayboat scallops4) Salt and pepper shrimp with pineapple5) Looks like Creamy pasta with octopus ink(forgot the name sorry)6) Roasted duck breast 7-9) Can't remember the names...... I give up... all I can say is everything was delicious, including the deserts!I must mention the waitress, my compadre Isabel from Mexico.Thank you for such great service! I did want to point out that in my opinion, I believe Xixa to be a little bit more upscale. Other than that, both places are amazing with a fantastic spin on the typical tapas menu. If you want to impress your date or want to take your significant other to a boujee little restaurant without the city prices,Traif is a must!",Traif
184,The line for this stand can get to be very long.  Standing in the sun waiting for a lobster roll is not the most ideal. You can order online and pick it up at the window for some convenience.  It seems like its a little over priced for what you get.  The meat was a little dry but very tender.  It reminded me of dry pulled pork that is cold.  It could have used a tad bit more butter to bring out the taste.,Gross. They have gone downhill. Lobster and crab rolls were so cold. Just defrosted i guessCrab roll was mostly the debris vs actual crab meat. See picture. Save your money. Go to shake shack across thebwayI guess they realized that they can make more $$ as a tourist trap,"They're running a $14 lobster roll deal until October 1st! How can you say no to that?Granted, that also means that their lobster rolls are normally prohibitively expensive for a normal meal, especially with their diminutive size. But they are tasty and loaded with lobster chunks. I think Red Hook Lobster Pound edges them out, but only slightly.This location is more of a shack near the water, so you can pick something up to eat on the pier. But they also deliver!",PDG--pretty damn good.  Also expensive.  But they have an excellent gluten free game for a little outdoor stand.We had walked over the Brooklyn bridge earlier and were overdue for lunch.  Our daughter had clued me in earlier in the day that Luke's had GF rolls. Whoopie!  I get to have a Lobster Roll.  We were at the Jersey Shore the day before and we ate somewhere with lobster rolls but they didn't have the GF bread.  I had a nice salad but it wasn't the same. Luke's staff was very careful to make sure my roll wasn't toasted on the same part of the grill as the regular bread.  Also not to butter it.  So I had a lobster roll and a canned cider and my hubs had a crab roll and a canned beer.  Total was a  little over $50.00.  I mean it was delicious but not 50.00 delicious so that's why only 4 stars.,We bought 2 lobster rolls. Each was around $17 (around 20 with tax) which we thought was overpriced for its size. My lobster roll did have a few shells in it. We weren't fans of the herbs used on top of the lobster but thats up to preferences. The location on the other hand is nice. It's a little shack near the Brooklyn bridge with outdoor seating on the side (if you don't mind the pigeons).,"The best lobster roll in NYC!  My favorite Luke's Lobster location.  This location is more of a shack near the water, so you can order food and walk over to the pier and eat it outdoors and get some sun.   There's nothing like eating some delicious lobster and being closer to nature.  Being outside, Walking around the park and and enjoying scenic water views.  So relaxing.  It's like being on a micro mini vacation.Now on to the yummy stuff.  I usually get the Luke's Trio sampler (lobster, shrimp, & crab 1/2 rolls), plus a drink and a side and/or soup.  Lobster rolls are stuffed with fresh from Maine, a 1/4 lb of lobster claw, knuckle, and leg meat.  A bit of mayo on bun and topped with warm lemon butter and secret seasoning.  Just the way I like it.  You can really taste the freshness of the sweet lobster meat.  Crab roll is pretty tasty too.  Very fresh.  The shrimp roll is just okay for me.  There is nothing wrong with it.  It's just not a favorite.  Download the Luke's Lobster app.  For every five visits spending $10 or more, you will earn a free lobster roll. You will also get a free shrimp roll on your birthday.There is indoor seating area in the back of the shop but you have to enter through the rear door. All of us lobster roll fanatics, need a Luke's Lobster location in Queens!",Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park
185,"i had been to this restaurant one time before.  My complaint about it was the table that I had been seated at and how I felt very cramped and had a problem with people continually hitting the back of my chair.I went early in hopes of getting a good table and when we arrived, I was given the exact same table that i had the time before.  I told the hostess that I would go elsewhere before I would sit at the same table. She first tried to tell me that there were not other tables but when we looked over the lower part of the restaurant, I pointed out that there were dozens of tables. She reluctantly sat us at one of those. We ordered appetizers and entrees and before we knew it, our food was plopped down at the table next to us.   The woman said that they had not ordered that food and the waiter picked it up and then turned to us and said ""Did you order....???""  The food and plates were plopped down in front of us as i wondered, shouldn't appetizers come first and main courses come later?  We were sharing what we ordered and the waiter placed plates that were hanging off the table.  He couldn't be bothered to re-arrange anything on the table and then quickly left.   It was no surprise that one of those plates fell off the table and smashed.   Do you think the staff could be bothered?   It took a good 10 minutes before someone came over to replace the plate and to clean up the mess.   Service was a 0Food was a 1 - the worst Ceviche I have ever had, the nuts were stale, the empanadas were greasy, this place is a disgrace to Peru and I won't be going back!","I would rate the food as five stars and although the atmosphere is nice, the service was slow and somewhat rude and I felt really cramped.   We arrived and were told there was a 30 minute wait and we could wait in the bar.   We sat down at the bar and it took 20 minutes for the bartender to ask what we wanted to drink.   We ordered drinks, five minutes later the hostess came to seat us, I told her we had just ordered drinks, she said something to the bartender, she came back saying he hadn't started to make our drinks yet.   We were seated and it was a good 15 minute wait until we were able to order.   My drink was delivered within a few minutes.  I took a sip and the next thing I knew, the waiter swooped in and grabbed the drink and ran off without saying a word.  A few minutes later another drink was plopped down in front of me without any explanation.  I sipped it and realized that they must have brought me the wrong drink.There seemed to be a lot of waiting and although I wanted dessert, I felt anxious to leave!","I've been going to various Pio Pio's for the last 6 years but this location is such a disaster. Our group of 5 visited the restaurant on a particularly quiet Saturday for lunch. We ordered a Matador Combo, empanadas, and an extra order of half chicken to share, and specified dark meat for the chicken.All of our dishes came out at once, except for our extra half chicken. We told our server about the missing dish and he said he would check on it. Twenty minutes passed and we flagged down another server to check on our missing order. It also took several minutes to flag anyone down since there were at least 4-5 people working the first floor's front-of-house but no one was really in our area of the dining space (even though there were maybe only 3 other occupied tables). A different server came to check on us as we were nearing the end of our meal, and of course we mentioned our missing chicken (we specified dark meat again). At this point, 4/5 of our group had consummed a quarter chicken each while one person still didn't have any but the meal was basically done.Several minutes later, one of the servers came back with a plate of white meat chicken. We said it was fine (we really needed to just leave at that point) so we started eating it. However, our original server came back with a plate of dark meat chicken, and then got visibly frustrated/annoyed (eyeroll, huffing, the works) when he saw we had another plate on our table. The servers started bickering just a few feet away from us.To top it all off, they gave us the wrong check.","Whoa!Was in NYC with some colleagues. This came up near our hotel. We dropped in for a late lunch/early dinner.Upon entering, it looks small. We were then guided down some steps to the larger dining area.We ordered a little bit of everything. Everything was amazing. Drenched in the green sauce? Perfect spice to it and just wonderful.Sangria was great too. Service was wonderful.Would definitely come back again.","Wow, what a difference in taste from the other locations.The Chilean sea bass was not good. The sangria was not worth the second glass; I barely finished the first. I would not order the empanadas again. The chicken was cooked well done; it was overcooked and lacked  the flavor that I've come to expect and enjoy like I get at Pio Pio 4 and the another location.","I'll get to the point, the chicken is very flavorful and tasty to the bone. Let me fix that. The rotisserie chicken is good to the bone! I've had empanadas that served their purpose and were good; I've never been a fan of them. Pio Pio's empanada's are delicious and I now order them every visit. Lastly, the Sangria is really good. I wouldn't mention it if it didn't leave an impression. I've only tried the red.",Pio Pio 8
186,i use to love sea wolf but i think there food sucks an i there are alotta good looking women tha come there but that's it also i'm starting to see tha sea wolf is not da place for me an da customer service is very poor smh,"Horrible!!! And the outside area smells like garbage juice and urine, how can anyone eat out there??",I waited 40 MINUTES for FISH TACOS!!! Don't eat here if you're hungry or if you have somewhere to be after. They really are unconcerned about getting your food out to you in a timely manner. I even waited to pay the bill!!! Ridiculous!! And the bill was WET!,"The aesthetic alone sets the mood before you even sit down. There was a wait but they handle it efficiently. Didn't get to try the brunch but the dinner was on point. They have great music selection also (that matters to me) Tye playlist was on point! I had the lobster Mac, shrimp roll and clam strips, all were tasty, would definitely revisit. The 4 stars is only because they messed my order up initially. But the place is GREAT!","Dogs everywhere. And you might think...OMG...I love fluffy and giggles! But this turned me off. And I'm fine with places that are dog friendly but this is on another level. Dogs sitting on chairs, putting their paws on the table where people have to sit and eat. I saw a dog lick a napkin. Nah bruh. People have serious deathly dog allergies. For me it feels very unsanitary unless you're wiping down each table and seats with some sorta all natural vinegar cleaning agent or a bleachy mixture. I know all the dog lovers are gonna hate me. But this is like a person putting a dog on the subway seat. Ya feel me. No. I'm cool with your support animal but they belong in a carrier or on the floor. Next thing. Had to ask for utensils...after the first round of food was on the table. Small but annoying. Now let's get to the food and drinks.I went during happy hour and had the painkiller, which reminded me of a Pina colada. Sweet and refreshing but not boozy. It was only $6. I shared a dozen $1 oysters with my friend. They were juicy, sweet and not too briny. Nice size too. Yummm! I did see this weird worm on the back of my oyster shell. Kinda freaked me out. I get it! They come from the ocean. I've sent countless oysters to their grave but never saw a worm on it. I don't have bubble guts today so I guess it's not a problem. Yay! Everything is awesomeeee.I ordered the steam pot with the added lobster. Spent $56 bucks on it. I am going to be honest and say it wasn't worth it. I've had better lobsters. I've made better lobsters. It was overcooked and not seasoned. Guess it didn't get an old Bay/salt bath. It was underwhelming but trust I ate my money's worth. Shells everywhere. Juices flying. Shells cracking. It was a glorious show. People were staring. I should've sold tickets. Lmao. The overall steam pot flavor was delicious. It was a rich red sauce, well balanced with tomatoes, tons of fresh garlic, and thyme! I could've just had that and been satisfied. But my mood was Treat Yoself YOLO! The clams were plump, juicy, and flavorful. The mussels were also succulent and sweet. The cod was bland. It had no flavor at all. I had to spoon it with the broth. The andouille was nice and spicy. There were also fingerling potatoes. You get 2 large half pieces of toasted bread to soak in the beautiful sauce and all those drippings. My friend had the Sea Wolf which is a burger, shoe string fries, a pickle, a small arugula salad and half a lobster. She thought the lobster was going to be draped across the patty but it was on the side. FYI. She loved it. If it weren't for the dog thing I could've given them a 3/4. It's a very popular spot. Outdoor and indoor seating. Gender neutral bathrooms. But I think it could've helped to have an additional person on staff. They need some stricter dog friendly rules. It was my first experience and probably my last.","I had there fish and chips( shoestring chips with herbs).Fish was fresh, and good batter but not oily, as you would get in Maine.My husband had the fish taco, looked really good, it came with guacamole which was good, nice grilled fish . The taco was softshell, which is flour and prefer over corn (which I find to be gritty)Their  signature drink , to me is  cross from daiquiri and pina colada There chicken wings looked good and almost every table ordered, next time Illl try.   They also had cauliflower  wihc appear to be same batter as chicken wings.Only negative is the seats inside are not comfortable.",Sea Wolf
187,"I first tried to see if this place is open on a Wednesday without looking up the availability, and just wondered, who the heck closes on a Wednesday?We went back on a Friday evening. It was a full house, self seating. Once you order the food, they give you a number and you sit down and wait to be served. I ordered the Pan Mee, Kway Chap Pork Belly Noodles, and The Michael Jackson drink. Bill came out to be around 33. I tipped minimal even though I didn't have to.We found seats but the table was kinda unclean and table was wobbling all over. You have to grab your own utensils at the counter and the straws were all unwrapped, I don't know how that's hygenic. The Kway Chap noodles came first. It looked okay, presentable. The noodles on top were okay, easy to grab, but as we kept eating the noodles looked more and more broken as we reached the bottom. I don't know if it was overcooked or was just too thin to the point it easily broke. Pork Belly was chewy, egg was standard. Broth tasted like just soy sauce, it was filled with white pepper powder. Unimpressed.The Michael Jackson, soy milk and grass jelly, and pandan syrup. Grass jelly was shredded to sizes of minced garlic. There was probably no pandan syrup in there, because I didn't taste anything besides the soy milk. 4.25 for soy milk. I could've just bought a can of grass jelly at the nearest store for $1.50.Pan Mee. Claimed hand pulled noodles, anchovy, wood ear mushroom, spinach, minced pork. The worst of them all. It looked like ingredients just thrown into a bowl of broth. I didn't see the minced pork, loads of anchovies, barely any mushrooms or veggies. The noodles were THICK. Like double the sui gao/wonton skin thickness. Nothing to be enjoyed about this.The table next to us were waiting on some food. We saw their food coming and they completely spilled the food over the customer's clothes. The worker was saying sorry, but she was chuckling while she was sweeping up the spilt noodles. Not only that, they weren't offered anything for the trouble. Bad service. On top of that, you have to clean up after yourself. All dishes you finish has to be put into a bin in the back. Tables aren't cleaned and wiped down immediately for potential seaters. How the heck is everyone giving 4+ stars. It is beyond my comprehension. Will not be coming back.Edit: I received a very hateful, and racist message after this review through another platform. If whoever it is wants to change my mind, invite me back out. I'll reconsider my review. But damn, so aggressive.","My wife and the in laws came to this restaurant on our vacation to NY and decided to try out this restaurant as we didn't want to take the subway all the way back to Brooklyn Chinatown. The shop itself is a little small and the way the layout is kind of reminded me of some of the local shops back in Malaysia. We sat ourselves and decided to order two Nasi lemaks and one pan mee. When our dishes arrived, we were speechless as the portion sizes were smaller and the flavors only relatively similar. Where was the fried chicken? Where was the generous amounts of sambal? The only closest authentic part was the mix of fried anchovy, nuts and rice. I was expecting a hearty plate and got a small bowl with sambal in a McDonald's ketchup cup. The pan mee was mediocre and I was left wholly disappointed as the tastes from when I went to Malaysia were still fresh.For people that want a quick small meal, definitely stop by here and partake more in their dessert. Otherwise, you do have better options in NY.","I ordered Nasi Lemak and Pan Mee during my visit with my family. I was a little disappointed that the sambal they gave for Nasi Lemak was too little that I had to ordered an extra sambal for $0.81. The Nasi Lemak is a little too pricey given that there's only coconut rice, eggs, cucumber, ikan bilis and sambal. For the Pan Mee, the soup was alright but the taste of Pan Mee was too soft.","Perfect place for traditional Malaysian food.Kaya Toast is the must have dish.Customer service was beyond awesome, all staffs were super friendly. Waiting time is around 20 minutes on weekdays but worth the wait.","With all the raves about this place on Eater (chef + one of the restaurants of the year according to Eater), I just had to try. The service was impeccable. I called to make sure it closed at 10p (late for a weekday for a restaurant off the beaten path of LES) + the manager was nothing short of super courteous. I got the Nasi Lemak (rice, dried fish, eggs + cucumbers), Lobak (bean curd sheet wrapped pork), along with a pandan cake for dessert. Overall I would say it was good, just nothing to write home about. The service + attention to details (decor, self service stations) is what really took this place over the edge. There was also a wide selection selection of teas, coffees, and baked goods on the menu (mostly during the day). However, I was not blown away. Perhaps if I get a main dish instead of their small bites? I find that the dishes really lack a good hit of acid + fresh veg. A lot of salt + fat action, not much on the heat + acid to counterbalance the richness of the types of items on the menu.","3.5/5Kopitiam is a good option for those in search of a traditional, affordable Malaysian meal. The seating is casual and the service is great. The whole setup of the restaurant nails the trendy, hip vibe. The dishes don't strike me as anything unique or special but the portions and prices are great for sharing a meal with friends. Nasi Lemak : A Malaysian staple consisting of coconut rice, fried anchovies, cucumber, peanuts, hard boiled egg. Can't complain about the execution but can't rave about it either.Malaysian Style Milo French Toast: This is made with thick slabs of bread that similar to the loafs found in Chinese bakeries. It was hard for me to enjoy this because I felt like I could replicate this on my own. Lobak: A deep fried pork roll wrapped in a beancurd sheet. This was my favorite dish! It reminds me of the bean curd roll that they serve for dim sum. I will definitely be back to try their more unique dishes, like the spicy grilled stingray, or the fried oyster omelette.",Kopitiam
188,"Very disappointed about the food.  Either we had bad luck or the food has deteriorated.  It was claimed to be the most high end authentic Chinese restaurant in China town.  The crispy beef as appetizer was very decent and cold noodle is worth a try.  Peking duck is prepared wrong, the skin is not a crisp and the fat under the skin is not cooked through.  The worst part is the knife work and it really is amateur work.  It was painful to watch it prepared in front of us.  I was apologizing to our guest at the end for the food not living to the standard.  Our waiter was very nice in giving suggestions.  But the services afterwards were hit and miss, never changed plate for us.  Overall, very disappointing experience and there are so many new, nice and higher end Chinese restaurant to choose.","I tried this place with my co-worker for lunch today.  Nice decor, and attentive wait staff..We just ordered 4 dishes, 2 appetizers and 1 dish and 1 dan dan noodles.  all turned out great.I particularly like the Dan Dan noodles and Tang's tofu dish.  I think the portions are just right as well, we barely able to finish all 4 dishes.As other review mentioned, I did notice that it took a while for the dishes to show, noting that we are the only customers at the time.  But we weren't in a hurry, so it was no issue.  will come back again for sure.","The reason why i gave this place 1 star is because of the manager ( it was a lady with a short hair ). We had a great dinner and at the end she ruined everything by coming over to our table and telling us that our server is rude but actually she's more rude and not polite by coming over and telling us and telling our server to take back the dessert ( coconut pudding) the he gaves us. The food is great, the ambience is nice and the service is good. Paul is very helpful and attentive and knowledgeable. He was making a mistake by giving us a free dessert but then She's making an even bigger mistake by asking him to take back the dessert that he gave us and telling us that he's being rude. He's not rude, she's the one that being rude. She should just let us have the dessert and dealt with him in the back.It just unacceptable that she did that. For fine dining restaurant, she shouldnt do that. She just ruined everything at the end. Im very dissapointed to have dinner here and experienced that. Most server that works in the restaurant business usuallt gives aways something but never in my life i experience the food taking back from us from the manager. She is very very rude manager.","Definitely a good experience of Chinese cuisine, dishes of excellent quality and presentation, excellent atention, average prices, highly recommended to frequent.Definitivamente una buena experiencia  de la cocina china, platillos de excelente calidad y presentacion, excelente atension, precios  promedio muy recomendable para frecuentar.Thanks for voting","We started off with the jasmine flower tea and some Tsingtao, for our shared meals we ordered the sesame peanut noodle, Kung pao chicken, soup dumplings, whole fish with hot bean sauce, supreme broth baby bok choy. The sesame noodles was cold and refreshing, the Kung pao chicken tasted nice but the meat was a bit fatty. The whole fish in bean sauce and the bok choy were good, the soup dumplings tasted decent but would have preferred chicken dumplings over pork. The service was outstanding, attentive and quick.","First of all, as someone who lives in Chinatown and thinks they know the scene pretty well, I have to say this place is a bit of a hidden gem. It's a few streets over from what most people consider the center of Chinatown but it's worth the walk!In a sea of outdated restaurants and run down spots, Hwa Yuan has a nicely decorated, upscale scene perfect for date night or going to dinner with parents or out of town guests. In fact you might even pass it or think you're going the wrong way because it feels so out of place on the street.The service is wonderful - The manager and several servers continually paid attention to our table to refill our water and sake glasses during our meal. The manager even personally came over to explain each dish to us as it was served.Now for the food, we came here at 1pm on a Saturday for a birthday celebration so our table of 8 ended up going with the Chef's menu which included several of the dishes we wanted to try: Cold sesame noodles, pecking duck, and crispy beef. This menu is on the more expensive side (and requires a minimum of four people to order) BUT the amount of food and dishes it includes is rather shocking. If you think of it as a 2-3 hour event, sharing in on trying some delicious dishes with friends, it's well worth the money. Also, we had THREE full bags of left overs after lunch so as the day went on, the remaining food was a big hit for tipsy snacking later on.",Hwa Yuan
189,"Sadly, this used to be my favorite sushi place in NYC but recent menu changes have just kinda pissed me off as it relates to new pricing. It used to be that Omakase came with 2 different options. I do not recall the exact amount but both came to about $50pp. Now it's seems as if they've tweaked the menu such that a very similar Omakase is now a whopping $75pp which is a bit outlandish for a sushi place that is good but is not one of the higher end sushi joints in NYC. Total cost for our table of 4 was close to $500 which just seems VERY out of line with what I'm accustomed to and that's with NO appetizers and just 3 drinks for the table. Also, no more Sapporo on tap, and a waitress that lacked any sort of energy. I still gave them 4 stars based on the quality of the food and what used to be a great local sushi joint but not at $500 for 4 people. Sadly, last time we will be there","Nothing really special. We were first told that we can't be seated until everyone in the party has arrived. They sat us at the ""bar"", which there was nobody serving or anything. No drinks menu, no service, no water. After everyone has arrived, we were asked to wait longer even though the place is pretty empty at 6:45 pm on a Thursday. Reason being that they don't have menu for us (they only have a few copies of it). Eventually, we were seated with the menus. The first two pages are drinks, which are over priced. Seriously bottled of water costs $8, Coke is $4? And they are premium beverage? The menus are also pretty old. The next and final two pages are food. The food options are definitely very americanized, completely unexpected for a restaurant that also serves omakase. We ordered the avocado fries, which is fried avocado -- nothing special. It's like fried tempura pumpkins, which avocado and a thinner shell of tempura batter. Nothing special. Service was subpar. Will not return and will not recommend.","So much disappointment. The yelp reviews really hyped this place up for me, but the sushi left much to be desired. Several things made our experiencing off putting. For one, the place had only 2 other tables on a Friday night at 10pm. Two, there was a really cold draft from the AC that cycled over our table. Three, our sushi was no where near the quality from the photos on yelp.The service was really great, but food really made our experience subpar. We ordered the $65 bada omakase dinner. It came with a scallops appetizer, 6 piece sashimi (2 pieces of yellowtail, tuna, a white fish I forgot the name of), 6 pieces of sushi (yellowtail, baby yellowtail, blue fin tuna, chutoro but not really, eel with quail egg, horse mackerel), and a negi toro roll. Our qualms with the fish is that they were not the best quality. It wasn't fishy, but it was not the freshest. The quail egg on the unagi was weird and ruined the taste, not to mention there were still bits of bone in it. The chutoro didn't even taste like toro - and with the lighting I wouldn't be surprised if they just slipped us a piece of normal tuna. I'm not saying the sushi isn't good - less picky sushi eaters probably wouldn't notice the difference. But if you are picky AF like me, you may want to pass this one especially at this price range.","Just visiting the neighborhood and craved sushi. This place had great reviews so we decided to try it out. Reservations were easily made online the day of. Our reservation was at 10 pm on a Friday night and we were seated almost instantly. When we arrived, to my surprise, the restaurant was quiet and empty, maybe because it was late. Atmosphere was great for a date or small group gathering. Dimly lit and intimate, this sushi spot will sure set the mood. However, the set up and overall environment did feel a little cheaper. I was almost nervous to try the food, but that thought sure changes the moment I tried their sushi.I ordered the Pado omakase set with the supplement sushi and my friend ordered the Bada omakase set with the supplement sushi. My set had 10 sushi pieces with a maki roll and the extra 3 pieces, and my friend's had 6 sushi pieces, 3 small dishes, a maki roll and the 3 additional pieces. Each order was just enough to feel full but not overly full. The fish was melt in your mouth type of fresh. Rice had this magical vinegar that complimented the fish well. each piece was so good, so delicately balanced, it was phenomenal. The uni was by far one of the best I've had. Amazing sushi is all I've got to say. I was blown away. Not to mention, it was decently priced. I've been to many omakase restaurants and am pretty picky with sushi and give this place a 5 stars for the food. Highly recommend, esp if you want a lil more low key and inexpensive while having great quality.","Came here for birthday dinner and was excited to try their omakase menu, it was easy to make reservations and there was plenty of seating when we got here. Biggest highlight of my night was spotting Sara Ramirez( Callie Torres in greys anatomy) here anyways... I was too shy to say Hi and I thought it might be rude to interrupt someone enjoying their dinner so I decided to just admire from afar.The appetizer was decent I wasn't a fan of the shrimp it was wayyyy too sweet and the hamachi in truffle was meh, didn't really stand out. The avocado fries however was different in a good way, I've never had fried avocado and I actually don't mind it! The mayo dipping sauce could have used a little lemon or a little Siracha kick but it was still good. The omakase for amount of food is really worth it for $75 you get ALOT of food, however I think this type of omakase is suited for people who like traditional omakase where there isn't much frills to the sushi peices, I on the other hand prefer truffle and yuzu and jalepenos and gold flakes twist to my omakase and found this a little bland. The wasabi is in the sushi already so they don't offer that on the side. Service was friendly and the waiter came around the introduce the fish and refill our water. If traditional omakase is what you like then I would recommend this.","They got rid of the Pado tasting menu on the weekends. If you want a sushi tasting, you'll have to shell out $75 for their omakase, which I don't think is worth the quality here. Instead, we decided to order some apps and a bunch of rolls to share amongst three people.For apps, we had the Suviche (crab, shrimp, raw fish, avocado with yuzu sauce). This was pretty basic and had too much of the sauce. They also decided throw some tomatoes in there, which was pretty weird. We also had the carpaccio, which was actually pretty good.For rolls, we had the Love (spicy tuna, spicy salmon, cucumber, avocado, tuna, salmon, crunch, tobiko), Habachiba (yellowtail, jalapeno, oba, cucumber, wasabi tobiko, st shichimi, scallion mix), Tri-State (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, avocado, masago), Rainbow (kani, avocado, cucumber ""4 different fish"", and Spider(soft shell crab tempura, kani, avocado, cucumber, lettuce,masago). Nothing was bad but it just wasn't really what I was expecting. They were definitely takeout quality, and not the same quality as when I had previously tried the Pado tasting. Two tell tale signs of fushi (fake sushi) are 1. Weird sauces drizzled on the rolls 2. Mixing different types of fish. All the rolls on the menu had both. If they're going to get rid of the tasting menu on weekends, the least they could do is an an option for a sushi entree, like x pieces of sushi + a roll. I might still come back, but only on a weekday and I would make sure they have that tasting menu available.",Pado
190,"They recently started charging additional $1.5 per rice when you order lunch. It gets even worse, they don't give utensils and napkins with lunch order. Food is good but the service is being too cheap for the price they already charge. Very disappointed with the recent downgrade service.","China Blue is a solid spot to bring a group of friends and order a ton of things to share. That's always the move at a Chinese restaurant (and everywhere, in my opinion), but especially here because the quality of the dishes is a bit uneven, and you don't want to get stuck with a dish you don't love. While I enjoyed the meal for the most part, the garlic pickles were my favorite dish of the night, which doesn't speak well of the massive amount of pork we ate (among other things). The pork soup dumplings, the pan fried pork buns, the pork dumplings in chili oil, the red cooked pork with taro, the Lion's Head pork meatball, the Dongpo pork baos, the Beijing style pork pancakes...I actually think we ordered nearly all the pork on the menu. I'm not sad about that since it's the finest of all the meats, but we really could've balanced it out better. (Of those, I'd revisit the pancakes and the pan fried buns before the others). I particularly liked the fish fillets in the gelatinous sauce (not the most appealing description, especially if you're my wife), and maybe other proteins would've helped. Two things I have an issue with:1. When the door is open, it covers the sign for the restaurant. So if you're walking over from Canal, you only see the China Blue sign on the far corner. If you walk to the far corner, you'll stand outside the restaurant confused and looking like an asshole because you don't know how to get inside. Or maybe I'm the only one that stupid. 2. The cocktail menu lists your Old Fashioned as being made with Basil Hayden's. I watched our lady bartender pour us well bourbon. Now, I'm not above well bourbon, but that well bourbon in particular should never cost $15.","I've been here on multiple occasions, and this place has never disappointed. The food is always great, and the servers are sharp. If anything is ever missing, it doesn't take longer than 1 minute for them to go grab it and make things right. I've tried a variety of their food (family style is common with my friends), and I don't think I've ever disliked anything.","I knew I was going to love this restaurant as soon as I saw the cute terrace that you could eat outside on. Walking in, it does feel like you're transported to the 1920s. I absolutely loved the neighborhood this restaurant is in as well as the decor. The restaurant is surprisingly spacious. As mentioned, there's an outside eating area, a long bar, and then several tables inside. I was pleasantly surprised by how extensive the menu was. We ordered the crab and pork xiao long bao (soup dumplings), drunken chicken, fried buns, fish, and two bowls of rice for three people. Every dish sounded delicious (especially the appetizers), and we had a hard time deciding what to order, so our server gave us his recommendations. Speaking of the service, it was incredible. Our dishes came out so quickly, and I appreciated that they provided new plates for us before the entree. I saw in other reviews that the portions are small, but I thought the appetizers were average-size, and our one main entree (Fish Blossom) was more than enough to feed three people. I would absolutely come back to try more dishes!","- Surprisingly packed for a weekday afternoon- Outside was even more packed (it was a nice summer afternoon)- Service is good- Food is as grand as the atmosphere- fried rice and Chinese sausage is great- garlic pork is really good, and filling- I like the lunch special","TLDR: Shanghainese bistro nestled away in TriBeCa. Authentic, delicious, great ambiance, reasonably priced. If you're a local in the area - I envy you.I struggle to find great Chinese restaurants outside of Brooklyn, Queens, Chinatown, etc. While working down in the Hudson Square area, a couple of friends mentioned China Blue to me. I took a walk over for lunch the first time by myself to try it out. I am so glad I did.When you first walk in, you feel as if you're transported to another time period. Now, I have never been to Shanghai but I'm guessing this was inspired by historic Shanghai.The lunch menu is a damn steal. Appetizer, main with rice for around $12; that's pretty great for a restaurant in this area.I've tried a lot of the dishes here but here are my absolute favorites.Rice Cakes with Salted Duck Egg and Shrimp. OMG, the rice cakes are fluffy with just the right amount of bite. That salted duck egg yolk just coats these starchy discs with this richness and the slightly sweet taste of the shrimps.Hot and Sour Soup. I know, how good could it be. If your'e a fan of takeout, then you've had your fair share. This one however is an excellent iteration of a timeless classic.Shredded Beef with Asian Chili. A staple dish but the beef is just marinated in this wonderful flavor. The julienned chili peppers combine with them to deliver this spicy/savory explosion in each bite. Grab plenty of rice and enjoy yourself.They used to have the Crispy Fish Fillet with Salt & Pepper but I think they took it off the menu. Also, if the menu looks familiar to you; it's owned by the same group who helms Michelin-starred Cafe China in Midtown.",China Blue
191,2nd time dining at this establishment. As the name suggests- they sell a variety of dim sum. The 4 stars is for the food ONLY. I usually pop in around lunch time for their lunch special. The food is a generous proportion and flavorful. However the staff is a different story. Staff: apparently only 1 person is allowed to seat you so every other server will ignore you until the host comes to get you. That is bad for business. Atleast acknowledge the guest and let them know the host will arrive soon. Been here twice and both times servers brought food to my table that I didn't order. I can't help but to wonder how many times my own food was placed in front of someone else before it got to me. It's kind of disturbing. Due to that fact- I most likely will not dine there again.,"Update: Dim Sum prices on menu are cheaper than what they end up charging you. They charged us $2 more for every item we ordered compared to the price on the menu. The dim sum was good, but not as great as I remember during my initial visit. The up charge in price doesn't make it as affordable to try as many things. $2 makes a lot of difference especially when some of the portions only contain 3 pieces. Not sure if we ordered from an outdated menu, or if they just tried to pull a quick one on the check.","We came to Dim Sum Palace with a reservation for 11 on a weeknight. We were seated with no problems, the back room was empty when we arrived at around 5:30pm but was packed by 6:30pm. The dim sum arrives very quickly after ordering. Our group ordered probably around 10 dishes, including some multiples and at least 3 different types of dumplings/shu mai. The food was neither good nor bad, just as expected. There is better dim sum in the city, but you'll have to go to Queens. This is good for Midtown.","We came to get a quick snack for a reasonable price and were not disappointed. When next time in town we definitely will stop by again. It was amazing and very satisfying! We ordered shu mai and the order came quickly. No one bothered us. We ordered, ate, talked, paid and left. Tasty and very fresh! Highly recommend!","Who knew that you could get decent dim sum in the theater district?Came here with my 2 friends right before we caught a Sunday showing of Betrayal. Since we had stopped by at around 1PM, the place was absolutely packed, so we did have to wait around for awhile, and we were glad that we had put our names down earlier. They offer most of your standard dim sum items, as well as a decent assortment of larger a la carte items, like stir fried greens and noodle dishes. The dim sum items came out pretty quickly, as did our order of Chinese broccoli. The crispy noodle dish we got, though, came out way later, basically after we were done with the rest of our food.Despite the somewhat erratic timing of when our food came out, everything was pretty good, and the service was pretty attentive, which was impressive as the dining area was quite tight and hectic. It's a little pricier than similar places in Chinatown or in Brooklyn or Queens, but for a dim sum place smack dab in midtown Manhattan, I'd say it's pretty decent.","Um... Did I visit the same place as everyone else? After dining here, I really can't figure out why this place is rated 4 stars on Yelp. Maybe it's because I'm from the West Coast where there's lots of good dim sum around, but my family and I were all highly disappointed by Dim Sum Palace. Especially considering the fact that we used Yelp to find the restaurant in the first place.Straight up, the dim sum is just not very good. Lack of flavor, dumpling skin is too thick, etc... Just highly disappointing after reading all these reviews. I wasn't expecting Din Tai Fung quality or anything, but trust me when I say that there are so many better options around the Times Square area, especially for the price (which isn't particularly cheap). It's weird because this place was pretty crowded when we walked in, so who knows, maybe my family's opinion is the minority.Service was decent, on par with other dim sum joints I've been to.Take this review as you will, but be warned that if you've had good dim sum before, there's a decent chance you may be disappointed by Dim Sum Palace.",Dim Sum Palace
192,"Would have loved to try their meat sandwiches, but keep in mind those are only available after 11:30am! They grill their own meat and that requires time to rest the meat etc. Because I came here too early, I opted for their breakfast sandwiches which were also great and delicious. They have several bar seating and two dining tables, but most customers get their food to go. I think this place is worth a visit if one is visiting the DUMBO area.Only problem I had here was that the cashier taking my order was a bit rude and unapproachable. She was frustrated with a previous big order and just didn't seem to care how she was coming off.",I was a lil skeptical because I thought it was overrated.... It's not it's delicious and fresh and you can taste everything... I'm in love,The giardino isan exceptional veggiesamm I often craveDon't sleep on the soups.The roasted veggie soup is one of my faves,"One of the best sandwich places I've been to in my life. I got the porchetta sandwich on ciabatta bread and man the word ""sandwich"" does not do what I ate justice. It was a MONSTER of a sandwich overstuffed with a generous serving of porchetta, perfectly pickled onions, arugula and a divine peppercorn jam. The bread was toasted, warm and pillowy in texture -- something I never usually am impressed with by sandwich shops. The flavors were well balanced and rich with every bite. I split the sandwich with my boyfriend and, despite coming in extremely hungry, we both left extremely satisfied and full. For $13, we basically had two meals and this was conveniently 5 minutes away from the Brooklyn Flea Market. So worth it!","We found this gem after we visited the flea market. We were looking everywhere for cheaper food and we were so discouraged by the smell from one of the restaurants in the area. When we were almost giving up, we came across their door and thought they are closed because the door wasn't huge and super welcoming. BUT!!!! We went in anyway because we have no self control and too curious. SO GLAD we weren't too shy to go in because we would have missed such an amazing little restaurant. There's not much option but a few good ones are already good enough. Everything sound very good so even though there's not a ton of options, I still had a hard time choosing. We ended up getting the beef short rib with blueberry jam and arugula. I was a little iffy in the beginning because I'm not a big fan of the peppery/bitter taste of arugula but it works! It works so damn well. Me and my bf are foodies and we are not easy to satisfy. But this sandwich hit all the right places and we left full, happy, and very very satisfied.","Great service. Great food. VERY GOOD TASTE!!!! Beef rib* is my number one (i cant remember the name). Also, Porchetta is good for non-beef lover. Good vibes, All employees are very friendly really ""FRIENDLY""!! Visited this place everytime before go in the city. They never let me down with everything i reviewed.",Bread & Spread
193,"this review is not about the food the place serves. but about how this well reviewed restaurant gives a rats ass about the community and the neighborhood. i see their garbage on the sidewalk as i walk by every night.. malodorous smells at its worst !!disgusting !the garbage bags ripped open with foul smelling food waste pouring on the sidewalk.. rats and raccoons attraction..and it all happens inches away from the outside seating section.Chez, you might have good food, but your relationship with the neighborhood is awful and you should be ashamed of it.step up Chez and clean up after yourself !","Came here for some pancakes at breakfast, and there was a 1.5 hour wait for 3 at noon. We were committed, so we walked around the neighborhood until they called us when the table was ready. The menu is a list of brunch foods with little to no descriptions, so we really had to rely on yelp photos to picture what we were getting. Everything around us coming out from the kitchen made us want more than just pancakes, so we ordered the Sausage and egg sandwich as well for the table. I could live and die by these pancakes, they were some of the best I've had - perfectly crispy and buttery, covered in maple syrup. The egg and sausage sandwich was good, but not the table favorite.","What a great way to lose weight and save money! Just eat here once and you won't want to eat anything for weeks! I got pancakes. Pancakes are supposed to be fluffy happy light clouds. These were not. These were heavy, thick bricks of oily sadness, saturated with syrup - i mean DROWNING in it. Gross. Didn't come with fruit or anything to cut through the grease and sugar grime. Basically it was a plate of obesity. Thanks guys. Also thank you for the room temp water on a hot summer day- really classy hipster bs. Much appreciated.The ""chips"" (guys, we're in NY- they're called fries) come with aioli - which tastes great but was suspiciously room temp af. This probably contributed to the earth spinning nausea that my friend and I endured once we left this special little death trap. (Guys, can't leave that stuff in room temp without it going bad).  Cherry on top was the 900 times we were asked if we were done eating despite clearly still eating fries and drinking our half full drinks- mimosa is pretty visible- you should be able to tell that the glass isn't empty so no we are not done. All that pressure to gtfo their hell den even though they had open tables. Don't go here.","Finally came back, this time for brunch. Reservations were super easy to make, even on the day of. Tried their famous pancakes which kind of reminded me of like a looser cornbread, with crispy exterior, and while it was good it wasn't something that I'd crave. What I did love though was the kedgeree, which is delicious and light and flavorful (also available at dinner). Quiche was fairly normal. Straciatella was also very good (in case you're wondering, it's not ice cream, it's a creamy delicious cheese dish). Rounded all the food out with a celery soda from their drinks menu which tastes just like celery and seltzer water (if that's your jam. turns out it's not mine).Also love the vibes - it's the perfect place to sit outside for a casual / low-key weekend brunch with friends.","Had an excellent meal here on a Friday evening. Was able to get seats at the bar despite no reservations.We got leeks as a starter that was an amazing surprise. I've had plenty of leeks before sliced up and stir fried as a Chinese dish, but the preparation here was completely different, with the leek cut into short chunks of the same height, then drizzled in a sauce / oil and topped with hazelnuts. The sauce was what really brought the whole dish together as the leeks were nice and tender and then slippery from the sauce. It was really good.Then for the main we got a chicken dish. It was a generous piece of flattened chicken, very tender if a seemingly simple dish and the sauce once again clinched the dish.All in all impressed with all the dishes and want to come back to try the kedgeree (and I suppose the famous brunch pancakes).","Finally went to the acclaimed restaurant that we had heard so much  about. Ordered the famous pancakes and wow what a sham!They were heavy discs soaked in maple syrup...so sugary and sweet like eating a super syrupy cake for breakfast. Unhealthy AND unappetizing.Wasted $15 bucks. If that's what ppl want for brunch, so be it...and the restaurant can continue making this kind of crap and laughing all the way to the bank. Hard to comprehend the hype and success of this place.I for one will go elsewhere for pancakes, etc.",Chez Ma Tante
194,"First time in the latest timeout market, lots of selections, must try:1. NY Salmon @ Avocado2. Basil Pasta @ Felice","The Time Out Market in DUMBO has excellent atmosphere. However, the restaurants here are ALL dreadfully  over-priced and not at all satisfying. This was very disappointing as I was so pleased when I learned that a food court would open in this architecturally wonderful site!  My experience with the Center Cut Deli was instructive.I entered Time Out Market with a great craving for Pastrami and decided, quite indulgently and much against my usual better judgement to pay the $19.95. I asked for Rye bread with Caraway seeds, the dolt working there had no idea what caraway seeds were- a very bad sign. I settled on plain rye. He brought me a blend of mediocre rye swirled with pumpernickel. I like my coleslaw on the side. They put some cole slaw upon my sandwich without asking me. This was dumb! The quarter slice pickle was quite skimpy and pathetic- just one! The portion of okay Pastrami, was certainlynot what a deli might describe as overstuffed. This  pastrami sandwich was most definitely NOT worth the price. There was no mustard in sight to be found-- fortunately mustard was available- obtaining some, resembled the process of making a special order. The most irritating aspect of Center Cut: the impossibility of using  cash. This appears to be the policy of other similarly overpriced restaurants at Time Out Market. Such places should be boycotted by all thoughtful citizens. The aforementioned dolt who served me this most disappointing sandwich carefully watched me as I decided NOT to include a tip. After all, no waiter service had been provided. I was done being a chump. Tip percentage options were too high as well. Had I been suckered into it clicking the tip option as I used my credit card, the total cost of this measly pastrami sandwich would have been $25.00. Still, the character that served me had the gall to say, while hovering over me: NO TIP? I didn't bother to answer him. I will not return to this ridiculously over-priced rip-off joint and am unlikely to patronize other Time Out Market restaurants as well. While Center Cut is attractive in its appearance, it is most definitely NOT the sort of place any savvy New Yorker would or should ever care to patronize. Only clueless tourists will help it to survive. This place does not deserve to survive.","I give this place 2 stars for the rooftop view however everything else was underwhelming. Comparing this to the Timeout market in Lisbon it didn't even feel like a food hall. Firstly the downstairs is cramped and dimly lit. Secondly while the food choices are pretty good, the prices are outrageous. The prices are not in line with a food hall. At those prices you may as well goto a proper restaurant and not have to carry around your own food in a plastic tray (which you paid $17+ for 2 tacos or $14 for mac cheese) . I think it's cool to check out once but don't go there for the food.","I got the hummus from Little Alda and it was AMAZING! We got the special, which was carrot hummus with labaneh, sage, brown butter, and sea salt. It was so flavorful and had warm, fresh pita with it. The employees were also so sweet and very genuine. Would definitely eat here again.","Dumbo's newest, gorgeous little tourist trap, it's a great idea with lovely interiors. The good ends there. The restaurants are interesting and diverse, but not all of them are the best in their respective cuisines even though they are priced as such... The prices and portions are insanely imbalanced, and I doubt many of the thousands of professionals in Dumbo can sustain making this a go-to lunch spot the way it's structured. Some examples-$16 for a Breakfast Sandwich$23 for a burger and fries$16 for a joke of a dollop of hummus with 5 pieces of cauliflower on topEven the nicest restaurants in Dumbo are more reasonably priced than this- and that's where I anticipate the people who drive day to day Dumbo food business will continue to take their wallets and appetites. This place is worth stopping in for a look, as the foods are all on display, but if you want to brave the crowded lines and congested walkways for an overpriced bite of something, godspeed.",Great place to hang out with friends! I like to have many options because everybody can get whatever they want! And the view is a big plus!! Take the elevator to go to their roof area. It's super nice. It's very spacious with many tables and chairs. The atmosphere is nice and cozy. I was expecting everything would be pricey but the prices aren't too bad! Grab a bite or some drinks if you are in this area. I will definitely come back again!,Time Out Market New York

Not very well seasoned/the ingredients could be better incorporated into the dish/with each other.",Very tasty noodles with unique preparations. They have good dumplings too. I've tried both the spicy beef and the pork belly versions on two separate visits,It was alright. Nothing special if you're not into spicy food. Had the braised pork noodles which was way too fatty,I was just randomly looking for a chill place to eat by myself and this place exceeded my expectations. It's one of the only chinese places that TAKES CARDS! :) Great portions and loved how they did not hold back on the toppings! Prepared quite fast as well.Lots of meat and veggies. Really chill environment and perfect for a hot meal on a cold night.,"If it's for take out. Even you start with a eat-in box, you should switch the whole bowl cuz you use another kind of bowl for a REASON!

Even I can save the noodles, I cannot eat anything because this kind of plastic is poisonous. I ended up throwing them away. And feeling so angry about everything that happened.Updating:The manager reached out and explained that the plastics is heat resistant and safe.

The 6-course omakase includes: Oyster Shot, Tuna Tartar, 3 tapas - mouth melting ribs, beef tartar, cheese (which I unfortunately skip), Sake Steamed Cod, Trapped Rabbit and Black Sesame Pudding. The dishes get their unique flavor from touches of Japanese ingredients, Italian, French, Spanish. ""Trapped Rabbit"" is the star of the story and makes it worth another comeback!

We loved all the food we ordered that night which was kind of fusion but delicate as traditional Japanese food. They served the best red snapper we have ever had so far. We were hesitated to order their famous dish with rabbit meat and we might try next time.I worked in Japanese company so I am familiar with how serious they treat every customer. They were not passionate but welcoming and considerate even there were little barriers between us due to language. They made their napkins to look like rabbit which was really cute!,Service was very sweet and friendly as expected by a Japanese place. Nice HH deal on drinks. Really a 3.5 star because the menu is way too limited didn't really know what to order... The Guac n Pork and Braised Short Rib which were both pretty good but that was it. Maybe something more after their new spot opening.,"This intimate little tapas place feels like a secret bit of New York unassumingly tucked away right off of Grand Street. In fact, we almost walked past it looking for this place. I brought a friend here, and he marveled over how many times he had walked past this location without even noticing it. Service is friendly if a little bit on the slow side, and for a hot summer day, it was a tad warm inside. However, the food more than makes up for these slight hiccups. Japanese Guacamole & Pork Dip: Yuzu-Miso Guacamole - the portion is small, but it's a lovely fusion of guacamole and rich pork, topped with one of my favorite garnishments - chili threads! This perfect for two people to share a few bites.Ponzu Mushroom: 4 types of mushroom, tofu sauce, tempura crispy bits - the hype is real, every bite of this dish an absolute joy, and we had no problems polishing this off.Tako-taco: octopus, chickpea, spicy mayo, nori sauce - now at first glance, this looked very...green, but we gamely bit into this and the combination of the chickpea and octopus (even covered in greens) was a fresh dichotomy of meaty richness countered with the nori sauce and crunch of the ""rabbit food""Tuna Tartare: prickly pear sauce, dragon fruit, crostini - pretty and pretty standard for a tartare, the dragon fruit was visually a nice contrast, but the flavors melted into the tartare and didn't enhance it much. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad dish in any sense, and is a generous size for tapas, but it's just overshadowed by the other dishes here.Chicken Skewers: one of the specials for the night - 6 ridiculously tender skewers topped with a rich warm sauce, I was going to save one for the puppers stuck at home, but alas - we ate it. Rabbit Stew: this was a special for the night, and we were a tad ambitious to order this, but the flavors were rich, heavy, and really - this would be an amazing winter dish, but wasn't the best choice for us to order during a 90 degree summer. I was sad that they were out of the cherry blossom cocktails, but managed to console myself with a tried and true favorite - Yuzu Sake! All in all, this is a lovely little diamond hidden away, and I'll definitely be back with small groups to discover their other dishes here!",Rabbit House Japanese Tapas & Sake Bar
197,"Had lunch with the family and my kids enjoyed it.. especially My son who is a picky eater. The portions size is perfect, not too much and not too little. The Forma salad was sooo good! Being that it has tuna in it and I am not usually a fan of tuna in my salad, but you couldn't taste it. I loved the pippette ragu and Budino- chocolate caramel pudding dessert.","Everything you want in a fast casual place. High quality every time, quick, reasonable prices. Have been many times and will continue to go back.","Yum! Incredibly: * good* quick* affordableGo. Eat. Repeat. It is cafeteria style, order at the counter and they bring it to you. Not ideal but worth it!","Forma Pasta Factory is a beautifully designed Italian spot located in the heart of Greenpoint offering delicious appetizers, pasta dishes, and salads. I love the fast casual concept here. Patrons can order their food in the front and grab a seat wherever, no tipping required. All their pastas are also made fresh in-house. On my visit with my friend, we ordered the pappardelle bolognese, the tagliatelle scampi, the forma salad, and the arancini (yes we can eat). I absolutely loved both the presentation and taste of both pasta dishes. The pappardelle was simply executed with a bold and flavorful meat marinara sauce. The tagliatelle included sautéed shrimp, white wine, and a lemon butter sauce that brought all the flavors together perfectly. The forma salad was a nice lighter dish to pair with our pastas. I liked the arancini but in comparing it to my other arancini experience from Arancini Bros at Smorgasburg, this does not compare, though it was still tasty. High recommend checking this place out!","Pipette Ragu - 4/5Spaghetti Pomodoro - 2/5Cauliflower - 4/5Hygiene - 1/5The dishes are small by nyc standards, so don't expect to leave full! I wanted to love the sht out of this place and have been meaning to dine here for months since I grew up and live in an Italian neighborhood, I know what good Italian food tastes like.The pipette ragu was tasty, I would've preferred my pasta to be a bit more on the softer side though. The spaghetti pomodoro, reminded me of a slightly tastier version of chef boyardee's sauce, because it had that same level of sweetness, but had more of a flavor depth to it that I can't quite explain. The meatballs are surprisingly, freaking small, but bigger then the chef boyardee version. Personally, I wasn't fond of this dish.Side of cauliflower that had tasty sauce, HOWEVER, and this is a huge no no and costed stars from me due to unhygienic food handling: The person who took care of the garnishing, plated the cooked cauliflower with his bare hands, that's right, SANS gloves, and placed the garnishes on top, then served directly to me. NYS law prohibits bare hand contact with ready-to-eat foods!","Absolutely lovely. Pasta was the best I've had in awhile. I wanted to try everything but they were making a batch of meatballs that smelled so good I figured I should start there. It was a good call. The spaghetti was cooked to a perfect al dente. I was pleasantly surprised to see smaller meatballs instead of 1 or two huge ones. The sauce was well balanced and not overly salty or acidic. Delicious, and I don't feel like I need a nap afterward. The service was great and the space is cute. Glad to have them in the neighborhood!",Forma Pasta Factory
198,"Honestly not sure why this place is rated so high. Expensive, not that good of a taste. I have had so much better cold noodles and katsudon before. Katsudon pork was smelly. Would not come here again.","The basic broth and soba is done well, definitely on the lighter side, and that is it. This place took a turn for the worst.The prices are hard to justify for what you get. No tea. No water until you specifically ask for it. I had a bottle water out to take my meds since our server wouldn't bring water and a senior staff? Came to ask me to put it away. Most orders come with minimum toppings and no side dishes. The more reasonable lunch sets are long gone from their menu.Whatever it is, they're not taking service training seriously. Service is extremely annoying trying to up-sell every table (or they selectively discriminate and make customers uncomfortable, either way it sucks). This all while they have already adjusted their prices and removed the more reasonable options (unless you want plain noodles) And if you think the decor looks nice from the outside, Tables are packed next to one another, impossible to get in and out.","$22 for early bird specialsMon - Thurs 5:30pm - 7:00pmYou get an appetizer, noodles, tempura, and a dessert.The interior of the restaurant is very simplistic, yet beautiful. I came here around 8:30pm and there was no wait for a table for two. I had a cold soba dish under their summer menu and my SO had the curry soba. The soba noodles themselves, in my dish, were al dente, and the noodles in the curry were a bit more well done since the curry is hot and was able to continuously cook the soba. Service here does feel a bit rushed, which is a bit disappointing because 1) it was not busy, surprisingly enough, and 2) it takes away from the overall experience.","While I have spent a good amount of time in the Village over the years, there are still corners of it that I have not really explored.  However, there is an angled block in the East Village where several Japanese businesses reside.  One of these is Soba-ya, where my girlfriend said she once had a great meal many years ago.  We were there right at the start of dinner service on a Sunday so we were seated very quickly.Soba-ya's interior is lovely.  Light wood decor, thin walls between the two seating sections and individual rest rooms near the entrance with incense burning inside.  To the right is a sushi bar with several seats.  The staff greets you enthusiastically at the door and the environment inside is super comfortable.Our meal was comprised of three dishes:Mori (Plain cold noodle with dipping sauce)The description does not sound amazing, but this dish is actually really nice.  You are given a simple broth and soba noodles to dip into it.  The flavor is light and almost refreshing in a savory way (if that makes any sense).  I do wish there had been *slightly* more noodle but that is a minor nitpick.Buta Kakuni (Braised pork belly with poached egg in soy sauce - based broth)You know you loved a dish when you find yourself drooling a bit when you think about it.  This dish was absolutely heavenly.  The broth was rich and flavorful.  The egg added some nice substance and the pork belly was wonderfully tender.  I actually found the broth almost *too* rich and wound up dipping some of the Soba noodles into it (which was perfect).Sashimi MoriawaseThis Sashimi plate had an assortment of seafood: Salmon, Tuna, Uni, Shrimp, Salmon Roe.  The tuna was fantastic and the Uni had that briney sea salt flavor you would expect.  The shrimp was raw but amazingly buttery.  I'm not a huge salmon roe fan, but it was salty and buttery as you would expect.  There was one surprise: the shrimp heads were added in as a decoration, but they offered to deep fry them.  We took them up on their offer and when they arrived they were breaded and fried *beautifully*.  They were tasty and crunchy.  It was a wonderful follow up to the main dish.It should be noted that a meal here is not cheap.  You are paying for a slightly more upscale experience than your typical joint slinging rolls at you for less than $10 each.  That said, I really enjoyed my meal here and I think it was worth every penny thanks to the great food, great service and lovely setting.","Nothing is more appetizing than Japanese cuisine. I've been nauseous since last night and the sight of all food made me want to gag, until my Santen-Mori arrived.My order included the Satsuma-Imo (Japanese sweet potato), Kabocha to Shiitake (simmered pumpkin and shiitake mushrooms), and I don't remember the name but it was green beans in peanut sauce topped with sesame seeds (Gomae Greens Beans?). The sweet potatoes were soft and delicious. The mushrooms were sweet. The greens beans were fresh and crunchy. There was the perfect amount of peanut sauce.For my entree, I ordered the Kamo Seiro, small. The hot dipping sauce was pretty oily, due to the duck, and the duck was pretty tough but I've NEVER had soba that wasn't slopping wet and it was AMAZING! The soba was cold and it contrasted perfectly with the steaming hot dipping sauce. If they had a location in the Bay Area, I would be there all the time.I finished up my dinner with the Green Tea Brulee. DO NOT TOUCH THE BOWL/CUP/DISH THING! The bottom was more of a creamy liquid than solid custard.Lastly, service was okay and I was a table of one, so I sat at the bar and the lights were dimmer in that corner - which was disappointing because I didn't get any good photos...","I've been here a few times and always get the tempura soba noodles. It is so delicious! The tempura comes on the side - crispy but delicate batter. It goes very well with the soba noodle soup. The broth is flavorful and not too salty. I've also had the chilled sesame tofu, braised pork belly, shishito peppers ... all so good.  The braised pork belly was out of this world though. The pork melted in my mouth. I am coming back for sure to get the soba noodles and pork belly! Service and atmosphere were great. Highly recommend.",Soba-ya
199,"Food was good here (4-5 star worthy), but the service brought this rating down. What should have been a 45 minute meal ended up being an hour and a half... all due to waiting on the service! It was a Saturday, place had most tables full, but that still didn't explain the slow to non-existent service we received. I'd rather check out other Georgian places.",Overall it's pretty nice but came at a not so good time. It was empty. There were multiple flies in the restaurant so that was very annoying to deal. The waiter was very informative of the food. We asked for the dumplings (3 for $7) and the waiter suggested to put an extra dumpling so that we can even the split between my sister and I. Would I go again? Probably not but it was a good chance to experience Georgian food. We also got the infamous cheesy bread which tasted really creamy and we were so full it was hard to finish it.,Amazing food and desserts Most try Napoleon cake and there traditional coffeeAte so much but no regrets:) Definitely next time in NY stopping by! 10 stars,"This place is a real gem! Tried (and absolutely loved) the following dishes after reading the menu over over again trying to decide:AdjaruliKhimkali (with lamb)ChakapuliLobioImeruliBedrijinjs quartetEverything was absolutely amazing in terms of freshness, flavour, and presentation. The size of the dishes is pretty generous so i would recommend coming with a small group of people to really get the full experience of trying out as many dishes as possible. Only down side... not sure if the place has air conditioning... it surely gets super humid on a warm New York summer night","My decision to bring a group of friends here for dinner was heavily influenced by another local friend and world traveler. He had just completed a 3-week visit to all of Georgia, and he could not stop raving about the scenery, the people, the wine, and especially the food. As you might expect, the food is somewhat in-between the cuisines of its neighbors. Georgia is also one of the first places in the world where the distilling of grapes occurred, so there is a history to their wine-making. I took and now approve of his suggestion to visit a Georgian restaurant.Dining here is a very social experience, enhanced by the wait staff, and a lot of the foods, especially the appetizers, are meant to be shared. I lost track of the number of times the folks at my table said something like, ""Can we get 6 of everything?""  Pay attention to the small print accompanying the entree list, because some of the dishes are served cold. And yet we found room for some desserts as well. Those that we ordered reminded me of simpler versions of tortes, again very rich and delicious. It was great to have this experience and to find yet another cuisine of which I'm now fond.","Came here because I wanted to try a different cuisine. Got some items from general consensus, the adjaruli, khinkali. Also chose another one since we were not in the mood for too much meat, PKHALI TRIO.You come here, you hear about the adjaruli. Yes get it. It's different since you rarely ever have raw egg and butter mixed together. Was it earth shattering, na. Would I go out of my way for this...na. But if you come here and don't get it, will it bring shame to your family..ya.The khinkali is a very large dumpling and we got the lamb one. The lamb itself was super salty, and it really requires a bite that includes the meat, soup, and the skin. This really is a giant XLB, but....without the ability to eat all at once. First it's too large. Second, you don't get a giant spoon so that all the liquids are still easily edible. Third, the skin breaks way too easily. If I could consume this easier, would be a lot better.Lastly, the pkhali trio...was kind of bland. Very creamy...but yet somehow bland. Pass on that.The service was great though. The food I'll pass on. Onto the next one.",Oda House
200,"I saw all these great reviews and so it was on my ""must try"" list on my trip to NYC. Yelpers, I'm sorry to say that you let me down. Chicken korma is my favorite Indian dish but it wasn't good here at all. I mean it looks amazing but looks are deceiving. The flavors were just off, hard to describe.My boyfriend ordered the tandoori chicken but we were surprised when it we saw the actual dish. It's not what we are used to from other restaurants. Look at the attached photo for reference. At least I enjoyed my samosa appetizer but they would have to be really bad to mess that up. I will say they have a good prix fixe menu though and I took advantage of it.","First off, the food and location were good. This is why I am giving this place two stars.After having our dinner here, I noticed the raw lamb meat sitting right below the ice cooler where all the dust collects. The tray of raw meat was place directly on the ground, uncovered! The fire hydrant was next to this as well. This is absolutely ridiculous and a health violation. After exposing this to the manager his customer service going forward was still very unprofessional. He acknowledged it, and tried to play it off like it was something new that had happened and offered us dessert. This is a major health violation, and it is a matter of time before they come knocking on the doors of this restaurant.",Place is small and homey. Food is solid and plentiful. Prices are fair. They do a lot of takeout too,"I came to this restaurant on a weeknight with a party of 7. This restaurant does not look like it can accommodate a group of 7, but they were awesome! The waiter was patient with our many questions and modifications to our order. The staff was attentive and quick to refill our waters when we were dying of spice overload :) This is by far one of the best Indian restaurants in Manhattan and actually affordable. With plenty of food, our bill came out to only $28 including 20% tip. The food was flavorful and plenty spicy. The naan was fresh and delicious. The chicken tandoor grilled was also made on the spot! Our order:Saag paneer Chicken biryani Lamb biryani Chicken tandoor grilled Chana masala Chicken tikka masala Chicken makhniWould recommend all of it! Will definitely be back!","Wow this place did not disappoint. Upon walking in I was shocked at how small it was, it's in a layer- like setting on the second floor. All the employees were staring us down for quite a while so it was a little uncomfortable and awkward, but once the place got super packed and crazy that wasn't a problem anymore. The food itself was splendid. I mean absolutely amazing. I haven't been able to stop thinking about how they perfected the masala sauce. I have had so much indian food and I think this restaurant is one of the few places who perfected the masala Sauce the way they did, and you can tell the paneer was not just thrown in after, it was well infused and in copious amounts as well. I asked for my food a level 8 spice as I love spicy food and it was perfected for my preference so luv luv loved that! Our sever was really nice and beyond respectful, gave us suggestion on how much naan we should order and even packed our leftovers for us, so generous of them! Def lives up to the hype on yelp and can't wait to be back here. For sure has become one of my fave Indian food places in New York.","Having heard so many good things and reading all the reviews on Yelp I had been wanting to check out Bengal Tiger for a long time. After about a year, I finally was able to check it out for dinner that made me regret not coming earlier. It has become one of my favorite Indian joints in Nyc. I usually judge a place by the butter chicken they serve. Bengal Tiger did not disappoint.I got a spicy level of 7 on 8 and unlike most Indian joints whose spiciest level is not spicy, Bengal Tiger had a decent level of spice and yet it did not overpower the rest of the flavor of the butter chicken - the way to tell if it's actually made well. The chicken was tender and cooked to perfection. The curry was creamy and buttery. The naan was well cooked with a good essence of garlic.Sadly I, I did not get to try other things but considering the proximity of Bengal Tiger and the fact that they have very good lunch take away specials, I'm sure I'll be getting to try out other things pretty soon.",Bengal Tiger Indian Food
201,"I usually write a review with different sections to give an accurate breakdown of what was good and what was bad. I am not doing this for Five Senses because it really didn't have anything - nothing to compliment. I am really surprised with this restaurant. I came with six other friends and we ordered some food to share. Maybe they were expecting us to order appetizers and drinks; I don't know. However, whatever they were thinking we could obviously tell that they didn't like us. The server made a disgusted, surprised face after we placed our order and didn't give us water until we asked for. We never got the refill that we asked for. It didn't taste good, it was overpriced, and it was just unpleasant altogether. I hope no one else pays to be treated like this.","Used to be good a few years back, but now it's gone downhill... the kimchi cheese fried rice has no flavor. And do not order the kimchi pancake :(   I can make one better than that!  Plus, it's really really loud in here...Not sure what the hype is all about anymore whenever i pass by and see the long lines.. People, research and look for other hidden gems in ktown!",Disappointed with both of my dishes. I wanted meat. We ordered the short ribs. I wish i didn't!!! It's overly sweet and marinated with bulgogi sauce.The servers asked if everything was ok and iI informed her that i didn't like it and she just apologized.,"We only had to wait about 7 minutes or so to be seated. It's always a good sign when the restaurant is mostly filled with Asian patrons. It looked legit. We ordered the recommended signature dish, the kimchi fried rice with chicken; they added the egg and mozzarella cheese on the hot cast iron grill pan after it was brought to our table in a formed dome intact, it was in a round flat skillet pan. Same cast iron pot material used for the dolsot bibimbap. We also had the seafood tteok bokki, it had shrimp, scallops, clams and calamari and mozzarella again. I felt there was a bit too much cheese on everything for me and the tteok bokki was way too sweet and not enough spice for me, but still tasty. The kimchi and scallion pancake was chewy and crispy all at the same time and was the best I have had so far, it was delicious too. The banchans were kimchi, potato and apple salad, broccoli, octopus, garlic stems and squash. I liked all of the banchans except for the octopus. The food overall was really good. I would come back for the fried rice and the kimchi and scallion pajeon for sure. I would like to try out the soondubu jjigae stew with kimchi the next time I am here.","This is my first time coming to this restaurant with my friend for lunch. I was pretty excited to try out their kimchi fried rice. We weren't seated right away but the staff did not acknowledge when we first came in. The waiting time was not long but we waited 10 minutes for someone to come over to take our order but no one came over. The staff didn't acknowledge us until we called them over to take our order. But other than that, the waiter who came to serve us came over with small side dishes while we wait for the main dish to come. We ordered a kimchi fried rice, seafood pancake, naengymyeon, and. The kimchi fried rice was pretty cool that they do the mixing in front of you and all the cheese pulling. Definitely a plus for that cheese pulling. The taste is quite flavorful with the combination of the cheese and egg under the fried rice. But wasn't impressed because it was a quite spicy for me even though, there was a lot of people say this dish is good. I really like the cold naengymyeon. The cold noodles were very chewy and easy to eat. The flavors were all there. It was a bit sour and sweet with the pears and the ice bath for the noodles. Everything was great! Absolutely would order this again! Definitely great for eating it during the summer weather! Cold noodles in the hot weather!! Then, we also had the seafood pancake. It was the first dish that came. Pancake was good but there was too much dough and not much seafood in it. Wish there was more seafood added in there. The sauce that came with the pancake was a wonderful combination. Definitely pair it wonderfully!! Overall, food was good but the services was disappointing because we weren't acknowledged when we came in. Most of the staffs were just standing around and weren't doing much since it wasn't that busy. Needs some improvements on staffs.","Surprisingly our group of 4 were seated within 10 mins on a Friday night around 9pm. Maybe everyone was already out drinking. Service was quick, efficient and awesome.  Food came out quick and tasted amazing. Been here about 4 times and each visit never fails. Their kimchi fried rice hits the spot. When they bring it out, it's great for an IG or Snapchat too.  The egg and cheese  mixed in tastes wonderful. All the other dishes were very flavorful and a bit on the spicy side. I love how there's seafood in the dukbokki. I feel like this spot is great for groups to drink and munch. It can be a bit loud, but that didn't bother us.",Five Senses
202,"Needs hygiene inspection!!!We were at South Street sea port and happened to drop by Il brigante.. we were quick to get a place for two. Interiors are cute with warm red brick walls. I had to use the restroom before placing the order, restroom is right next to their kitchen and boy their unkempt kitchen is a nightmare for every customer. There was dirt n litter all around, small and over crowded. I tried not to look at it though was already beginning to lose appetite.Ordered wild mushrooms truffle pizza. The pizza tasted good; bread was crispy, cheese melted in the mouth and truffle oil always does the magic.The service was average, transactional and to the point. I suffer from a sensitive stomach and the very next day I woke up with stomach cramps and had to live on liquids the rest of the day (nothing major though, I survived the day) Don't know if it was the cheese, the bread or basically just the hygiene of the place but I'm quite put off now.","The service wasn't great. My reservation was not ready and when we were finally seated, we were asked to move again to make room for another reservation. We were never served by the same person. One asked if we wanted to keep our plates and we said yes. Another came and took all of our plates along with our forks and knives. No other server came to replace them so we had to call someone's attention. The crowd favorite seemed to be the caprese but the food wasn't special.","Wow what awful service I will never return and neither should you. We got seated and everything seemed fine. Fast forward an hour and our food still was not out after being told 3 times it is coming in a minute.  We finally had enough and asked the manager why other people's food was out and they arrived after us and he said ""they just got appetizers."" Well apparently they order full entrees as appetizers. He never was apologetic and when i said we were leaving he asked ""you don't want your food? I felt bad for the server as she was pleasant but the kitchen screwed up and the manager was being a complete tool. Too many other good restaurant options. Enough said.","Il Brigante is terrific, the food is AMAZING. I have gone in the afternoon, but never on a weekend night.  The restaurant was packed with lots of people waiting outside.  My husband and I got seated after about 15 minutes. The service was fabulous.  I didn't feel rushed at all and the drinks, appetizers and entrees came in a very timely manner. The portions are huge = lots of to go leftovers. The Caesar salad is one of the best in NYC.  Rigatoni Funghi can compete with/ blow away any Italian restaurant.  The veal Milanese was delicious as well.The manager Navid is great!","Amazing food! Pear and gorgonzola salad was sooo good!  And the pizza, holy moley the mushroom pizza! Airy crust and truffle oil make a party in your mouth. I can tell I will be craving it again so soon. We also had the fungi pasta and it was delicious as well. Go try this place out!","Came here one evening after work. Everywhere was very busy, so we decided to come to IL Brigante. My company has been here before, but my first time. Very romantic type of atmosphere. Place is kind of tight. We started with a bottle of Pinot Grigio and complimentary bread. For appetizer we got the burrata mozzeralla, which is excellent, nice and fresh.For entrees we had shared the Farfalle alal Campagnola w/ broccoli rabe, sun dried tomato and sausage. Their is a light sauce in this pasta dish that is amazing, it was fantastic. We also went with the Bufalina pizza, a bit bland for my liking, but wasn't bad, just nowhere as delicious as the pasta dish. The waitstaff were highly knowledgable about the menu and made the experience feel like an authentic restaurant in Italy. Definitely check this place out! Their pastas are amazing!",IL Brigante
203,"Where do I even start? I was super excited because I found a vegan/vegetarian dim sum spot to satisfy my dim sum cravings. When my friends and I got there we were sat down and asked if we wanted tea - in most Asian restaurant it's complimentary, so I said yes thinking it was... at no point was I was told there was going to be a charge ($3). That's fine, no big deal. The food is okay. The dumplings are awful. The only good thing was the turnip cakes. Nothing blew my mind away. We asked for water and they took over 10 minutes to get it to us. The bottle of water was not enough for 5 people. We asked again for a refilled, and again our waitress took forever to get it to us. She came back rudely place the water bottle that she had just filled it up with sink water. To make things worse we saw how she sat down many people, passing by each time looking at us, speaking Chinese and ignoring us. She gave the people frosted glass refrigerated clean water. That really upset us because of the way we were being treated as customers. Here's the worst... 2 of our dishes didn't come out after we have been waiting for over 35 minutes, so we asked to cancel the order. She shouted, ""NO! It's coming."" That was super rude! Never in my life have I experience something like that at a restaurant. The food by the way NEVER came out. When our bill came we were charged for it - after we have repeatedly said we didn't get it. I had to walk up to the manager and tell him about our awful experience. The manager was nice, took off the items that we never got, and apologized  (he's the only reason for the 1 Star!) but I will never come back here, and I DON'T recommend this place.","Went here because its a vegan asian restaurant.But boy, was I disappointed!The dumplings were good (not great)the thin noodles with eggplant were terrible, lacked any taste whatsoever! I had to add some salt and soy sauce to even eat some of it!","How Disappointing! I don't understand the rave about this place. The food was below par. There was more than one dish where I had took only one bite of and refuse to have any more. One disappointing dish after the other. The BBQ Vegetarian meat, mushroom duck, veg. ribs black bean sauce was gross. We did not take more than one bite of these dishes. The pan fried turnip cake was very bland, and the oyster sauce had a sharp soy sauce taste that just was not cutting it. The lotus sticky rice was very dry and needed some flavor to it. Shrimp roll was not recommended. The batter on the vegetarian meat stuffed eggplant was distasteful. The noise level is loud when the servers have an open conversation in their native language, as if they're the only people in the place. Be mindful of the guests! I don't know what to tell ya. They accept credit cards, but they make you put the tip before swiping.","My colleagues and I came here a few times for kosher vegetarian dim sum. We usually get here by 12 - 12:30pm and the place was never crowded during the times we were here. You will not see your typical dim sum carts here. You order by marking/checking down what you want on the paper menu. Some of my favorite dim sum dishes here are: vegetarian beef noodle roll, vegetarian jelly fish, congee (both the house special congee and twin mushroom congee), and vegetarian shark fin dumplings. I also suggest requesting soy sauce and hot chili oil since the condiments aren't place on the table. It might take some time for the dishes to come out since the dim sum is steamed/cooked to order.They also have lunch specials for entree dishes. I'll have to comeback again to try it.","""It's vegetarian dim sum"" my friend said when she brought me to Buddha Bodai. Initially, I was extremely skeptical but once I took a bite of the shrimp rice roll, my skepticism vanished.Dish after dish, bite after bite, I was amazed by how delicious everything was. While my friends enjoyed the shrimp dumplings, my favorite were the rice rolls - shrimp, spinach (especially this). The wraps were thin and silky, not thick and chewy as I've had at other restaurants. The best thing about enjoying dim sum is that I didn't get that gross, greasy feeling that I usually get after dim sum. I walked away from that meal feeling great. There are no carts here, instead there are paper menus where you mark down what you'd like and they bring it to your table.","Really great all vegetarian dim sum! The ""ribs"", ""shrimp dumplings"" were sooo delicious! Im not vegetarian but thought it was all delicious and cheap. Note unlike other dim sum places, there are no carts. You simply check what you want on a piece of paper and it's brought out. Note that tea is NOT included- costs extra. Overall would recommend to everyone as vegetarian/vegan dim sum is hard to find!!",The Original Buddha Bodai 佛菩提 Kosher Vegetarian Restaurant
204,"I think think the prices at Davelle are now a bit too high. When I returned for Breakfast, the prices for the toast were the same but they no longer included an egg.  They no longer included the soup.Also I cannot imagine myself ever paying 16-18 dollars for Omurice (ingredients are Egg and Rice) its just too expensive.",Simple and chic jap bar/bistro. We had: - matcha americano- hojicha - omurice - berry and cream cheese toast. Very exquisite and typical high-quality jap hangout! My only suggestion would be to replace the current paper bowls/plates/cups with real utensils that will give Davelle a more elevated sense of class it deserves!,"Okay, definitely an authentic Japanese joint which I have fallen in love with..and will be back for dinner. I came for lunch and ordered their katsu curry. The chicken was crispy and hot, curry steaming, and rice was well.. it's rice. I wanted to try a lot more things on their menu but due to limited space allotted in my stomach I'll have to come back.","I had a hard time deciding whether this place would get a 4 or a 5 star rating.On one hand, the coffee was probably the best coffee I've had in New York. The Kyoto style cold brew was perfectly complex, palatable, and smooth. It was expensive but I could see myself going back just to enjoy another cup. The maple latte was also quite tasty, sharing all the same qualities of the cold brew but with an added sweet touch from the maple. The service was great, and the ambiance matched the mood perfectly.We also decided to splurge on the toast, which happened to be 9 dollars. I don't typically like rating places based on their prices because not every body has the same standards but I nearly took off a star for how marked up this piece of toast was. It was a thicker than your average slice, but it was so light that it only lasted a few small bites. I would love to say that the taste and texture made the $9 price tag worth it, but I cannot. Overall though, based solely on coffee I would recommend this place every time. The food though, at least from what I've experienced, is lacking.","Came here for brunch because their toast is so darn cute.This is a nice place to have a bite of something small (well, toast) and a cup of coffee to meet a friend. It's not super filling, but it's cute and tastes good.Their interior is very small, but perfect for what it is. It's a spot that this neighborhood should appreciate. It's delicate. The service was very good, I sat at the bar and felt well attended to. I would definitely come back to try something else off their menu. (Possibly not toast?)4/5","-mochi mochi napolitan spaghetti: I'm not a huge fan of ketchup in pasta/rice so I found this dish far too sweet and not very well composed overall--I was a little grossed out by it to be quite frank.1/5-tofu caprese w/ shiso: Really impressed with this--it was creative, unique, and most importantly, very tasty5/5-pork curry: The curry itself was really tasty, but they really didn't give me much pork at all, so it was effectively sauce with rice and the odd nugget of ground pork. I felt really let down to be honest, and I have a feeling the chicken katsu curry is much more bang for your buck.3/5I actually still want to come back to try one of their toasts and drinks as I think everything they do is pretty creative, even if it isn't always a hit.",Davelle
205,"Tried this place for the first time the other day.  The catfish is was GREAT!!!!  The biscuits and cane butter means business though, I'm hooked on just those three things.  Can't wait to go back.","I had high hopes for this late Saturday night dinner but unfortunately it was pretty lackluster. When we first were seated, our waiter told us the bar was closed and we wouldn't be able to order any special cocktails. My experience has been usually that the kitchen closes before the bar so I was pretty confused. I can't imagine what Harlem restaurant opened for dinner on a Saturday evening would discourage patrons from ordering overpriced cocktails, but touché. The manager must have sensed our confusion, because the same waiter came back shortly and corrected himself stating we could order cocktails. Not wanting to risk the bartender purposely messing up the drinks, we settled for glasses of wine instead.  The complimentary biscuits and butter were somewhat stale and given to us with no utensils. It took several minutes to get the waiter's attention as he purposely ignored our attempts to get him to come to our table despite there being only one other couple dining at the restaurant. More disgusting was the butter it was served with which clearly had been left out un-refrigerated and congealing. We ordered the shrimp and grits and turkey meatloaf as our entrees. The shrimp and grits came with cheese and jalapeño bits. The shrimp were a bit over cooked, and the dish could have been enhanced with leftover liquid/gravy from the shrimp. The seasoning was okay, not too salty. The cheese was not that appetizing. I can forgive lackluster food, maybe it was an off night. But the lack of hospitality shown by the waitstaff is worrisome. If you don't want to serve customers, then just say the kitchen is closing. But welcoming us in and then giving such piss-poor service is stupid and made way more of a lasting negative impression.","The food was amazing!!! However although a reservation was made we still waited for over 30 minutes to be seated. We asked 2-3 times about an approximate time and was told 10 minutes each time. The venue is entirely too small (even after a location change) to accommodate the crowd it brings. It was clear that the reservations were double booked and there was also a ton of walk ins. There was no place to stand while waiting and it was a constant shuffle. Once we were finally seated there were a ton of people standing directly next to us where they were waiting for a free table. We were very uncomfortable with our seating bc people were constantly banging into our chairs and talking around our food as we were being served and while eating. I want to again say the food was amazing however the space is not great, the service isn't good, the wait is atrocious and the air level is poor.","I came here for brunch and we made a reservation for 10:30am because my daughter informed me that the place gets really crowded. Our waiter was Solomon - can't write a review without mentioning him. He was an excellent waiter.For brunch I ordered the homemade buttermilk sandwich (bacon, eggs & cheese). It came out nicely plated with a little jar of fruit preserves. It was 2 sandwiches on the plate. The biscuits were nice and soft with flavor. The bacon had a nice sweetness to it that went well with the eggs and cheddar cheese.I also ordered a side of cheddar cheesy grits - can't come to Harlem without ordering the grits. The grits was really good, nice and thick with a lot of flavor. I didn't add a thing to the grits and it was delicious. For my drink I ordered the bottomless Bellini. I think they just started the bottomless drinks because it wasn't programed in the cash register. I had one carafe of the Bellini since it was early. The Bellini taste really good, it was a great mixture. It was worth the price.My suggestion is to make a reservation and to come early to avoid a long wait.","First time at the new location. BLVD is consistent -- food is always good, service always friendly and professional. We didn't have a reservation and were told by the very friendly host that a table would be ready in 15-20 minutes; we were also offered seats at the bar if we didn't want to wait. We decided to wait for a table, and one became available in only 10 minutes or less. My daughter and I both got the southern dinner with fried chicken, plus a side of biscuits. Our meals came out so quickly that we hadn't even got our drinks yet! They give you a 3-piece mixed serving of chicken, which is quite ample. It comes with collard greens and potato salad, both very tasty. I can't remember the names of our specialty cocktails and I don't see them on the online menu, but they were yummy and not stingy on the alcohol! One of them was mango puree and tequila and the other was raspberry puree, vodka, prosecco. I can't remember our server's name now, but he was a sweetheart, as were the hostess who took our names, the man who seated us, and the host who was floating the dining room. Thanks for being here for Harlem, BLVD Bistro.","Pricey and cramped inside. Menu is short but food is tasty. Easy choice for meeting up with friends, local or visiting from out of town. A good Harlem staple.",BLVD Bistro
206,"Ordered the shrimp salad for a team lunch through their website. It said that our orders were ready at 1:23PM, but when I got there late at 1:40PM, it still wasn't ready. Also, my coworker ordered a salad, but it was missing eggs. She ended up calling them and getting replacement eggs!","Great food, not go great service. Came here a few days before New Years for brunch & thankfully there was no wait! The interior was really cute and aesthetic, perfect soho feel. 3/4 of my friends, including me, got the EGG SANDWICH. it's a bit on the pricier end but the flavor was yummy! Packed with lots of different layers of flavor, given that it was a bit messy to eat with hands. My other friend got the BIG BREAKFAST, which was also on the pricier end for not a really filling plate. It looked like a platter of English breakfast; the mushrooms were very delicious! What took away from the experience, however, was the rude service. Almost all of the servers gave us an attitude while we asked questions about the menu and check, even when it was about my friend's allergy. We were trying to split the check per item as they miscommunicated that we could, so we misunderstood. And the server gave us a very rude and belittling attitude, as if we were stupid, as though it was not our fault for misunderstanding miscommunicated information. If any worse, the ranking would've dropped to a 3, as the service already took away the potential 5 stars. tldr;food 4.5/5service 3/5interior 5/5","Had the shrimp pasta and truffle fries. The pasta was good, they were very generous with the shrimp. But the fries were extremely cold and didn't have any truffle or even the fake truffle oil aroma! We were seated right next to the bathroom/kitchen next door and it was an extremely tight space. Might come back for lunch on a less busy day, but would skip the fries for sure.","Just wow. 2nd time around is really the charm. I absolutely loved the Bronte burger and fries (and the sauce they had). Just thinking about this makes my mouth water...The first time around, I didn't really like the food, and it has been awhile. I've heard my sister and my friends rave about how Ruby's is so good and I refused to try it again. However, I finally got pulled in. The Bronte Burger is so perfectly sauced. It was so juicy and you couldn't even taste the tomatoes. It was just perfectly stacked together and was so tasty. The fries are so thin and crispy, my favorite!! We also ordered the creamy chicken pasta and it was okay. I did like how the pasta was cooked though, I'll give it that. But the sauce was a bit too creamy and overwhelming. I would definitely come back for the burgers in no time at all!","Monday around 2:15pmStill need to wait 15mins for tablesAnd I orders shrimp pasta and fries.Shrimp pasta: it's pretty salty, but got lots of flavor in the sauce. Very creamy, garlic taste. And there are 6 big , fat, fresh shrimp in the pasta.Fries: very crispy outside, and it already got flavor so you can eat it alone. Or dip with the truffle aioli.  Pretty heavy but taste good.Their dish tend to be on salty side. The girl beside me, she was chatting with me. She said her sandwich is very salty too.","had my 9:00pm night at ruby yesterday.The music is too loud so every one task each other like yelling. The waitress seems too busy and I had to ask her first for menu. Is there any potential reason for tiny table especially in soho? Cuz I went eggshop for brunch, they also runned the same table setting as Ruby's cafe.I ordered lamb ragu and sweet potato fries. These two are amazing, but lamb ragu is over salted. I had to swallow tons of water after every bites. Sweet po",Ruby's Cafe
207,"2nd time here in a few weeks. For the 1st experience I would have given 4 stars...tasty adobo chicken and adobo ribs. This time was the complete opposite deserving 2 or less. We ordered the $25 pork dish that is supposed to feed 2-3...that is only true if you like to share a big pile of fried pork fat. Completely disappointing. Then there was the sliced beef. Small portion and didn't have much to it other than a soy sauce flavor. Last, there appeared to be an employee's bday in the back with about 10 ppl...3 of which were kids who were allowed to provide an ambience of high pitched screaming while running around for the duration of our meal. We don't mind kids but this was over the top rude. What a bummer. We thought we found a secret gem.","I came here recently with a small group and, although a majority of the group enjoyed the food, I just thought it was OK. And, quite frankly, when the prices are this high, OK is just not good enough. After having been to numerous Filipino restaurants over the last decade and a half, from the mom and pop restaurants in Woodside, Queens to the restaurants in Jersey City and NYC, I wanted to like Ugly Kitchen after hearing about it for so long, but it just didn't stand out in any way.Let's start from the beginning. We arrived for our 6:30pm reservation on a Thursday evening and the restaurant had just a few people inside at the time. As expected, as the evening wore on, the tables began filling up ... and the noise levels also began to rise up quickly, due to the number of people and the extremely loud music blaring from the speakers.The menu was robust. There was plenty to choose from - Typical Filipino appetizers and main dishes comprising of chicken, beef, pork, seafood and vegetables. Each category of food consisted of multiple dishes. Since we had a group, we decided to share family style and DID NOT hold back when it came to ordering. We got the Seasoned Frites, Fried Spring Rolls, (Asian Garlic) Ugly Wings, Fried Isaw, Bistek, Daing and Laing Combo, Garlic Fried Rice (for 4), Adobo Ribs, Spicy Sizzling Chicken Adobo and Sisig. Whewwww, let me take a deep breathe.So what were the winners and losers? We loved the little fried spring rolls, which came in an order of 8. They were exactly as they should be, tasty and crunchy. The Ugly Wings were also very good as well and on the sticky side. The Bistek was good, but not anything surprising. The same could be said about the Spicy Sizzling Chicken Adobo and Sisig. I typically look forward to Sisig when I'm at a Filipino restaurant, but something about it just wasn't right. It didn't have enough flavor to grab my attention. The dish that stood out to me was the Adobo Ribs. The meat was extremely tender and fell right off the bone. The adobo seasoning was also very flavorful.The Fried Isaw was definitely our least favorite dish by far. We were hoping to order the Chicharon Bulaklak, but somehow they did not have it at only 6:30pm, so we ordered the Fried Isaw. The Isaw was way too gamey for us and it tasted like liver. It was not a good replacement for the Chicharon Bulaklak.It's too bad that the food was just average because Ugly Kitchen has a good reputation amongst Filipino restaurants in the city. On the other hand, the service was excellent. Our food arrived very quickly and our waitress couldn't have been more friendly, but it couldn't save the lack of enthusiasm I had for the food. By no means is Ugly Kitchen terrible, but their dishes can either use a bit more flavoring or creativity.","Will be reporting ... caught the bartender adding 18% to our tab of a party of two as gratuity when we asked for the bill. We were given the non itemized version that didn't break down the 2 HH drinks we bought and the 18% gratuity that was added without our knowledge. We caught the scam and they gave us the money back in cash since they already ran our credit card without a signature. She, AND the manager, tried to pawn it off on the computer. Nice try. ** Still irritated by this scam - read through this places reviewsA lot of people have caught this place adding gratuity or trying to hide the extra fee. ** Adding to the top of the pile.","I came here with a group of friends for my birthday dinner, and I loved the dining experience at Ugly Kitchen. If you're a big party, get the Kamayan Feast!!! Kamayan is the traditional Filipino way of eating ""by hand."" For $35/person, you get an entire row of tables laden with food over banana leaves. The food is a smorgasbord of Filipino delicacies - bone marrow, fried fish, pork ribs, chicken skewers, head-on shrimp, rice, and a creamy vegetable stew. My favorites would probably be the fried whole fish and pork ribs. I also enjoyed the bone marrow, though some of my friends said it was too greasy or fatty for them. It took a bit of getting used to eating with our hands (gloves provided), but it was so much fun communally eating like this! *Check in on Yelp for a free house shot!*I'm only docking a star because the service was underwhelming. On a Friday night, they were understaffed so we had to actively flag down a waiter for requests. (It also didn't help that all waiters wore black shirts but so did a third of the customers). The live music could get a bit loud, and it's quite hard to listen to conversation unless you really speak up. Otherwise, Ugly Kitchen is a fantastic restaurant to check out in East Village!",Nice small restaurant / bar in Lowr East Side. Had the boneless grilled chicken with grlic rice.Chicken cooked excellent. Checked in with YELP and received complimentary shot (blended spirits)Happy Hour drinks were a bonus.,"Umm absolutely loved this place. If you're here, ask for Nicole and she'll take GOOD care of you. She was so nice and recommended a bunch of delicious things that we ended up trying and ended up loving! We didn't expect much from this place but man did we have a good time! Check-in: If you check in to this location, you get a free shot! Heyyy! It was nothing too harsh just calamari juice and vodka. What a way to start off the night! Drinks: We came in during happy hour so everything was discounted. We tried the lychee mimosa and although this lacked in the sweet, lychee flavor it was still a pleasant drink with a lychee at the bottom! What really stole the show was the Weng weng. By Nicole's suggestion we drank it and it wasn't until halfway through the drink we realized how drunk we were! We asked what was in it and she said SIX diff alcohols! But it tasted like juice and was so sweet and yummy! I highly recommend this drink if you're trying to get a little buzz but also keep your taste buds in order. Food: Seasoned fries were fried to perfection. Hard and crunchy outside with a soft inside. The spicy ketchup was perfectly spiced and not too overbearing (I HATE spicy food but could easily eat this.) I just wish it had a TAD bit more flavor. Maybe some basil or salt? The sauce still did it justice as we munched on it the whole night. The Asian Garlic wings. Seriously how do they fry this to perfection? Again with the hard crunchy outside with the hot and piping center. It was so gooood! Not sure if this is basically soy garlic wings but tasted a lot like it! The sisig. Squeezed with lemon on top and youre in literal Filipino heaven. Only complaint is I wish there was more meat! Tasted like there was more fat than meat but still had lots of flavor. Overall this is a great hole in the wall place. I highly recommend it. The servers are friendly and you can tell that the customers in the restaurant were regulars. Ironic that it's called ugly kitchen when there is nothing ugly about it. We will for sure be back. Thank you Nicole and Ugly Kitchen staff for a great time!",Ugly Kitchen
208,"This fking place. I can't even. One of my friend is drunk. Ok. The rest of the group is sober as fuck. (Party of 8) 3 of us walk in first. This waiter said we cannot order drink if we only order 3 entrees. Ok I ordered 3. And this chubby dude be like ohhh you can't order any drink cause your friend is drunk. Really? No like seriously. Really? I'm about to smack you across the fucking face. You're just racist I'm not Korean and we in KTown? I can promise you, you just lost an customer that love Korean food. Fuck you BCD tofu you racist motherfucker. I'm the reason youre getting a fucking paycheck cause I'm the fucking customer. I'm here spending money, you're here to serve me.This is strictly against the person who service is, not the food. The food is alright. Better in flushing.","Came here for lunch special.We got bbq short ribs combo $24.99And oyster tofu soup $14.99Also curry tofu soup $12.99As all korean restaurant, you got complimentary appetizer, and in here you got extra fried fish! Food was decent, with reasonable price.","I was craving some tofu soup and have been to the Los Angeles version of this restaurant many times, mostly as a post-drinking place to dine at 2am.  What really surprised me was how upscale it is compared to the LA Koreatown version which is basically a diner.  The food was the same and came with all the standard banchan including the fried fish.  The fish cakes were incredible and they refilled them quickly  Service was attentive, but not overbearing.","Very friendly, food is great. Maybe the portion is too much for two people.I've visited another location at Fort Lee, NJ.","Tldr: awesome soondubu with generous variety of banchanI'm in love with the restaurant. I've been a huge fan of soondubu since my freshman year of college, and, man, this place has my favorite rendition of it! Their mixed soondubu is my number one (for now, I intend on trying the whole menu... eventually). I also love the fact their tofu is organic!The favor of the actual soup is delicious no matter what spice level you go for. Having no spice really lets the base broth shine, though I think spice takes the whole dish to another level. Careful though, Korean spice mean business! Another detail I love: they give you a fresh egg to crack into the soup yourself!The service here is always superb. The waiters keep scanning my table to check if we're out of banchan and water, always ready to replenish whatever I've finished. Speaking of banchan, I was so pleasantly surprised during my first visit that they give you a whole fried fish (small)!The servings are very generous and I always leave with leftovers. The dishes can get pricy, but it's on par with the rest of New York. On the whole, one of my favorite restaurants and definitely one I'd return to for comfort food.Edit: I brought my parents here around 2pm  on a Saturday (they're visiting me from out of state), and my server seemed very... unfriendly. She looked impatient when we were asking for banchan refills and never checked in on us. We felt super guilty about asking for a second helping of the veggies because she gave us a *look*. This is a stark difference from my previous visits... Maybe she was just having an off day, but it definitely soured our mood. For now, -1 star.","When i arrived in front of the restaurant, there was already a huge line. The host told me it was a 40min wait and gave me a number. Since i am out of town and this restaurant was on my must try list, i waited. The wait time ended up being only 20min. The restaurant is huge, on 2 floors, maybe more i couldn't see. The service is super fast! We all took soondooboo. I loved the fact that you can choose the level of spiciness. Also, there is the usual seafood or beef version but they also have the mixed option of half beef, half seafood for the undecided like me.  The bowl is full! So much meat/seafood. There is a lot of side dishes and they also bring you a fried fish as an entrée.Really really loved the experience!!!   I would suggest even with the long wait.",BCD Tofu House
209,Holy cow- I thought I made the best pirogies. But clearly these guys do!! I may eat myself to death!,"Order take out, so good! I had Jalapeño - cheddar & potato. They have dessert pierogies too, but I didn't try.",Absolutely delicious. Cooked quickly & fresh - amazing sauces too. Will be returning to try all the flavours but I can't imagine anything better than the pork ragu!,"Hands down for the best pierogis ever! The place is super cute, love the clean design! and they were very accommodating. We were 6 people+1 toddler.

Pan fried was just perfectly crunchy at the bottom and boiled were al dente. The fill for everyone of them were so good... we had extra caramelized onions as well.It was that good and we so hungry that added extra order of 1 kielbasy and baba's potato!Our waitress was super nice and knowledgeable. She recommended for each of the type of Pierogies if it was best pan fried or boiled.For drinks, lemonades and beer. All super goodChill small place that do not rush on giving you the check. Definitely one place to go back again!","Tasty and filling pierogies; good pricing; friendly staff; cute little space -- all the makings of a great restaurant. We had the potato (boiled) and mac and cheese (pan-fried) pierogies, as well as the blueberry dessert ones. The potato ones were delicious; the mashed potato and cheese filling was smooth and creamy. The mac and cheese pierogies were also delicious -- solid mac and cheese filling. I would have happily eaten a bowl of each of the fillings, but it's nice that they package them up neatly in dough. We had 9 pierogies each for the potato and mac and cheese, and we were stuffed after those. The blueberry pierogies were pretty good as well, accompanied by delicious homemade whipped cream.One suggestion: I wish the blueberry pierogi filling was more like blueberry pie filling -- like a few whole/smashed blueberries and a blueberry sauce/jelly. Currently, it's more like just blueberries in a dough vessel. Price: 4/5Quality: 5/5Quantity: 5/5Service: 5/5Atmosphere: 5/5","Very good pierogies.  We had the sauerkraut and the cheese pierogies (farmer's cheese and ricotta cheese).  These were really terrific.  I kept insisting that whichever pierogi that I was eating at the moment was my favorite.  They worked together so well.  The cheese is a heavier, denser taste, and the sauerkraut was a much lighter flavor.  I think the pairing worked really well.  We also ordered the cucumber salad.  It had a little too much bite for me on it's own, but I enjoyed eating it with the pierogies.  We also had a czech lager, which was pretty tasty. Services was friendly and quick.",Baba's Pierogies
210,It's ok. The food is delicious and authentic but over priced. The service is subpar plus the drinks are boring.,"Dinner review:Truthfully the staff is great so's the food, the downside is the price. $20 for literally a cup of stew and a plate of rice was disappointing. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.",Not worth it. $24 feijoada is tiny and the brigadeiro tastes stale. No seasoning just plain all around. Had such high hopes. Only giving it two stars because the delivery was fast.,"Just. Wow. One of the most genuinely memorable experiences I've had. The second I walked in, Mari was so attentive and welcoming that time flew quickly. After looking at the menu, I settled on the Açaí bowl and the Feijoada.First, the Açaí bowl... a hearty serving with a variety of fruit. Then, the feijoada. Nice balance of salt and texture, and the farofa was on point. And to top it all off, I had cashew fruit juice - muito obrigado, Mari. I'm really looking forward to going back and exploring the menu in-depth. In the meantime, I'm gonna have a difficult time keeping my mind off the food.","Was really excited to come here! Always smells amazing and looks so cute. We went on a Friday at 7pm and got seated outside right away. First off, it took at least 5 minutes for someone to come over with menus when I had made eye contact with the waitress several times.  Didn't matter to us much.  I noticed she was the only one working at 7pm on a Friday.  Poor girl was running around, good thing it was a small place.  Our appetizer came before our drinks.  The drinks had never came and my fiance went up to the bar and asked about them and the waitress said she will check with the bartender.  Clearly they were forgotten.  We got our dinner a couple minutes after finally getting our drinks and we both REALLY enjoyed the food. Maybe they were short staffed that night but the service made for a below average first experience.  Food made up for it though!","If your looking for a staple restaurant in your roster, look no further.

212,"The Little Owl is indeed little. Its a little place, with little food- small portions without sides. For example, if you get eggs benedict... it won't come with a side of potatoes. And if you order french toast, you get 2 slices of toast, that's it. They probably want you to order sides- such as half an avocado for $6 or French fries for $11.This place was super cramped. If the person next to you is big, it is possible that your arms may touch. The bathroom is right next to the kitchen, if there is a line for the bathroom, you will be blocking the entrance to the kitchen.The food was good, but not outstanding. If you are on a diet and want to eat little portions, go to Little Owl!","Love the food and the servers were interactive with us. Overall great experience, but the host was not nice to us.

I actually didn't order one and then my friend got one and it looked so good I had to order one too.Felt a little underdressed here, so maybe dress up a bit when you visit.

213,"Ok, I feel bad giving this place 2 stars, but the experience was frustrating. I took my friend out for her birthday. The host was nasty and full of negative attitude and immediately complained about my water bottle - My water was almost finished and I was going to order a new one anyway. And the water they offer is Dasani (???). Like chill, my water I brought is way more expensive than Dasani and I'm about to spend a good amount of money so don't worry I'm going to buy your water.The service was soooooooo slow like snail's pace slow. We were there for 3.5 hours for the tasting menu, which was like 1 plate every 20 mins or something like that. And they kept asking us when we wanted our food: Do you want everything now? Do you want us to rush? Or do you have time to go slow? Um.... Can you figure it out like every other restaurant? Your regular pace is too damn slow!!! No one else asks me what I want my food interval timing to be. When I order a tasting menu the food comes out idk maybe 10-15 minutes apart, keeping in mind how quickly we eat and how long we are waiting. So weird. The soba is mediocre, by the way. Way too much fish on the tasting menu without enough other flavors to cut through the oiliness of the consecutive fish dishes. Pretty food, but make it more palatable.I also asked for a birthday candle to the waiter at the beginning and he completely forgot. So that was annoying.","When we arrive, the server told us that she gave away our reserved table because ""we are 5 minutes late"" and asked us to sit at the bar, without appearing to be apologetic. I mean, we are in Manhattan! Who does that!? Later we ordered Soba. Because we had to share it among people, I asked the lady at the bar if we could get more dipping sauce. She said that would be $1 charge for the extra. Again, who does that!? It is just soy sauce that Japanese restaurants throw in A TON when you order delivery.The food is really mediocre compared to nearby alternatives (say Sakagura). I will not go back to this restaurant because of the terrible service we get",Not bad. Cute place...quiet lunch hour and privacy for a conversation. All I could ever ask of a lunch date,"My NYC go to Japanese restaurant.Located in East Village, this joint is popular yet have not lost its authentic touch.They have good soba and sushi along with the daily specials.  Worth to try them all!Try to book table online, it will save you a lot of the wait time.","Didn't come here for the sushi but was intrigued by the soba options. Not that many restaurants have such an extensive soba selection so definitely was excited about the large menu at Ise! Interior is very clean with a minimalist vibe. The restaurant was decently crowded but they were able to accommodate our large party pretty easily.The appetizer menu is extensive and a bit overwhelming. We ordered a selection of apps which I thought were generally a bit small in portions for the price. It would probably be enough for 1 person but to share you really have to get multiple portions. The soba menu was really great, with both hot and cold options. None of the soba noodles were soggy - the noodles were cooked very well and were nice and chewy. They had a ton of options, including soup and sauce types. At the end, they bring a broth / water so you can drink the leftover sauce. Staff was so nice even though we were a large group.","My boyfriend took me here for dinner the other day, and we had a great time! We ordered a cold soba with mushrooms and grated radish as well as a chirashi set. The soba noodles were very chewy and bouncy. They are handmade in house. We thought that the chirashi was a great value because there were almost 20 pieces of sushi. The octopus was a bit tough but all the other pieces were great. No one told us that they had ran out of uni and we didn't realize this until we heard the waitstaff telling other customers. When we asked about it, and waiter offered us complimentary ice cream, which doesn't really make up for it considering the price/value difference. The black sesame ice cream was a bit too sweet for our taste. They also service complimentary hot tea if you ask. My boyfriend loved it so much here that he came back by himself a few days later. Also, I don't know why the reviews complain about the service here; the service is above average and everyone is very courteous.",Ise Restaurant
214,"Didn't like this restaurant nearly as much as I thought I would. We couldn't finish the duck pate, the steak au poivre was too peppery (although cooked well), and the vegetables that it was served with were very plain. The service was also subpar and the tables are essentially on top of one another. Will not be going back.","This is a really well known French restaurant so I thought I'd give it a try. The worst thing about this restaurant is that the service is horrible, I came into the restaurant and was given the expectation to wait 20 mins, it ended up being an hour and 10 mins. The servers weren't working with a sense of urgency at all and just brushed me off every time I asked about the progress.The food was not that great either. The escargots were too salty, we got a goat cheese tart, didn't taste like anything special and lastly the mussels and fries didn't have much flavor to it either. The servers weren't attentive and just getting my check took about 15 mins. It was a rowdy restaurant without the nice intimate vibe that French restaurants usually give as well. 2/10 would come back again","Soho classic with a cute authentic French-inspired interior that's definitely worth checking out once in your New York life.Service at the bar is slow, and the food is good but not amazing. Balthazar is an institution, but if you want a meal that will knock your socks off, head elsewhere.","This place came highly recommended by​ a friend. She described it as ""bougie with a good wine list"" Was able to score some last-minute​ reservations​ online albeit it was at 9:30pm and they weren't able to accommodate​ us any earlier. We tried calling around 7:00 and they said it most likely wasn't going to happen and when we walked in at 8:30 it was PACKED so don't even try to squeeze in here before your reservations. We were going to just grab a drink at the bar but it was packed there too so we just went to a rando dive bar across the street. The ladies working the front were super friendly and well organized dispite the pure chaos of everyone trying to check in for their tables. Do not make the same mistake we did and order six dishes. We were only able to finish two and I was eating leftover pate for breakfast for days. I wish the waiter told us we were way over ordering. We even asked how many dishes we should get and he did not bat an eye over the fact we were ordering enough food for a family of five.The portions are huge and the food is heavy and rich. We ordered a carafe of wine. The waiter let us try one of the options before we made our final decision which was nice.Escargot - This is a must. I love escargot but my husband soaked up every last drop of the sauce with the complimentary bread. I thought the sauce was just okay but it was by far his favorite.Pate - The pate is soooo heavy here. My husband knocked into with a knife and thought it was going to jiggle but it was solid! Its so so rich and it was one of my favorites even though you can only eat a little at a time.French Onion Soup - Another favorite. You can honestly almost eat this as an entree if you eat the whole thing because of how much cheese and bread there is. We left most of it after drinking the broth unfortunately and knew it wouldn't make good leftovers.Duck Confit - Literally fall off the bone goodness. Both our favorites of the night but we were stuffed by the time it arrived to our table. Must order. Steak Tartar - Solid tartar but could be skipped. Only finished 1/4 of it. Shrimp Risotto - Almost ordered the entree size and glad we didn't. This one could be skipped to. Super fun and beautiful ambiance. Our favorite restaurant from our entire trip!","Balthazar's is my favorite when visiting New York. Service is always on point. The escargot is AMAZING. The chicken liver and foie gras mousse, so good!  Tried the Le Balthazar cocktail this last time and loved it. My sister had the Champagne Pick Me Up and really liked it. Until next time Balthazar, we'll be back.","As one of the recommended French restaurant in New York which still doesn't cost a fortune, we came here for a Birthday celebration. This restaurant was way more crowded and less fancy than expected, with even a table in front of the restroom. We waited an extra 10 min after our reservation time.  The decoration is old style, and based on my french friend's comment, it is more like a lunch place in France where people discuss after half day of work. We ordered the duck config and petti stake. The food was served fast. The duck config came with sweet peaches as most french duck dish does. The stake was cooked well, with great french fries. There were not too many suspense in terms of tastes. The waitress was very caring. The thing we were not satisfied was the wine. It was bad wine served with bad shaped glasses, but charged at a high price. Overall, the food was good but not worth the price. People likes this place maybe more because of the noisy and lively french atmosphere.",Balthazar Restaurant
215,"I visit NYC every year and this is the last place I go to on the trip to leave the vacation on a strong note. The food is very much authentic and traditional, which is exactly what I want. My only complaint is they removed spam fries from the menu but the waitress recognized my Mitski shirt so all is well.","My first attempt at Filipino food was a success!My table tried the pork sisig, which had pork belly, cheek and tongue scrambled with eggs. The flavor bomb was totally unexpected. The textures from the different cuts of meat blended perfectly together with the egg. Because I was in a time crunch, we couldn't try anything else, but the food on everyone else's tables looked so appetizing. Next time, I'm coming back for the Ube & Chicken Waffles :).","Attentive service, really good sisig, but everything else is just meh to ok. Came here for brunch, but it wasn't eggscelent!Baboy sisig ($16): be warned of the small portion (it is adequately listed as an appetizer, and it's definitely one of the priciest appetizers seen). If you have a mini cast iron skillet that you use to fry one egg - it's that size. I really liked this while it was hot - tasted some of the fattiness, but some pieces were a little hard and dry. What I didn't like was that their waitstaff actually mixes the dish for you, standing on the side, before serving. I wouldn't mind mixing it myself . . .Garlic rice = YESSS. Went so well with the sisig!Eggs benigno ($14): NO RUNNY YOLK! Eggs were almost hard boiled. Bread was sooo fat and thick, and hollandaise sauce was alarmingly sparse. Spam is spam so that was delicious...but never again for this price. Most disappointed by the lack of runny egg, and the table next to me received the same thing...yikes. They also commented loudly that they didn't like the arroz caldo (the rice porridge entree) Eggs aguinaldo ($18): lemongrass pork belly was very crispy (but not crazily so) and quite flavorful! Perfect sunny side up for this dishBangus ($8): I really thought this would be more moist, but it's on the drier end. Milkfish had little to almost no flavor, just fried, not much to this. Wouldn't get again","Great staff! Service on point! However, the food was just okay and I would recommend a better storefront sign or something. I walked past it at least 3x. I finally found it after. It's the store with the yellow awning.We ordered lumpia Shanghai, kare kare, Pasyal plate, chicken and ube waffle, and isda of the day. Let's say that the lumpia Shanghai was the most memorable dish I had. The ube waffle was okay with dry chicken. The kare kare was a typical kare kare. The amount of ox tail was meager. Our table of four had about one piece each, or did we had to share... I forgot. It wasn't alot. The pasyal plate is a good sampler of you are new to the cuisine. The isda of the day was simple but my mom who is a grilled fish fan was just eh about it. If you ask how I have ranked the food... my experience with Filipino cuisine is about novice. I get a longsilog once a month, had my friend's mom (true Filipino mommy cooking) homemade food and few times, and have made my own kare kare at home. If you have it more often, I think you wont be impressed.Overall, I think will only be back for a kamayan meal for the experience. The staff is super nice and unfortunately, I didnt get our waitress's name. They deserve the credit for the night better.","We came during happy hour because we saw $1 oysters, but they don't offer oysters anymore. We were slightly disappointed, but stayed since we wanted to try Filipino food. The staff was very helpful in explaining the menu as we were not familiar with anything on the menu.We ordered the pork Sisig - Pork and we really enjoy the deep flavor of the pork. The Garlic Rice on the other hand was surprisingly on the bland side. We were both disappointed with the rice as the other dishes were so flavorful.","There's so many amazing food options in NYC, but I was really eager to try some of the Filipino restaurants out here. We ended up choosing Maharlika because of the high ratings on Yelp. We went during lunch time, so some of the options were not available, which was okay, because there was already a lot of options to choose from. For drinks, I got the Filipino flash and the finacè got a red horse beer (a Filipino beer that's 8%). We shared an order of pork sisig and Flip'd fried chicken and ube waffles. Both of the dishes were amazing! The pork sisig was just the perfect portion for us, which by the way came with a side of garlic rice (score!). The ube waffle was also fantastic. It tasted like a waffle, but once you bit into it you got the ""halaya"" style ube inside. It was made with bagoong butter and coconut syrup. You can definitely taste the Filipino accents to it. I'd love to come back here one day and try out the dinner!",Maharlika
216,"Chicken is tasty with s crunchy crust and juicy meat. Mac and cheese is an overpriced fail. We sent it back because it was cold and tasted bad, no flavor and was not cheesy. A small plate for fourteen dollars should be banging but this didn't even come close. The grits on the other hand were delicious. They are creamy and hearty. Waffles are okay.  The chaquillas are a mess. The flavors don't work well together: too many different textures. The dish also came out cold. The place has a chill vibe and the girl who greeted us was very nice but the waiting staff were not enthusiastic or friendly, just not a happy mood all around.Mera's Tip: try the grits","Thursday night late dinner. It was loud and difficult to hear and have a conversation. They provide three homemade butters- mixed berry, lemon honey, and herb butter The rosemary and mushroom waffle and chicken was yummy.","1) TOO LOUD. Holy crap, why the eff is it so freakin' loud even when you're sitting by the window? Did we walk into a Yodelers Convention?2) Pretentious service. I just want a straightforward answer about what's in this particular dish. I don't need your ironic snarcasm (snark + sarcasm) and ""What do YOU think is in it?"" mind games. #girlbye3) Underwhelming food. Shrimp and Grits - Under-seasonedFried Chicken and Waffles - Chicken too dry, waffle okayBraised Collard Greens - Not hammy enoughBrussels Sprouts - Burnt...?Rico Suave Bossa Nova - Decent cocktailThe Queen of New York - Also decent cocktail","There is NO reason to market and sell Chicken & Waffles. Mainly because Chicken & Waffles sell themselves! Just when Nas couldn't get any better, from a Queens native perspective, Mr. half man half amazing goes ahead and embarks his entrepreneurial spirit into an unbeatable food category. DELICIOUS CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. Sweet Chick has many options and variations of their delicious waffles and fried chicken. I've tried a bunch of them and can't decide a favorite, mainly because they're all so good. Try them all and you decide.","Have never been let down with Sweet Chick.Been to their L.I.C. and Williamsburg locations and i love them both equally. Their specialty waffles and delicious chicken have always been just enough to satisfy for a competitive price. The VIBE in their shops destroys anyone else who's still trying to define the meaning of the word.Excellent staff, music and speed of food delivery.I Love SWEET CHICK","Had a somewhat subpar visit to Sweet Chick today. Granted, it's Labor Day, and the wait for a table was 35+ minutes. My friend and I waited outside as the rain poured. When our table became available, we were happy to be back indoors. After glancing over the brunch menu, we both ordered breakfast burritos. It took a long time for them to arrive, but I found mine much to my liking. Eggs, chicken, gravy, etc., in a tortilla, panini-pressed. The side of potatoes was gratuitous; I took most of them to go.The service was spotty, and also $5 for a 12 oz. Narragansett feels exploitative. That said, I have no quarrel with the food I selected. Also, and totally not their fault, but a baby was screaming for most of my visit. Can't bring myself to give four stars, so three it is.",Sweet Chick
217,This place was right down the street from my apt and it is to die for. Food was so tasty and so affordable. Wish I had more seating inside though!,Understood why it was 5 stars when i had their jerk chicken. Normally i don't really write reviews but this one deserve legit 5 stars,This place is the f*&!!king bomb. Jerk chicken is off the chain. Staff very hospitable.,"My boyfriend and I found this gem in Brooklyn that had some darn good soul food. We both had ribs, but he had the BBQ ribs which were perfectly cooked.  I had the jerk ribs, they had a good kick to it. They ran out of the Mac and cheese (since it's so popular), but we had some candied yams and veggies. (JUST AS GOOD) We will definitely be back for some Mac and cheese","It's been FOREVER since I've been to a soul food spot in Brooklyn And was like ""this is it""Came here 12 on the dot (as soon as they opened) and had a fried fish meal with two sides. Yams and Mac and cheese cause that's what true southerners eat! Fish was fresh out some piping hot oil. Wait, let me back up. The CORNBREAD! Chile! So good I asked for two (and I'm supposed to stay away from carbs but mind y'all business). Fast forward. So I received my meal. My biggest critique with yams is 1 of 2 things 1) they're not sweet enough 2) they're two sweet. I know, very thin line. But when you know, you know. They're yams are PERFECT! The Mac and cheese is real ""my grand momma said dinner ready"" Mac and cheese. The fish is fried like your classic black folk fish fry in the south. OHHHHHHHHH and they had kool aid y'all! Listen, I don't indulge like this normally. Maybe twice a year. I gotta keep telling myself ""girl don't go back before you start rolling down the street instead of walking"". The kool aid was black folk kool aid forreal. Not too sugary either. JUST RIGHT. I'm assuming they're family owned but they're a cool staff. That food though? A1. And now I know why they have a perfect 5 star rating on yelp.  Like I always say, I love when Yelp doesn't disappoint. Y'all were spot on with this spot man!","Yesterday, I and some of my family members went to this great restaurant in Brooklyn called A Taste of Heaven, which I found by simply googling ""soul food restaurants in Brooklyn"". The restaurant sits on a quaint block in Williamsburg. Upon us entering, we were greeted with a warm and friendly ""hello"" and shown the variety of foodchoices.There is SO MUCH to choose from, over here! I had the Rosemary Chicken with macaroni and peas and rice as my two sides, and my cousin had the Ox Tails with the peas & rice and macaroni as his two sides. I forgot what my uncle had, but it was obviously delicious, as he scraped is dish clean. The proprietors, Melody, Tony, as well as Tyrone and the rest of the amazing staff treat you as if you are family and truly made the trip to the restaurant worthwhile (mind you, I live nowhere near it). If you have time, this is a hiddengem that needs to be checked out! It is SO worth the trip to Brooklyn. Also, a block away, they have some of the most beautiful murals I've seen.",Taste of Heaven
218,"Yesterday I had what perhaps was the most unpleasant dining experience since I moved to NYC more than three years ago. Technically, it was not ""dining"" because we had to leave before food was served, but it definitely wasn't pleasant unless you enjoy rude and incompetent service. An hour before coming to this place, I called them and asked whether I can make a reservation for two for tonight. The guy on the other side of the phone said that they are not taking reservations for small parties, but they have room for walks in. I asked then how long the wait time was and the guy answered that there was no wait time and that we will be seated swiftly. Within an our after the call (the guy knew our ETA because I said it when I asked him about making a reservation), we arrived to the restaurant only to find that from the same guy I talked on the phone that there is a 30-45-minute long wait. So I am taking off the first star because of this.After the guy said that we would have to wait for 30-45 minutes, which is not the end of the world of course, I asked him why then he said on the phone that there is no wait. The guy answered that ""it was not certain"" and that I didn't call (sic!). When I heard that, I simply pulled out my phone and showed my last call (to the restaurant) and asked whether it is their phone (because for a moment I thought that I called to a different place). The guy confirmed that it was their phone and told us that we can  go eat elsewhere (!!!) if we don't want to wait. After this answer, I understood that it is pointless to talk to this guy and requested to talk to a manager. Also,  for this rude and unprofessional answer, I am taking off the second star from my rating.The manager, who showed up swiftly, heard my story and said that he can't help me in this situation and that either we wait for 45 minutes or go elsewhere. I said that by no means I wanna bypass all the people waiting in line before is, but I would like to hear apologies for being misinformed about the wait time and then about rude customer service after our arrival (up to this point nobody apologized). The manager became furious, literally speaking, and stated clearly that he won't be apologizing for our poor experience... For this I am taking off the third star from my rating. (Side note: He was unapologetic to such an extent that it reminded of Dick Cheney's comment after it became abundantly clear that the the Iraq war turned  into a bloody mess)After the manager finished his angry speech, our party of two decided to leave (before doing so, I informed the manager that I will be writing this review and said good bye). The manager continued spitting words in my back (I didn't hear clearly, though) while we were walking away from the restaurant.  For this I am taking off the fourth star from my rating.As a result, I am very displeased with customer service in this place. First, I was lured by a false promise of having no wait. Second, both the waiter and manager were extremely unhelpful in resolving the situation and multiple failures to admit their own faux aps. Third, suggesting going elsewhere and spitting words in someone's back is simply rude. Therefore, I will not be coming again and hopefully my post will help everyone else to avoid this unpleasant experience.","Second time here and both times were average at most. High traffic place so staffs are very rushy and try to get people in and out fast. The bill will be on your table before you ask. I ordered the crabmeat fettuccine - parts of the pasta was cold, and the crabmeat is nothing more than some minced frozen or canned crab. You won't even know it's there because it doesn't taste like crab. The calamari app was good though, grilled 2 whole calamari, not the fried kind. I was surprise by the amount of reviews and high rating, but after 2 visits I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. Also this is CASH ONLY but there is an ATM on site.",Tourist TrapThe service was rushed. The food was bad. Do not order the steak tagliata. It's road kill grade beef served with arugula from trader joes drenched in sweet thick balsamic syrup. And it's very over priced. I wish I can take my meal back.,"Simple homemade pasta, good ingredients means amazing food!Got the taglietelle and the spaghetti and we were not t disappointed at all. The pasta has a beautiful, rustic chew to them and are perfectly aldente. The tomatoes in both dishes are well cooked and flavorful.Love this place and would definitely come back.Would recommend, would come again.","Arguably one of the most authentic experiences I've had living here in NY. I've had this place on my bookmark for YEARS and I finally was able to go. Our time here was rather quick, we were seated outside since it was still nice out. The servers were really attentive and very Italian I almost felt like I wasn't home! We ordered wine and two entrees. To start they brought out some bread. Although on the dry side (no butter or Olive oil) it was very good! We ordered two glasses of wine nothing special. Now for the entrees. My lady ordered Tagliatelle Al Ragu. It had really good flavor, just felt like the pasta was slightly undercooked. It tasted fresh, just needed a bit more time as it was a bit rough to chew. I had the Spinach Gnocchi that came in a Gorgonzola Sauce and it was very tasty. But like the Tagliatelle I felt like maybe this could've been cooked a tiny bit more, as it was too chewy and just took way more effort to get through. Best part was the grated Parmesan. I can have that for DAYS it really gave the plate some bright notes. The food is good, don't get me wrong I just expected a bit more being how authentic it is. I definitely recommend the Gnocchi if you had to stop by.","We decided to eat there because it looked really busy and that's generally a sign of good food. We had their beets and different flat bread for appetizers. I would really suggest beets, they will get your taste buds going! The flat bread should of been served a minute earlier because it was getting a bit hard. For appetizers I had the chicken cutlet and my friend ravioli. The ravioli was pretty average and same for the chicken cutlet. The house Rose made up for the couple of mishaps. I would visit the place again. Wait staff was also very friendly.",Malatesta Trattoria
219,"Wet food and absolutely no flavor, no spice, and no salt. I added lots of salt, still, couldn't swallow the puffy, greasy chunky rice. The meat was wet! Yes, wet with some soup, although I ordered the grilled dish and specifically asked him if the meat is grilled and browned or is it in Maraq, which is soup or tomatoes sauce. He insisted that the dish should come with crispy grilled to perfection peices. I'm from an Arabic country, and I've been cooking Arabic Food since I'm 9 years old, so you can't tell me that's the dish is normal or it should be like this, coz it is not! They wouldn't dare serve that to their Yemeni family. I have had many Yemeni dishes, and the tasteless, flavorless plate I received would not reach that status. Yemeni food is one of the best of Arabian cuisines.I hated the food so much THAT I barely ate 4 spoonfuls. I wouldn't suggest going there unless you don't care or don't know better. I'm sure they have some dishes that taste better and cooked right.","The Good: The food is incredible, we had the Lamb Haneeth & the Hafsah and both came with sides, naan, soup, and tea. I am so happy. The wait staff are pleasant.The Bad: Not clear about the fact that we can get our own water in the back for free, never offered us any drinks, so odd.The Ugly: When it's busy, it operates like organized chaos. If I had a larger family, I would be annoyed. But it was just the two of us.CANT WAIT TO COME BACK FOR ALL THE FOOD.","Lamb Fahsa and Foul. They bring you mad bread, the tastiest soup and killer hot sauce.Terrible lighting. It's perfect.","Yemen once was the center of a major civilization. It had trade and culture, consequently great food.  In a thumbnail, Yemeni cuisine can be described as a cross between Middle Eastern / Greek and Indo /Pakistani food.  The food is distinct and delicious.  Their national dish is Roast Lamb called Haneeth. Saltah/Fahsa a root vegetable (plus meat)  stew served in hot stone pot is very popular. Spicy Marg soup/broth is also a very iconic Yemeni starter. The Yemeni ""Biryani"" (rice and meat casserole) called Zorbian  is different from the Indo/Pak Biryani but equally good. Yemen Café  on Atlantic Ave, close to Court Street (by the recently shut down  Barney's) is perhaps the best Yemeni Restaurant outside of Yemen. It has been a local landmark for multiple decades. It was there when the neighborhood was not that hip.   I have never been disappointed with food at Yemen Café. They serve their spicy Marg soup and their oven fresh bread with all meals (just comes without even asking for it).  Almost everything on their meu is good. On every visit I take some food home for the next day","The complimentary marag soup was good. Really good. It all went downhill from there. Salad was bland, nothing special. The hummus was decent, not too much to it, but it was fresh. Their ""world famous lamb haneeth""? Not in this world. Not flavorful, way over-cooked. It really was like eating a soft leather shoe. Not kidding. When you add in the price tag...well, it would do in a Zombie Apocalypse, by other than that, I wouldn't eat it for free.  Being of Middle Eastern origin, I was highly disappointed. Won't be coming back for a meal, but if I'm ever in the area I might get some soup to go.","Paaacked on a Sunday night. Always a good sign. Full of locals who know what they're eating.The lamb was deliciously tender and literally felt right off the bone. The hummus was delicious and authentic, nothing like a Sabra (though Sabra is quite yum). The Kibdah (lamb liver) was only fine; I've had way better, and this one's texture and spice level just felt off.",Yemen Cafe & Restaurant
220,Refused to deliver an order placed with delivery.com.  Very impolite and gave the ridiculous excuse that 8 blocks is too far to deliver.,"Stale bread, pasta which was fine but nothing special, and an ambiance which is also fine but nothing special.

I would not recommend this place but it's also not bad if you're in a bind.","Yelp has rarely let me down, but the rave reviews of this place have got to be a scam.

I don't think you could do worse in nyc for Italian food. $150 bill for 2 and food we could barely bring ourselves to take a second bite of.",Oh my goodness! This was a wonderful first time experience!The gentlemen who served me were fantastic! The stuffed ravioli melted in my mouth and was very light and tasty. The fried zucchini with the pepper was a soulful combination! Excellent. The wine was good and the moonshine was delightful!Thanks for making my first experience one to share with friends. Everything I had tonight was a recommendation and well worth the experience.Dr. Scena,"Giorgio saved the day.   My boss flew in from London and was seeking to have a sit down dinner with his New York team.   He found that getting a 5:30 pm table for a team on short notice was nearly impossible.   I offered to help him find a place for a nice sit down dinner.   Giorgio at Antica was the first person that popped into mind.   In the past, he had provided excellent and professional service when I had taken my family to Antica for a delicious meal.   I had no doubt in my mind that Giorgio's great service and Antica's fine Italian food would be the perfect setting for a business dinner with the boss.   I knew that this evening was in good hands and this event would reflect positively upon my career.I called Giorgio in the late morning of the day when we needed the table.  Giorgio greeted me as if I were a long lost cousin that called him and greeted me warmly.   He quickly and efficiently sized up what was needed and told me he would set up the back room for us so we would have the feeling of a private event.   He told me not to worry about a thing and he would make sure the team would receive exceptional service.Giorgio did not disappoint.   Despite the fact that parts of the team arrived at different times, we were all greeted with a broad smile and a bow.   As we were courteously whisked away to the back room, the evening began with smiles.   The environment was perfect for a business meeting.   Giorgio and the staff were on top of everything.   No glass was left empty;  napkins appeared out of nowhere for people to discretely dispose of their gum; sumptuous food seemed to be provided constantly; and the service never interrupted the discussion.   It was near magical.If you have a business meeting with your team, I highly recommend contacting Giorgio.  You will do your career a favor.","I went to Antica with my girlfriend and her daughter and we were very pleasantly surprised.   Giorgio greeted us at the door as we entered with a kind smile and a gracious bow.  It felt like we were coming to the house of an old friend.  The food was wonderful and reminded me of the fresh Italian dishes that I had when I visited Italy in the past.   The staff is impeccably trained and very attentive to our needs.  They never let our water glasses reach empty and they were always there to pour wine into our glasses as the evening progressed.   Giorgio even helped us customize our dishes with some off menu items to make this a very unique dining experience.      We started the evening with a deliciously made sampling plate of appetizers customized to our liking.   We spent the next few moments commenting to each other how delicious each morsel was and while we wanted more, it was just the right amount to get us ready for our main course.   Our main course was a very light and flaky branzino that just melted in your mouth complemented by a very nice bottle of pino grigio.   Giorgio  carted in the fish, seasonings and a single burner.  Then very skillfully, he skinned, de-boned and cooked it right in front of us right on the plate that was served to us.   My girlfriend and her daughter were delighted by the service.  We spent the evening enjoying the cosy atmosphere and chatting the evening away.   We finished the night off with a glass of grappa made right there in the ristorante and a sumptuous chocolate mud cake with ice cream -- delicious!   It was a perfect evening with superb service.    If you need a place for a special occasion (like Valentines day etc), you can't go wrong by bringing your girlfriend to Antica.",Antica Ristorante
221,"The curly blonde hair , blue eyes manager it's one of the worst women I've ever encountered in my life. Incredibly rude, bad energy, looking for confrontation, not accommodating and just a terrible bitch. Ruined my whole experience at the egg shop.She should be fired!","Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the Egg Shop.Here's what stood out to me: a long wait, no leg room, and pretty average food.Do NOT get their steak and eggs sandwich. Their bread is so hard and chewy that my jaw hurt while eating my food. The steak was also extremely dry and broke into bits in my mouth.They are the Egg Shop but the food doesn't have a whole lot of eggs.The best part of this restaurant might have been the hash browns.","Over rated. I was excited when I found this location had great reviews and was around the corner from my hotel. Ventured out this morning and was glad there was some seating available. We were stoked over the ingredient description and limited menu - we just knew it would hit every foodie spot in me. I got the Chix Sandwich on a biscuit. What I received was a piled-high fried piece of chicken with absolutely no base flavor, bland thick pieces of biscuits and some pickled veggies. The description of this menu item is completely spoiled by the lack of any base flavor. We found the same thing with the steak and egg sandwich. What my wife actually received was a steak and egg hoagie with pickled veggies as well. It had some heat but again, no base flavor. The hashbrown truffle with pecorino was interesting..... again - no base flavor! Adding red flakes to the food cannot mask the fact that it is flavorless. That does not work with foodies. To say this spot was a disappointment is an understatement. Especially after ordering 3 items and paying $53 to include tip. Brutally sad place to eat.","I got a Hot Chix sandwich without egg (not a big fan of egg in most of my foods). The sandwich has a jalapeños, cucumbers, and carrots...if that combo sounds odd, it is but!! It's so good! The cucumbers give the sandwich a fresh kick and the jalapeños add some heat. Chicken is well cooked! Service is great here.","The egg sandwiches are certifiably decent and are worth it if you can snag a seat quickly, especially at the bar. Otherwise, after a long wait, you might find that you'll need to order some sides to satisfying your hangriness, and you might be a tad surprised with sticker shock when the bill comes out. I ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich partly because it didn't have a runny egg by default, and also because of the protein it offered. At $14, it was a tad pricey, but the eggs were scrambled in a nicely thick and fluffy way, and the overall sandwich was a tad bigger than what you'd expect of a solid neighborhood deli here in New York. The brunchkins were also satisfying, but rather petite for the price. I lucked out by scoring a seat quickly at the bar, but otherwise I wouldn't necessarily seek out the Egg Shop from afar if there was a long wait, and especially if I could get a comparable egg sandwich from a quality neighborhood deli for half as much.","I am super torn about Egg Shop for a few reasons - so let me just break it down here:PROS:-The food is excellent, which is why I'm torn. We all really enjoyed everything we got (I got the Hot Chix) which is hot chicken with an egg on top and a bunch of toppings. Flavors were great and super large portions.CONS:-Super small place so we waited about 45 minutes to get a table-Because it's small, it just feels super tight, you can't even go to the bathroom without basically standing on top of someone else's table and it's just awkward, and the bathroom was about the size of an airplane bathroom, ha!-Gratuity is added to all checks at 20% - and as a former server, I don't love this, because I don't feel we got first class service yet we are expected to tip like we did.",Egg Shop
222,"Was very disappointed in the ""renowned"" Junior's cheesecake. I got a slice of plain with strawberry topping. The slice was very dry and mealey. The strawberry topping was good at least. Shame.","NY Cheesecake is a slice of soft pillowy creaminess! I'm not the biggest fan of cheesecake but it really was a good moist piece that I would come back for. There isn't much of a crust though. Not sure if that's the NY style or the style of this restaurant, but I'm a fan of crust on a pie or a cheesecake so the thin layer of crust was a bit sad for me, but overall it was still really good! I opted for strawberry sauce on the side as I wanted to try the cheesecake and how it held up on its own. So damn good!",If you were a real New Yorker you would never eat here. Places for tourist hanging out before a show. Come here for the cheesecake late night .,"Had to drop by and try their cheesecake when I was in NY! We ordered a slice of plain cheesecake which was big enough to be shared with two people. It was delicious! Not too sweet and the bottom of the cheesecake was a pound cake, not graham crackers crust. There was also no line and we were seated right away on a Friday night at about 8pm. Service was fast and our waiter was friendly. We returned two days after at their bakery to buy a whole cheesecake to bring home with us to the west coast. It was a bit pricey, but so worth it.","First of all... 5 stars for the server, Eric G. He was the bomb and went above and beyond to help make our visit nice (thanks for scaring away the pigeon!)3.5 stars for the food. It was just ok.. I've had much better. I ordered chopped liver on rye with a side of fries.. everything needed a ton of salt and was just sort of bland. Portion sizes were good, though. Top shelf LIT was good. Prices are a bit high, but is to be expected in NYC.Nice touches in the bathroom with the Ralph Kramden pic over the toilet. I got a kick out of that.I'm glad that I gave it a try.But, of course.. I'll be back for the cheesecake.","Juniors is so famous for their cheesecake but I believe this place is a tourist trap! Servers are in a hurry to get us out! Like not even 15 mins.Location: It is located in timesquare, near all the broadway shows, so after the show we went here. There is an inside and outside seating.Service: Very poor service. They server was in a hurry to take our orders, we can't even choose yet what we want to order and he stood there. Like he is really in a hurry. He gave us our food and after 15 minutes he is there ask us if we want to take anything home. Like? Seriously? I dont know maybe because I ate fast? But one of my friend has not even eat that much yet. I told this guy to give me a box for my leftovers. And he came back with two boxes, one for me and one for my friend who is still eating her burger!! OMG no! I told him she is still eating. And it is not busy, I understand if there is a line. But there are like 7 empty tables and chairs there. So what's with the hurry?Food: To be honest the food was okay. We all ate burgers here and I think that McDonalds is actually better. The onion rings at the side of the burgers are all flour, I can't see onion rings at all! Lol. For burgers we ordered: Pastrami-Swiss Burger, Steakburger and Cheeseburger.Price rating: 8/10 expensive for not that good burger and service.I will not give this place another chance. Improve your service for the future customers.",Junior's Restaurant & Bakery - 45th St.
223,"Not my first time at a Burger & Lobster but my first time at this location and I can say they ruined my whole experience and I will probably never go to another one. Came here for lunch during my lunch break on a Tuesday, wasnt busy at all. I ordered the lobster combo and it came out luke warm, basically cold (lobster & fries). The only decent thing was the salad and my $14 glass of wine. I addressed this to the bartender (I was sitting at the bar) and he says it's probably because they just had a table of 36 people. He asked me if I wanted him to address the issue to the kitchen and request a new order. Ofcourse I said no cause no body got time for that!!If you want to try Burger & Lobster go to any other location but this one. Highly disappointed.","This is the worst lobster I've had in my life. I got the burger and lobster combo deal, and the steamed lobster tasted like sea water. The texture was gross and chewy, kind of like gum, and most definitely NOT what lobster is supposed to taste like. Avoid at all costs. Very disappointed, especially after so many people recommended it to me. Could not see what the hype is about at all.",Came here for lunch with my husband. We were seated right away ( No reservations ). I ordered the Bryant park punch and it was good. I ordered the burger and it was actually really good. My husband ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and a burger with lobster. He said his lobster Mac and cheese and no taste to it. He said it literally had no taste to it. I couldn't try it because I am allergic but I don't understand how is that ok to serve. We didn't make a fuss about it because it was busy for the waiters. The service was really good. So I would not recommend getting the lobster Mac and cheese.,"Darius is the best! We were SO tired after a show at the nearby theatre and we literally poured ourselves into Burger & Lobster after 11pm. I love seafood and lobster, so when my Yelp app pointed us here, it wasn't a hard decision.We ordered a random assortment of things: oysters, lobster mac and cheese, lobster bites. Our food came out quite fast given how busy it was. Darius was a delight to talk to even though we were exhausted and a bit out of it eating such a late night dinner. He honestly might be the nicest person we met in NYC.Living in Ohio, we don't often run across great seafood places. But here, the seafood was fantastic. The oysters were perfectly briney, the lobster bites melted in your mouth and the mac and cheese was creamy and hit the spot on a late night bite.We also enjoyed the atmosphere (this spot is in some type of refurbished building) with its super high ceilings, huge bay windows and snazzy blue uplighting. I'd recommend this spot to anyone for delicious comfort food that makes you a happy camper!","This place was awesome.  Enjoyed the original lobster roll and the lobster Mac and cheese. Service was on point and timely. We had lunch reservations, but wasn't necessary on a Monday at noon. Location was right off Times Square.",My husband and I visited after hearing about the great food at Burger and Lobster. My husband and I both ordered the burger and lobster combo.The burger was flavorful with all the trimmings! We requested grill lobster. OMG..the food was amazing!!The service was great. Our first visit was on a Friday and we returned on a Sunday ironically we had the same waiter.,Burger & Lobster
224,"So meh. Came for a ladies brunch today and was so disappointed. Two of us had the French roast and the other two the marg pizza. The French toast were the sweetest things I have ever tasted and the pizza, somehow, had no flavor.",This spot is the best bang for your buck! Stopped by here last weekend and managed to get a reservation at the last minute. 2 hours of bottomless brunch for $27?! WHAT A STEAL!This could have been a 5 star review with no doubt but we were seated next to the speakers. There were empty tables of two and we asked to move but we were told those had reservations. (I also had a reservation)The music was so loud I couldn't hear my friend talking across the table. Come for food and drinks but avoid getting near the speakers.,"This place was too lit to quit! We went for Sunday brunch and some mimosas and let me tell ya, we got a whole ass DJ! At first I thought it would be overpriced like most New York restaurants which is fine but then I saw that plate! The omelette came with so many sides it was hard to believe!","Brunch is always a good look! Despite it being packed, you can normally always find a resy the night before using yelp. The drinks flow, the food is great (sidenote: if you're in s group of 5 or more they have a family style menu that includes bottomless for $35!!!), and the vibe is awesome! Food highlights: speck pizza, wings, orecchiette with broccoli rabe and sausage. Dj Carole was spinning the day we went and she killed it, literally everyone was having a great time.","Very cool bar for a nice cocktail.  I noticed some people eating, and it looked good.  Next time I will have to try their food.  The front is your main bar area, with plenty of different types of seats (bar stool, high table, booth).  The back room is a more private area with a DJ, and mini dance floor.NOTE:They have a Co-ed bathroom downstairs that was manned by the towel guy, kinda cool.  Wish the towel guy wasn't there when I went.","So meh. Came for a ladies brunch today and was so disappointed. Two of us had the French toast and the other two had the marg pizza. The French toast was the sweetest things I have ever tasted and the pizza, somehow, had no flavor. I would definitely not go back for the brunch.The bottomless was strong and they did gave us a true two hours - but it did not redeem the food quality. The service great!!! But the food was rough going.",Carroll Place

Hell to the yes!!!I can't wait to come back and try the gumbo.  I hope one day they will add chargrilled oysters!!,"Came here before a comedy show nearby in an extremely hot summer day. Luckily, we didn't have to wait too long!I ordered the fried oyster platter and there was an ABUNDANCE of oysters on the plate. The fries were good and crispy. But the star is the oysters - these were the best fried oysters I've ever had! Perfect batter, perfect cook time. These things were crispity crunchity on the outside and juicy succulent on the inside. I'm salivating thinking about it, tbh.My boyfriend got the fried shrimp plaster - perfectly cooked as well. One of our friends got the gumbo and she's from NOLA and have it two thumbs up, a high praise since she makes gumbo herself on the reg.Definitely want to go back cus now I can't stop thinking about them oysters!!!!","If you are around the area, I HIGHLY recommend coming by and trying this place out! The place itself is really small (it fits maybe 10/14 people at once) but the food was bomb! My boyfriend and I got the following:Half a Dozen of Oysters: the oysters were bigger than average and it was really FRESH! Seafood & Okra Gumbo ($16.00): the portion of this was a bit on the smaller side but the taste was definitely there. There were blue crabs, gulf shrimps, oysters, okra and steamed rice in the gumbo. If you absolutely cannot eat spicy, I would not order this since there is a kick of spice in it. Crawfish Etouffee ($20.00): this was def the most hearty dish of the night! The sauce was cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this! The portion is good too.Barbequed Shrimp ($22.00): It is kind of pricey for 6 shrimps but it is worth it! The shrimps are high and the Worcestershire butter sauce is to die for! It comes with a side of bread for you to dip in the sauce. Must try!When we got the bill, they gave us complimentary cafe du monde panna cotta which was delicious! Besides the food being amazing, the service was great as well. We are definitely coming back to try the other items on their menu!","The restaurant is a very small space so it feels like an intimate setting. It is not a great place for kids or large groups. We came on a hot day and they had the AC blasting so it felt great. The service was good and the waiter was very attentive. I got the half and half. Half fried oyster po boy and half gumbo. I thought the gumbo was a bit too salty but the po boy was delicious! Next time I come I would get a whole po boy. The crawfish also looked very yummy so I would try that next. Their menu is small but I kind of like that as I feel like they would do each item very well. Since the space is small, I would come early or at odd hours as it can get crowded very quickly. I feel like the place can only fit about 15 people max.",Lowerline
226,"This restaurant let me down.  I was so disappointed by this experience that I didn't snap a picture of my meal or of the venue.  The following factors might disappoint you, as well.  First, there were too many flies and gnats in the dining area, which lead me to question the hygiene of the kitchen.  Unfortunately, I couldn't leave as I was in the company of someone who was determined to dine at this cafe. Second, the service was inept.  I had to wait at least ten minutes for a waitress to take my order.  After I received my food, neither the waitress nor the hostess approached my table to gauge if all was well.  When I completed my meal, I had to wait at least fifteen minutes for a waitress to appear, so that I could ask for the check. The unavailability of the waitstaff confounded me as the restaurant was not packed before, during, or after my meal.  Last, I ordered the slow braised lamb shank and it was both bland and dry.  While the meat was tender enough to cut with a fork, the meat was not juicy.  This was very disappointing.  The flies coupled with the negligent customer service and unpalatable beef motivates me to give this establishment a low rating.  I'll never return and I don't recommend this place to anyone else because there are too many better alternatives in the city of New York.","3 stars because of the extremely slow service! We arrived around 2:30 on Labor Day and they sat us in the back. I'm not sure what was going on, but our area got 0 attention from any of the staff. We couldn't even ask them to bring us water or check on our food because no one swung by. When they finally brought over our water, we were able to order, and another 20+ mins of 0 service. I noticed several  other tables waiting awkward amounts of time as well to order or get the check. Food was good though, just really need to step up their customer service.","I was looking forward to The Paris Cafe after Yelping for a place to have dinner near the seaport. Unfortunately, I left disappointed.The restaurant itself is cute. Outdoor seating, a bar, classic Irish fare with a rustic feel. They have daily specials but they were out of the all entrees we picked. The restaurant sold out of all three entrees that we chose. You would think that the staff would be notified in advance so they wouldn't sound so clueless when they came back to our table to tell us to order something else.I ended up ordering the mussels. They were very salty and nothing special. Honestly, I had nothing to rave about.","I got absolutely nothing bad to say about this place. One of the best happy hour in the area. $6 dollars well and wine from 4 to7pm. Tons of food on the menu to choose from to go with your drinks. We ordered the appetizer platter and that thing was huge with spring rolls, cheese sticks, calamari and it was pretty good.  The place is also one of the oldest restaurants in NYC. Inside was cool and cozy. Lots of TV. They have an outdoor area to sit on a nice day. Our waiter, think his name was Sanjay, took good care of us and made sure drinks were flowing the whole night. He even gave us a round of shots on the house at the end. Overall, it was a great time.","I have been a patron for over a decade. Food is consistently excellent.I have never had a long wait for a table. Bar is spacious, and is ornate, so it's always interesting to examine the fine woodworking while you have a drink.","The food here is on point. Didn't take pics but the beet salad, shrimp scampi and cheesecake did not disappoint. Exceptional! The bar was busy when I got there at 7, slowed down as it got later and I got a great shot of it. Definitely recommend.",The Paris Cafe
227,"Heard this was the only Michelin Star restaurant in Queens, decided to give it a try. I'll say it's good but I'm not super duper impressed by it, maybe it's because of the food I ordered and I think food are too sour for me (personal preference, I absolutely hate anything that's sour). I had enchiladas, accidentally ordered another one with chicken in it instead of the mole sauce, too sour (again, personal preference here). If I would have ordered mole sauce I'll probably love it very much. No matter what, still a good place and I will recommend people to come try this place.","I know this place comes with lots of bells and whistles, but I was truly disappointed, unfortunately. Service was below standard and food was simply meh. I had the steak, which was mediocre to say the least. hosts weren't welcoming at all, and we had to wait even though we had a reservation. I had expected better. Will not return.","I know this place comes with lots of bells and whistles, but I was truly disappointed, unfortunately. Service was below standard and food was simply meh. I had expected better. Will not return.","Visited twice in two weeks. Restaurant was pretty empty on a Tuesday at 9 PM, but was busy the next Monday around the same time, though I was seated almost immediately. The staff are friendly and helpful and service is prompt.Overall, the food is excellent. It's not flashy, or even particularly fancy, but it tastes great and there was clearly thought and effort put in. My favorite dish over the two visits was the mole de piaxlta. The meat was tender and very flavorful. I also enjoyed the guacamole. On my second visit I had the chiles nogada, a traditional seasonal specialty. The dish consists of a pablano pepper stuffed with meat and dried fruits topped with a creamy sauce. I found that there wasn't as much meat as I'd have liked, and it was pretty sweet. I'd say it was a good dish but not very amenable to my tastes. The high quality carries through to the drinks and desserts. Both the tres leches and cheese ice cream were excellent; they were also very rich and filling.It tells you a lot that this is the only restaurant I repeated in a few weeks in New York. Apart from being delicious, t food (and ambiance) is comforting, the prices are reasonable, and you'll likely leave with your stomach full. The most important qualities for a restaurant in my book!","When I asked a friend where to brunch in LIC he only told me one place: Casa Enrique. First off the prices are amazing for a Michelin Star. No different than a typical New York restaurant which is pretty cool. We started with the absolutely delicious ceviche which was fresh, light, and well seasoned. I actually had read on their website they had molletes, my absolute favorite breakfast from Mexico that I grew up with my mom making and had looked forward to them all day. Imagine my disappointment to enter and see they had removed them from the menu - could have cried tbh. But, I had the huevos rancheros they were very good. It's rare to find huevos rancheros that are made as I know them to be in Mexico in the United States and these were the closest to them I've had here. They were tasty with a nice little kick. My friend had the mole enchiladas which I tasted and were also delicious. Service was good but disappointing the waitress didn't even know what molletes were even when I showed them to her on the menu. I hope they bring them back!","Casa Enrique is WAS favorite restaurant in NYC. This place changed :( The food is still amazing, but portions SHRUNK and Prices gone up!It's classic dishes served in a first class manner.It's also a short walk to the water front, so you can enjoy a nice walk after a great meal.",Casa Enrique

The mussels were well cooked and everything tastes better in sauce. probably my favorite dish over the fish.EntreeI had the swordfish which was pretty great, the fish was very soft and moist. I typically didnt eat fish because I'm terrified of fish bones but this fish had no bones in them!DessertThe dessert I had was the mint chocolate gateau. I dont like very sweet, heavy desserts so I had a bite of this one and and it was good but I'm not much of a dessert person.",The notion of hospitality is lost on this venue - a shame as the food and setting set it up for success. Won't be going back.,"Stopped by during a Monday night and ordered a steak & frites. It's just mediocre, not bad but definitely not very good. Won't come again as there are many better options.","Been here many times. It became my new goto after some bad experiences with Bacchus. The Chickpea socca is fresh and savory with softness and crispness in all the right places.The creme brulee French toast tastes EXACTLY LIKE CREME BRULEE! How the heck do they do that?The Eggs Benedict are always perfectly poached.And the fries... woohoo.Go, enjoy, bring friends, have a wonderful time.","This is a cute place with nice ambiance but a wee bit cramped so you're quite close to your neighbors.I'm a little torn on the food-- it was a bit heavy for what I was expecting. A lot of heavy sauce, even though the food itself wasn't bad. Depends on what you order of course-- my sister loved her beef tartar which was light and left her a bit hungry while I was uncomfortably stuffed.Waitress wasn't the friendliest which is why this place is still just okay in my book. Wouldn't mind trying it out again in the future, and see if my thoughts on it changes.","Another day, another restaurant week review....The restaurant atmosphere is nice but it is a bit loud. It's a bit cramped (so voices get loud) and they play jazz music on top of that. It was not too loud to hear the other person and tables for more than two seemed to have more space.The service...exceptional... they were very good making sure we had everything we wanted. The only issue was that I eat a late lunch and was not that hungry. They would not let us split the restaurant week 3 courses and I had to order something. I got the soup and both of us ended up eating too much. It's not that big of a deal but was an inconvenience.The food - good but nothing I will be craving but solid good food. Good portions too. We got tghe cauliflower soup, the mussels,  the steak with fries, and the profiter rolls. The steak was a bit salty but good. The best part was the mussels. They were in a mustard sauce but it worked and was good.We went for restaurant week, but they also have a prefix 3 course dinner every Monday.Overall pretty solid place",French Louie
229,Brooo The artichoke dip is to die for. It was hearty and gooey and just the perfect ratio. I think I could eat it once a week. Only wish was pita was flashed grilled or something but whatever.I would also go as far to say the cocktails were very cheap considering it's in Financial District. I would have rate this place closer to one dollar sign than two.,Decent NY happy hour - for some outdoor seating and $6 wine you can't go wrong. You order at the bar and seat yourself. I don't think it is anything to write home about but if you are in the area it is worth the stop for a cheap drink!,Absolutely disappointed. I walked in my n a local night.. thay where rude and the bartender was disappointing. Thay preferred to treat it like their College dorm rather than a professional bar. I was never offered anything special no particular appetizers or their specialty drink for the night. $20 of disappointment.,Came here for happy hour because I was in the area. They have deals on drafts and wine from 4-8pm. There are some seats outside but you have to go inside to order. They also have a full food menu but I did not try anything. The bartender was friendly and the place was pretty empty when I got there around 4:30 but by 6:30 it started to pick up. Great find! Most happy hour places are so insanely crowded it's almost not worth the cheaper drinks. I will definitely be back!,Best drinks best food best ambiance best bartenders best servers never leaving you can't make me go. This is the only / bar restaurant in FiDi I will ever religiously go to. By the way the women servers are absolute fire  (specifically Dina and Ryan... dime pieces)P.S. F the non dog lover who reviewed this place. They are friendly to humans and dogs alike eat a bar of soap thanks,"I've been to Fresh Salt a couple of times in the past,  and when it comes to being in a comfortable environment to catch up with friends, this place does not fail to please. First, finding a venue that has happy hour  isn't so easy in the vicinity, and theirs is quite good.Happy hour specials run from 4 pm to 8 pm and it includes: $6 wine such as Rose, Sauvignon Blanc & Montepulciano as well as $5 draft beer and well drinks.In addition, their craft cocktails normally $12 were $8.There was no table service therefore orders must be placed at the bar for both food and drink---however, food was served to the table once ready.We settled in the back part of the establishment but there were also seats at the bar and when the weather permits--outdoor dining.Their menu in terms of food was simple but diverse: sandwiches, salads, dips for sharing (hummus & artichoke) and additional plates.For drink, I selected Rose while my friends opted for the red. We also ordered food upon which two of my friends chose the meatloaf sandwich while I went with the breaded eggplant sandwich.Most entrees averaged at $12 with some less expensive items.My sandwich was breaded eggplant (assuming it was fried) with mozzarella and pesto on a ciabatta bread.  I chose a salad rather than potato chips to accompany the delicious sandwich.My friends enjoyed their meal very much.Fresh Salt is a cute, homey type of establishment with good choices. Music seemed to be of the 60s genre all evening.This place is an old reliable.",Fresh Salt
230,"The owner or manager (older gentleman with ponytail) ruined my thoughts on this restaurant. I came on a Saturday night at 6pm with two friends. We ordered two cocktails, an appetizer, and 3 dishes. The gentleman came up to our table and asked if we'd like to move to the bar and ""be more comfortable"". When we all looked at each other and deemed we were comfortable at the table, he stormed off, incorrectly stating that ""you didn't even order any food"". The couple next to us commented on his rudeness, so we spoke to them who ALSO had an unsatisfactory exchange with him. When this man came back, he apologized and then told us not to listen to the man next to us. Once the couple left, he came over and apologized again and called the man an asshole. Truly unacceptable by every sense of the word. He comped our two cocktails, but I wish that was enough for me to forget that this human is THE WORST. I will no longer support this establishment.","Walked into this restaurant at 10:01p, the staff did not immediately acknowledge me or the two others in my party and finally after a few awkward minutes a server came over to say they just sat their last table. Confused I said ok and walked out and thought, maybe it was a mistake on the part of Google that the restaurant closed at 11p. I checked the website and they advertise 11p. I would have understood if we walked in at 10:30p or 10:45p but nearly a full hour before is ridiculous. I won't be returning to this restaurant again.",The food is good enough. The staff were the most disappointing as they were rude and unprofessional. A female staff person was heard making a rude comment about us on the way out. The manager didn't seem very responsible from our interactions. Wanted to like this place more. Ah well.,"Fried Artichokes with (pesto?) aioli for an appetizer. YES PLEASE! Grilled Octopus appetizer, perfection. I'd skip the Mariana sauce that is one of the sauces that come with the fried artichokes and get 2 aioli. I've never had nothing but an amazing meal here. Skirt Steak au poivre, like butter, perfectly cooked medium rare. Get the ""frites"" well done and they are French Fry nirvana. Or opt for the mashed potatoes which are creamy heaven. For the Vegetarians out there, whatever ravioli (I've only seen vegetarian ravioli) they have on the menu, do it! Mushroom now but I believe at one point they had butternut squash. Ask for extra sauce on the side, they are sometimes a bit dry for my liking but nothing a request for extra sauce can't remedy. They also have various vegetarian options, hummus, falafel etc. and several salads, all great. The beet appetizer is especially yummy.My only ""complaint"" is like most NYC restaurants the price for wine and cocktails are high so my suggestion is go to WXOU Radio Bar across the street before going to Meme. You can have cocktails there, super cheap with a local spot cool vibe (FYI, it's cash only). Then you can leave to go eat at Mémé and enjoy 1 glass of wine for $15 or other drink without breaking the bank on drinking more than 1 drink which I usually do, I usually have 2 sometimes 3 glasses of wine with with a 3 or 4 course meal. It was interesting because the last time I was there, it was early so it was empty (perfect!) but The Butchers Daughter next door was packed. I thought I'd try going there the next time since I've never been. By the time we left Mémé it was packed, around 7:30, normal dinner time. Another heads up, when Meme gets busy, it's pretty tight since it's not a large spot. You can easily hear the couples sitting on each side of you discussions and bang elbows with them. The service is a bit slower which is to be expected so sometimes you have to go out of your way to get your servers attention. In my experience if I need something and can't get a hold of my server, everyone from the busboy to the manager will willingly help :)Back to the Butchers Daughter. I wanted to check out the reviews and menu and surprisingly neither were impressive. Seems like a bit overrated touristy spot. Happy I read about it first because I would've missed out on another amazing Meme experience!Ps - I went to Meme for brunch once and it was very good but the dinner offerings are much better. Tip : Go earlier that the normal 7-9 dinner rush and try to go during the week. Much less crowded and the food and service is a bit better.",Prices  are a bit high but food doesn't disappoint. We ordered the branzino and the lamb chops - both so delicious. Ordered the hummus as appetizers and it comes with falafel balls which were a nice surprise and equally delicious. I love this place - the outdoor sitting has a very casual feel and the indoor sitting gives you a different atmosphere depending on the hour of the day. Great for a group of friends or even a date.,"Hummus and Falafel was delicious, the falafel was not dry and it's tasty. Chopped Salad was being chopped salad. Branzino was good, a but heavy on the butter or oil whichever they used. Shrimp Risotto was meh, the shrimp was good just the sauce was weird I didn't get it. Outdoor seating perfect for the summer time!",Mémé Mediterranean
231,"Bad service, food is not even good. Took my 2 friends here today because they wanted to try pho, we came in around 3.30pm in a weekday so the place was almost empty that time. They came over to rush us order after like 10 seconds giving us the menus. The pho is not even good, and I am Vietnamese so i m positive. Today is unusually hot for a fall day in New York, but no AC working,or maybe they do have but turned off to save cost, we were all sweating eating pho. The bright side is the portion was big. We all ordered pho, some appts. We hadnt even finished the pho, the middle age woman already dropped the check. I looked around and only saw 4 other guests. For a check of 79 dollars I left 20 dollars tips just because we work in same service industry, we hardly ever given bad tips. But the service is unacceptable during their slow time, cant imagine how they treat guests during peak time. I wont recommend here again.","This is not my first time be here. Just because I missed the pho so I came back. Food is good, the atmosphere is nice. However the female waitres's service was terrible. She did not greeting to most of customer, put put on her poker face all the time. I wanted to have soft drink. So I asked her is the sparkling water unsweetened, she showed her impatience and annoyed face. I think she hates doing her job. In the end, when I left the resultant I saw she would like to come back into the cashier. The aisle side was too narrow to fit two people at the same time. She just bumped and squeezed to get her way. She did it even saying anything. She did not assert to apologize, but at least saying something like watch out ... or anything. I strongly not recommend you go to that restaurant. The artichoke pizza and the food stand next by are also famous and high yelp reviews. You don't need to treat you bad!","Great spot for pho and other Viet snacks.The Bahn mi and fried spring roll are tasty. Cash only so watch out for that.This is my go to Viet/pho spot in the west village, no need to look further.","I think this is one of my favorite Vietnamese spot in Manhattan. Came here for a Tuesday lunch at 1130am with a colleague, and we were looking for something homey but flavorful. The restaurant was actually quite full, but the hostess managed to get us a seat at the bar. We ordered: Saigon shack pho for myself, he ordered a pork vermicelli, and we got a shrimp summer roll which we spit. Total bill came out to be around $33, tip Not included. Pretty good deal I'd say!AMBIANCE:Casual spot since it caters to mostly students and undergrads who study and live around NYU. There are a few tables and a long table at front that can sit eight people give or take.PROS:Flavors are definitely on point here! My pho was so flavorful and the broth you can taste the umami and beefiness, without it tasting too oily or thick. The noodles were boiled to the right softness. I love the variety of meats you get in the pho, including sliced beef eye round, beef tendon balls etc, and they definitely did not skimp on the portions of meat or noodles in the bowl. The pork vermicelli was also super flavorful. Think super greens meet giant chunks of charred pork, which had a sweet honey glaze yet a smokey flavor to it. Definitely taste healthy and the food makes you refreshed after eating it. Also love the summer rolls we got, they were light, big portioned, and paired really well with their house made peanut sauCe.Price wise you can't beat. My Saigon shack pho was slightly pricier at nearly $13 a bowl, but you can get their regular pho bo for less than $10. The vermicelli was around $10.OVERALL:This place is incredible! Some of the best pho in Manhattan, I know I'll be back hungry for more!","Some friends and I came in for an early dinner before class. We were seated right away at the large communal table at the front of the restaurant. We ordered the fried spring rolls to share and then everyone ordered a separate entree. I went with the classic Pho, while my friends got Banh Mi and rice dishes. My Pho was awesome. The size is plentiful for one, the beef was perfect, and the broth had great flavor. They also bring everything on the side, so you can put in as much or as little of the extras (jalapenos, sprouts, etc.) as you like. My friends enjoyed their choices as well, particularly the Banh Mi. The ambiance is cool inside. It's a small spot, so I could see it getting very busy later in the evening. They had the windows open too, so we could enjoy the breeze with our dinner. Waitstaff was nice too. The food came out timely and they came around to check on us frequently enough. Overall, highly recommend this spot if you'e in Greenwhich Village. The food is excellent and the scene is pleasant! They are cash only, but nothing is crazy expensive.","With the exception of a possible wait, I really liked Saigon Shack. We came on a Friday night at 630p, put our name on the list, and got seated after 15 min. It's busy in here and with good reason. The food and vibe is great, and I'd love to come back again for the pho and banh mi.I tried the Bun vermicelli with grilled pork, shrimp, and spring roll plus an app of shrimp summer roll the first visit. The bun with the medley of toppings sounds like alot, but it's a good way to try a little bit of everything, which was my intent. I loved the spring rolls and the shrimp was nicely grilled and seasoned with flavor. The spring rolls are a must try; super crispy throughout. I think these might be the best spring rolls I've had in general. The grilled pork was tasty too, and they put a lot on this dish. Overall, portion was more than sufficient, and there's plenty of vegetables and noodles in ratio to toppings. The summer rolls were delicious as well, and if you want something 'lighter' for an app, these are the way to to. Make sure to add some sriracha to all your dishes if you like that bit of heat.I'll definitely trek back to Saigon Shack. It's totally worth the little wait. It's a quick meal, so a wait shouldn't be as bad as it looks. Their bun vermicelli totally hit the spot for dinner, and I'd love to try their pho and banh mi. Service was also very prompt. Definitely give Saigon Shack a visit if you haven't for some tasty Viet food.",Saigon Shack
232,"Short version: Food is only decent; but the quality of the food and the service are only worth perhaps one third of what they charged.We made a reservation and got in without any wait. They put us at a  very bad table that kept moving up and down. When we asked if there was another table open, it did not upset me that they could not arrange a different table for us, but it was the waitress who gave us an attitude that really threw me off.Anyway, we ordered soup dumplings, lamb kebab, and veal. The food were half-decent. The dumplings were a bit cold and nothing special; and they came halfway through the meal when the entrees were already served, despite them being appetizers. The veal tastes like some market food that I would eat as a take-out in the week, but I would not expect that mediocre quality at a restaurant. I do think the lamb kebab was very tasty and well-seasoned, but the portion size was quite small. They charged $29 for each of the entrees, and $11 for the dumplings. I considered them very much overpriced.What bothered us throughout the whole meal was the attitude of the waitresses. They never checked on us once; instead all they did was coming to our table to take our plates away while there was still food on the plates. In my opinion, this was extremely impolite and unprofessional. They were not rude, but they gave us the impression of trying to get us to leave as soon as possible.Overall, we left this place with a bad impression. Oda House was a much better choice for Geogian food and wine, so I don't think we will ever come back here.","One fine summer evening, I decided to try this neighborhood spot. I had never heard of khinkali before. When I took my first bite, it was so plump and juicy it reminded me of a Doja Cat video.","Our first time ever trying georgian food.The restaurant has a very good ambiance.They have a closed patio which was beautiful.We were a group of 8 and we ordered khachapuri for appetizers and a few entrees.The khachapuri was tasty. The bread compliments the salty cheese well.For our entrees we had the lamb dumplings,lamb stew,cornish hen,chicken shish,lula chicken and lamb kebabs,borscht soup.All of the entrees were tasty except the chicken shish which was a too dry.The bread that came out with a few entrees was probably one of the best breads i had.I would have given 4 stars for the food.But there was some serious problem with the service.Firstly the restaurant was fairly empty  but The food came out very very slowly.The entrees came one every ten minutes or so.So by the time a some people in the group finished their dinner,some of us didn't even get our food.The lady almost forgot to bring out my food and asked for ten more minutes after everyone in my group already finished their food and gave me a salad.Didn't expect this kind of service from this place.","Fantastic Georgian food.  Everything we got was excellent both in taste and presentation.Their wine selection was lovely and the glass we got was superb.Only downside to this place is the price. Youre paying top dollar for manhattan. Hop over to Brooklyn and you can find a bunch of excellent Georgian bakeries serving similar quality food at a fraction the price. But, you wont get the find dining experience or the wine in most of those.","Been there for dinner on a Friday. I was excited about Georgian food as my previous experience(at a different place) was way better. Here are the things I have to say:1. I tasted one piece of cold veal in my hot food.This gave me the feeling that the food was not fresh, but reheateaf. 2. The lamb did not have that ""lamb taste"" that stands out. The potatoes it came with were lukewarm. 3. The waitresses were pretty rude, attempting to quickly take the plate. When we left, they kept checking on us to see whether we handed back the check and we were done ( I was writing this review for them as well) and then they took it like expecting us to leave.4. The food came in a completely unappropriate manner. We ordered 2 entrees and 1 apprtizer. We got first entree, 15 mins later the appetizer and few minutes either the other entrees.5.The food was quite average, amost blunt. I am pretty confident my own cooked meal is way more flavorful than that. Definitely suuuuuper overpriced for the quality. I would say the entree is worth at moooost $15...by no means $29. At that price I am expecting a nice meal and friendly service.Very dissappointed. I would NOT go back there.","Food: not bad, but nothing special neither.  I order cheese stuffed mushrooms, which needed more cheese.  The dumplings that were very dry and chicken kabob and potato that was just nothing out of the ordinary.Place: cute spot with a garden on the back.  Great for a date.Service:  it was good, did not had major issues.I wouldn't go back given that I didn't love the food",Old Tbilisi Garden
233,"Fear of Missing Out, aka FOMO. I felt this for a long, long time passing by Rustic Table on my weekend walks about Hell's Kitchen with friends. We always weaved in and out of the crowds waiting for seats to open up, glancing in to see more people clumped inside by the door, probably more than the number actually seated. For those who discovered joining the waitlist via Yelp, they happily walked up and in. I eventually discovered this when I went for my first time.But even after my friend and I finally made it as diners on a Sunday morning for brunch, I still felt FOMO. FOMO for not understanding what all the rage is about! The portions are tiny, my shakshuka was unremarkably bland with two eggs and a shallow pool of flavorless tomato. The entree came with an arugula salad, and well, it was small too. I came hungry and left hungry. And sad. I might try again someday, but for the price point I'm not sure if it's worth risking another disappointing moment.",Very low key spot that my mum and I had found on our way walking to the vessel. We were promptly seated during lunch time. Amazing food and coffee - lots of options!,"The food quality here was top notch. I ordered the avocado smash which came with this absolutely incredible lemon dressing! Also tried the Nutella classica but way too peanut buttery for me - it also is not as sweet as you would expect. Overall the servings felt small, so if you're a big eater make sure to get something extra. Pros about the place: chic interior, very quick food service (food came within five minutes of ordering). Cons about this place: waited 20 minutes longer than estimated, felt rushed by our server once at the table, no personal space inside (party next to us table touched ours- felt cramped).","In one word: reFRESHingIn a few more words: Take a break from the diners and coffee chains, you won't regret it. Every detail is carefully tended to, from the conversational volume level of the music to the freshness of every ingredient curated into a satisfying meal. If you like tomatoes, get the Shakshuka, and definitely add feta and avocado to make little sandwich pockets with your soft pita. The feta adds just enough saltiness to not need the shaker, and the side salad is just small enough with a gentle addition of vinaigrette. I couldn't stop eating this meal, even though I was getting full. Our daughter ordered the Nutella croissant with a side of fruit, and ate every bite. The Balkan croissant is described by my husband as savory, slightly spicy, and satisfying. I can't say it enough, everything here looks, feels, and tastes freshly and locally made. If your server offers suggestions, take them - especially if it's something you wouldn't normally get. That's what we did, and our only regret is not finding this gem until our last day in NYC.","I came here with my husband for Brunch and it was fully packed. It is a very small restaurant with less than 10 tables, I would say not more than 20 people can dine at the same time. I knew this place dont take reservations so we came little late(around 1pm) but there was still 45 mins wait. They have a yelp check in where you can list your name and then come at time they tell you. We sat outside and waited for 30 mins. I was checking with the staff every 10 mins and finally we got a table after a long wait. We already knew what we have to order as they have their menu displayed at the front, so that dint take time. Our food also came very quickly. We had one shakshuka, one classic nutella croissant and one plate of early lunch. Shakshuka - 4/52 eggs in a tomato sauce with arugula salad and pita bread. It was tasty but nothing special.Early lunch - 4/5Everything on this plate was delicious and it was a very small portion. It came with olive butter and olives.Croissant - 4/5It was stuffed with nutella, penaut butter and bananas. Again, it was nothing special but tasty.I did find this place expensive with the quantity of food we got.It is a cute little place but really small. Food was great, I have had better. But the best thing here for me is their staff which is very friendly and polite.","A tiny cafe It was weekday noon, we need to wait about 20 mins to sit in.Food was amazing, very good spot for light lunch or brunch!",Rustic Table
234,"Not for vegetarians!!There are NO (literally not a single) vegetarian option of ramen here. When I asked my server which ramen contained no meat and minimal spice he replied ""you don't eat meat?"", to which I answered ""no, no meat"". He then asks ""no chicken?"". Again, I say ""no meat"", he says ""no fish?""He then recommended the three vegetarian dishes: kimchi, rice, cabbage. Very annoying. How is it that the ramen cannot be made without meat?","I've been to this place three times, hoping that I'll have a better experience and they fail every time. Some options for lunch menu are good and budget friendly, but the service is really bad. They're slow, grumpy and not very attentive. I really wanted to like this place and come again, but I couldn't.","Place is nice, not pricy, probably good for lunch, meals were ready fast. But nothing special ramen is okay","Awesome ramen, fast service.Came here on a Saturday night and despite the good reviews, we were able to get right in for a table for 2. The service was good (and fast), the ramen was delicious. Cute little spot with a modern vibe that's great for date night or the entire fam.","Last night in NYC and have not made it to ONE. SINGLE. RESTAURANT. with kids in tow. This trip to NYC and our attempt to do a food tour was an EPIC FAIL! But what a way to end our trip with an attempt to have a final meal actually out of my Aunts house.What a relief too! If this place turned out to be horrible, we would have talked junk all the way home. But I should expect nothing less from a place owned and represented by an Iron Chef. And it's Chef Morimoto at that. He was one of my faves on the show.Let's get to it, cause we wanted to try a little bit of everything but well, you know... New York. Our server let us know about the watermelon mojitos that are not yet on the menu. We decided to try. They were.... underwhelming. To me, it was merely watermelon water. Like no alcohol taste. No refreshing citrus taste. Kind of a waste of money. I had to try the salad with the Caesar dressing and it was awesome! For me, the dressing really makes the salad. And this dressing is definitely top 5 of Caesar dressings. I loved the shaved crouton pieces. Gave it the crunchy texture along with the other accoutrements. If I were to order this again, I would ask for extra dressing. I normally don't drown my salad in dressing but that's how good this dressing was. I originally ordered the Tantan while my dude ordered the Gyokutso ramen. Buuuut... after tasting his he was kind enough to switch. He had the better dish. The broth was a peppery flavor. Very verrrry tasty. The noodles were cooked to perfection. The meat was literally falling off the bone. Extremely tender. My only thing is I like a poached egg. I guess that's not traditional when it comes to ramen. Oh well. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal. We do ramen again in NYC, I will definitely come back here.",The best ramen I have ever had! I came here during a particularly sad day and it was just the right comfort food to cheer me up. I also pleasantly found out after I came in that iron chef Morimoto was the chef - though he wasn't there I when I went. We started with the gyoza and boy what a treat! It was cooked to perfection and the ginger scallion sauce on top gave it just the right amount of onion yumminess to set it apart. The tonkotsu ramen was the star. Rich and flavorful with a real pork flavor. I added the Kakuni The waiter did make suggestions on what to add to amp up the flavor even more but I'm afraid I dont remember what they were. Also it's served with chopsticks but don't be afraid to ask for a fork if you are chopstick impaired like me.,Momosan Ramen & Sake
235,"Its price it way beyond its taste. We order pork curry, quail, and beer Lao. I barely found any pork I the pork curry and it cost me $31 dollar. The quail is not shareable at all since it's too small. Beer Lao is awful. Strongly not recommend this place.","This is the first time I had Laotian food. The Pork Belly with Spicy Bang Bang, and Cha Sew banh mi (same pork just in a bun), are delicious!!!! Laotian (or at least Khe Yo's version) is very similar to Vietnamese. So they taste familiar to my palette. We came here for lunch, and the options are far limited compared to dinner menu. Will come back in the evening soon.","I came to this restaurant last night for restaurant week and it resulted in a severe case of food poisoning. It was so extreme I ended up in the emergency room. When I called the restaurant to let them know in a sincere attempt to inform them, the gentleman on the phone accused me of eating something else during the day and gave me the rudest attitude. He spoke down to me as if I had a motive of calling in and informing them. And when I said I was calling in a sincere attempt to let them know this happened, he yelled at me that I'm the only one this has happened to and hung up on me. This is not how any restaurant let alone an expensive restaurant should customers. I had the pork belly, sweet sausage and stick rice, and vanilla pudding for dinner.","Came here for dinner. Found this place from yelp before we went and made reservation online. It was very good service. Not crowded and a very quiet cozy place. Our waitress Sara was very patient with us. We did take a long time to figure what we wanted to order and she stopped by a couple times asking if we had any questions about the menu. She also helped me with the cocktail. I mentioned I like something sweet and she made the Lao Lao on the sweeter side , which I really like!!!We ordered 4 small dishes and they were all great quality! The food came out really fast and in good presentation. The quail was my favorite, a little sweet. The pork belly wrap was also very good, but with a little too much fat... the crunch coconut rice was a new dish to me and it turned out to be good. The papaya salad was spicy, not that spicy as we thought but still spicy!Overall, this is the place I would absolutely recommend! Very different cuisine and very nice service!","Disappointed. First off, I didn't care for the cuisine. Im a pretty adventurous eater and this was my first experience Laotian. May have been what we ordered but dishes were so over spiced you couldn't taste any ingredient. Heavy on the sweet sticky tamarind flavor, and the hot sauce was like fire. Food was so coated with spice. Next, the portions (and prices!) and maybe we just had a very inexperienced waiter. Our waiter told us that the food is served family style and is meant to be shared. We assumed, perhaps wrongly, that this meant the portions would be on the larger size, and items would be served in a way that made it conducive to share. I guess anything is sharable but we all left hungry. Very hungry. We said it was our first time. It would have been helpful if he let us know that we probably didn't have enough food or what is suggested for 4 adults. For 4 of us they brought 1 serving of the sticky rice and we got s funny look when we asked for them to bring a second one. We ordered the jerky - Waiter said it's not dried out. It's dried out.  Heavy coating on it and sesame seeds. We ordered the chicken sausage. Tasty but not much there. Like a small Vienna sausage cut into about 5 slices and some large pieces of lettuce. He told us the quail was the smallest of the small dishes so we ordered 2 since everyone wanted to try it. Quails are tiny to start. Each portion is just half a bird body so little wing, little leg, little back portion. We ordered the lobster noodles - this dish was the tastiest of the bunch and a bit larger than a regular portion but not much lobster or anything else for that matter so $40 for fat noodles, a couple vegetable pieces and a few pieces of mostly lobster shell seems a bit pricey. We debated ordering more food but nobody felt anything we ordered was that great.  We left hungry.",Love the ambiance here! I'm always excited to share this gem with family who are visiting New York or introducing Lao food to friends. This is obviously on the trendy and higher end ($$$) for this type of cuisine (I thankfully grew up eating Lao food everyday). Every drink I had was great! The cocktails had so much flavor. Take a seat at the bar if you're there solo and order some jerky. Perfect for days after work on a random week night. As far as authenticity ... let's just say nothing beats my family's kitchen!Only caveat the portions are small. Go treat yourself or share a meal with friends and family!,Khe-Yo
236,Egads. That. was. horrific. The $48 dollar steak was impossible to cut and harder to chew. i gave up a quarter way in. The potatoes required the same exertion - rock hard and cold! The oysters tasted like they were 2 weeks old. The skillet brownie was a pan full of burnt crumbles that even the ice cream couldn't make palatable. The waiter disappeared for long stretches leaving us sitting with the barely eaten items in front of us. The inedible congealing in their sauces.What a disappointment. I'm marveling at the glowing reviews! Were we at the same place?I was in the restaurant business for years so I usually give a place at least two visits before i cast judgement. Off nights are inevitable at the finest of establishments. But I'd be a fool to return with so many strikes in one meal.,"I have to say I have had only one bad experience and about a hundred good ones at this place. The food, service, drinks, atmosphere are all worth the wait (though I recommend making a reservation). Looking forward to our next visit!","Not really too impressed with this place. Food seemed to be fresh at least, but the flavor was lacking, not sure what all the hype is about. With all the places in NY I'm sure you can find something much better. Not sure if they are trying to cater to the folks in the neighborhood but the menu didnt impress me either. I felt as though I didnt have many options to choose from and the prices were high. Sometimes I just want simple good tasting food.","Every girl in NY has that one girlfriend who decided to live life on high and move to the highline area, never again (or rarely) venturing from west to east. And for meeting that friend, Cookshop has become a common ground - a shop that can, in fact, cook up a delicious array of brunch that never fails to satisfy - and dare I say, a savior to redeem the bonds of friendship that would otherwise be lost by geographical barrier that separates west NY from east NY. I've been to cookshop on multiple occasions and while the time tested menu items remain consistent, note that the sweet items on the brunch menu are constantly changing and vary by the season. Remember that delicious peach French toast on that hot summer day? It's been replaced now by the ode to fall dish - the Dutch baby apple pancakes now. I highly recommend making a reservation at least one week in advance to ensure that you are not left sadly waiting at the front of the Cookshop sipping on your third or fourth glass of mimosa or Bloody Mary, gawking as servers deliver plates after plates of scrumptious brunch offerings to the dissatisfaction of your grumbling stomach and watering mouth. My year round favorites?Pickled Mary - The pickled Mary is, for those who enjoy pickled, tart flavors, an explosion and generous serving of tomato based vinegary flavors inviting you with every distinguished bite. The olive. The celery. The pickled onion. The perfectly saturated pickle.The Burrata - A fresh circle of heaven in cheese filled with cream form, sitting innocently on top a bed of stewed ripe Italian tomatoes, garnished by fresh, large basil leaves, olive oil, and a piece of toasted bread. Ask for more bread! This dish is creamy, tart and blended with Italian spice - a perfect Italian wake up call. Huevos Rancheros - The Star of the show. If you take nothing else away from this review, remember to order this dish. The three eggs are baked to perfection over classic black beans and are melded in harmony with Monterey Jack cheese and ranchero sauce. The lime crime fraiche and pickled jalapeños add that tart balance, which it topped by the crunch of freshly fried tortillas. This dish pairs perfectly with the pickled Mary. Autumn dishes?Skillet-baked Dutch Baby - The macerated apples take you to the crisp autumn apple picking days in New England orchards. While the apples are delicious, the pancake itself was a bit soggy for my taste. It needed to be lighter and perhaps served nearer in time to when it was prepared. I enjoyed the vanilla mint flavors. Cancun Farm Chicken Breast Salad - I enjoyed the burst of autumn flavors in the sweet potato, apples, and pecan. My one issue here was that the chicken was a bit over cooked, however, the pickled-Chile vinaigrette was on point. Summer dishes?Peach French Toast - I miss the summer days when I could enjoy the juicy summer peaches on top the bed of perfectly cooked French toast. Crisp on the outside, moist on the inside, with creamy milk and egg batter soaked throughout. Tip: order any dish that comes with chips. Their homemade chips are to die for. I wish that the French toast and crispy potatoes could be offered consistently. It is a pity that one must wait for the right timing... but I guess it gives a good excuse to revisit. My one minor issue is that the music is way too loud such that I have difficulty enjoying the conversation and feel somewhat hearing impaired afterwards. The service is amazing - very helpful, friendly, and efficient staff. Cookshop Chelsea, I will not stop hopping to you.","I've been twice and enjoyed myself both times. The servers are attentive and it's a really comfortable environment. The burger was very typical, but the overnight oats were great. One thing they could work on is expanding their coffee options. It can get really busy, but you can easily book a reservation on Open Table. There is outdoor seating, which you may have to wait a little more for, but it's worth it during the summer.","Came here for dinner on a Saturday, and really enjoyed our meal!We had ordered the deviled eggs, the pork chop and sea scallops and everything was cooked to perfection. The pork chop was tender and was flavorful, while the sea scallops was super fresh! It was really delicious and I can see why there's so many raves about it.I highly recommend trying this restaurant!",Cookshop
237,"First of all let's be clear. The food is very good . So my review goes to the staff, more specifically to the man in the register. This its not my first time in this restaurant. I've eaten here about 3 times. But this time wes the last time for me. Im in mid fifties. And I don't have more patience for rude people. I came from a French immigrants family raised in Argentina and nowI live in Florida. Every time I travel to NY I go to this petite French restaurant. I been with my wife and my 2 daughters (14 & 16 now) and alone. I don't speak flawlessly English and French but I learned at school so i can communicate with others. I travel many many times to Paris and Courchevel and with my basic french language i can order food and take taxis and they understand me. But this French guy needs an update on manners. In the 80's french attitude was worldwide known, that they don't like to talk with someone that they don't speak like a French. But now, not any more, French people are very kind.Our last trip to Paris (12/18) we been in many restaurants, were the staff were super kind even with my basic skills of communication.So sir , I don't care if you are having a bad day or you still living in the 80's in Paris, you are in NY now. I highly recommend you say hi with a smile and don't correct people when they don't speak like a french, because I heard you, you also didn't speak well English. We both need to learn. Salute mon ami","Overhyped and the seafood is not fresh. Perhaps we dined on a bad night, but we know we would not come here again nor recommend it to friends. My boyfriend and I came for our Friday date night, and we were so excited about our dinner after reading fantastic reviews and having craved French food for awhile. We ordered the filet mignon carpaccio and beet salad to begin with. Both were very good, which then made us more excited for our entrees - mussels and seared cod (special). When our entrees arrived, I immediately smelled Indian curry. I told my boyfriend and he thought it to be strange, too. I assured him that it was coming from someone else's dish. But sure enough, the smell was coming from the mussels. When he took his first bite, I could tell from his facial expression that something was wrong. He gave me one to try, and I almost spit it out. It tasted like the Indian curry smell (not that I don't like Indian curry, but it was like a rotten Indian curry smell). I then took a bite of the calamari that came with my cod. It was absolutely disgusting. I got very bad food poisoning from calamari in Cuba last summer, and this calamari tasted exactly like the one that made me sick. Then, I took a bite of the cod hoping it was tasty. It was also disgusting. It didn't taste fresh, and it had no flavor. We slowly ate our entree not wanting to waste the food, but it was difficult. The food was not edible and I feared getting a stomach flu. I insisted my boyfriend to tell the waiter. He's not the type to vocalize to waiters if something is off, but I think rotten seafood is absolutely not acceptable especially since his mussels smelled like Indian curry. We quietly told our waitress and her first reaction was ""SERIOUSLY??!!"" She seemed a bit pissed and like she didn't believe us and went onto say how the mussels are sourced every morning etc. We saw her go to the kitchen and talk to one of the cooks, who then looked over in our direction. The waitress returned and apologized and took away the plates. She asked us if we wanted to order another entree. We refused and asked for the check. She came back and gave us the dessert menu. We just wanted to leave, but she insisted that we order a dessert on the house. We ordered the creme brûlée, which was impressive. But we still would not come back to this restaurant. They did take the mussels off the bill, though, which was nice but the meal still ended up being $113 plus tip.","Great food, mediocre staff.  A really​ snotty woman who was our server for lunch rushed us to order before the lunch kitchen closed.  Lunch kitchen was not scheduled to close for another 35 minutes.  She was so rude to our French-speaking​ 8-year-old​ that I spoke up on behalf of our daughter who was on the verge of tears.  It was unacceptable!We were one of 3 tables for lunch, so it is not like they were slammed.  Her behavior was beyond rude and despite being a repeat customer, I will be finding a new lunch spot.  We later watched her sit down and enjoy her lunch and it appears that was the real rush, not the kitchen.  There are so many other good spots in the area, no need to put up with the poor service that accompanies your meal here.  We will not be returning.","Had a great time here on a Sunday night. This place is a hidden gem with amazing food!!We had the escargots, the mussels, and the duck confit. Everything was just spectacular! All the food was delicious. I would definitely come here again. It's a very cozy French place with a great ambiance. You can share a bottle of Bordeaux and enjoy the delicious food here.","A great authentic hidden gem. escargot was delicious and mussels were tasty. Nice and intimate setting, great for conversation and fine bites.","Delicious food and great service. 5 stars especially for the outdoor sitting that was big enough to accommodate 5 of us and my dog. Came here on Memorial Day, but they had lunch menu, no brunch since it was a Monday.  I got the steak frites. Was a good portion of food and the red wine thyme sauce was yummy. My friends got the spinach egg white omelette, and another friend got the grilled steak sandwich. They all liked their food. Our entrees all had fries, crispy. Our waitress was nice and attentive. They also have a great selection of wine.",Le Parisien
238,"Late lunch on a humid August Tuesday afternoon and oddly this business appears empty with only three patrons in the house (including myself).  Relief with food and air conditioning cool environment away from humidity was a phlegmatic disposition.  I was able to attain a table by the window without issues of a single girl dinning alone.  Again, the loneliness never bothered me anyway.  My server Sergio is attentive, ready, willing and able who served me well.  Business cards are available for grabs.  Rustic countryside atmosphere with exposed red bricks and cute wall shelves containing bric-a-bracs and nick nacks.  The decorum of wall shelves bric-a-bracs and nick nacks fends a home feel rather a restaurant.Hanger Steak Frites $20Grilled 8 oz. hanger steak, baby greens salad and French friesMy steak was unfortunately overcooked excessively dry and served without the standard Bearnaise or Hollandaise sauce accompanied.  The meat is trimmed and served in pieces in authentic Parisian form rather one whole large slab of meat which I whole heartily enamored with the served cut appearance.  Unfortunately, the meat was slightly harden since it was dry making it difficult to intake.  I believe the overcooking squeezed out all the meat's natural juices making it excessively dry and become hard.  I was hoping for either Bearnaise or Hollandaise sauce to be provided accompanied as the standard French entree.  I have previously traveled to Paris, France and experienced the immense joy of authentic Hanger Steak Frites and no stranger to what this entree entails.  The baby green salad contained insufficient dressing.  As I work my way further into the salad there were no dressing at all embedded and it was difficult to intake.  The portion is good for this entree as there were no shortage.  Nevertheless, I was exhausted from walking earlier that hunger pangs strike as the passage of time was 3 pm.  I departed dispirited and utter dismayed.  The French fries was the only good item of this entree that was not overcooked and yes, ketchup was provided.Cabernet Blend, California $10Good body and it was a good blend of ""Bordeaux blend"" of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet franc of reds.  I actually like this wine and was paired well with my steak.Note: The only form of credit card not accepted is Discover.",Overly hyped up. The food was pretty bad and minimal breakfast options. Ambiance is nothing special. I had the Crab Cakes Benedict and couldn't even finish one - not appetizing. They charge extra for every small thing and didn't even have avocados! Pretty surprising. Service was cold and not welcoming.,"When I have a certain food in mind it's hard for me to want anything else. Oysters weren't on the menu so I settled for mussels. I hate mussels so that probably wasn't the smartest of decisions but ya know you only live once! Anyway, here come my mussels and homemade fries... I ate every single bite. It was incredible. My dinner guests were equally impressed with their salads. My drink was always full. No complaints! Check it out for yourself and order the mussels!","Go! It's SO delicious and the service is fantastic.I went here with a friend and my infant daughter. He picked the place (I was treating him as a thank you for dog-sitting) and I had no idea what we were walking into. It's very cute inside - lovely ambiance without being pretentious. It feels like a secret neighborhood gem even though it's on 3rd Ave.Shrimp toast with pesto starter was way better than I could have anticipated (friend's order) and our entrees - his the Beef Bourguignon and mine the Salmon - were outstanding. The beef was tender and the reduction was just right in consistency and richness. I am a chef, classically trained in French technique, so I have pretty particular tastes. Everything was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. Even the mashed potatoes and zucchini that accompanied the salmon were impressive - not an afterthought like lots of sides can be. The bartender and servers were excellent, especially when my daughter was having a meltdown and needed to go outside.Needless to say, I will be returning sans bebe to enjoy a fully adult meal with dessert! Thanks Bluebell for exceeding expectations!","I LOVE THIS PLACE! When you walk in, it had such a homey vibe and made me feel right at home. The servers were very attentive and gave good recommendations. My favorites on the menu is the Ahi Tuna Sandwich, Salmon burger and the Pappardelle pasta with Ragout - they are amazing! I've been looking for a place that serves ahh tuna, and I can say that bluebell filled my ahi tuna void. Would love to come back again to try their brunch menu!!","I don't think the concept of a ""Goldilocks Zone"" is a thing for restaurant customers, though I'm sure we all have our own idea of what's just right. Bluebell Cafe would be in my zone. It's not too fancy, not too basic, eclectic enough without being predictable, etc., etc.,, etc..  We had a minimal wait for a table for Sunday brunch, and the hostess was nice enough to inform us in advance of which table we'd be getting and how quickly it would be ready. The Benedicts are a nice option here, including traditional, smoked salmon, and crabcake-style, which is what I decided to get. The Hollandaise sauce was just a bit deeper and darker in color than I expected, but it was nice to have really well poached eggs. The potatoes were interesting too, not quite home-fries, not quite hash browns. If I had to describe them, it would be (:geek. Large Catan Road Marker Size :egeek.), nicely crisped with chunks of onion and red pepper. I also recommend a fruit bowl as a side, a large bowl of fresh melon, grapes, pineapples, etc. The coffee was average but also hot and refilled frequently, and service was very good. All in all, it was a very enjoyable experience, and - need I say it? - just right.",The Bluebell Cafe
239,"Maybe this was me and my wife's favorite Pho in the tri-state area.Definitely a but overpriced compared to Chinatown Pho places, but the neighborhood that they are in (south Williamsburg) makes it understandable.Worth checking out just for their Pho!",Some of the most authentic Viet dishes u could find in New York. This is Hũ Tíu Gõ. The flavor is on point. Made me miss home so much.,"Definitely americanized Vietnamese cuisine cater more toward Westerners. This doesn't mean the food is bad in anyways, they are still okay, just does not taste as flavorful and some dishes are just really 'bland' and average. Read the two asian ladies reviews above, notice all the high rating are of mostly non-asian/ non-vietnamese. Extremely overprice for the portion and quality. $16 for a bowl of Hue Beef noodle is possibly the highest I've paid in my entire life anywhere. Then they want to charge extra just to have the spicy chili oil thats supposed to come with this dish, with out this chili, this dish isnt a complete dish in vietnamese cuisine standard, They are only able to do this here because, once again this is caters to westerners. Imagine charging extra for mustard when you buy hot dogs, or ketchup when you buy fries. When we come in, we were the only asian peopleIn this restaurant and felt like we were being treated differently right away. Instead of leading us to the table, the server just point to the table in the corner. Usually, I don't mind these kind of etiquette in restaurants but if you're going to charge premium price for typical foods, at least I expect a little more customer - experience oriented service. We ordered the tamarind chicken wings, grill pork rice dish and bun bo hue. 5 mins later the server came out and said they no longer have any of the chicken wings. We ordered something else instead. Around 10-15 minutes later, 2 westerners guests entered and ordered the same chicken wings we tried to order earlier. Notice that this is when our food still hasn't come out yet. We didn't say anything right away just to see if the chicken wings actually come out and you guessed it, they have the chicken wings!! When I asked for the check, I politely ask the server how come she said they don't have the chickens wing, she said, oh because they were out of the sauce, and that they have made the sauce again now... and she then ask me if I want the chicken wings now, after I asked for the check...","Fantastic Pho, Great Spring Rolls & Watercress Salad.The Bun Bo Hue and Chicken Pho broth were both delicious and sweet.  The Bun Bo Hue was my favorite of the two due to the complexities of broth flavor.  With thin slices of beef shank and bologna topped with scallions, onions, bean sprouts, cilantro, and mint, everything was fresh and vibrant.  The Grilled Chicken over rice is a keeper.  Tender moist thigh meat sliced and layered over seasoned rice.  There is also an option for rice noodles in case you don't want rice.The Roll Platter included two each of three different rolls.  A fried Spring Roll, a Summer Roll and a Rice noodleSheet wrapped with beef.  The fried Spring Roll was definitely very good with a strong porky flavor.  The summer roll was ok as was the rice noodle beef.Tamarind Wings were ok but the plate was limited to two wings and two drumettes.  That's a little pricey for 10 bucks to be honest.  Even so they were very good options for appetizers.The menu will vary, on a recent visit the menu did change but the quality of the food didn't.  The pho options were slightly different but still very tasty.  It's a small restaurant with 7 Table tops, a picnic table, and a bar, not really a place for a super large group.  There's a slight discount for cash and the staff are friendly.","I've been dying to come here for so long, and it definitely hit ever spot I was craving for this! We came on a Sunday early afternoon, and there weren't many people in there. This is great, because we sat down right away :) rather then waiting an hour+ for a table, especially in that area. They have season menus, btw! We wanted to try their spring rolls but unfortunately it is on their regular lunch menu during the week, and not on their summer brunch menu. Confusing, but I guess we just need to come back! We ordered their grilled rice paper, which was delicious! It's cool too, because they offer scissors to cut rather then ripping with your hands. Light, crispy and good. My sister go their beef Pho, which was packed with beef and I got their street pork noodle soup which was SOOO flavorful, wow. Both soup portions were a great size, the perfect size to fill you up but won't leave you hungry or won't leave you feel bloated and stuff. Their presentation is cute too. We ordered a Vietnamese coffee, super strong and it almost tasted like candy.Their staff was super friendly, and the ambiance/ vibe is cool. Their pricing is pricer then your typical whole in the wall Vietnamese place in Queens, but what do you expect. We're in Brooklyn and it's more of a restaurant. I'm use to spending $8 on a bowl or soup and I spent $15 on mine here. If you're in the area, or a huge fan of Vietnamese food, i suggest checking this place out.",Overall experience is good. The pho I found out the sweeter it is the more south it's from. For me sweets is not for me. But the rest of the food is good. When I came the head chef was away. Will come back to try the food again.,High Lúa Vietnamese Kitchen
240,"Came here for Sunday brunch with some friends.  All three of us got the eggs Benedict and while the food came out very quickly, it did not taste fresh. The bread which they used was hard and tasted stale. The sausage was room temperature. This is usually one of my favorite spaces because of the ambience and space, but I was disappointed in the food since it is on the pricey side and I expected more.","Quite disappointed with the food at this location. Service was great, but the food was subpar. Came on a Saturday for lunch around 3pm and was seated quickly. My favorite item on the menu is The Smith burger and I had bought my SO to try for his own. However, The Smith burger at this location was subpar. From what I remember, The Smith burger was supposed to be the perfect combination of tanginess from the TSB sauce and kick from the pickles coupled with the saltiness from the white cheddar and the crunchiness of the crispy onions without overpowering the beef taste of the burger patty. In spite of that, this burger was disappointing. The batter on the onions was incredibly thick that it was hard and inedible. It felt as if the onions had been fried beforehand (perhaps in a large batch) and had been reheated when placed on my burger. My SO fries were also disappointing. It was not crispy at all and kind of sad looking. Service was great. The waitress was friendly and attentive. All in all, I probably will not be returning to this location.","I don't know what happened to this place, I've always been impressed with the brunches at the Lincoln Square location.  Had the grilled chicken sandwich here for lunch and it was really insulting.  I mean the chicken was tiny and overcooked with nothing else inside the sandwich aside from sauce.  Did they think they could really charge $18 for basically bun with a few bites of chicken?  C'mon people.  I should've photographed this but I was too put off by the whole situation.","This place has OUTSTANDING food.  The prices are steep, so just be prepared.  I had the fish tacos and they were $29, just to give you an idea of what I mean by ""steep.""  But you get what you pay for, friends.  We were a party of four and we went all around the menu.  Appetizers like the blue cheese chips and the burrata were out of this WORLD.  The tacos were perfectly prepared and presented beautifully.  Dessert was outstanding.  Our server (wish I could remember her name) suggested sticky toffee pudding and I will be forever grateful.Excellent service, outstanding recommendations, and a wonderful dining experience.  Bring your credit card and leave plenty of room on it for the evening of fine dining at THE SMITH.","The Smith is one of my favorite sit down lunch spots in the Flatiron area. The decor and ambiance is super cute and cozy, and it's a great spot to go with a group ranging from one other person to a large group. I've had breakfast here before and the French toast is fabulous, and the oatmeal was good (I was trying to be healthy but couldn't resist the French toast for the table). When I come for lunch and am feeling healthy and low carb I really enjoy their kale salad. The chicken and burrata sandwich is also delicious, and what I usually get when I order what I actually want to eat. Have also had the fish sandwich (tasty), fried okra (very tasty), and brussel sprouts (tasty). Pricing is pretty standard New York - not cheap, but not out of the range of everywhere else.","This is my favorite Smith location. However, I had pretty bad service when I came on Saturday. Our waiter never came back to check on us and was dismissive when we had to wave him down to ask for drink refills. Despite the poor service this weekend, I still love The Smith. You really can't go wrong with their menu. Some of my favorite menu items:- Mac and Cheese- Spicy Salmon Tartare- The Smith Burger - Caesar Salad - BLT + E- Ricotta Gnocchi",The Smith
241,Good food but horrible service.. this new server taking orders and all over the place then come another server and she is as horrible as the the first guy..I like the food and the environment except horrible service..,"CHEESE. BOAT. My husband and I visited for lunch and were excited to experience a bread boat filled with cheese. Said cheeseboat met all expectations and was delicious. However...we overestimated how hungry we were and also ordered a side of fries. We assumed they would be New York-sized. They were not. That basket could've easily fed four people. We did our best to finish our food but failed miserably. Then we mistakenly walked around Brooklyn for the rest of the day. It wasn't the best start. I'd suggest visiting Cheeseboat before a casual night in, perhaps wearing sweatpants.","Prosciutto Cheese Boat was ok, definetily wasn't the best. The taste got tiring and honestly soooo much money for something that tasted just ""ok"". Wouldn't really go back.","Oh wow.  If you love melted cheesy goodness and Eastern Europe like I do, this is the spot for you. Dishes and wine from Georgia.  Came in around 1pm on a Saturday, seating for 5 was easy. Decent size seating area with bar in the back left corner. If all the tables are full, it could be kinda tight at the tables. Front windows open fully and some sidewalk seating. I enjoyed the red wine we had with lunch, but for others it was a bit too sweet- the blackberry note.  Three of us shared a Cheeseboat- a boat made of bread filled with gooey hot melted mozzarella and feta, then topped a with butter and an egg. It was like an open faced epic grilled cheese.  I was in heaven!! The Kundari- cheese-less meat pie was unexpectedly huge, the size of a medium pizza. Flaky layers of pastry with a thin purée layer of meat and spices. Service was great. Table just a little sticky.","Had a reservation for 6 , at 8:45 . When we arrived the table was not ready .   Mushroom dumplings were gross , hope I won't get food poisoning.  Also had khinkali with beef , if you now how the real Georgian food taste like , you will be disappointed. Wine was ok , but the quality and price just don't match .  The worst thing , we had to leave in an hour and half , cause nobody told that restaurant closes at 10 .","Beware! They have changed their brunch menu as of one week ago and not updated it online. A group of friends and I came, eager to try the various different cheeseboats only to find that their menu had drastically changed and they no longer serve cheeseboats until after 4 PM. This change with lack of update onto their website is the primary reason to knock their stars down. There was very little flexibility in accommodating to us based on our disappointment and expectations except that they could make the regular cheeseboat. Some of us got the regular cheeseboat which was very delicious and freshly made. Others tried the pumpkin French toast and pear salad, which were also good.",Cheeseboat
242,"Summary:This place hits the spot for a Vietnamese craving but it is not all that great or spectacular. By California standards, it's pretty bad, but given the more limited choices in New York, it's a good option.Food:I had both the egg rolls and the banh xeo. The egg rolls were done well, and were pretty crispy, but their fillings were just okay, not too amazing. It came with the expected herbs and veggies.The banh xeo was disappointing. By the time I had received it, it had gotten mostly mushy and wasn't all that great anymore. I expect it to be mostly crispy on the outside, but this place just didn't make it up to par. They did give a bunch of vegetables, though it was oddly heavy on lettuce and cucumbers.Service:A little slow, especially at lunch time when there are a bunch of people coming in for work lunch.","I think the value of the food is reasonable and consistent. However, I've dined alone here a couple times and the wait staff are overbearing and probably overworked. I dine alone all the time and I don't take a table if it can be helped. I'd rather do takeaway than eat around an anxious vibe. I'd add another star if not for the uncomfortableness of the environment.","3.5 stars Cute spot, got a lot of press/media coverage the last 2 years! I saw their photos on Instagram so I came in.They won't serve rib for lunch unless you pay for dinner portion! Which is horrendous to see that how much food I left behind. It sucks that they charge $18 for a bowl of Pho that feed 2 people and I can't order less than that  portion. So much left over, food gone wasted which I personally hate it. A LOT of meat, too much that it turns me off! SEE MY PHOTOS. I wish they offer smaller size as lunch menu, and charge the rib on the side! The broth was sweet, sugar in the broth, Southern style Pho. Bò Bía was $9 it's a hard blow for me! It's ok, tiny roll, with dipping sauce in side. Service was efficient on the lunch time I visited. Will need to come back to try other dishes and update my review!","Came here on a weekend noon for lunch around 1:30 pm, got a table in 10 minutes. For drinks, we got fresh coconut and lichi juice. The coconut was noticeably fresh and a spoon was provided to scoop inside, I highly recommend it. The lichi juice was refreshing as well but relatively light and not as flavorful compared to the coconut. we got the fried rice cake, vermicelli bowl and the madame pho with short rib. And yes, it was a huge bowl of pho with a huge rib. As much as I enjoy the rib, it was too greasy and I hope they can chop off the fat and grill it first. Otherwise, it's your classic Vietnamese pho we all know and love. I also loved the fried rice cake with egg and pork sausage. The egg itself was a bit too light but went great with the sausage. However, the whole dish was a little dry and you will need a drink to accompany it.The only real complaint is the ""cancelation fee of $25 per guest"", which is rarely seen for a restaurant at this price range. The waitresses were all very nice, and I believe the food was about fairly priced. I also notice that there is a vibe around this name, but I'm not sure if it lived up to that.food 4/5service 4/5ambiance NAvalue 4/5","I've been here twice. Once was about half a year after they first opened for lunch and the second time was recently for dinner. I guess this place is best known for their +rib for the pho, but the pho is its foundation, right? So that first time at tried them, I thought, I can see why people like this place. The broth was flavorful and not too heavy while the noodles were cooked just right. They also paid attention to presentation. On my most recent visit, I ordered the Madam Vo and it was just ok. It wasn't as good as I remembered it. The order came out surprisingly quick and the soup was oily and heavy. The flavor was just different. Maybe it because we came for dinner on a Friday night and it was busy. I think that there should be a consistency in quality regardless of popularity or what not. I don't see myself coming back anytime soon because there are better pho places around.","Had a pretty awesome meal here! Honestly, order the other dishes besides the Madame Pho. Or get that out of your system once & go back to try the other plates because those were actually my favorites. Service was very friendly & ambiance was lively, but a bit darker than I liked. Make a reservation if you don't want to wait! Goi Cuon - Summer Rolls with Shrimp, Rice Vermicelli, Lettuce, and Mint served with Peanut Dipping SauceOkay, I'm a summer roll fanatic, so ordering this was a must & I loved every bite! Literally thought I could order another just for myself. Cha Gio - Fried Spring Rolls Filled with Shrimp, Crab, & PorkIf you get summer rolls, you need fried spring rolls. It was pretty solid, but still would prefer the summer rolls :) Madame Wings - Spicy Chicken Wings Caramelized in a Garlic Fish SauceI LOVED these wings & the sauce was awesome sauce! I felt like I was drooling every time I bit into it.Suon Kho - Carmelized Spare Ribs Braised in Coconut Juice & Pineapple served with a Side of RiceThis dish was incredibly flavorful with the coconut juice & the pineapples were a refreshing sweet touch! Cleaned the rice because it was so yummy!The Madame Pho - Beef Broth Simmered for 24 Hours with Rice Noodles, Angust Certified Brisket, Eye Roung, and Meatballs topped with Cilantro & ScallionsOkay, at least one person from your group will order this because it's the Madame Pho from Madame Vo. The broth does seem hearty, but I also feel like you really have to want to believe it to really tell the difference between a bowl of regular pho. That being said, it definitely satisfies your pho cravings & it's super filling.Bun Bo Hue - Spicy Lemongrass Broth served with Vermicelli Noodles, Brisket, and Vietnamese Pork RollI actually thought this bowl was more flavorful than the Madame Pho - really wanted to finish all the soup but my pants would've lost a button. So delicious!",Madame Vo
243,"Terrible ramen. The soup broth is too salty. Dry noodles come with smell of ammonia! I've tried a lot of ramen shops in the NYC, and unfortunately this is the worst one I've ever had.The check-out experience was negative, too. I was told by the waitress that the add-on is $2 (it's $2 on the menu, too), and it turned out to be $2.50 on my receipt. The cashier told me that they recently changed the price...Will NEVER come back.","Ramen immediately after a Broadway production of ""Wicked.""This ramen business has been on my Yelp bookmark ""to try"" list for a very long time and I decided to give it the o' college try after reading all the high praise reviews.  I became another victim of an open mind and was lured into ' ""Will you walk into my parlour?' said the Spider to the Fly"" by Mary Howitt.  The bowl is gargantuan for depth but the actual ingredients are small.  The noodles is significantly smaller portion size very minimal for a $16 price furthermore, there is no soft boiled egg included like most ramen businesses but must be requested at a additional add-on charge.  I ordered the Akamaru Shinaji $16 ramen which was average and nothing beyond extraordinary.  The ""Umami Dama"" paste was not impressive to me.  The broth was nice.  It does contain immense flavor without MSG and within mere minutes I engulf the entire thing but, unfortunately, did not eat my fill.  Ippudo's ramens does not quell starvation as I was still hungry afterwards.  For a price of $16 I felt was the illusion of less food in a gargantuan bowl.  As per their ramen menu there are only four (4) measy limited options for ramen:  Shiromaru Motoaji, Akamaru Shinaji, Karaka Spicy, and Ichiraku all priced $16.  Consuming Chinese hand-pulled noodle soup surely eats my fill, but not Ippudo's ramen.Customer service is attentive acknowledging it was a summer heat wave day and high relative humidity index the staff offered ice cold water to patrons upon being seated.  I arrived for a very late lunch of 4:20 pm on a Saturday afternoon and there was no wait.  Sitting at the bar counter was a simple request that has been granted for one person without issues and without waiting.  Are you a freak like me who frequently dines alone?  The loneliness never bothered me anyway.  Business cards are available for grabs.  This business is easily accessible by C or E train at West 50th Street within walking distance to West 51st Street intersecting 8th Avenue and 9th Avenues.  I departed dispirited and utter dismayed.","After loving this place for several years, I'm sad to say that I'm really disappointed in the food/service/ wait, in comparison to previous years' visits. I doubt I'll resume attempting coming here, with all the other food options in the vicinity, or ramen options elsewhere...It's not 'bad'- I just remember it being much tastier and a better/less stressful/irritating experience overall, than my recent visits. Host was oddly brusque, service was very harried/non existent to get closing duties finished (was seated hour prior to closing); food came out lukewarm, so disappointing...","Ippudo is my favorite ramen in the city. Always fresh, great portion size, great atmosphere, but most of all, delicious!A little lighter and less hearty than something like Totto or E.A.K but more flavorful, in my humble opinion.","As much as I loved the vibe and the presentation, I wasn't a huge fan of the ramen itself. Overall, it was a fine experience but I will be curious to compare the ramen at the other location next time.BAO BUNS (5/5): This was my first time trying bao bun sandwiches, and I was blown away. We went with a vegetarian and meat option to try both ends of the spectrum. The grilled eggplant and mushroom and the fried/glazed chicken were phenomenal, flavorful, and reminiscent of eating clouds with meaty insides. This is where my love for bao buns blossomed. AKARA VEGETARIAN RAMEN (3/5): Pretty...bland. I've had more savory vegetarian and vegan ramen meals at so many other places. The noodles weren't tender...the broth wasn't anything special...even the sauce and the other ingredients did nothing. Kind of disappointing.Because I've heard amazing reviews about Ippudo in general, I'm determined to give it another try and visit the other location for an authentic experience.","Westside! I am so glad we were able to pay Ippudo a visit while we were on vacation. This ambiance just screams legit ramen shop when you walk in. Friendly hostess and services greeting you. Another spot not too far from Times Squares so definitely a good spot to visit while in NYC. As for the food, the most important part of a reviews. The ramen is legit! The pork bun is legit! Both are awesome options! I ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic and pork buns! So much to be excited about! The pork buns were so savory and so good! The broth in the ramen was great. Looks great and tastes great. For me Ippudo Westside lives up to the hype! Thank you!",Ippudo Westside
244,fell in love with this restaurant 2 years ago.Today I was craving sancocho. So I call & ask if they are serving it today I was told yes.. so now here I am starving been working since 6am wait at the restaurant for my sancocho walk back to work & I'm surprised & disgusted! The sancocho had no flavor & the chicken was tough & no color to it! I honestly feel that they threw everything together in a pot warmed it up & gave it to me!! I threw out the chicken ate only the root vegetables & broth what a disappointment! Never ever will I eat here  again! I should've had pho instead of this amateur sancocho!!!,Two words:Coconut caipirinha!Which is probably one of the best drinks I ever had in my entire life. It's soooooo good. They had a bomb ass ceviche which unfortunately has been taken off of the menu. Bummer! Please put it back.Otherwise I don't really order food from Bogota unless I come with someone who wants food. There's no need. The caipirinha is all I need.,"I was honestly a little disappointed. The food was expensive and it didn't really taste Colombian to me. It's good if you're looking for a more generic Latin American taste but if your heart is set on Colombian food, don't come here.",With all the options in NYC I rarely go to a place more than once but I've lived in BK less than a year and already visited Bogota 4 times - twice for brunch and twice for dinner.  I've always loved Colombian food but once I became vegetarian it became difficult except but Bogota has several vegetarian/vegan offerings and are able to work wonders with their impossible meat!  I've had the migas with the impossible meat substitution as well as the vegan bandeja paisa... both delicious.  The drinks are not as great as the food but still good and they offer bottomless mimosas with brunch!  They also offer extended happy hours most days.  One thing to note the portion sizes are very generous so come hungry or consider sharing an entree and pairing with an appetizer or dessert between two people.  If you're going on a Friday night I highly recommend you make a reservation or any time for that matter just to be on the safe side.  The manager is super attentive as is the staff.  With so many options I'll definitely be back for more.,"Love the fun atmosphere and delicious food!The empanadas are so yummy - I particularly liked the vegetarian one. They are a decent portion size; although, I recommend getting the empanada sampler since it's a great deal (4 for $15).  The yellow sweet corn arepas are also so good!Overall, great place to chill with your friends :).","Fabulous - have the plantains with queso!! Friendly staff,fun atmosphere, great drinks and fun options forthe designated drivers too!",Bogota Latin Bistro
245,"Great atmosphere and service, but taste wasn't quite as good as Five Senses in Koreatown. But still authentic and good for FiDi.","Gunbae is one of the fancier Korean restaurant joints around the city. But it satisfies! If you want to sample their meat selection you can try their combination Korean barbecue. The banchan was quite limited though. We were served kimchi, pickled chilis, steamed egg, brocolli, and some vegetable and macaroni salad. If you're in the singing mood, they have karaoke rooms at the basement.","This review is only for the karaoke. I recently attended a party here with a group of 15 people. The karaoke rooms are in the basement. It was extremely hot and humid down there, and despite fiddling with the AC and talking with the servers, we were unable to get the room as cool as we wanted it to be. Somewhat limited selection of songs. I'm used to flipping through books organized by artist, and this only featured song titles, which was somewhat annoying. Limited wine selection as well.","Came here with colleagues for a work dinner/ night of drinking. I had the whiskey/red wine cocktail which was delicious. Lychee mojito, mango mojito were also tasty. Food wise I don't remember but we got a lot of food and it was all good. Solidly priced for such a large party. Great fast waiters also. Karaoke room downstairs was really fun. It wasn't a shoebox like ktown,ore like a stretch party bus and awesome sound system...yes I murdered it on the mic. I'd come again.","UGH. Gunbae recently changed their menu and removed some of my favorite classics like Galbi tang and replaced them with weird, fusion-style Korean food. Not that they were super authentic before, but Gunbae was decent (considering that there's no other Korean restaurants around Tribeca). It seems that they have entirely new staff now and changed their menu to be even less authentic than before. However, prices remain the same (if not pricier!) so you're looking at paying close to $20 for an entree that is not authentic Korean food. Add in tip and tax and that's easily $25. Unfortunately that means I'll have to take the trip up to Ktown now for my Korean food fix...but it seems that it'll be well worth it compared to this.","Overall a pretty average KBBQ place. The pros: - Very nice decor- Best seafood pancake I've ever had. Thick, but light and fluffy. Great flavor. - Main entrees all tasted great. - They were accommodating for our large group. The cons: - The banchan is all on the spicy end, and not a huge selection. Places like BCD provide a lot more choices and varying degrees of heat. - Dishes on the small side- Prices higher than what you would pay in Ktown in my opinion. - Service is a weird mix of nice when they are there, but then they will ignore you until you flag them down. Overall, I feel like if you are in the Tribeca area, and want Korean food, you won't regret coming here. But I would not make a special trip out here and feel like Ktown is a better bang for your buck.",GunBae
246,17 Syllables about Lolo'sGet the Pom Pom ShrimpGet the rum cocktail pitcherRly- try it all!,"2 stars for the vibe. Love the decor and menu.Unfortunately, the quality of the seafood just wasn't there. I would try this place again and order a few things different. Pros:-Cajun garlic butter sauce is yummy.-shrimp is good and bigCons:-Crawfish is frozen, not fresh, obvious from taste (fresh crawfish is super yummy, but I get it, this is NYC)-Snow crab was either old or way overcooked as the meat stuck to the shell making it difficult to eat.-Fries weren't crispy, more soggy. I wished they didn't put the soft shell crab over it with sauce, maybe it would have been crispier?Next time I will just stick to the shrimp and maybe try the coconut shrimp. But food was bit of a disappointment.","The food here was great and I loved the chill atmosphere of being able to sit outside on the casual patio that wasn't too packed at all on a Sunday evening. The waiter though that brought our food to our table was extremely rude and he really dimmed what would've normally been 5 stars based on the food and atmosphere to a 3. Not quite sure at all why he had an attitude, but it was not okay to take it out on the customers. Would love to go back here again based on the food, but not sure if I would due to the really rude waiter that brought our food to the table who's attitude left a bad taste in my mouth.",Came by for a quick meal on labor day. You order at the front then get a number and can sit anywhere. There's limited seating in the front but a ton more space in the back room as well as a cute outdoor seating area in a backyard of sorts (there's also a roof).I managed to come here during happy hour so my entire meal was about $20. The happy hour meals are smaller portions which is great if you want to try a bit of everything. I got the following items:1) Pom Pom Shrimp w/ Garlic Fries: Great fries. Crispy with a soft inside and salty all the way through with plenty of seasoning. Almost like a curly fry. Garlic sauce is a bit on the sweeter side almost like there's a touch of honey and it's not overpowering. The shrimp itself was alright. It had flavor but was nothing special. (3.75/5)2) Conch Fritters: The conch was a bit chewy and the fritter had a more tough texture but the various veggie flavors really helped balance out the seafood and starch flavors while offering bursts of earthy sweetness (3.5/5)3) Crab Burger: Really tiny burger but so full of crab and crab flavor. Not too much fillers clogging up the crab cake. Solid all around (4.25/5)Overall I really enjoyed my meal here. While there were some highs and lows I feel like I didn't order quite the right things so I'll definitely be back to give this place another go.,What i love the most about this place is the feeling of being somewhere in a Caribbean island instead of NYC. Their decor is very rusty & caribbean. Their service was excellent. Very friendly & attentive.  I had the pom shrimps and a crab cake both very delicious.,"I can't believe I work across the street and I never spotted this gem. My boss invited us for a working lunch and I am so glad she did! Lolo's did not disappoint. The inside seating is intimate but there is more seating outside. We began with the plantain chips. Crisp and spicy with a sweet chutney. I ordered the fish basket which was crispy and delicious with garlic fries. The scallops were cooked perfecyly in a spicy cajun sauce or curry sauce. The scallops were cooked to perfection amazing. It was served with corn, broccoli, and sweet potato. The conch fritters came out steaming hot and crispy outside full of flavor on the inside. We ended it up with tres leche cake which was melt in your mouth slap your momma fantastic!!!!",Lolo's Seafood Shack
247,"Delicious and novel, but small and pricey! We got a classic burger and a churro crazy shake. I wouldn't have any complaints about the food, but also nothing superb to mention. The service was a little on the slow side and the wait to get in is outrageous at certain times of day! We mostly went for the crazy shake, which was undoubtedly unique and full of sugary goodness, but probably not worth the $15. It is a cool place, but I didn't fall in love and as there are so many places to eat in New York City, I don't think this would be very high on my list of recommendations.","The milkshakes are worth the hype (although I'm not sure they are worth waiting in line for). We managed to walk right in on a friday afternoon. I couldn't believe it since every time I've been past it there is a line out the door. I had the sweet and salty shake which was delicious and messy. It's pretty salty, even given the name, so I'd reccomend another shake if you aren't a big salt person. I also had a burger, which is good but not amazing.","So THIS is why we stopped eating at Black Tap Craft Burger & Beers.Had a meal for our interns there, then a few days later walking past it in the morning.Open boxes or raw meat (in the morning, waiting to be taken inside and served) literally lying in the last day's garbage.Alarming sanitation, food and safety choice.Not for us, ever again.","Quick seating at the bar, great service! Bartenders were very attentive, despite how busy they were. Good tap selection (including cider for folks who are needing hop-free), unique cocktail menu - ordered the watermelon smash and it was A+.Ordered the Bison burger - cooked exactly as asked. Wasn't over-seasoned. Roasted tomatoes were great and pesto mayo didn't overpower. Subbed teri broccoli for fries...delicious! Husband ordered the Old Fashioned - gone in less than 10 minutes. Fries were fantastic - tasted like old-school BK fries.Definitely a banger and portions are generous...vibe is great, service is excellent. Would make this one of our regular spots.","Be expected to wait as its a hotspot for tourist too. Went with my friends on a whim, prob waited 20 minutes. The service was good. Now most people go there for the desserts and ultimate shakes. I went there for that purpose and didn't expect much of the food....LET ME TELL YOU that the burgers were BOMB. Big proportions so be ready to eat. The shake i got was the Oreo supreme. That was overkill and very sweet. Great to share with at least 3-4 people. Overall a great experience!","We came for the shakes. But had the rings and fries first. Fries are served with a home made ranch with dill to set it off nicely. The fries themselves, while very good, were not extra special in themselves. The onion rings were definitely house made and delicious and coupled well with the dill ranch dressing. Hubby liked the zesty sauce they were served with. Water was readily available and replaced frequently for us. The atmosphere is on the louder side. Not overly loud but if your looking for a quiet intimate setting, you may not enjoy this as much. The seating was well arranged and while we were there (Thursday evening 6:45 ish) it was not crowded. So the shakes. If you have never had an over the top shake, just order one for the table to share. If you want more then order another. We made the mistake of ordering 3 for the 4 of us to share and it was way overkill. At $15 a pop, (average for most places) it is a super treat. The pictures are very misleading because these are very big. I had to take 2 pictures (one of each side) to capture it.",Black Tap - Midtown
248,"Came here without reservations on a Friday night. The wait was 40 minutes so we decided to sit at the bar. We ordered 2 cocktails, an appetizer (the spicy hummus) and each had the salmon with eggplant as an entree. The hummus came out before the drinks did and it was really good, probably the highlight of our meal. 20 minutes later and still no drinks (the bartender was slammed and there didn't seem to be a bar-back helping him). Our entrees arrived and we were disappointed to see the $27 per-plate salmon alongside just two-bite-size pieces of eggplant and the remaining plate supplemented with roasted onions (which honestly didn't compliment the flavors of the salmon whatsoever, so I'm wondering if they were out of eggplants and just threw in the cheapest veggie they had on hand)?Our drinks finally arrived when we were about halfway done with our meal (womp womp). We finished with the chocolate brownie with ice cream which was good but nothing to be impressed about. Unfortunately our experience was lackluster and I don't expect we'll be back, despite living only a few blocks down.","Really can't believe the high ratings for this place.  But hey, it's Fort Greene, home of the $15 schmear of hummous!  I'm not even kidding. 4 plates and 3 drinks cost over $100, and then we had to go to another restaurant since we were still hungry.  Warning: the skewers ($10-15) are ONE skewer.  The various hummi come on tiny plates and are about 1/4 of a small Sahadi's container. Sure they're good, but not THAT good. Adding insult to wallet injury, when the 3 of us (having ordered 4 plates) asked for another pita (having been given one, cut into pieces) we were charged an additional $2!  SKIMPY  is the only word to describe this place. Oh, and the service is just as skimpy.  Really loved how the bar/bus person left the water tap on so that it poured over the bar, menu and into my lap.  I had to turn it off, mop up the mess, and no one even noticed.  Since I did your job, can I have my tip back?",I came back a couple of weeks later and the food wasn't nearly as enticing.The pita bread did not seem very fresh and the whole meal was rather average.,"Holy moly. There have been very few restaurants that have left me speechless and this is one of them. The hummus/dips are to die for. I think I even sat there in awe for a moment as I had my first bite of warm pita with each accompaniment. We ordered the sweet potato hummus and whipped ricotta and WOW. It's difficult to even describe how delicious each of them were. The sweet potato hummus was a perfect combination of slightly sweet and smoky while the whipped ricotta was a literal dream--the sweetness alongside the slightest bit of saltiness was complex and had a beautiful depth to its flavor. I cannot rave about these two dishes enough. We also had the Sabich and Malawach. The sabich was very good, but not as stellar as our small plates. I would probably opt for something else if I went again. The Malawach, on the other hand, was so amazing and flaky. Also, my boyfriend said that this was the only place he was able to find it this far. Incredible restaurant, very nice people, beautiful atmosphere. They were very accommodating to our large group and I cannot wait to go back!","We've been multiple times for dinner and recently went for brunch. Really fantastic meals each time.The High Notes: - MUST order the whipped ricotta with honey. Do not question this. Just do it. - Babaganoush dip is also wonderful and a nice way to balance the sweet whipped ricotta- Pita is great and plentiful, we're often pretty full from two dips and pita alone- The variety of kebabs haven't let us down yet- Very cute spot with a nice garden in the back- Fair price for what you get in flavor, satiety, and environment Other Notes:- There is a separate section on the patio that is pretty cramped, right in the sun, and the plants are all over you depending on your seat. Just don't grab this table on a hot day and you're golden. - The food comes out SO fast. Which can be great if you are starving, but I usually appreciate a little spacing to enjoy the experience a bit more. Meals feel a bit rushed here. Get a reservation if you can, but if you can't they do try to take walk-ins and so far we've been lucky and were seated almost right away. Will keep coming back, excited to try more of the menu!","I loooooove Mediterranean food. And this place did not disappoint!! Our waitress suggested 3-5 app plates for my fiancé and I then either an entree each if we were still starving or split an entree. We didn't even make it that far! We waited about 15-20 mins for a table and started with the lavender old fashioned cocktail. I would've tried the other yummy looking drinks but a lot were gin and tequila and my college experiences has scarred me for life with those liquors. We sat outside under the covered roof and it was perfect. Dimly lit string lights lining the roof cover just gave it such a warm and comforting vibe. We order 4 apps to share: the whipped ricotta (GET THIS. we literally ordered it as dessert AFTER we finished al of our other apps...no shame), the chicken liver caramelized onion hummus, the chicken thigh skewer and they had a NY strip steak skewer on special. We loved everything except the hummus. I don't think it was made poorly, but neither of us had tried chicken liver before, and it came with big chunks of liver on top...I was hoping for more onions bc personally I could eat an onion like you do an apple....weird flex but idcWe also had a glass of red wine each and I learned that their wines are made differently than ""normal wines""! And you can taste the difference (in a good way)!!Our bill for 2 cocktails, 2 glass of wine, and 5 apps (the 5th is the second order of ricotta) was $115ish and after tip was $140. Def a little pricier than what we usually dine out at but it was a realllllly nice change of pace. Definitely recommend and forming an opinion for yourself!! I'd love to try some of their other dishes like the falafel or octopus... Overall, it was",Miss Ada
249,"While back home in NY, visiting family. I Took my daughter ice skating on the lower east side. Checked yelp for lunch, saw the reviews for Pommes Frites and went to give it a try!! One of the rare times while eating that I was savoring every bite, and making plans to visit again. Two days later, a day before returning to AZ, my daughter and I made another trip to the lower Manhattan from the Bronx, just to have fries!! The family and I are visiting again this xmas, and Pommes will be on our top things to visit/eat list!! Highly, highly recommend this joint!!","Pommes Frites is without doubt French fries heaven. The fries are incredibly crunchy on the outside, while fluffy like pillows inside, while the selection of sauces is incredible. I highly recommend the tequila - lime - chipotle combo with its spicy note, and the creamy wild mushroom. The service was also reasonably fast on an early Saturday evening. The interior is done in a rustic, dark wooden style, but seating space inside is limited.",Often times you are looking to eat and sometimes you are in the mood for salad. If you are in the mood for salad and you come here my judgment would be you have made a  mistake.Like a waterfall in your mouth.Cheaper than a trip to Belgium or even Montreal.If you are craving some french fries but not sure what kind then this place will fulfill your desire.If you order to go you will be skipping out on ambiance points.I come here every time I am in NY and I have been coming since I found out it was open i think back in 05. Not sure how long the place has been open before that time.,"Let me count the ways I love Pommes Frites: Regular, Large, and Double. If you're looking for more to convince you, try one or more of the 30+ dipping sauces. When you do something this good you only have to do one thing, fresh frites! A definite High Five  Rating!","BEEN WAITING FOR THE DAY I COULD HOLD MY FRENCH FRIES IN  A CONE. at first i was amazed that sauces were $1.75 but thats the BIGGEST plastic ramikin i've ever seen, and they give you two! Regular ketchup, mustard, and raw onions are free amongst other regular-ish toppings.they have so many cool sauces and i love that thats the selling point. they let you sample a bunch off of a napkin. the regular is massive enough to split into THREE cones to share with others. idk how it could get bigger than that and tbh i dont' wanna think about it.french fries themselves i wish i could put some seasoning salt on it but with the curry ketchup i got i was happy! all thats missing is that little wooden prong fork to eat it with so you don't get your hands greasy :)","Being an establishment that serves just fries with an assortment of different dipping sauces is such a simple concept that works for Pomme Frites!I mean, who doesn't love fries? They're literally one of the most famous side dishes in America and they're both vegan and vegetarian friendly.It is really cute inside. It reminds me of something out of an amusement park with how antiquated the décor is. I like how the tables have holes in them so your paper cone full of fries fit inside perfectly.With 3 sizes of fries to choose from and over 30+ dipping sauces, it was hard to choose but ultimately I decided on getting a regular size fry with Mexican ketchup, sweet chill sauce, and Thai chili ketchup. All of them were good but the Thai chili ketchup was by far my favorite.  All in all, two thumbs up for this spectacular spud spot. Bon Appétit",Pommes Frites
250,"Dry Pot to-go order -Delivered with plastic lid all melted - I might get poisoned by it. Delivered with spicy oil all over the place - messy af. Ordered the ""hot"" the most spicy, manageable, not the best dry pot I've had, single spice flavor not as interesting as other places.","I'm a fan of any sort of Asian vegan food so it's hard to go wrong.Pretty yummy fare here. I had the vegan tripe (I was just talking to someone about the scarcity of vegan organ meats, haha) and it was good (the spice was a bit much for me but that's because I'm a wimp). Scallion pancakes, peppercorn Brussels sprouts, and vegetable dumplings were all tasty. Wasn't huge on the mountain yam puffs or the General Tso's mushrooms though. Reasonable prices.Friendly service.Cute little place. It was unbearably hot though which doesn't go well with Szechuan. Between the barely functional AC and the spicy vegan tripe, I was in rough shape. Please fix your AC!","I had really high expectations because of the reviews here but I didn't really have a good experience here. The place is so small and my boyfriend and I were seated next to other couples. We were really close to the other tables where it was hard to get out and go to the bathroom. Not a place to go to on a date, no privacy you can hear other people's conversations, the place was very loud. We tried the dan dan noodles and it was very dry. Not what I expected at all after. I enjoyed the mountain yams with vegan cheese, but everything else was not described as it was on the menu. The honey walnut edamame was just fried edamame. All overpriced, and not a great experience.","I am not vegan, but I am vegan-friendly and supportive. I just love good food, and that's what Spicy Moon is--really good, spicy,numbing Szechuan that happens to be vegan. Get the wontons. Eat them all. The dry pot is amazing. I can't imagine anything not being well made here. Bring your carnivores. Let them talk shit. Then feed them here and watch them walk back on their words.","I could not possibly be any farther from vegan and prior to this have only been to one other vegan restaurant, but good god, this place was amazing. I ordered the dry pot tofu (pretty good), fried dumplings (pretty meh), the ""beef tripe"" which was surprisingly delicious and last but not least, the FUCKING DAN DAN NOODLES. Hands-down, the star of the show. Noodles had the perfect chewy texture, sauce was flavorful af, and the beyond beef crumbles were a very nice addition. Don't leave without ordering this. I will definitely be back to try the rest of the items on the menu.","Spicy Moon is a vegan Chinese spot in East Village, offering plant-based versions of standby Sichuan dishes.They've been open since this winter, but my first trip was this weekend. We came around 6:30 and were given a 15 minute wait for our party of 2; we were glad we hustled back since there was already a small crowd waiting outside.The menu is split into appetizers, noodles and salads, and mains. We did an appetizer, a noodle, and a main, which was a bit much portion-wise. It's an even mix between dishes that are already vegan (sesame noodles, cumin fries, bean curd salad) and dishes that have been vegan-ified (mala meatballs with Beyond Beef, General Tso's mushroom). They also have beer, house wine, plum wine, and a handful of house cocktails like a tamarind margarita.We started with wontons in chili oil ($8), which were up to par but not mind blowing. Dan dan noodles ($10) with added Beyond Beef ($2) were mixed tableside with care. We were both really impressed with the flavor, definitely one of the better renditions I've had of it; there's solid spice but it's really more of a sesame flavor. The Beyond Beef has a super beefy taste and worked well, but I don't know that it needs it.Dry pot tofu ($16) made us lose our minds. The tofu is gently fried, with a nice crust on the outside and a soft inside, and absolutely doused in their mala sauce. An absolute delight. My boyfriend is willing to go on the record as their dry pot being better than Mala Project's. The spice level is considerable and you'll be sweating but not dying.Service was great. Dishes come out quite quickly. They are tree-nut free and seem to be able to accommodate common allergies. The space is cozy and seating is tight. It's casual but the low, red-tinted lighting gives it a party vibe. It's best suited for couples if you're doing walk-in, but they do take reservations and this would be super fun for a group dinner.We will definitely be back to explore; we went fairly classic for our first visit and the vegan tripe is calling my name.",Spicy Moon
251,"Bobby Flay must be on his summer vacation!! If so, he should be ashamed that GATO had the gall to even open tonight, knowing that its chef (A fill-in? A distant cousin? An imposter?!) would be completely out of his depth in the kitchen. Unbeknownst to us, we chose to dine at GATO tonight and our meal was an absolute TRAIN WRECK --  This, our first (and our LAST) visit to his place. Soon after we were seated, waiters began circling our table, refilling water glasses like flies around trash bins. We should have known that something was amiss. An hour slipped by before our appetizers appeared, when we noticed a feverish queue of waiters in the kitchen angrily gesturing for their orders. When our main courses and side dishes finally arrived, they were cold, poorly plated and Ill-prepared. We turned our phone lights onto the chicken to make sure it was thoroughly cooked. A manager stopped by to express her apologies for the poor service, and admitted that the chef was having issues (which we greatly appreciated). At least there was acknowledgment that their kitchen was off-the-rails. However, restauranteuring starts and stops with management deciding to open a well-reviewed and expensive restaurant knowing full-well that they were about to do so with an ill-trained chef at the helm. This is about meeting an expectation set by the restaurant -- This is not about a customer having unrealistic expectations.Shame on GATO.And shame on Bobby Flay.","Our food was extremely disappointing. Every dish was missing seasoning. We eventually had to ask for salt to make it palatable. To cap it off, we were charged for an extra bottle of $90 wine. Thankfully my husband caught it before we paid. They admitted to the mistake but didn't offer any recompense. Overall we paid a lot of money for what amounted to an average meal.",Went for a drink and dessert. The same was good but service could be a bit better. I feel like they didn't really notice us even though we were seated at the bar. Did not get the chance to try the food but dessert I had was ok. To my taste not the best. Will give them another chance.,"I absolutely love Gato! Again it's a kind of place that has everything for everyone. I have tried most of their menu items over the times I have visited and I like them all! They have a standard long standing menu, though some menu items change with season. My personal favorites are - eleven layered potato, sea scallop, mussels, crispy potatoes, roasted carrots, roasted cauliflower, black fettuccine, fried chicken and steamed halibut. Tip- get their crispy potatoes with goat cheese and oh my god, absolutely delish! Great ambience, great place and greatly recommended!","I love the name of this place, GATO!My friend loves Bobby flay and he's wanted to try this place for a while. We cane here on a Saturday for dinner and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be, it was pretty casual attire as well.The restaurant was clean and the decor was pretty cool, the service was amazing. The food was delicious! I love how everything was tapas, so it was nice to try a lite but of everything.The cocktails were fantastic as well !The fried chicken was perfectly cooked, juicy and crisp! The pizza was out of this world! The only thing I didn't like was the paella. It had a weird aftertaste that was off putting.","Came here for date night while my boyfriend was visiting the city. We were impressed by the menu + ordered all (3) courses to really get what we came for. We of course shared dishes, but I loved my scallop entree the most. Then the chocolate tarte for dessert was to die for. After some red wine we ended the evening with a coffee. They even brought us a complimentary dessert wine! Our service was professional  + accommodating. I'm looking forward to coming back next time I'm in the city!",Gato
252,"Walking towards Princes I started seeing the lineup going down the street. A long lineup for pizza?! That's crazy, right? Well I stayed in that crazy long lineup because I was really hungry for a slice of pizza...Was it worth the wait? Yes, totally.The pepperoni pizza is thicker than a traditional NY slice and it's cut square. They label it as spicy but I'd just call it really flavourful. It's really, really good.Grab some napkins, the tomato sauce will run down your hands.","MY #1 SLICE IN NYC. The spicy pepperoni. The sauce. The cheese. The dough. Not too thin, not too thick. It's perfection!Be prepared for long lines!","This review is NOT for the pizza, but for the SERVICE! I have to say something, because it was just that ridiculous that I am leaving a yelp review. Yes, we all know we usually have to wait in line for this place. But not 2 HOURS for a slice of pizza. Waited 2 HOURS for a pizza, not because the line was too long, but because they kept giving the pizzas to deliveries first! & they kept running out, but still taking orders from people in line.....so they were CONSTANTLY BEHIND in orders. The people that ordered at the store were 2nd priority.Every pizza that came out of the oven, you would think finally it's out, but NOPE that WHOLE pie all went out to delivery. So you wait for the next pie & then the next. I think maybe every 5th pie a couple of people who order in store got a slice. Never come to this place after 5pm. NOT WORTH THE WAIT.","This is some of the best Sicilian-style pizza in NYC.  The thick slices of pepperoni, the gooey cheese, and the pizza dough: love everything about it except for the blow to my calorie count. The Sicilian slices here are very greasy for sure: the grease from the pepperoni and the cheese just drips while you eat it. Though it's not fun to have to wait, the line moves pretty quickly. It's also pretty fun to spot the celebrities on the walls who had eaten there before, so the time passes quickly. Considering how filling even one slice is, I think the price is pretty fair too! Will be back for more!","This pizza is the truth!! Lots of hype surround this one ... celebrity 'endorsers' on Instagram. From rappers to directors to NY athletes, all have featured this pizza in their stories. After a long day of business meetings in NYC, I decided to brave the line in the rain and try a slice (or 3 ...) for myself to see what the fuss is about.The first thing I noticed was that there was only one small marble 'ledge' to one side which you could stand and eat at. The store is small and the line takes up most of the space. There are no benches outside, so if the 8 or so spots at the ledge are taken, you'll have to get it to go, find a park nearby and get harassed for spare change by hoards of the downtrodden while you eat your slices.I tried their famous 'Spicy Sicillian' slice which is a square slice of thick dough literally covered in 1/2 inch of pepperoni pieces. They claim to be the originators of the new pizza/instagram phenomenon of 'pepperoni cups' which is when the slice is cooked so hot that the edges of the pepperoni slices curl up to form little cups. Not sure why this is such a 'thing' but it is.The pepperoni slice was fantastic. The dough was thick but crisp. The cheese was quality. The sauce was a bit on the sweet side, typical of New York pizza and the best part was the thick layer of pepperoni 'cups' with just the right amount of spice to counter the sweet sauce. This was truly one of the best pepperoni slices I've ever had. Worth a 20-30 minute wait? Not for me. Worth a 5 minute wait around 7 p.m. on a Thursday? You betcha! The quality of the ingredients was apparent.I also had a slice of the plain triangular sliced cheese pizza. This was average to above average for NYC pizza. The sweet sauce had nothing to counter it without spicy pepperoni so it was too sweet tasting for my liking. The dough even had a sweet starchy sugary taste. It wasn't a bad slice for NYC but you should be coming here for the Sicilian slice with pepperoni. If you get a regular old cheese slice, you may be disappointed. Joe's Pizza in Greenwich Village about a 4 minute walk from here is my choice for plain cheese NYC slice pizza.Worth a trip if you happen to be in the Bowery district and want a good slice. Lots of celebrity pictures on the wall and a cute little shop. Prices can get up there ... $4.50 for a Spicy Sicilian slice, $32 for a whole pie. $3.10 for the plain cheese slice, $25 for a whole pie. I will say though that you feel full after a slice or two. I would say this is my favorite pizza in the Mid-Town-ish area. And they are very credit card friendly.","Nothing more authentic than grabbing slices of Prince Street Pizza as a second dinner and eating it sitting on a curb on the street.The square shaped pizza was greasy, pepperoni salty, dough chewy and cheesy, just how it's supposed to be. This is, I dare say, the best street style pizza I've had so far in New York.",Prince Street Pizza
253,"Not good. But pick hotpot without bbq. Broth wasn't good. Quality of meat and seafood wasn't good. It was pretty disappointing. I'll just stick to hot pot and Kbbq in California. Grilling was just sad. Nothing looked liked it was decent quality or very fresh.They have a sauce bar where you can make your own sauces, but after being at many restaurants that have this, I think it's better to have different prepared sauces (like a creamy sesame, instead of straight peanut butter). Customer service wasn't great either. They didn't look like they liked us very much. Maybe they could tell we're outliers.",Love to come here. It's all you can eat for 2 hours. Cooking takes time so order most of what you want in the beginning so you don't need to wait for staff to come back to reorder. Also the quality of the steak is questionable. Very chewy and tough. It's cheap for kbbq so you get what you pay for.,"It honestly wasn't that good. It's hotpot was just spicy, not as flavorful. We had to wait for a table for 20-30mins despite their being empty tables and no one to clean them. This was my least favorite option out of all of the meals i ate while visiting australia. At the end, they handed us the wrong bill and were confused when we said we refused to pay it because it belonged to the table next to us who had left.","Let me start by saying the customer service here is top notch! From how fast the food came out, to our server cooking the food for you. We have multiple servers helping us which makes our first time experience a great one! I ordered the bbq option with the hot pot. Unlimited items you can pick for your dish. I got to pick up to 3 broth flavors for my hot pot. I love the idea, they have a season bar where you can grab certain things to flavor your own broth or food. Love it!","Why the eff is this place called 99 Favor Taste but ALL the signs in the store say 98 Favor Taste? Literally this quirk about the place makes me SO MAD lmao. Like the first time you see it you're like oh maybe this is just a typo on this one sign but NO it's like everywhere and you're just like bish are you trying to give me a stroke?????Anyway, on the weekends apparently this place is super packed. We tried coming here on Friday and the wait was two hours so we were like okay maybe not but then the hot pot craving would not subside so we came here again on Saturday and then waited two hours down the street at Mi Tea (waiting for food in NYC is as much of a thing as it is in SF, apparently) and then we were finally seated.What to say? The service is great here, and the price point is good. The food itself is what you'd expect, so nothing too special there. Was heartily satisfied by my hot pot meal. Highlights included the seafood pancake and the herbal broth for me. You have the option of getting both individual pots (shabu-style), or sharing a large pot.Super fun if you have a birthday here!! They have someone come out in a costume and sing happy birthday here lmao. It's such a party. I would come here for my birthday just for that lololol.","Compared to the Chinatown location, I'm a bigger fan of the St Marks location because it felt like we had more space. I'm not really a fan of all you can eat hotpot since quality just tends to be poor, but it's fun to come here for birthdays where you get the monkey to come and cheer on the birthday guy/gal and they can get their meal comped. The quality of meat is quite mediocre - it's dry and some kinds have way too much fat - and you end up having to dunk it in sauce to make it appetizing. The best thing here are the fish balls with roe inside them - those are actually delicious - and pleasantly surprised they had nagaimo as an option. At the end of the day, would never come here if not to celebrate a birthday - much prefer higher quality spots that aren't AYCE.",99 Favor Taste
254,"Dinner review. Gastropub.3 - Steak on Toast (Baguette, Chimichurri, Baby Arugula, Picked Red Onion)4 - Bone Marrow (Soft Scrambled Egg, Soy Glaze, Tobiko, Toasted Bread)Average beer selection.Overall, ""A-OK.""","My friends and I showed up around 7pm on a Wednesday for a happy hour.  It has a nice ambience, maybe mid 30s and above crowd I'd say.  For a Wednesday evening it was a little louder than I expected. We were able to find a table for 4 fairly quickly and ordered drinks at the bar. Unfortunately they ran out of the Pilsner (4$) which is on the HH menu. I had to settle for a Yuengling (4$) instead.  I would have no problems coming back here but I'd prefer to try other spots in the neighborhood.","Amazing food, with a variety of small plates. Great selection of drinks. Enjoyable atmosphere. Would have rated five stars, but there are no servers who take your order. All orders must be placed with the bartender, whether you're seated at the bar or table. So running back and forth for drinks, apps, and dinner was unusual.",Hmmmm Lots of pressure submitting another 5 star review. But to be fair there was nothing to discount the rating.Local spot that made this visitor feel like home. Many craft cocktails to choose from. Menu limited but different enough options. The pork carnitas  were superb. The rum mule refreshing on a warm night. Yapping with the busy bartender/0wner added plus.,"Amazing service and good food!Service: Jason and Ed (the chef) are the absolute best. Super friendly and made sure we were totally taken care of the other night. They alone are enough reason to come back!Food: Came for dinner. The bone marrow appetizer is amazing - comes with this delicious scrambled egg on top, which was just perfect. Loved the soft bread it came with also. My date got the burger, which he thought was fine - I ate basically all of his fries because they were so good. I ordered the tuna tacos, which were good but could've used a little more tuna. Will definitely have to return to try the chicken and waffles! And fried burrata.Drinks: Come before 8pm for happy hour! Offered every day including weekends. Can't beat $6 wines, and they were really large pours. Good variety, as opposed to some places that offer only 1-3 options of wine for the happy hour. They had maybe 4-6. Ambiance: It is a bar so very loud, but a fun place to go if you want some drinks and good bites!","We had a huge lunch earlier in the day and by 8, weren't terribly hungry. But we were in the mood for some good drinks and shared tapas. This hit the spot for us! We had the wings, ahi tuna which was awesome and the meat and cheese board. Perfect place to end our fun day in the city.",Hold Fast Kitchen and Spirits
255,"There was barely a wait for a table for three on a Wednesday night! My friend got there early and had to wait for us to be seated. We shared the mezze plate with naan. The hummus was good, but not the most amazing I've had. The babagounash was a little strange as I'm used to it being of similar texture to the hummus, but instead it was very much still shaped like an eggplant. The skin of the eggplant was quite bitter. For the entree, I went with the meatball tagine, which came with a side of couscous. It was very good. The chicken tagine was also very good.Bu I felt that tagines in Morocco were tastier and came with more spices and sides. If I could, I would rank this a 3.5.","Great food, bar was busy too dark, but in general I would go back.","Okay food. The Pita was old and stale. Hummus was probably taken out of a box, not really fresh. Too pricey and service was so so. Update. Aug.3rd - so I came again after my friend persuaded me that this place got better but unfortunatelyI have to downgrade my previous review to one star after this visit. The waiter (his name is George ) here treated us so poorly to the point when we had to go and complain to the manager.  He completely ignored us, or at least didn't acknowledge us when we were there. Everytime when we need something I had to get up and look for him. He was rude, and very not nice! That's not how you treat your customers!","Unfortunately when I came here it was packed and it was hot to boot. All you could see were plates with leftover food as the staff worked hard to remove them and keep things moving.I waited about 20 minutes before being seated, unfortunately next to a rather loud group. I ordered the lamb shank tagine with couscous accompanied with some Moroccan sauce, and Moroccan mint tea.Oh my goodness was it good. The texture of the lamb was perfect as it melted in my mouth effectively dispersing the awesome flavors. The couscous was also very tasty and complemented well the lamb that I believe was marinated in a cinnamon like sauce. The tea was very good and different from the tea I had in Morocco in that over there it was much sweeter. Given how hot it was, unsweet tea seemed more refreshing.While my fine dining attempt the previous night was all but a failure, this more than made up for it in terms of the awesome food I had. Sure it wasn't the same kind of tagine as in Morocco still boiling and/or sizzling in a clay pot, but it tasted amazing and filled me up perfectly, which ultimately matters to me the most.",Amazing food great taste exotic!All waiters are super chic .Thru have both downtown and Brooklyn locations.,"This place was pretty good, we were in and out really quick and the halloumi eggs were tasty. The portions are pretty small though, and as a Middle Eastern I felt the dishes were a little...basic. I guess I'm just not sure what the hype is all about? Why was it so busy? Regardless, good food at reasonable prices so 4 stars for me. I would recommend - but not if you have to wait more than 10 minutes.",Cafe Mogador
256,"Even for a big Arsenal match, there was room for everyone to sit, and steady service. TVs everywhere mean no bad angles. The food was quite good.Fortunately for the Winslow, this rating is for its performance, and not Arsenal's.","Was just there with friends from out of town and the gentleman checking IDs made very offensive, racist, and quite inappropriate comments. My friend was in a cast after just braking her hand and he started making comments to her about being beat up and whether she let ""this guy"" do it to her and why she would allow any physical abuse, while he laughed the whole time. This isn't funny. She was taken aback. Making fun of domestic violence has no place in our society. Next with one of my friends who is of Asian descent he very awkwardly made a slight bowing down gesture to her, and then he started talking with an ""accent"" trying to mimic how those from that region of the world speak. She is AMERICAN born and bred! The insulting remarks were completely classless, vulgar, and should be grounds for firing the individual. When I asked him why he did both things to my friends, he became confrontational. We, obviously, ended up immediately leaving and will never return. But, hey, for those who like racist, inappropriate, and unheard of comments and gestures, then this is the place for you! Enjoy yourselves! You'll have a blast.","Waitresses here are UNNECESSARILY bitchy. We had a huge party and an individual had rented out space. You would think that given the income from renting out the space in addition to the drinks purchases and food ordered, we would receive at least decent service. It felt like the staff went out of their way to make us feel like we were bothersome. Keep in mind no one was in anyway belligerent or otherwise intoxicated which might help us understand the scenario. For example, we asked for water and were told there was water on the table. When we asked if we could get clean glasses it took asking five times. We resorted to using what appeared the be clean classes on a table after the fifth time but were then promptly reprimanded that those were for the beers on tap. Every time someone so much as crossed a toe over an invisible threshold we were immediately told that we only had one specific side of the area rented and we could NOT pass this threshold. At one point someone opened a sliding door long enough to take a photo of the group. During the time it took to take this photo, a staff member has already come over and told the person taking the photo to close the door as soon as the photo was taken. Finally, when the time was up for the period we had rented the space, the same unorthodoxily bitchy waitress told us no less than five times within three minutes that we needed to move for the next party. Granted this was a very crowded bar and folks were saying goodbye as they wrapped up. Lived in Manhattan forever and never encountered someone inexplicably and pointedly mean.","I really have to recommend The Winslow. - Awesome drinks. Any martini made out of their gins is great (and pretty strong / generous), and one of the drinks I tried that a friend got -- I think it was the coffee and peppery ""Nine Lives"" was great. Lots more unique stuff than a lot of the other places in town. - Great beer selection too. Any place that has more than the usual American domestics and a token IPA is good in my books.- The burger is great and beats out any of the ones I've tried in the city, considering the price. The blackened brussel sprouts with garlic and stuff is great too -- somehow is vegan but tastes like you're eating steak.- The only time I went during a peak weekend time, I was able to get a table for 6 with a call an hour beforehand, and it was not ridiculously loud or crazy. If you come during a day afternoon it is very chill, which is nice. - Friendly service too. Keep up the great work and I'm looking forward to coming back.","Came for a late dinner, enjoyed eating the scotch egg and the bangers & mash croquettes with the gin flight sampler.I shared the tasting with another person and we tried the gin cocktails: Edinburgh, Botanist, Bluecoat & Hendricks.","I can't say enough good things about this bar. The owners and staff are absolutely amazing, and I challenge you to find a bar with a better gin selection!They have a full 2-page menu devoted to various types of gin. Each one can be served with tonic and carefully matched botanicals or in a cocktail. If you're having trouble deciding, I'd recommend the Barr Hill, a honey-infused gin. I also really enjoyed the Aviation, which is paired with lavender. Or if you like bitter drinks, you can't go wrong with the draught negroni.The food here is also a solid step above your classic bar fare, and the the bar always seems to have a good crowd without feeling to crowded. But really what makes this place is the people who run it.It's a great spot early in the night for a few starter drinks, but be warned you may find you won't want to leave.",The Winslow

Veggies were tasty but very salty. Pad Thai was ""eh"". Most disappointing was that Top Thai gave me fried rice that was UNDERCOOKED. I understand that things get busy around dinner time but don't mess with quality control and serve a customer UNDERCOOKED FOOD. To make matters worse, the lady who took my order on the phone enticed me to order that dish saying it was $20.95 because it came as a two-person portion. The portion I got was exactly the same as the portion of pad Thai noodles.  False advertising?I'm going to take the undercooked fried rice back to them tomorrow and ask for a refund. Will report back on how customer service goes.","I am impressed! Once you get to the block you can already see a storm of people waiting outside the small restaurant and I totally understand the popularity. You can fill out your info on a notebook to wait for a table. We ordered our food while waiting outside and once they seated us it was a short amount of time till the food started rolling in. The menu is a bit non traditional and priced based on the kind of protein you choose. After that, you pick your base like pad Thai or basil udon. I highly recommend getting the app platters, it's about $23-$25 for a combo of 3 apps. Some of us even got the platter as an entree because you can totally do that. One of the apps is the 8oz grilled skirt steak which was hands down the best dish on the table.The crispy duck with udon is a popular dish and was beautifully cooked. We also got a crispy crab pad see ew. You can pair the base with anything but basically topped with pieces of crab mixed with egg and a whole soft shell crab on top of that. I really like the idea of it but it wasn't as flavorful as I expected it to be, nothing some hot sauce couldn't fix. I prefer chunkier crab bites that's NOT mixed with egg or rather anything so that's the main reason I didn't love the dish as much. Definitely worth a visit and the last thing I would leave you here with is that if you check in on yelp you can get Thai iced tea for just $1. So Check away my friends. Actually I lied, one last last thing - pay with cash for a 10% discount on your bill.",Came here on a whim Saturday night since we were craving Thai food - they have a number of non traditional dishes on their menu including skirt steak and udon which is interesting and unique . For drinks We ordered the Thai tea and a mango margarita from their happy hour menu which is a sweet deal. I Ordered the basil udon with chicken which was flavorful and filling and my fiancé ordered the mixed seafood pad Thai. The portions were large and we were very full with enough food left over to go for another meal. The ambience and service were on point and they had Halloween decorations up when we went which was cute. Lines can be extremely long so the waitlist feature on yelp came in handy.,"Why is it so hard to find good Thai food in NY? Anyway, I'm glad we found Top Thai! The standouts last night were the Basil Udon and Thai iced tea! I've never had anything like the basil udon--just the right amount of flavors with the udon sticky and textured so perfectly. I would come back for that but share as it can be a little too sweet/rich on its own for a meal. The Spicy Basil Fried Rice was a little lacking in flavor but grew on us. And the Pad Thai was a miss. Would not order again. It should have more of a complex flavor and was a bit too watery if you ask me.I really wanted to try the highly raved Crab Rangoons, but when I asked what type of crab they used, they said ""real crab."" I ask this because I can only eat two types (dungeness and lump, allergic to the rest). Sad!Overall, pleasant staff but a little unorganized. Wait time for us was around 30 minutes on a Monday night. I don't think I would wait longer than that. There's a bar next door that is BYOF so if you're just hanging with a friend and don't care for the restaurant experience, I'd consider ordering takeout and eating next door to watch a game!",Top Thai Greenwich
258,"It's a shame! This could be a five star review, if the service wouldn't have been this bad!First of all the waitress was kind of bored and not very friendly when she handed out the menus and told us about the special. Then, after bringing our food, she did not come to our table again a single time. Which was sad, because I wanted to order another drink and we wanted to order another side of fries for our daughter, which she didn't bring a fork for. We wanted to give her one, but had no chance, since nobody showed up.Also, the vegan Mac and cheese needed a little more salt. Since it was not on the table, we wanted toast for it - but again, no chance.She didn't even show up at the table to ask how our food was, a total standard and must. But nothing.I have to give credits to the young waiter with the tattoos, who brought us the check (we had to let him come to our table since our waitress seemed nowhere to be found). He was very friendly and nice.But then again - we (and our 2 year old, who wanted to finally have her parents pay so we can bring her home and to bed) had to wait so long to pay.... I don't get it. I just don't. So again - what a shame! Decent location, good food but just horrible service! Won't be coming again I guess...","Reservations are kinda a must. I've eaten here 4 times and each time is a little bit more disappointing. The Hen of the Woods Picatta is my favorite dish and I enjoy repeating entrees to see if the cooking sticks ground each time. Unfortunately the flavor was on a steady decline. For the price point, I would say try it once and then move on to the number of other vegan dining experiences in the area.","Love this place but they ruined the amazing tofu scramble brunch option by adding pesto to it. It's inedible now. Also, the servers can be a little forgetful during brunch. It's understandably busy but having to remind someone three times for a drink is disappointing.","Went the other night with a friend for last minute dinner plans. Upon arrival the next wait for a table was 45 minutes so we were totally cool with taking a counter table to eat (if you are impatient I suggest making a reservation). We had a very polite waiter who was very prompt and available if we had any questions.My friend and I ordered the mozzarella sticks as an app to split and these are by far the best vegan mozz sticks I've ever had. I ordered the delicious penne vodka with meatballs and my friend ordered the Mac and Shews and we were both very satisfied with the orders.As I come here often, not a complaint yet. Keep up the great work!!","I'm a non-vegan who has been eating more vegan food recently for a variety of reasons.  Seems to me there is a spectrum for table service level vegan restaurants that runs from:Those that are doing dishes traditionally prepared with animal products, which are substituting something for that animal product; in other words, nut cheeses or seitan, or something like that.  Now a days the substitutions are with new, innovative foods that are surprisingly satisfying alternatives, e.g. beyond burger.Then there are restaurants that are exclusively serving dishes that are traditionally vegan, like salads, ratatouille, etc.Modern Love is somewhere in the middle.  Seems to me they have some of both of the above, but what I like most is that they have some dishes where they are doing traditional preparations, but substituting something vegan--a whole food, not a something new and, for lack of a better work, processed. For example, their picata that replaces the veal with mushroom. Sure, the cream is probably made from a nut milk, but it feels more like real food...no offense to anywhere else!Anyway, that's my description.  My rating is obviously very good.  They have a great menu and do an excellent job preparing the dishes.","I can't say enough good things about this place. But let me start off by saying my boyfriend is a vegetarian (I am not), has been one for 16 years & has never enjoyed ""vegetarian/vegan"" restaurants because they typically try to be overly trendy & give you super tiny portions (& he is a pretty big guy) so it drives him nuts.But it was his birthday, & I came to Yelp in hopes of finding a perfect spot & WOW did I find one. The atmosphere is def on the trendier side (I mean it's Williamsburg I expect nothing less) but from the second we sat down we experienced nothing but amazing, fast service, incredible (large portion sized) food & awesome drinks. We ordered the spiked lemonade & I can't remember what he got but it had sour in the title but anyway. Both were amazing. We got the tempeh buffalo ""wings"" & truffled poutine. I was FLOORED. The buffalo tempeh tasted like boneless wings without having to think that it's creepy processed chicken but just soy! The avocado ranch it was paired with was amazing too. The truffled poutine took me places. I couldn't even believe it was almond ricotta. I'm a true ricotta lover at heart so I was a little skeptical but it honestly tasted the same (or better because it was with truffle!!)For dinner we got chickpea cutlet parmesan & Brooklyn fried tofu. I think I ate only half of my dinner because I was SO FULL. This was probably the largest plate served to me at a restaurant. I was so shocked I got so much food. I literally ate the rest for breakfast the next morning that's how good it was..... My boyfriend loved this fried tofu, it was super super crispy on the outside, & perfect to pair with the mashed potatoes that were sooooo creamy. I couldn't even believe how amazing every single meal turned out. & honestly it's not even on the more expensive side so I was so happy to be treating him!!I cannot wait to come back as soon as I can, we are even thinking of inviting his family (who love meat) to come soon because it's impossible not to adore every single dish!!!!!!!All photos taken by @carbiesanon on Instagram",Modern Love Brooklyn
259,I've always walk pass cocoron and decided to give this place a try one evening. I got the cold noddles expecting it a cold broth comes along with it. However I was wrong the broth is actually hot and the noddles were cold. Customer service here was excellent. I would definitely be coming back here again to try a different one. They offer water near the end of the meal for you to water down the broth. The noddles portion is good but I would prefer a little bit more noddles.,"This is the worse restaurant ever. We told the waitress 4 times there's roaches crawling around the bar and she didn't do anything expect ""ohhh wow, omg ok"" ... imagine staring at the roaches while we're eating... worse experience ever.. the hygiene level was legit 0/100.","Oof, there was a hair in my soba and all I got in response was an ""oh, we'll get you a new one.""  No apology, discount, or anything.I'm a fan of the original location (I've been going since college, all too many years ago), but the dismal, unhygienic experience of my last visit plus the fact that it's cash only (ughh) may have turned me off for good.And if you ignore everything I just said, then PRO TIP for ordering: always get the dip version of soba to avoid a bowl of mush.","The best place for soba in NYC.West village is not lack of fancy great food... but after being told to line up for 2 hours at the most popular restaurants at 9pm, we just wanted some comfort food at a restaurant where we could relax and fill our tummy. We were so glad to we found this gem, even without doing any research before going (I know). We had mera mera warm soba and mera mera dipping soba. I would recommend the dipping soba, which keeps the noodle chewy and the soup warm. We will be coming back again Cocoron!","TLDR: Just a simple shop that excels in one thing, soba. Two locations, one on Delancey and another on Kenmare. If you're craving some bomb noods, this is the place.I love those places that specialize in one thing and they do it real well. They have a lot of different variations on the menu, hot/cold but my favorite is the Meera Meera Dip Soba.Your dipping broth comes a top a candle to keep it going and it's this creamy emulsion of just goodness. There's bok choy in it, ground chicken and what a better way to pull it out then with your dipped soba noodles! I always get a side of the chicken meatball and this is truly heartwarming cuisine. It does get crowded here but well worth it!Once you've finished, head around the corner and swing by Morganstern for ice cream.","They have expanded! I love this place, and I haven't come in a long time. However, the soba is as good as I remember! I particularly like to come here for the dip soba. They have many flavors of broth that you can choose from, and they even bring you extra broth if you need it! Please note, it's cash only -- I feel this is the main downside of the place.",Cocoron

From the fries to the salad dressing I'm just not sure why nothing is quite right.,AdalyaNY Manhattan Union Square4:30pm Thursday 11th February 2016Four StarsI just stopped to use my Whiskey Passport and I sat in a completely empty bar and restaurant. It has a relative big space with a fun Mediterranean feel. I had a Marker's Mark on the Rocks in a thick lowball glass with cold draft ice cubes.,"I highly recommend this place. Delicious food, incredibly service. You must try this cocktail called ""Phoenix Down""","I went here during the week with a couple friends. It was just ok, I wouldn't go out of my way for it.I had the salmon, and my friends got pasta. The salmon was fine, it came with about 4 spears of asparagus. The service was also a little slow since there was only one waiter. Overall ok, but better options nearby.","I have been coming this place recently so often. I am so happy with service, Caner is great guy at the bar. Great drinks, loved the cocktails here. Food is great, I usually have their flat breads, must try ones, best hummus by tye way. Owner Mustafa had checked on us, very sincere, humble person. Over all they are friendly and and great food.",Adalya
261,Trendy spot in the East Village for Mediterranean/middle eastern food. I tried the grain bowl and my boyfriend had a salad. Both were fine - nothing too special and a bit overpriced. The cocktails were very good. We got a tasty small hummus with pita for checking in on Yelp. There is a really cool speakeasy in the back!,"Overcharged, horrible service. Came here with a large group and our waiter, knowing gratuity was included, basically ignored us all night. He brought us the wrong drink and when we sent it back he gifted it to the neighboring table instead and charged us anyway. I repeatedly asked for water and never got it. Expect average food and prickly service. Or better yet, don't bother.",Service slow. Prices too high for portions. Says they don't have certain meals or wines that are on the menu but then they do. Overly confusing. Cannot stress how slow the food is. Wait staff pretty incompetent as well. food is decent but portions are ridiculous and wait is way too long. Never again,"Local 92 is an amazing place for tapas & Mediterranean food in the East Village. We came here on a Saturday evening. The place was not overly crowded, but we had a reservation anyway.

262,"A GEM. This restaurant was, simply put, amazing. The service, the ambiance, the decor, the FOOD. Oh my God- the FOOD! The flavor was nothing short of mind blowing. I haven't enjoyed a meal like that in many years. The drinks were also delicious. I literally can not wait to come back here. I'd give this location 10 stars if I could.EDIT***WE CAME BACK FOR THEIR BOOZY BRUNCH!It was AMAZING! The wait for a refill can be a little extensive (the wait time overall is something that can use some work but ‍) but the food was to die for.Can't wait to come back.","We were hopeful, but were twice disappointed. The first time we were informed the kitchen was backlogged at least by 45 minutes, so we didn't even stay. The second time, we sat the bar for drinks and one dish. The only redeeming factors are the drinks and the bartender - they are delicious and he appears to be the only one working hard. We ordered the brick chicken, and it took over an hour and three rounds of drinks before we asked them to put it in a to go container. That took another fifteen minutes and when we got around to eating it, it was bland and unimpressive. To rewind, once we got the food, we were considerably surprised by the bill.While the itemization was correct, we were shocked that a vodka soda was the same price as the specialty cocktails. Especially as the soda in both drinks were almost entirely flat and oddly poured from a 2-liter bottle. Seems a bit odd that an otherwise functioning bar wouldn't have a soda-dispensing machine. Will not be returning, plenty of other places to try.","Under sad (and joyous) circumstances, we'd noticed Baron's driving to a friend's passing memorial nearby coupled with music and knew that after the event, Baron's was it. They put those digs to good use. Transforming a (supposedly) former law office into a swankish but cozy-cool eatery. With the exception of a few folks at the Bar, Baron's was strangely quiet on a Thursday night. So we figured, we'd have all the service to ourselves. Menu is short, but man... it had a bit of everything and room to tweak a few items if I had to. My 'French 73' cocktail was delicate and packed a real nice punch. While hubby's Old Fashioned, was also expertly made. We shared a Mushroom Flatbread minus the pancetta. That sucker was so freaking thin---all the Mushrooms, Truffle Oil and the Parmesan made for it- bite after bite. Since our appetizer was heavenly we somehow knew, Entrees would be just as great. But here's the problem...We waited at least 40 minutes to start eating our Entrees. And during that time, Fabrice our server- blamed ""the computer"" for not sending the order to the kitchen. We made the best out of that night. And 2 drinks on the house later, we were still bopping to a funk mix of Jamiroquai, Chaka, Kool & The Gang's, ""Summer Madness"" and Depeche Mode. Mushroom & Ricotta Ravioli dish with Mint-Citrus sauce in all its simplicity- was banging and knew the chef put his foot in it. While hubby raved about his Brick Chicken with bacon and Mashed Potatoes. Fabrice threw in Dessert of my choice but at that moment I felt, we overstayed our welcome and wanted to skip having my Molten Cake there- plus, we had to trek back up to White Plains. So here's my 2¢ in all this, I feel the whole situation would've been downright awful if: (a) our server Fabrice was uptight, (b) food was dreadful, (c) Cocktails were weak or (d) the place wasn't charming. But that wasn't the case. Almost everything made for a solid setting....except for that long wait. And seems that based on reviews, that's Baron's only downfall......so why not do anything about it? My Chocolate Molten Cake? That bad boy was freaking oozing delicious. In the end, it was real nice checking out Baron's on the fly. If I'm in the area, I'd come back.","A GEM. This restaurant was, simply put, amazing. The service, the ambiance, the music, the decor- the FOOD. Oh my God- the FOOD! The flavor was nothing short of mind blowing. I haven't enjoyed a meal like that in many years. The drinks were also delicious. I literally can not wait to come back here. I'd give this location 10 stars if I could.",From (9/13/2019)My fiancée and I came in at 10:03pm (I know this specifically because when it hit 10pm on the dot we decided to walk next door and grab oysters and drinks) and left at 10:40pm when our self-respect and common sense kicked in and we realized we had no food or drinks .  In the almost 40 minutes the lowlights included:-sparklers going out in champagne bottle like a nightclub to a 15-20top with flutes.-the people next to us got their check closed before we were even approached for an order after initially sitting a solid 5-7 minutes.-and of course the breaking point of seeing another couple walk in almost 40 minutes after and get cocktails before us.We want you to succeed but you really need to step your POS (points of service) up.  Your floor manager needs to manage and your server should be more attentive in his section.  It wasn't that busy; 6-8ppl at the bar tops and 26-30 guests on the floor tops.  Highly unacceptable for a slow Friday date night.  Ended up having to drive to Moloko and got my food to go within 20 minutes of being there.  No wonder why this place is always barren.  Do better.  I emailed them in hopes they would be professional and try to rectify the manner in some capacity but a week has passed and no response so you earned your 1-star.  This place is literally attached to my building and I would rather get dressed and drive ANYPLACE else than stay in my pajamas and walk next door for this kind of treatment.,"I really was not expecting to give such a low rating.My fiancé and I made a reservation here for 530 pm tonight to celebrate Father's Day with our parents. We were excited to check this place out after seeing the high ratings and pictures of the cocktails and food. Upon entering, the restaurant was empty however by the time we were leaving every seat except the bar seats were taken. (Tables are decently spaced out so you can't really say that it was so packed and there were soo many people-- in hopes of trying to find a reason for the extremely slow and poor service.) I loved the ambience right away and we were initially warmly greeted. However, the quality of the service quickly declined. We waited way too long for each round of drinks, our appetizers, and our entrees. We received the wrong drink for one of the drinks we ordered and when we brought it to our waitress' attention she said ""Oh"" and walked away. We didn't know whether to expect a new drink or what? Maybe 15 minutes later we finally got the right one.While we were eating our entrees our empty and dirty plates from our appetizers were still standing on the table. We ordered coffee with our dessert but ended up finishing our coffee and then waiting another 15 minutes afterwards before we canceled our dessert order. Once again, our waitress said ""oh, okay, sorry"" when we asked to cancel our dessert and just asked for the check. Really didn't seem like she was bothered much.We also couldn't help but overhear a couple next to us also sound annoyed and cancel their order and ask for their check as well. There are some positive aspects of this place:- Happy hour from 5-7 pm with great discounts on cocktails - A free house wine (red or white) when you check in on Yelp- Food was great, with the exception of the duck being totally burnt and you really couldn't escape that flavor as much as you tried to enjoy it (all you can taste was the extremely charred outer layer ) - Interior decor and ambience However, the service was ridiculously bad and they really did not seem bothered by it at all.",Baron's
263,"Most of the staffs were friendly, but one staff was calling me to get into the restaurant by moving his index finger in a hook shape back and forth, just right in front of me. There are no crowded people, not a situation that he had to use that gesture. Also, it's not the airport, he was not in charge of governmental authorities, but in charge of keep door opening for us, who was standing right in front of him, to get in. So I feel very bad when he used that gesture. I know that gesture is common but also know that this is not regards as polite. He also complained while cleaning up other customer's table right after they had left. Put cutlery and dishes into a basket wildly, which made big noise while we were eating. He better not to work for that place.","4.5 stars***Decor: This place is so cute. Reminds me of a little greenhouse/ dining in a backyard garden. Place is small and kinda hidden so if you're not looking for it, you'll miss it. It's right next door to Zenkichi. I came here on a weekday afternoon so it was not crowded.Food: I ordered the Okinawan Taco Rice and my bf got the Japanese Hamburg steak. I also ordered the matcha milk. Food is delish overall and prices are decent.Service: Nothing notable about service. Nice host and servers and no complaints.","We came in for brunch for a table for two, and was told that we'd have a table ready in 20 minutes. Came back 20 minutes later, and there were 3 two tops visibly available, but they told us to come back in 10 minutes. We came back in 15 minutes to give them time, and they not only told us to wait ten more minutes, but they sat a party of four who put their name on the list after we did. Not only is this severely disrespectful of their customers' time, but it's also a totally inefficient and terrible way to run a restaurant. I'm never going back here again, no brunch is worth being jerked around like this.","A little gem in Williamsburg! The interior of this place is so unique, there's a tree growing in the middle of the restaurant. My boyfriend and I ordered the Okinawan Taco Rice and Tsukune Don (chicken meatballs) as our entree and we loved it. The taco rice was minced pork with rice and salad; it was very flavorful and nicely paired with rice and salad to balance it out. The tsukune don was chicken meatballs with rice, seaweed and sesame seed, surprisingly not too heavy and everything went well together. Highly recommend the matcha cappuccino, one of the best matcha drink I've had and I'm a big matcha fan. The portion of matcha and milk was perfect; a lot of places don't put enough matcha powder but this place knew the right portion; my boyfriend loved it too. The place is a little small so not a good spot for group hangouts but lovely for a date. I came around 11:30am and was seated right away but it did get busy after!","Up too early due to jet lag, I wandered around the burg with the vague mission of getting coffee and a light breakfast. Poked my head into this place and wonder of wonders, it was really a small wonder. Food was excellent and the gardenlike setting was such a nice, relaxing oasis in what's becoming little Manhattan.","House of Small Wonder is a hidden gem. I usually leave brunch feeling eh or wondering what I'm going to eat next but my stomach was filled with not only food but pure happiness after the meal at House of Small Wonder. We arrived around 12:45 on Sunday and were seated right away. Actually, it wasn't very busy today, as one pair finished another was seated right away. They don't take reservations so it's a matter of luck and timing. I was immediately blown away by the decor. Everything is arranged in such a way that the energy just flows throughout the space. Upon entering you'll notice a tree in the middle of the restaurant, it's accompanied by lots of indoor plants and bamboo.There's another tree towards the back counter area as well. The earth tone colors and woods along with the plantlife help to create a quiet oasis experience- a trip outside of the loud New York life. The orange juice and rose lemonade were welcomed refreshing drinks on such a hot day. I ordered the vegetable curry and he ordered the croque madame. The curry was flavorful and not overpowering and the grilled vegetables were cooked and seasoned perfectly! His eggs were extremely fluffy and we both loved the vinaigrette on our salads .It is important to note that this is CASH ONLY. There is an ATM inside the restaurant that charges a $2 fee.I'm also not sure that this would be the best location for a group based on the setup but definitely a great date spot or one on one hangout.The only cons but not enough in my opinion to take away a star1. A photographer arrived after we started eating to take photos for the restaurant's  social media/website. I didn't see a sign stating that that would be the case before we entered but saw it while we were leaving.  I hope they got my good angles 2. The waiters sometimes take a while to do things. We waited several minutes for our check as it stemmed our waiter got sidetracked. The people next to us had to keep asking for their check and for their change.",House of Small Wonder
264,"I've been in this city for like six weeks and I'm tired of writing long-ass reviews for pizza, so let's just say L'industrie is the only place I've been to so far where I'm willing to go back for $4+/slice pizza.Also I just ate a sad salad and writing this two sentence review has made me hungry again, dammit.","These must be fake 5 star reviews. Ordered delivery, said 50 min, then updates to 2 hours and 30 min and person there says this is normal. Then told me I was the one who had to call the app customer service to cancel it even though they were the ones that are just incredibly slow and unorganized. Wasted over an hour of my time waiting for these clowns to get there act together. Ended up just walking down the road to Vinnies - way better. Edit: and now the owner is threatening me with saying 'he has all my information', has called me 10+ times and harassing me on WhatsApp and is saying he is going to come to my house. Reporting to police. This guy is obviously unhinged. Had to call the police.","After all the hype this place has been getting, I added it to my bookmarks list.If you're not already in the area, I don't think it's that good of a slice.Their whole thing is they'll do any of their slices or pies to order (they only have regular pies premade and they'll add stuff to it and throw it in the oven for you). I guess on most high traffic days, things will be fresh enough. But when I went, there had to be 6 pies just sitting in their shelf waiting for people to order. It was a hot summer day, so I assume all the gentrifiers went to the beach. Massimo (the owner) didn't seem as friendly as the photos and stories I'd heard made him out to seem. Kinda felt like he was annoyed at everything, but I'll chalk it up to a bad business day.Anyway, I got a margherita and a burrata slice. Both were okay, but nothing extraordinary. Crust was light, but kind of stale. Maybe more time in the oven would've worked in their favor. The burrata slice (which Massimo recommended) was fine, but nothing mindblowing. The cheese was fresh enough though.The space is tiny, so if it's busy (or if there are a bunch of Chads talking about buying pizza and 30 racks for a house party), it'll be annoyingly crowded. Cash only, and no bathrooms either.","Food: 5/5   Price: 4/5  Service 5/5 Ambiance: 4/5  Bang for your buck: 4/5 Recommendations: You have to try the burrata pizza! Put some hot oil on the side to dip your pizza. Would I come back?: Yes! Tips: It's a small pizza place with a few tables. I would recommend getting your pizza to go or making sure that you have a table before you order. Review: We were looking at open houses around the area, and I am so glad we were able to stop by. All of the pizza options start with a red or white pizza base. Then they put the ingredients on based on which slice/pizza you order. The burrata slice is a must-try. With a crispy and chewy base with the creamy, savory burrata on top, it made a red sauce slice (I usually don't like red sauce) one of the best slices of pizza I had in NYC. You can't go wrong with the other slices. Just get the one with toppings you like. You won't be disappointed.",The pizza here is absolutely unreal. Not sure how they do it but the crust is perfectly crispy on the bottom and chewy on the top....BY FAR the best pizza I've had in NY! The place itself is tiny with a few seats inside and a few tables/benches outside. The slices are pretty small so it definitely makes sense to order a whole pie if it's for multiple people. They have red and white pies and the toppings are added fresh. Words honestly cannot express how amazing the pizza here is...just try it for yourself.,"I have to agree, this is definitely one of the best slices in New York!! I love their technique of having their two base pies(red and white) ready to go and then adding fresh topping when you make your order. We had the special prosciutto-hot honey-ricotta slice and New York Slice. Both were fantastic. Not over cooked/not burnt, excellent form. Crust was just right. This is what all New York slices should be like!I can't wait to return for another slice!",L'industrie Pizzeria

Decor was fine.Service?  Disinterested. But here's the kicker: of the 4 items we tried, each one had a fatal flaw. And to make things worse my dining companion got the runs after eating the Pla Prik Khao (Chicken, String Beans, and Birdseye peppers).My dish was just wrong. I got the duck leg confit red curry. Sickeningly sweet with coconut milk, lychee nuts, and canned pineapple and they deep fried the duck leg. It was greasy yet tough and dry. How is that even possible?Even the garnish of cold, hard, nasty tasting fried tofu on the starter salad was a travesty.I wanted to love it here, but, man, I just don't. With so many good Thai places in Manhattan, I will not return.  ONoOWhat OShameNO Bao for me.NOBAO NOHOW!","We came here for dinner around 10pm on a Thursday after seeing Hamilton.  The walk was quite short from the theater district, but still managed to get us out of the annoying crowds that were just a block or two away.At 10pm, the place was rather empty, though not completely dead.    I ordered the Khao Soi and a glass of sake.  Very quick service, as both arrived shortly after ordering.    The sake was enjoyable, and I found the Khao Soi to be flavorful and hearty.  Although it was still good without adding any ""heat"" to it, I like spicy, and so I asked for some fixings tso that I could spice it up myself...  I believe they gave me something like a sriracha sauce or chili garlic sauce (was a week ago, so I don't recall exactly), and it worked perfectly to spice up the dish, while still maintaining its delicious base flavor.If looking for a late night place after an evening Broadway show, I'd definitely recommend Obao.","This was a great find on a Saturday night!

If you are looking for bbq, this restaurant is a total miss","I've been living in Astoria for years now, and finally decided to eat at this supposed neighborhood staple. We visited after the dinner rush in a weeknight, and I noticed that our waitress had a friend come into the restaurant, which normally would not be anything to write about. However, after our waitress ""took"" our order (i.e. tried to memorise it), she then proceeded to have a lengthy conversation with her friend as she was putting our order into the register. So of course, our order came out wrong! She messed up our drink order, forgot to add the extra honey butter for our cornbread, completely forgot an entire entree, and put in the wrong order for ribs. She was completely unapologetic about it, and even had a bad attitude when we pointed out what was missing.Oh, and these ribs... apparently the ""Fall of the Bone"" St. Louis-style ribs are nothing more than the dry-rub ribs with BBQ sauce poured on top. Anyone with an inkling of barbecue knowledge knows that St. Louis-style ribs are supposed to be finished on the grill with sauce, and not just have the sauce simply poured on the top afterwards. And they certainly were not falling off the bone at all!Horrible waitress and bad bbq ribs. At least the mac & cheese and garlic broccoli were decent - hence 2 stars...","I was hungover and cramping, their chili cheese fries are the absolute bomb so I decided to order some to be delivered as a way of treating myself! Extra jalapeños! Turns out I wasn't supposed to be able to order them online during brunch time Oops! Instead of calling to cancel they called letting me know that it would just take slightly longer for the kitchen to prep the necessary things! So so sweet of them especially since I said they didn't have to!!The brussel sprouts here are also some of the best I've ever had! Definitely not healthy for your body but top notch for your soul","Really expected this place to be great based on the 4 star rating with over 1,900 reviews plus the hype it was getting from friends that picked it....but it fell short. For starters, the beer I ordered was no longer being served (but was one of the 10 being advertised), the food took almost an hour to come out (the place was probably 1/4 filled. Not busy at all), AND when the food finally did come the order was wrong. So needless to say I was not too happy with the first impression. -Smoke House BBQ Burger: 3/5, it was alright. The burger itself was like any other burger with bbq sauce on it. I've gotten burgers before with pulled brisket or pork on top so I was excited thinking this was the same, it was not. Instead it was two slices of very mediocre brisket slapped on top of the burger. This was my mistake as I thought it would be pulled not sliced. -Beef Brisket: 2/5, honestly shocked at how underwhelming the brisket was here. Very dry, with not much flavor. -Mac & Cheese: 4/5, thankfully this was great and saved the meal. For $6 I had high hopes which were met by this side. Great flavor. Overall, had I gone into this place not knowing about all the hype and hearing everyone rave about it I would've thought it was just another BBQ joint. After eating here though I personally feel that I would not return. The food and the experience were both subpar and I've definitely had much better BBQ food at other spots. Still glad I gave this place a shot though.","Went with the family for my dads bday party of 5. Great BBQ spot in Astoria. Love the Decor huge American flag hanging on the wall. Started with an appetizer had the ""burnt ends"". It's small taste great you can kill it by yourself.   The ""smoked pork belly"" basically chicharrón thinly sliced. It comes with the "" Porkys platter"" You can't go wrong with that. Got that with max & cheese it was on point! My dad got the dry rubbed ribs very tasty. My brother ordered ""fall of the bone"" ribs had wayyyy to much bbq sauce so ask for it on the side.   Service was GREAT! Our servers name was Christina she was helpful when my dad asked a billion questions. She was energetic, informative,patient and did all that with a smile. They don't wear name tags she has light eyes and a smile that could light up a room! She recommended the ""bourbon banana bread"" which was really good. All it that was missing was a scoop of ice cream to go along with it. Idk what they pay her but GIVE HER A RAISE!!!!   Will definitely be back Great food and Great service! Also, check in and you'll get 10% of your bill of $20 or more!",Butcher Bar

Empanadas (cheese and onion and chicken) were delish, a special salad that was amazing and pappardelle special that was just ok. The pasta itself was thick and tough and the sauce was quite good. The Alfajor Rústico dessert was wonderful and a must have. Bon appetite.","My go-to spot for brunch in Williamsburg. I go a few times a month. I've never been for dinner though. I don't understand how there isn't a line out the door, but there's never been a wait. Great spot for an improtu brunch with a group of friends. When friends come visit it's always on the agenda. For around $20 you can get a coffee, cocktail and steak from the pre-fix menu which is unheard of in the neighborhood. Food is great. Cocktails are great. Ambiance is great. The patio is super serene and quiet with natural shade. I can't recommend it enough.",Tabaré
268,Its like eating in an inky dinky tiny little donky doll like restaurant and you are a super huge giant ogre..... BUT boy is it WORTH IT... The Lomita Saltado is delicious!The Cholita drink - is to die for! Seriously the food here is Equidorian heaven!MUST try! I drive 2 hours just to eat there! I.kid.you.not!!!! YUM YUM YUM YUM!,"Mmmm, squashed interior meets succulent flavors. Fine, sure, sit on my lap, so long as I can still access the Fritadas (lean chunks of pork with mashed yucca, green salad) and Sudado De Camarón (shrimp in onions, tomato, peppers and cilantro sauce, with yellow rice and green salad). I'm drooling just thinking about it (not the lap-sitting, the food)...",No no to Ñaño!Food was not good and service was meh plus waiter added a tip on the bill for two people.,"This was my first experience with Ecuadorian food, and boy did it blow my mind.  I got the seco de pollo. Tender, slightly chewy pieces of chicken, smothered in a tangy sauce that somehow balanced overwhelmingly bright cirtrus flavors with subtle spice notes.  Plenty of fluffy, well-seasoned rice to soak up all of that sauce.  Creamy fresh avocados cut through the tanginess of the dish.  Spicy sauce on the side.  Tender, sweet roasted plantains bring it all together.Nana Ecuadorian Kitchen is intimate and cozy.  The restaurant is small, and probably seats around 20.  The owner was working on his computer in the restaurant while I ate, and we chatted a bit.  The chef came out and asked me how I liked the food.  This restaurant made me wish I spoke Spanish.","I've eaten a ton of cuisines over the years, but never had Ecuadorian.  Glad I stopped by because I just learned it was delicious!  I'll definitely work it into my rotation of Peruvian, Brazilian, Colombian and Argentinian eating going forward.Encocado de Camarón: I absolutely love tostones, so this was right up my alley.  Basically tostones molded into a  small cup shape with shrimp in the middle.  It looks like an appetizer you'd eat with your hand, but don't do it!  There are some hot sauces going on that can scold your hand a bit.  A fork and knife is fine, no shame.Fritada: Fried pork chunks, because obviously crispy pork is the best kind of pork!  Kind of a mishmash of other stuff though.  Fried potato chunks, avocado slices, pickled onions (which pair perfectly against the pork), sweet plantains and some random salad.  I did like the peanut dipping sauce, reminded me a bit of satay, but wish it was a bigger portion.Seco de Pollo: I can see why everyone on Yelp raves about this!  Tons of delicious orange sauce hosting a very generous portion of boneless chicken slices. The chicken was so tender. The sauce wasn't spicy hot, but it was full of delicious spices.  Had a unique taste which was different from the other Latin American cuisines I've had.  The fluffy rice didn't go to waste, since it had an important job with all that sauce.  Also, appreciated the sweet plantains to contrast the savoriness of the dish.","During Fleet week we visited Ñaño for lunch. It was late, probably close to 2pm. The small establishment was 3/4 full! Lots of interesting items on the menu, we opted a coconut curry shrimp appetizer, a soup for our son and we tried the tripe and lamb stew with rice. Interesting flavors. The lamb stew uses a local fruit that gives it a tangy, sour taste - very appetizing. The tripe stew is mildly rich and tender. Definitely ask for the house made hot salsa to kick it up a notch. The only ""surprise"" was a glass of regional red wine priced at $14. If it was cheaper, I might have two or more.",Ñaño Ecuadorian Kitchen
269,"I ate here for dinner the night before last with my friends and half of us got food poisoning from the burgers. The staff was nice but, damn, I regret eating here for some over priced contaminated burgers.Update: the staff isn't that nice after all.Apparently, I have to site my sources now: newyork.cbslocal.com/201…","Ate here with family (6) after 9/11 Memorial Museum around 3pm. Mildly Busy. Very short walk ~5 min.  Food was good quality. We are all easy to please but nothing too special. Cool atmosphere. Front of the house staff unprofessional. We got sat quick, food came quick, service was below average in terms of drinks. Some servers half-dressed sitting in the table directly next to us folding napkins throughout our entire meal. Manager sat at bar on phone and drinking beer on his phone after running back and forth trying to help the servers take care of the mild rush. I almost started sweating because of how fast he ran back and forth across the restaurant shouting things at the servers.",Horrible service. Still waiting for our food 40 min later No refills. Still waiting on a drink we ordered when we first arrived,"Came back on our latest visit to NYC and was just as good as last time. The keftedes and suspenders burger were on point!!---------------------Amazing gastropub that we found on Yelp. The French onion soup was the cheesiest ever, the shepherds pie was so good, and the chicken skewers and salad were over the top good.

Tuesday afternoon, not many people inside, so was able to grab a seat at the bar and order quickly.Decided on the Meatloaf to go along with a draft beer (total $25ish). Food comes fairly quickly (surprising considered what I ordered) - a large slab of meatloaf and mashed potatoes covered in gravy with a few pieces of buttered broccoli to the side. Meatload wasn't as warm as I would have hoped, yet the flavor was on point. Seasoned well and good texture. Mashed potatoes were blazing hot on the other hand, which is tempered by the semi-sweet gravy. Broccoli isn't bad either.Overall straightforward restaurant, service was quick (maybe too quick for the meatloaf) and the menu is what you would expect. Fine enough place for a sit down meal.",Suspenders Restaurant & Bar
270,"Don't let pictures they have fool you. The food was so bad that I was shocked that this place is so popular. New Yorkers really can eat anything! The soup dumplings were sticked to the plate, so when we tried to grab it, all juice was gone. Moreover, the meat filling tasted like some cheap can food. Fried chicken we got was over salted and was definitely a leftover from yesterday that was heated up in a microwave.  Other wishes we got were not as terrible but it definitely wasn't delicious. Result- we spent about $100 and left hungry.","Just dropping by to drop a 2 star rating. To give a TLDR, our server at the bar always seemed preoccupied. It is impossible to get his attention even when we were literally right in front of him. When we asked him for a cup of water, I kid you not... it was like his mind went somewhere else while he washes his protein shake bottles.","Went here today for the first time. Wow, service was extremely poor. We ordered a few tiny dishes and ordered drinks. Drinks never came and neither did the server. I mean like ever.  As we sat there with empty bowls  for about 20 mins without the drinks or the server in sight, we finally waved  a server over and asked what happened to the drinks. The place was almost empty. There was really no reason for their inattentive behavior. No apology. In fact, it almost seemed as if they didn't care. I left hungry and upset. Won't be back.","Sichuan food is one of the pillars holding up my food pyramid.  We live in Fort Greene and had found a solid place, but it really was only satiating, we never walked out of there swooning over the foods we'd just eaten.  We were swooning over the dishes at Birds of a Feather.It was only my wife and I there, so we couldn't do much more than 2 dishes and an appetizer - but BoaF went 3 for 3.  Their MaPo tofu was one of the better versions I've ever had - they nailed all the expected bold flavors and did enough ""little things"" right to make it stick out as something special.  The Chungking spicy chicken (seen it called Chong Qing elsewhere) was a really solid rendition, if unmemorable, but I'd order it again.  The sichuan pickled vegetables were really good, perfect heat, great flavor, nicely complimented the other two dishes.We will definitely be back, and plan on making BoaF our default Brooklyn sichuan place.","Came here last Friday.  Initially made a reservation for 4 at 6pm.  We ended up being 5 and the restaurant gladly gave us an additional seat.  The restaurant is adorable inside.  The staff are very attentive.We ordered the following to share:-  Thousand year old eggs w/ tofu:  This was delicious.  The tofu had great texture and paired really well with the thousand year old egg. -  Mung bean noodles:  This was ok.  It was tart.  Pass on this.-  Husband and wife special:  The tripe was very good.  Very thinly sliced and flavorful.  -  Poached wontons:  I enjoyed these.  The wontons were decently sized and went nicely with the chili oil, not very spicy-  Mapo tofu:  This had some nice flavor as well, eat this with rice!-  Curious chicken:  Pass.  The wintermelon was good, but the chicken wasn't great-  Order the purple rice!!!","Serious hidden gem! We were party of four and in search of some food with heat (in summer) and tried a couple of dishes and told our server to make it xtra spicy. The dishes are explosion of flavors and we couldn't stop eating. Plus, cool vibe, friendly staff and wallet will thank you.",Birds of a Feather
271,"Where is the uni?  I went here based on the review and the pictures with delicious looking uni.  Upon arriving, I was rushed to order. What the?  The waitress was uneased when I asked for an extra minute to find alternative since uni is not in season.  Yeah right!  I got the bowl with salmon roe, salmon and tuna.  I have to give them credit for freshness, but minus for small portion, too much rice and in oversized bowl.  I tried it, not impressed and moving on.","Highlight of the night was the mushroom miso soup! I ordered the sashimi platter and it was decent, however at $38 it was neither worth the quality nor quantity. Kaoru has good customer service, but falls severely short in offering a dining experience and for this reason along with the high price of fish I would not dine here again.","Very small portion compared to before, they give you 5 pieces and charge 30$, it use to be a bowl full of sashimi that you could not even finish, now you are left hungry and there is no uni!!!!","This. Place. Is. So. Good! Definitely worth going to - and a place that I would want to come back to again!I got the Tres Amigos, which includes salmon, tuna, hamachi, spicy tuna, and yaki salmon. The portions are very generous, and the flavors were all very complimentary. Was a very solid meal that was very filling.","Oh I really wanted to enjoy my meal but something was off with the uní (sea urchin) I had on Monday night. I am a big uni lover and do not have a sensitive tummy but oh boy, I didn't do so well the morning after having my uni don dinner.I think it was a fluke that the uni wasn't super fresh (I also tasted some pieces of rocks in my uni). My friends got other bowls such as the three amigos and they loved it!Aside from my bad experience, the place was very cozy with oversized booth and the staffs were friendly.Also give the plum/orange wine a try, it was delicious. If the yam sticks are on the menu, make sure to try that!","Don't be confused this is not your run of the mill Japanese place. They don't serve any sushi or any of the typical items you would find on a japanese/american menu. The vibe in here is soothing with toned down decor. They have bar type seating as well as a few tables. There aren't a ton of items here but all you need to know is they do fresh seafood right. I went with the three amigos don over white rice. It had salmon, spicy tuna, and regular tuna. Think of this bowl as deconstructed sushi. All the ingredients are there but you can enjoy them separately. If you are looking for a unique authentic take on Japanese cuisine come here. Cool spot",Kaoru
272,"Came here for a Sunday night for dinner, arrived 15 mins after they open and we were told the table won't be ready for another 15 mins. So we came back after 15 mins and this time the receptionist said it is ready, but that table we got was empty this whole time, and there were so many empty tables in the back which I highly doubt were all for reservations. Not sure why they won't allow us to sit right away.Let's talk about the food. We ordered the cheese and meat platter, the roasted eggplant, and bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese. They were all average to my opinion. The cheese and meat platter was beautifully presented, nothing special, but probably still the best among the three. Roasted eggplant was nothing impressive either. The bacon wrapped dates were overcooked, almost burnt. I also ordered their rosé sangria, which is also a meh - taste like water.It is overpriced considering the food quality and portions comparing with other Soho restaurants. We are pretty disappointed overall. It is a nice place for a date - very small space so you can get more intimate conversations if you don't care about what you eat or how much money you spend..",Went here with a work group and ordered the chef menu. This means they just send out food till you are full! I preferred the appetizers to the main food. The patina was not my favorite and seemed bland compared to the rest of the food. You cannot go wrong with the sangria here!,"I came here for the first time for brunch on Sunday. The food was really flavorful, but the service was terrible. As a group of three, we were seated at a table meant for two people and were also seated next to this HUGE vent that was nearly touching the table. It was a bit gross to be right next to it during a meal. The service was so slow that it took us over two hours to get through the whole meal because we had to wait long intervals for the food to arrive. It took over 45 minutes to get our first dish - the shrimp with bread. It took over 90 minutes for the paella to be served. Come here only if you have patience and aren't seated at the table in the front...","I really love this place, have been here over 10 times. We normally go for brunch but also at other points too. To start: the service is great - they're always attentive, but not so much that it's annoying.  The food - always spectacular and reasonably priced, the brunch is about $45 with bottomless red/rose/white sangria or mimosa. It's not overly watered down although the ice adds up so after a couple may be worth asking for a new glass. The food is good portions and never leave hungry.","The only thing good here is the ambience. Food: 2 starservice 3 star We came here on a crowded Friday night. Attracted by the old-fashion front decoration and the hanging Jamón, we thought this would be an authentic Spanish tapa place. It turned out to be a trap! The dish here definitely has the size of tapa but each with $10-18. We ordered  SALTEADO DE SETAS （Sautéed  mushroom),  pretty bad with salty and sour taste and extremely small, PATATAS BRAVAS (fried potato), extremely salty, CALAMARES (squid), with three small pieces of squid and a lot white beans,  ALBÓNDIGAS (lamb meatballs), the only one satisfying. The dishes were served extremely slow, after we finished first two and then a long while came the last two. The wine was good, but when we picked two different wine and ask for trying before buying, the waiter just trying to convince us there were no difference between the two wine and suggested only to take the same, whereas my friend understood the wine were very different.   I tried authentic tapas in Spain and the dishes here were nowhere close to that. It's more like fusion with American food.  I don't suggest this place as a Spanish restaurant .","Solid tapas spot - I definitely recommend coming in a group! Sangrias are great - love that there's more than just red or white. Came in a group of three and we had the Ensalada Cogolles, Pulpo a la Plancha, and the medium Paella. All of it was delicious and it was the perfect amount of food for three. Just wish we could've tried more dishes, but the portions are just too large despite it being 'tapas' style. The waitress recommended 2-3 dishes per person, but honestly 1-2 would have been plenty for each of us. Would be difficult to come here in a group of 2.",Boqueria Soho
273,"This place is super crowded, but still nice for Sunday brunch. Definitely try the blue cheese chips they are to die for! I got the Benedict Johnny. Do. Not. Recommend. This dish is just weird. Nothing goes together. The chicken sausage has a strange flavor that didn't go with the dish. The cornbread was dry and blah. The couple next to me got the  Mac n cheese and I wish I had done the same.","This place is very busy all the time and I don't really like the ""chain"" feel of it. Unfortunately we were seated in a far back room that had horrible sound acoustics and basically no windows. The waiters seem very busy all the time. I'll say the food was very good but also not sure I'd be ok paying that price for it again all things considered. I paid upwards of $65 for calamari, a kale salad without protein, and a fish sandwich. We did not order drinks.",Saturday brunchPros:Nice decor I recommend the breakfast pot pie. Very delicious!Cons:I ordered pear cider and thought it would be like hot apple cider only made from pear. Turned out its beer! The waiter didn't explain it to me very well.I saw pictures of breakfast pot pie posted by other yelpers and they have 3 eggs on top. My cane with 2 eggs! :( not fair.My friend ordered sandwich and it was actually a burger. 95%of the plate is occupied by fries. And it's not cheap!,"Great service! Our waiter was fun, attentive and engaging.Food was also very good! Cinnamon Toast Brioche was warm, fluffy and tasty!!The breakfast pot pie was unique!! Very flavorful and a must try. The filling was a lot of the breakfast stuff you like in a light sausage gravy sauce. The top was essentially a biscuit baked  crisp then topped with a sunny side up egg. A bit pricey but worth it!",BananasCrazy busy for Sunday brunch at 11a. But if you have a reservation the chaos is well worth it. Fast service and the food was perfect.,"-First Impression- Boy was this place packed! Especially the outdoor seating (it was a very nice day). The outdoor tables are VERY close together.-Food- Everything was delicious. I ordered The Smith Burger. came with a mountain of fries. The spicy ketchup was great on the mountain of fries that came with the burger (I dipped the fries, I'm not a savage). The cinnamon toffee brioche tastes almost like a Cinnabon, very good! Washed it all down with a piping hot cappuccino.-Service- As mentioned before, this place was pretty much FULL, but the staff was very attentive and accommodative. We didn't have to ask for a thing (except for an extra fork because I dropped mine)-Price- Most items seem pretty reasonably priced (see menu pics)-Did Not Like- It can be a bit difficult to hear what your dining partner is saying as you can hear all the other conversations going on at other tables, but I was so into the food that I got over it pretty quickly, lol-Noteworthy- I'ms still thinking about that burger...-Recommended?- Absolutely!",The Smith
274,"Found this restaurant because of Groupon and saw all the good reviews so I bought one.  Before I went I saw most of the reviews said they have a separate limited menu for groupon users and it wasn't really worth it.  I went in with that expectation, but the waiter said I could chose anything on the menu except this one expensive fish dish.  I was skeptical but we were both able to pick out dishes we wanted.  The crispy calamari (appetizer to share), Nasi Kerabu with Fried Chicken and Mee Goreng (2 entrees) and 2 thai iced teas (2 drinks).  We could have gotten beers or wines but we didn't really want it.  Glad we had the option to pick anything from the menu.  Our final bill did deduct the groupon and we just had to pay the taxes plus gratuity.  I guess they changed their policy, but just be aware your visit can be different.  Food was very good and worth it with the groupon.",i was disappointed in the dish ASAM PEDAS as its not your authentic ASAM PEDAS. This restaurant is more thai than Malaysian and I would not recommend it to my friends or anyone that want to taste AUTHENTIC MALAYSIAN DISHES. I would recommend Nyonya in Chinatown. I am from Malaysia and I know all the Malaysian dishes. And to be served this POSER ASAM PEDAS is a slap to my face. Please educate your customers correctly of what the real MALAYSIAN CUISINES is all about. I came here for the experience and taste but walked out with Disappointment.,"Worst Thai food I ever had! I even let the waitress know that the beef tasted like rubber and she did absolutely nothing about it. Will never come again, and definitely do not recommend it. I wish I could give zero stars!","Absolutely delicious and very veggie friendly. I got the Malaysian curry with tofu and it was so, so good on a cold day. Reservations were easy here. The restaurant was full but never had people waiting.The staff are incredible. The are so proud of their food, rightfully so, and so hospitable. When they found out I was vegetarian, they thanked me (yay!) and rolled out a million options for me. They even let us try their fried pappadam chips and pick my favorite to order a bowl of. If I go back, I'm going to the veg version of the fried chili chicken. The servings are hugeMy only negative is that the quantify of rice served with the curry is pretty small. Beware: If you order the chili fried chicken (or other protein), it is extremely spicy! Spicy for me means VERY SPICY.","Absolutely delicious and very veggie friendly.

275,"I was in town for work so it was just myself. I called them and they said they don't take tables of 1, that I must purchase 2 orders to be able to dine at their restaurant! Sucks! Lots of people eat alone and that's just straight rude. Just letting others know so they don't eat at this establishment, if they're coming in alone!Edit: I went to another restaurant and they served me. This isn't the standard.","This place is overrated. This place might be one of the worst KBBQ experiences I've had.We ordered their signature AYCE. The shortribs were of the lowest quality. It was rubbery and tough. We told the server and he giggled and said ""maybe you will like the pork ribs instead?"".  I'll cut to the chase, ALL the beef items suck. Dry and looked gray. Flavors were weak. The pork items were better especially the jowl. Overall, the meats were a let down at nearly $40. I've had better food quality at a korean spa than this at a fraction of the price. They never refilled our banchan and they never took away the empty bowls. The seafood pancake was good but they didnt give us any dipping sauce. Thats like getting a burger with fries and not having ketchup!The server cooking our food kept mixing the cooked and uncooked meat. Last thing I want is to get food poisoning from cross contamination.","I've been meaning to come here since it's opened and I have to say that it's not worth it compared to non-AYCE places or even non-authentic BBQ places like 99 Favor.Reservations - Why bother? Our group made a reservation for 8 and didn't get seated until 8:30. The hostess kept coming over to us to ask us what our reservation was and then, without giving an update, walking away (what?!). Then, when we asked when we'll be seated, she told us to come over and that it'll be ready. So we went from a more open space where we weren't in anyone's way to crowding the waiting area, then she told us to move because the table wasn't ready and we were crowding the area. That was what we were trying to avoid! No communication about wait times and very disappointed we had to wait 30 minutes with a reservation. Especially, when we were seated, we saw 3 tables open for our party size. Food - First, it's AYCE so I get that I'm not getting the best quality. That's fine. Nothing to write home about here. But, the banchan is mediocre at best and they skimp on the sauces (which is disappointing because you need more sauce when the meat isn't great). Also, the choices in non-meat options such as veggies like mushrooms or seafood are extremely slim. Service - It's their policy here to make you order in waves, and unfortunately, they seem short staffed so you have to wait to order a lot. This is probably a ploy to get you not to order as much since there is a 100 minute limit. I get it, they have to make money somehow and Midtown rent is expensive. Our server was friendly and definitely tried his best, but it was not a timely service so we ended up cooking everything ourselves. Our server definitely deserved his tip, but I felt bad for how much he had to handle!   Beware, though, they will put raw meat on top of cooked things! This gave me the food safety heebie jeebies, but I didn't get food poisoning.","Today was actually my second time dining in at Let's Meat and it was definitely such a huge improvement compared to our last visit! We came in for the lunch special and it was an amazing experience. They have a decently sized selection for just $20 AYCE per person. Amazing spot if you want to have affordable and delicious korean bbq! I definitely recommend the thin sliced meat, such as the marinated sliced ribeye and the thin brisket as well. They were super yummy, especially with the marinated sauce. It goes super well with the provided sides as well as the side sauces! I do recommend the tofu stew, it's just the perfect amount of spice: not too spicy and not too bland where you can't taste the flavor. I do like how they leave a big container of water on your table so you won't have to constantly ask for refills. One of the major improvements I noticed was the service. We were served b two different staff today, one seemed really out of it but the other was so amazing! Sean helped out our table today and described everything patiently to us since we were unfamiliar with the process. He was very attentive and made sure that our grilled meats were never overcooked or burnt. Our side dishes were always refilled and he always made sure to check up on us to see if we needed any help or any extra food. Even when it was busy, Sean made sure to smile, greet, and thank each customer that walked in and out of the restaurant. Very friendly and nice server along with amazing food. The only concern that I have is that the grill splashed/popped burning oil on me a few times. The path to the bathroom could also be a lot cleaner as well. Other than that, I think it was a great experience-- will definitely return!",Overall This place was okay. Set up a group dinner for my husbands birthday here. The hostess had an attitude and we didn't get our table until some time after our reservation. Everyone was starving by then. So when the hostess call my groups name we were excited so we proceeded to walk in. And the hostess didn't say anything until most of the group was already inside and the music was so loud. She ended up yelling at us for walking in and being excited which put a damper on the half of the group that did hear. But whatever we finally sat down and the food was okay. It was hard to have conversations in a group cause it was so loud there. But our stomachs was full. And our waitress was great which made the experience more fun. The food: overall the food is okay for an all you can eat. The spicy squid was not really spicy. The seafood pancake was good. The steamed egg was okay. It wasn't like the steamed egg I've had at other places. The shrimp was marinated pretty well. It may be a while before I come back here. I've been to better spots.,"Been coming here since the year it opened. Brought dates, friends, clients, and anyone who wanted to experience Korean BBQ in a nice clean place with great service and quality meats. I recently brought my friends here for my birthday, and this will most likely be a tradition I'll keep every year since it was such a big hit.Initially LM did not offer the ""all you can eat"" option, so when they started that I was concerned the quality will degrade like most other cheap joints, but that did NOT happen at all here. Quality is still top notch. This place is clean, so i bring my Korean BBQ first timers here without hesitation.My friends and I consider non-meat dishes to be a waste of time/distraction normally, but I have to say the haemul pajeon (seafood pancake) is really good... Enough to distract me and my BBQ loving friends to order multiple dishes, and take away from our serious meat consumption time.I don't know how they are still open and not broke, because whenever I bring my friends we always do the AYCE option... It's the best bang for your buck. The alcohol selection is pretty good here...We usually order the tower of beer.I'd recommend making reservations.",Let's Meat

I ask to remake it for the third time and it was rare (i.o. medium rare) and bland.

Which would be fine, but for what happened below. I ordered the BR burger. When I ordered, the waitress asked ""do you want fries or tots?"" I said fries.Order comes. Burger is overcooked and horrible. Fries and oversalted and horrible.My wife ordered the tacos, 3 different ones. The waitress came back twice because she couldn't remember the order. Hint: Write it down.Bill came. Got a great surprise. She charged us $5 for those crappy fries. In what world, do you ask someone fries or tots - without saying their extra - and then charge them extra? In a world where you don't want a tip, I guess. In sum: horrible food, horrible service, overpriced crap.Maybe this place is better for drinks, when it's just you and the bartender.But Do. Not. Eat. Here.","We came here for the oyster happy hour, however, they ran out by the time we got there. The bartender suggested we visit The Oyster Bar at the Roxy Hotel for an oyster happy hour, but we stayed for some other bar food anyways. The onion rings, Brussels sprouts, and tater tots were very good and well priced with the 3 side combo option.  There weren't many draft options though.","I came here for brunch on a Sunday and it was better than expected, but still just ok. This place is a late night bar, so I give it points for offering weekend brunch. But even still, they only open at noon and the menu is pretty small. I ordered the French toast, which looked like it was burnt, but actually tasted pretty good. Nothing really wowed me with its creativity. Definitely lacked in visual presentation, but made up for it in flavor. The service was a bit scarce, even though it wasn't busy until my friends and I were about to leave. Furthermore, it wasn't really at the service standard for brunch time, but rather for late night at a bar. Overall, I probably wouldn't recommend it nor return.","Even if you love Belle Reve in the summer for their epic summer *pool parties, you should make thema rotation any season. With a patio permit, on weirdly unseasonable day ends up being a day to drink al fresco. *NYC pool party with open fire hydrants, we're not talking Amalfi Coast. But it's arguably better?",Belle Reve
277,"I just want to say first that I love the food and drinks here...normally. Last Friday my friends and I tried to eat here and had a really negative experience. Not sure I'll be coming back.We got to the restaurant around 5:30 for an early happy hour/dinner. Waited in line to order for about 30-35 minutes. Got to the front of the line, and was told that there was a big take out order placed, so they will not be taking any orders for the next 30 minutes. Wouldn't even write down our order, we were told we'd have to wait on line again. We figured we'd get drinks at least--then were told the frozen mojito machine is broken. We left. I understand the restaurant is busy which is why I'll wait on line to order for 35 minutes, but to be told that because they took a take out order on a busy friday night instead of serving customers in the restaurant is just poor planning. Again, love the food here, but last Friday it was poorly staffed and badly executed. Don't recommend coming here on a weekend, I guess?","This place is designed so well on the exterior! So cUte! The interior seating feels a bit gross. My gal pal and I ordered the nachos, which you pick up at the ""decorated food truck outside"" They were ok. NOTE: this restaurant is cash only. The menu advertises that they have movie nights on their outdoor patio and dj on some nights. The music was very low at conversational level tonight. I don't think I'll return. Food, ambiance, and vibe didn't peak my interest.",Food was extremely bland.. no taste whatsoever. I had chicken and guacamole burrito.  Chipotle tastes better.,"This spot is cool. Music is good and so is the food. My partner had the chicken plate and I had the chicken and guacamole burrito, we both enjoyed it along with a bottled beer and a frozen drink. I also had the waffle sticks 1/5 stars. Cons: the frozen drink could've used a tab bit more alcohol. The beer could've been colder.The waffle sticks were not made of pancake mix at all.. maybe cornmeal? DO NOT try these, they're inexpensive but kind of salty and really just a waste of energy. The only good part of it was being able to have syrup with it. They should honestly invest in either replacing the metal tables with something that doesn't absorb heat or more canopies/umbrellas. Common sense. Also maybe some bug repellants? Why four stars? The first dj did a great job with playing a variety of Spanish and English music of all several genres, and aside from the waffle sticks, the food is really tasty and affordable. And the place is powered by the sun so that's a plus.","So we got here on a Friday evening so the line being long was understandable. There are two registers: first you order your food at one, then you order drinks and corn at another. We waited about 10/15 minutes in the line to order and then waited about 35 for our food ‍. We watched as the same numbers came up on the board multiple times within that half an hour. By the time ours came around we were STARVING. There was music blasting which was kind of nice but the whole waiting situation was a bit ridiculous. We ordered the chicken plato and chicken burrito. The plate was worth it with a large serving of rice and beans but the burrito was small and nowhere near the same portions of the bowl. We didn't take any photos of the food because we were starving. While I enjoyed the simplicity of the meal, it was not worth the price. The frozen drinks are small and are $11!?? Oh and they're cash only but they have an atm inside! Seems like you're paying for vibes and history but is it worth it considering you wait for most of the time you're in there?","Visiting on a Sunday summer afternoon, there was a slight line as to be expected. There's only one menu posted to your right as you enter. So make sure you STUDY IT CLEARLY.1st misstep - there was a fly on the top of my margarita! I chalked it up to being an outdoor venue and left it alone.2nd misstep - the plantains taste like they've just been sitting in oil for hoursss. They're so oily/gooey.3rd misstep - ordered a cheese quesadilla... came with sour cream, quac, olives, just a ton of stuff I did not want. I spoke to a manager to see if I can get it rectified and get just a plain quesadilla. She said to me ""since the menu lists everything the food comes with, I would not be able to get a refund (which I wasn't asking for) and if I wanted a new one, I can get one, but I would have to pay 50%""... the audacity. Are making sure customers are satisfied not the priority here??!I'm not too sure how this place categorizes itself but a restaurant IT IS NOT based off its service. Any other manager would have understood and fixed the food, it's just a $5 quesadilla! You're not paying for the subpar food ($11 for a pre-mixed basic margarita... blockheads pls come show this place how it's done), you're paying for the music, the ambiance, the vibe. Grab the Cuban sandwich and get out of dodge.",Habana Outpost
278,"I was never expect Thai food in Newyork  before ,Sorry to said that ! Few restaurant that similar taste as Thailand,But now your restaurant become my favorite restaurant .  Specially **noodles soup** ,Environment,music similar as my home ,comfortable.I'm not spoiling person but your team and your food is exactly ""Thai style""","Beef noodle soup (C)The soup was goodBut the beef was too fatty to the point of being unedibleThe noodles were solidThe servers acted a little odd (C)Pricey for what you get, $15 BEFORE taxes","My work friends and I ordered lunch in from Pure Thai Cookhouse today. I had Pad See Ew with Beef ($12) which was pretty good but not the best that I've had. My colleagues ordered the Pad Thai with Shrimp ($12), Wok Basil with Chicken ($11) and Nakorn-Patom Duck Noodle Soup ($14). Everyone was happy with their choices but no one raved that it was the best entree they ever had. However, there was one showstopper...I am writing this review because the Steamed Vegetable Dumplings ($9) were the bomb.com! My coworkers and I were fighting over them. The veggies were encased in a green dumpling wrapper that wasn't gummy or too thick nor was it too thin. The veggies were accompanied by tofu and peanuts (the best part) and the dumplings were paired with a soy sauce spiked with ginger. We got two orders and I really wished we had ordered more. Bottom line: Pure Thai Cookhouse is a good Thai option in Hell's Kitchen. The Steamed Vegetable Dumplings are not to miss!","Oh god this place is so good...Definitely get the Chicken Curry Puffs. They kiñda reminded me of Somasas but with a spice inside that makes it feel distinctly Thai. And don't get me started with the sauce that comes with it. If the waitress didn't take the plate away from me I would've literally slurped that shit up.For the entree I got the Fried Rice + crab. Delish. Only thing I could think of that could be improved would be some more spiciness. Also there was a little crabshell in the rice. But hey, whatever, at least it's real crab.Overall 5 stars. Wonderful stuff. Will come back again","What is this deliciousness that is the **Krabi Seafood Noodles Soup? I had a hunch and I was right that their most interesting dishes are under the ""Pure Thai Noodles"" section of their menu. The broth was a mixture of tangy, spicy and sweet that reminded me so strongly of my time in Thailand. It came with some red pepper flakes and clear spicy pepper liquid. A drooly four stars.The other two dishes we got were fine but more run of the mill. The Pad See Ew was fine but it had a smoky burnt aftertaste and the chicken was dry. The Pad Thai Noodles lacked flavor in some places showing it was just not mixed or seasoned well. Three stars.Next time I will stick to the Pure Thai Noodles section. Especially since all of the dishes there sound so interesting.","Pure Thai Cookhouse was small and industrial, making it feel like a local hideaway tucked away on a quiet Thai street.  The Wok Chili Turmeric With Beef had been listed on the menu with 3 stars, which was certainly not a joke, as the turmeric chili puree sauce was extremely spicy.  The beef was tender, and the vegetable of the day was asparagus, which added a nutty earthiness.  A Special Pasta dish included thin noodles that were wrapped like little scrolls and served with plumb shrimp, tender calamari, and chili-infused mussels.  The dish was topped with a delicious sauce similar to the sweet soy used on pad see ew.  The Egg Omelette with Shallot was cooked to a light golden brown perfection.  It was salty, oniony, and well-seasoned.  The accompanying Steamed Jasmine Rice was also fabulous, with each grain maintaining its distinct structure, rather than turning to mush. After sampling the food, it was easy to see why it was often so difficult to get a table at Pure Thai Cookhouse.  It was certainly worth the wait.",Pure Thai Cookhouse
279,I came in for a drink and a snack. Jalapeño margarita was just ok and not particularly flavorful. Tuna Tatar had a tolerable flavor but presentation was very sloppy. Not at all visually appealing. Service was fine.,"Upset. I went here around 5pm and they were out of chicken. I had to resort to eating the beef sausage and it was not tasty. I was upset that I asked for chicken and the waitress looked lost. She did not know what to say. I then asked for avocado toast and she told me it was not on the menu. However, it was on the menu. Lol I was upset. Not a great experience.","Reserved the private downstairs bar area for my birthday, and the space as well as staff was absolutely phenomenal. Prices were reasonable and they were very accommodating. I will absolutely be coming back to Entwine again soon!","I'm so glad I stumbled upon Entwine on Yelp. I was looking for a venue to host a bridal shower that would provide a private space without totally breaking the bank. The bride-to-be is incredible easy-going, so we really only needed a comfortable low-key place with good food. After contacting various venues across lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, Entwine seemed to be the best option. I stopped by a few times for happy hour and I fell in love with the ambiance. The mismatched decor and sparsely decorated backyard felt incredibly cozy. It felt like we were hanging out in someone's living room instead of a bar in the Village. The reservation process had a few hiccups, but it all worked out in the end. They ended up extending our reservation time for the space at no additional charge. Also, the staff was so welcoming and easy-going. They played really enjoyable music and let us bring in a ton of decorations.","I would give Entwine 4.5! It was a great spot for a drink tucked away in the west village. They have a wide range of cocktails- and good cocktails (definitely worthy of a try). Their little back patio was perfect for a warm summer day, it is tucked in back and super quiet. We were able to order some drinks and enjoy the afternoon while also ordering a spread of different dips, essentially their mezze platter- it was all fresh and really delicious. It was a place that would be perfect for a date and for a cocktail on a slow afternoon. I waited for a friend inside until there was space outside on the patio, but the bartender was definitely comfortable making a variety of cocktails and didn't mind having a few patrons sitting at the bar while they waited for a spot outside! If i'm in this area of the west village I would definitely return!",Super cozy place for drinks and quick bites. We were in the area and looking for a place to just hang out and this place was just perfect. We were very quickly seated downstairs. We started with the mezze platter and it came out literally in no time! The server explained each of the dip very nicely. I loved the babaghanoush. I would surely recommend getting the platter to accompany your drinks.We ordered a couple of different cocktails and each of them were legit strong. The serves were really friendly and very knowledgeable. Its really a great spot for even a date night. Highly recommend trying this place out.,Entwine
280,"I am really impressed by everything at this restaurant. The service was top notch, the food was above board in every way. The starters, entrees and desserts were stellar. The pastas were unworldly. I can't say enough good things. Pics don't do it justice. It's off the beaten path but well worth every bit of your time.",5 stars for the foodCould do a bit better in terms of decorations (those printed flowers...),"I really wish I could give this restaurant more stars!! It's a cute place. The service is good...our waiter was fantastic. The wine selection is good too! However the food is very average. Completely average. I'm not quite sure why there is a 4.5 star rating (maybe because of the good service and wine?), but you can get better Italian food at a ton of other places (Lil Frankie's nearby). I was disappointed unfortunately and I'm not sure I'll be returning :/ Maybe for a glass of wine at the bar!","I was in town for one night with my Lady looking for an authentic Italian restaurant. Tableside did not disappoint. The food fantastic. The house made hummus, the lamb meatballs, and the perfectly seared scallops were the highlights of our night. Special shout out their bartender who made a great Aperol Spritz. As a fellow bartender I know how easy it is to slack on a Spritz. This one did not disappoint.  The house Montepulciano was also fantastic. And finally what impressed me the most was the service. As someone who works in the industry, I definitely notice the subtle things waiters do throughout the night. At one point my girlfriend went to the bathroom, one of the servers came and folded her napkin and put it on the table. Our entrees came out at this point, he came and grated cheese for my entree. I thought my Girlfriend missed the boat on the grated cheese, but the second she came back, he was right on top of it. Thanks to your great staff!","{Overall: 4.25; Food: 4.5} Atmosphere: 4.25, Service: 4.25I see why people love this place. Vibe is really intimate, while being comfortable for couples and groups of friends. Food is really homey and delicious.Food, 4.5:- To start, bread with 3 different types of hummus!- Meatballs: So moist inside, tomato sauce so rich and hearty- Lady of the night: Delicious meld of salty and hearty; they gave us extra sauce since we wanted it super saucy!Atmosphere, 4.25: It's dimly lit, there's trendy music playing.

For our meals, we had the chef's special appetizer; calamari with a few shrimp and a house-made marina sauce...husband had the lasagna (Italian Mother's Love), and I had the Truffle moneybags...although my moneybags tasted great, the portion was so small (or maybe I was greedy). I ended up assisting my love with his lasagna lol...we didn't have room for dessert but we sure scraped our plates!Will definitely be back!",Tableside Italian Cook Shoppe

Spend time reading the walls on how to cook the meat properly, I messed mine up.

Offered to pay extra for food to cover our 4th and still no go,Booked a reservation and showed up across town then they gave my table away because our 4th person had to cancel last minute. Offered to pay extra for food to cover our 4th and still no go,"In this household, we love Takashi. It is a go to dinner spot whenever visitors are in town and we're headed to the Comedy Cellar afterward.The filet in garlic butter is a melt-in-your-mouth piece of heaven, but you really can't go wrong here. Other faves are the beef belly and the shoulder.Don't skip out on dessert, especially if you love soft serve! I love the balsamic and my other half loves the salted caramel. It comes with a pretty lil gold flake on top. Other nice touches include the fact that you get to pick your sake glass from an eclectic collection AND THEY HAVE A JAPANESE TOILET!!! Love you, Takashi. Keep doing you.","Takashi is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in NY. It's quite small and you should expect a wait to be seated. It's a similar process to Korean BBQ, and the servers are happy to help you cook the meat. We started off with the kobe gyoza and thinly slized A5 Miyazki kalbi and hokkaido uni. The uni and kalbi pair was absolutely delicious. For the meat, we ordered a lot - maybe 8 different meats. It's hard to pinpoint a favorite because every piece was well prepared and full of flavor. Sweetbreads might have been my personal favorite but I'm partial to fatty meats. We kept ordering the scallion vinaigrette salad to help cut down the fatty meats. We ordered some black sesame dessert which was also good. The highlight here though is the meat. Get some sake and meat and enjoy this meal.","Absolutely AMAZING.I've had Takashi bookmarked for over 2 years now, but finally had the opportunity to try it today.We made a reservation for 9pm on a Monday night, and even at this time the restaurant was full. KFC - Kobe beef tartar, foie gras, and caviar One of my favorites - the beef tartar and foie were so flavorful, and the caviar on top added that slight bit of saltiness. I LOVED the pickled cantaloupe and toast that was served with it - gave it the perfect contrasting texture, and I think the cantaloupe might have been the best part of this dish, and really rounded it out. Squid ink rice and miso sweetbreadsCouldn't really taste the squid ink too much, but the rice had a perfect texture. My family really enjoyed the sweetbreads - they had a nice chew to them, and it was so so so flavorful.Calf's brain cream Super interesting and fun to eat. If anyone watches iZombie this is probably what they eat in the show. The brain actually has a very mellow flavor which is not what I was expecting. I think the blinis were a bit bready and wasn't a fan of the texture. Of course caviar is always nice to have. While this is a fun item, I wouldn't get it again cuz there just wasn't a lot of flavor to itYooke- beef tartarThis is single handedly the BEST beef tartar I have ever had in my life. The flavor and texture of beef was just unbelievable. My family doesn't normally eat raw beef, but even they were like WOW, this doesn't taste raw at all. I've never had such an amazing tartar before; this is a MUST GET. Niku UniEasily their most photogenic item, and definitely one of the best items of the night. It's the perfect appetizer bite to start the meal. Uni, beef, and fresh wasabi go so well together.Kalbi- this was SO FREAKING TENDER AND FLAVORFULRosu- super delicious, and the marinade was amazing. This is less fatty than the kalbi, but even more flavorful. Tongue experience - My favorite was the back of the tongue, as I thought it had the best flavor and texture. The body of the tongue is what we are most accustomed to eating at other JBBQ places. The tip of the tongue takes the longest to cook, but I felt it lacked flavor and the texture wasn't as enjoyable. Filet mignon steak with garlic butter dipOMG probably our favorite grilled item if the night. Filet is naturally a very tender and mild flavored cut of steak, but this brought the tenderness and flavor to a whole new level. It comes with a little dish of garlic butter that you let cook on the grill. First you seat the filet for 1 minute in each side, and then you place the filet pieces into the garlic butter bath for another 30 seconds to let the flavor infuse and for the beef to cook a little bit more. It was SO FREAKING TENDER AND SO FLAVORFUL this is a MUST GET IMO (and my family is gonna start cooking our filets at home this way!!!). Also the garlic pieces were super tasty as well, and did not have that pungent strong raw garlic flavor. We ate all of the garlic by itself after the meat was done, and it was delicious. A5 Miyazaki wagyu prime ribWhat a treat! It's so rare to get A5 wagyu in New York. It's been a quick minute since I've last had authentic A5 japanese beef, so we decided to get an order of this to try. A lot of my A5 experiences in japan were a bit disappointing as the cuts were overly fatty and almost nauseating to eat. Takashi cuts this super thin, and gives you 2 Long pieces. A5 wagyu is best enjoyed in moderation, and this was the perfect portion size to get just a taste of the flavor and tenderness of Japanese beef. It's beautifully presented with flakes of gold for that extra bouginess.Bakudan- this is pretty much just rice covered with seaweed. I would totally get this over plain white rice any day!Scallion salad- nice and refreshing Ice cream - I got the works, with the peanut sesame powder, azuki beans, shiratama, and green tea sauce. This was one of the best ice creams I've ever had. The green tea sauce is bitter but it balances out the sweetness of the vanilla ice cream perfectly. I was able to finish the entire thing easily without it feeling too sweet or fat. The azuki beans were amazing, but I would skip the shiratama as it was tasteless. The kinako powder was good, but not very noticeable. Of course this also comes with gold flakes on it as well. Also tried the balsamic sauce, and it actually was so good WITH the ice cream. If you try the sauce alone it's a bit gross,  but with the sweetness of the ice cream, it's the perfect tartness to accompany ice cream. Overall this was one of the most enjoyable meals I've had in a very long time. The service was impeccable, and the servers were very nice, and quick to answer any questions we had.  I can't wait to come back here.Highly recommend Takashi - it's a bit pricey, but it's some of the best food I've had in a while and well worth the splurge.",Takashi
282,Well... I finally got around to trying this place after passing by it a number of times over the years.I went to the US location before class to get a mixed green/grain w chicken. But it wasn't at all what I got... i got a few small pieces of cheap rubbery chicken with tons of dressing .... though I said no dressing and very little salad. And it was under filled. Why?Its only tasty bc they use so many fattening dipping sauces and tons of feta cheese to make it flavorful but over all I thought it was a bit of rip off. After a long wait and $12 later..... bye bye,"I am not sure I will come back here again. I have been to many fast Mediterranean places and this would be my least favorite. First, the portion was smaller compared to others. They don't know what one scoop is. I had to ask to put a little bit more of each and it wasn't enough yet. Also, food tasted just okay. Falafel was so cold and extremely dry. Undercooked quinoa and rice.. Service was so slow too. There was a long line because of the slow staffs. I don't know why this place has good reviews...","Rip Off! Stay away from this place if you are ordering through their mobile app.They consistently miss extra ingredients when ordering through phone. I ordered extra lamb meatballs for $4.70 which was missing in my order. Guess what this is not the first time it has happened. They consistently miss items from order.Last time I called the manager and she said a refund will be given back nothing was refunded and this time no one is even picking up their phone.Unless you guys have 20 min. To go and stand in a long line to order physically, DO NOT ORDER THROUGH PHONE APP. Their service is absolutely zero as they consistently mess up orders.","I am a CAVA regular, primarily at their 42nd street location. First time I had Cava and I must say I was very impressed, and after my nth meal I must say this is still my favorite fast, healthy, casual spot! Fresh ingredients, healthy, big portions, and great prices is what comes into mind. You can choose between ~4 types of veggies or grains, choose 3 out of ~6 dips, pick 1 out of ~4 proteins, have unlimited toppings, and top it off with a sauce of your choice. Eggplant dip, chicken are my favorites here! The tzatiki sauce was also great, and the lemon herb tahini taste fantastic and healthy. Unlike the 42nd street location, there are seating options here. Awesome! Would come back here again if I need a quick, healthy, and decently priced meal!","I've seen a lot of these all over the city, but I never knew what kind of food they sold. While I'm not sure how authentic their mediterranean food is, the food was delicious. I built my own bowl and chose a grains and greens base with romaine lettuce and lentil. Then got chicken and roasted vegetables as my protein. I got cucumber, cauliflower quinoa tabbouleh, and white bean salad as my toppings. Roasted red pepper hummus as my dip/spread And I chose roasted red pepper hummus as my dip/spread and finished it with their yogurt dill sauce. I wasn't sure how any of this was going to taste or if they even went well together, but it did. I enjoyed all the vegetables, which were tender, but not mushy, and the chicken was so juicy and flavorful. I think I played it safe with the sauces, but I did enjoy how creamy and mellow the yogurt dill was and it didn't conflict with the roasted red pepper hummus. For around $11, I felt so full just eating half the bowl and I could even save the rest for the next day. The service was very good too, everyone was super nice and friendly","Awesome health-conscious and delicious place for lunch or early dinner! First time here and I really like the ordering process, it's a super simplified ordering process & the girls behind the counter are super friendly while all the food stations looked clean while all the food looking absolutely delicious! You have to build your meal so I just went with a simple Greek salad with marinated grilled chicken tomatoes and feta cheese with the Greek vinaigrette and it was absolutely delicious! Wasn't that expensive either, I washed it down with a delicious spindrift lemon flavored seltzer, I'm doing this keto thing now so obviously it was super keto friendly, The cashier told me they are expanding all over the city which is a good thing!",CAVA
283,"Decent quick southern food.Recommend their chicken sandwiches.The coleslaw tasted a little different, not better, not worse, just different.Good portion, small menu, the atmosphere is pretty cozy. Food: 8/10Service: 6/10Environment: 7/10","It was just okay. The coleslaw was weird, the biscuit was sort of rubbery (but a nice butter flavor), and the fried chicken was fine, not the best I've had, kind of overly salty. Don't think I'd go back.","On the exterior, Bobwhite Counter is a small, unassuming place that can be easily missed. However, as soon as you enter the front door youll smell the warm fried chicken and biscuits. I went to the famous Sylvia's in Harlem for lunch the day before and was so disappointed in their fried chicken and waffles, so I was a bit skeptical about Bobwhite at first too. I was pleasantly surprised at the simple menu and decent prices. I was very happy with the Chicken Little- 3 pieces of chicken, a biscuit, and a side of Mac n cheese as well as collard greens. The chicken was perfect with hot sauce and honey!!!I would've given Bobwhite 5 Stars, but ultimately I give it 4 Stars due to the unpleasant experience from the waiter. This man rushed us from when we arrived to when we were trying to finish our meal. :( But I have to say they know how to make a good fried chicken tho","Aaaannnnnndddd *drum roll* The Best Fried Chicken Award goes to.... You got it! Bobwhite Counter. And thats coming from someone who lives in Harlem (there's a lot of fried chicken in Harlem). The Original is my go to, with their new signature sauce. Mmmm....  Delectable. The french fries leaving you licking your fingers to close the meal. Our service was very chill and very much wanting to give us the best possible experience. He recommended we drizzle some honey on our fries. When I looked at him like he had a third eye, he stood by it, so we tried it. I've never looked back- it was divine. Doesn't take a lot of honey, but oh man! My taste buds were FLYING! Bob Whites fried chicken inspires me- no joke. And I can't wait to return! Recommendation: Don't go with a group larger than 4. It's best with a single buddy. You'll be sitting in silence once the meal comes anyway","Unfortunately I have to single star review Bob White for poor service and even worse customer service follow through. No issues with food. After waiting 40 minutes post order without communication from any staff whatsoever I asked ""why the delay?"" The waiter first replies with the requisite ""the fish takes a long time to cook"" and I'm like ... deep fried fish takes a long time to cook? Okayy!! All good because I wasn't up for a debate before a meal. 10 minutes later and still no food I asked if there was something management can do to make this right, the manager comes out and explains the order was never entered. So I said ""it happens, what can you do?"" He said ""I'll take a percentage off""*Note: at this juncture management should comp the meal.As the food comes out I ask what would the percentage be? The management replied I'll let the waiter know. Which I was good with because like I said I didn't want to debate over a $15 meal and the food looked delish. In hindsight perhaps I engaged simply to pass the time. The food was actually better than it looked, when I went to pay I noticed the bill was reduced by 10% on a $15 plate I'll tip a minimum of 33%, more for exceptional service. I asked the waiter to please charge me the full amount. Good food is important, how you treat humans is more important. 4stars on the foodUnfortunately I won't be going back to experience it.","I had this place bookmarked for a while and finally got a chance to try it. The amount of positive reviews and the mouth-watering photos of the food here on Yelp only built up the anticipation for me. I had their Chicken Little plate, which came with a thigh, wing, drumstick, a biscuit and a side of your choice. I had their mac-and-cheese. My order took nearly half-an-hour to be prepared and I had to admit, I was getting a little impatient and grumpy while waiting. A lot of previous customers may disagree with me, but personally, I don't think their chicken is exactly the show-stealer. Sure it was good, but that award goes to their mac-and-cheese. It was seasoned perfectly and tasted especially delicious since it just came out of the oven. My favorite part was for the slightly spicy aftertaste it had. Would've been better if it was slightly more cheesier, but it was still delicious regardless. Chef Ramsey would've approved it if he had it. The biscuit was warm and buttery. Chicken was also nicely seasoned and not overly dry. Skin was flavorful and crunchy. The real highlight for me is still their mac. Definitely go give it a shot if you haven't already.

284,Michelin 2 star?  The service here is very good with staff falling all over each other to pour your water but our waiter had really bad breath which put a damper on things.  The food was very visually pleasing but the flavors were rather dull and the hamachi was a bit stale.  Very over rated in my opinion.,"I was charged $400 without having anything from this restaurant. We canceled the reservation at the early morning for the dinner due to the delay of flight. Please be caution for this restaurant, if you provide your credit card for the reservation. I am going to dispute the charge through credit card company.","It was okay. Some of the dishes were interesting and brought an umami flavor. I was disappointed I brought all of my A clients to this place after watching Action Bronson to be denied of the ""off the menu"" duck dish. I asked 2 months in advance too. Pretty lame and spent over 3K. Would not come back over the harsh denial of their most popular dish","Visited this upper east side staple for a celebratory dinner! We wanted the full experience so we went for the chefs tasting menu with the wine pairing, and the experts did not disappoint.The meal began with a cold shrimp appetizer, followed by a raw fluke dish. Continued with several other courses including langoustine, frito miso, sautéed fish, shortbread, and wagyu beef. Dessert was definitely a highlight for me! They have a pretty fabulous cheese cart (cheese is a food group in my eyes) which we made a selection of 5 cheeses from. Followed with a play on cherry pie, a chocolate mousse, and Madeline's.A note on the wine - we had a really excellent and enthusiastic sommelier that made tasting so fun! His wine pairings and flavor profile descriptions were on point and wonderful. Our experience at Daniel was really lovely overall and I would absolutely recommend dining here for a special occasion or celebration.","The chef was lovely and talked to me. I felt badly that he knew Anthony Bourdain.The service was great. I was greeted by an Asian lady at the table who was the first to make sure i was happy. I was not so satisfied with the food. I prefer a more ample version with fewer sauces and where the full flavor of the meat and vegetables come out. I only tasted this with the butter, and I do not even eat a lot of butter. When I cook, I use olive oil. lemon, oregano, thyme, salt and pepper and at times more, and the food turns out great. It must be my energy through God.I had a fish appetizer and main dish. My appetizer was scallops that I truly enjoy. These seemed ""dead,"" like you could taste dead, not fresh and buttery. I believe the main dish was swordfish and consisted of two small pieces of the fish.  I felt I was eating chemical concoctions and I was full but not in a satisfactory way.An elderflower white cosmopolitan I had was divine and perfect, just what I had imagined I wanted.The dessert was great and included small chocolates and a rice pudding. The rice pudding cannot measure up to family's or some Greek diners. Cinnamon was even missing. The dry peach slice on top was not needed. The kataifi wheat on top would be better with some juice or honey.I had another very good dessert but do not recall it fully now. Fig slices that were good enough were on the side. It was like a chocolate barrel with pudding.They allowed me to have two desserts and did not give me the free Pavlova dessert. (I took part of the fig dessert home.)The free French madeleines were great.","Wonderful upscale traditional french restaurant with romantic mood lighting and excellent service! Men are required to wear jackets in the main dining room but not in the lounge. I'd recommend wearing a jacket regardless. Ladies - bring a cardigan or a sweater, I was cold in my sleeveless dress. We sat in the lounge which was cozy and intimate - they have plushy couches/pillows against one wall. Despite the seating being close together we did not feel it detracted from the ambiance as the patrons surrounding us were courteous. We got the 4-course prix fixe menu with sommelier chosen wine pairings. We got a few delicious bites on the house in the beginning that included a little crunchy fig/blue cheese bit and fresh fluke. The bread is fresh and warm - I almost never eat bread at restaurant but highly recommend trying it at Daniel. They come by a few times throughout the meal with the bread basket and it's best to pick a new piece each time to help mop up sauces. You are allowed to pick each course in your 4-course prix fixe which is nice. My husband started with the Seriole (duoe of Hamachi, Tartare) which he loved. I started with the Escargot - I'll admit, I've never tried Escargot but it was tender and I mopped up all the remaining sauce with my bread. I am glad I tried it.My husband got the Espadon (grilled swordfish) for his second choice which he enjoyed. I got the foie gras which was amazing - they make a show of flambéing it in front of you which is always fun. My husband got the Agneau (roasted lamb chop) for his third choice which was fantastic, loved the crunchy sesame crust! I got the Boeuf (strip loin) which was INCREDIBLE. Highly recommend medium-rare for both.For dessert, we split the Pavlova (Meringue) and Sakanti (rich crunchy chocolate mousse deliciousness). I didn't love the Pavlova - it reminded me of a meringue fruit cake, but my husband enjoyed it. The Sakanti was incredible and paired extremely well with the port-like dessert wine selection and espresso. They also brought out several complimentary desserts - little chocolates, little lemon popover bites, and a congratulatory pecan praline sweet. The complimentary pecan praline was by far our favorite as it was both sweet and salty and beautifully executed. The highlights for us were the sommelier wine pairings (on point), Boeuf (strip loin) and pecan praline desserts. They also send you home with a complimentary canele (which is essentially a pop over) that went perfectly with coffee the next morning. They also print a copy of your menu selections to take home which is a nice touch. Thank you for making our evening so special!",Daniel
285,"Pig Beach used to be everything everybody loved about Brooklyn, now it's the exact opposite: in terms of both clientele (irresponsibly allowing their dogs & children to run around bothering others) AND employees (who huddle in a corner, smugly sneering & snidely leering, very obviously hating their jobs, very unhelpful & resentful of customers).",I'm a black dude who was vaping when other white women were vaping and then I got kicked out? Double standards are cool.Also: it's pride month and I was wearing a rainbow romper,"Great food & drinks. The women's bathroom line on the other hand is horrendous. 20 minute, 50 person wait for the women's while no wait for the men's. The reason for this is because they have a private bathroom for men but only offer gender neutral bathrooms for women.",First off. Omg omg. The food was great. The brisket was soft as can be.  The Mac and cheese was great. They use crushed goldfish on top of the Mac and cheese. Omg. The price was good. The drinks were great. The views were great.  The clientele was ehhh.  Come with a big party. All in all 4.5 stars from me.  Brisket was on point.,"As the summer winds down, made it a point to come here to enjoy the outside BBQ atmosphere while possible. Saturday late afternoon (sometime between the lunch and dinner crowds), still a significant line to enter.Was able to get to the backyard area after about 10ish minutes in line. Place is generally packed both inside as well as outside - including a large portion ""Reserved"" for various parties. With nowhere to sit, opted instead to lean on one of the bars and order some drinks. The initial stall as you walk in has some cans, where I opted for an IPA ($8). Towards the back there is a bigger bar that I did not know had a better drink list. Inside, you can order food - settling on a Brisket Sandwich ($9) and some fries ($6 for a small). Meal comes out within a few short minutes - a small but dense sandwich packed with some brisket, fried onions, and pickles. Juicy and flavorful, but wishing there was more. Fries are fresh but completely over salted, which the beer couldn't whisk away.The flaw here was coming on a Saturday afternoon; it is way too packed to enjoy a meal, even despite the bouncers regulating the crowd. May try again on a weeknight.","Top 5 reasons why Pig Beach is the quintessential place for day drinking in Brooklyn.1. BBQ. Not just any BBQ. BBQ that's delicious as f__k. Everything on the menu is great. The brisket is my favorite. Authentic BBQ in the Brooklyn. Can't beat it. 2. Great summery booze options. Day drinking requires refreshing cocktails and this place has a bunch of that. 3. Did I mention that BBQ? ... Mhmmm. Ribs. Wings. Pork Shoulder.4. Large outdoor space. Big enough for you and your friends to soak up some sun rays from one of the large picnic tables or while enjoying a game of corn hole. 5. Fido Friendly! Your little furry pal can day drink with you. What's better than that?! ... BBQ, Booze and Pooches. ItThe winning formula for a great day drinking adventure. Sidenote: Pig Beach isn't a secret so expect a wait during peak times (weekends). It's a popular destination for young families too, so there's a good amount of strollers earlier in the day.",Pig Beach
286,My 3 friends and I went here for a farewell brunch  the food was delicious and the cocktails too.    They were turning over to dinner so we went to the bar for a farewell drink but the bartender said that we were there too long and that he wouldn't serve us.  After speaking to the manager he said that it was a liability question.  And that  bring we were not intoxicated we could order another. But I refused saying we could spend our money elsewhere.  I was very humiliated by this event and will never go there again.,"Terrible service. Order taking was slow, check took forever.OK food. Not worth the wait. Terrible Bloody Mary. Small and basic. Amazing blood orange margarita. Come to the bar just for that and then leave.","Most disappointing restaurant I've been to in Brooklyn. The restaurant is small, loud and crowded. Service is very slow. Our cups were not filled with water when we arrived even though we called head and reserved the table.  We had to wait 10 minutes to get water, which was warm. The server didn't leave water on the table, so we had to wait another 10 minutes to get refills.The menu is embarrassingly lacking. There's no poultry or basic salad options. You can get some pieces of lettuce with some drops of lemon for almost $20. Ridiculous. Wine list is also minimal and lacking.We came in a larger party, and multiple members ending up getting nothing except water. If you're looking to entertain guests, go somewhere else.","Brunch review only!We came here on a Sunday around 12:30 and didn't have trouble finding a spot for the 2 of us. We sat at the open kitchen, which was great to see all the dishes being made! Also helped in our decision making since most of the pictures on Yelp were for dinner.We ended up getting the cherry salad, turkish eggs, oysters, and donuts.- Cherry salad: very light and refreshing with prosciutto, manchego and mint! The cherries are a bit tart but still refreshing and sweet! It paired really well the cheese and prosciutto. I thought this was a good combo to the heavier egg dish we shared- Turkish eggs: my first time trying this! It's basically poached eggs, yogurt, and brown butter sauce with fresh dill and spices! SO good! It comes with a side of freshly fired bread. Mix it all up, dip your bread in, and hellooo flavors! We liked it so much, we were inspired to make it at home!- Donuts: we were immediately tempted to get this when we saw it on the menu. The donuts are more on the cakey side, so don't expect airy/fluffy. But flavors are bomb. It also comes with this creamy light lemon sauce that I couldn't stop eating! I'm glad we ended up coming here because I was a littttle skeptical when I first saw the menu and wasn't that impressed. But I was so surprised and can't wait to return!",Been here twice for brunch and blown away each time.  Donuts and monkey bread go well with French press coffee to start. Ricotta is smooth and lemony - goes well with toasted bread!  Shrimp and grits always good. Turkish eggs truly unique and flavorful!  Sunchokes are potatoes make for good sides!  Best of all - we got to sit at one of the corner tables in the front for a sun drenched brunch!,"Pesto Bianco...is..back people If you know anything about Brooklyn heights, you know there are several restaurants in a 4 block radius and many of which are your general Thai, Mediterranean, or Sushi restaurants. If you live here, you also know how difficult it is to get your Manhattan friends to make the journey. I'm happy to announce Colonie is golden ticket we've all been waiting for. Firstly, sit at the chefs table. Watching the chefs work their magic is incredible (shout out to Kone (sp) on the pasta. They put so much TLC in their food it really is a treat to watch. All of their drinks are delicious, I especially favor the detox retox, and cuc cocktail. The apps are also fantastic I would recommend 1 per person. Everything is fantastic, esp the sweet potatoes, Brussels (shaved and light not fried) and sunchokes. For dinner- get the spaghettoni. The pesto blanco is almond based and has a spicy after taste. I could eat this for every meal for the rest of my life. It can be made vegan or they can make it into a cheesy delight of that's what you're into. Everything here is A++++, but just expect a $100 for a party",Colonie
287,"I would've walked out if we didn't need to eat something and it would've taken more time to find a place. We made reservations and walked in to no hostess or any type of hostess podium. I thought maybe the bar was on the first floor and the main restaurant was on the second floor. As we walked upstairs the bartender apparently started to make fun of my husband and I to 3 patrons at the bar that we didn't know where we were going. Here's a thought, why don't you help a paying customer instead of making fun of them. That pissed me off and completely turned me off to this place. I whipped around and asked him sternly ""Excuse me, are you talking about me?"" He immediately turned his face down in embarassment and turned his back on us. Even better, we have an employee that makes fun of his customers and then can't even cop up to it when confronted.The two stars goes to our actual waiter who took us to our table and was nothing but kind even though he could tell I was in a foul mood and hadn't seen the incident so didn't know why. I was all prepared to get drinks and a great meal here but I ordered the bare minimum because I wasn't interested in giving this place any more of my business then I had to. Absolutely the most rude experience I've had at a restaurant. Go elsewhere; there are plenty of places in NYC.","I was very underwhelmed with this place. They are known for their burgers, but mine was very over cooked and dry. Their famous cookie Sunday was below average, too, and it was all quite pricy. I do not recommend this restaurant.","The decor of this place is now really nice! Food was mediocre- nothing special during lunch. Their wings were a bit pricier for only 7 and their chili wasn't anything different from anywhere else. We had to always get the server's attention to take the order, get condiments and the bill.","Prob one of my favorite Happy hour barsService:Bartender (nick?) is amazing, sincere, and attentive. Keeps up chats with everyone at the bar Space:Nice vibeUpstairs seatingMain floor - limited seating but with the bar and a DJDownstairs - bathroom They have some cute quotes on the mirrors and industrial style light bulbsFood:Happy hour $2 sliders are the bestMac and cheese comes on a cast iron and ya can taste the diff cheeses they use to make it but prob won't order it again","After a trip to the American Girl store, imagine my surprise to see that the Burger Heaven, which I've eaten in forever, was re-branded and remodeled.The restaurant is gorgeous, and the food and staff were excellent.We ordered a variety of options, and my grandchildren [7 & 10] each had dinner from the kids menu {$12] and ate in silence, which is good thing.We all agreed that when we're in the neighborhood, we'll go back.Robin W.","This place was great.  We were seated quickly.  Our food was prepared surprisingly fast.  The the food was awesome too.  I had a burger and fries, the temp on the burger was good and I really enjoyed the house sauce.  The food wasn't so amazing that my mind was blown but it was very good.  Better than average, hence the 4 star rating.My only complaint would be that the bar was so busy that it took a while to get our drinks.  We literally had our food before the drinks were made.  The bar was also so crowded that we had trouble getting out of the restaurant upstairs..... but hey, when you are running a business, being busy is a good thing.",BH Kitchen & Bar
288,"I really really wanted to like this place. It's super cute, by the water, and a good vibe. We placed a reservation for 12:30 on a Sunday. When we got there it wasn't crowded at all, but the hostess said that we had to wait 15 minutes (annoying). We decided to just sit at the open seating that was closest to the water. The view was nice and the music was good.It took the waiter a few minutes to come over and take our drink order. He did just that and literally dumped our drinks off to us and walked away. We had to flag this man down to get him to come back to take our food order. I was a little upset when we got the check too because those small watered down drinks costed $15 each- not worth it.My friend asked the waiter about the lobster omelette. She had a question about the lobster used in it; he answered really coldly and didn't even give her eye contact. It was so rude. She decided to order something else on the menu. Afterwards we got our food and it was just ok. The smoked salmon was good, I got that as the side. However our waiter never came over and asked us how our food was. Not once the entire 2 hours we were sitting there. He didn't even give us forks after he gave us our food and walked away. We had to ask someone else to bring us some. It was literally the worst service ever. All he did was take our order and bring us our drinks and food, then had the nerve to be rude when we asked about menu items, and had the nerve to never come check on us. We didn't feel like that deserved a tip at all.","**update as of 8/30/19** I decided to try this spot one more time for Brunch and again soooo disappointed. I've decided to give up on this spot allntogether! They have the advantage of being right on the bird walk near the water, but you are better off buying something from the food stands and just grabbing an open seat all along the area.. why was brunch so bad?!! Taste of Food + over priced food= disaster!! What's also extremely comical is they have an $1,100 golden something dish on the menu. The audacity to put that on the menu, but can't make eggs over medium is beyond!! What we ordered: Watermelon salad- beyond overpriced! Literally it's chunks of watermelon with a sprinkle of  super greens on it. Avocado toast- it's a definite twist on a classic avocado toast, but with the chunks of feta it was just okay. Brunch crab cake- the lunch crab cake I got my last visit was actually the best thing I've had there. This one though was in a bed of smooshed avocado served with an over easy egg. Making it for just smoosh on a plate and no texture balance whatsoever. There is no classic eggs toast and potatoes etc. you can order eggs separate and toast for $10.00 but nothing special.  Whomp whomp whomp! 5 stars for the view and one star for the food!! Ugh I was crossing my fingers that this spot can have good food and a bad ass back drop, but we were throughly disappointed. I'd probably recommend just to go for drinks, but if you are looking for a satisfying meal this ain't the place. The menu is a mix of American selects and then a ton of different 'wood fired' pizza. We decided to get the margarita pizza and by far the WORST PIZZA IVE EVER HAD! No exaggeration this pizza is worse than a microwave pizza. Actually those pizzas are actually better. I took one bite and everything was just bad. The crust is off, cheese bad, and holy moly the sauce is gross. Again, I can't emphasize enough that this is the worst pizza I've ever had in my life! Ordered the Caesar and that was just okay. Edible, but not memorable. King Crab cake  was good. Probably the only thing I can recommend. So come here for the nice views, people wAtching, and dog petting, but just don't eat","5 stars for the view and one star for the food!!

Although they do not offer any happy hour specials, the vibe is fun and it's right on the water. It's a fun place to chill and have a drink. To be honest, I have never tried the food, so I can't comment but when I see other people ordering food it looks decent. I will have to give it a try.","We had plans to enjoy the weather on Saturday and we went to this place that seemed to have a beautiful view of the city.And so it was, the only recommendation was to make a reservation and thank God we made it. Because it was the perfect point to spend the Saturday.Wonderful service and we fell in love with pizzas and the Prosecco was ON POINT!!! Totally a place to recommend and go again!","My friends and I made reservations for brunch here on a Saturday and I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the establishment. I expected it to be pretty packed especially since it's located on the waterfront, but there was still a couple empty tables available. My party was seated in an outdoor table which was perfect on a cool cloudy day. This place would be a great place to enjoy your food and drink while people watching at the same time. It was a little squished in terms of the surrounding tables, but it didn't bother us too much. Service was great in terms of ordering and receiving our food, but I found it a little hard to flag down our waitress for anything else I needed. Food was great - my party ordered family style so that we could try a variety of dishes. We ordered 2 pizzas, 2 sides, and the caramel waffle. I would definitely recommend trying the waffle, it was AMAZING - definitely my favorite across the board. Only other downside I would say is the structure of the bathroom. It didn't bother me that stalls were unisex, but there were 2 doors for the entrance and they were right next to each other. So when I was waiting on line for a stall, I got hit with the other door pretty hard by another guy who was trying to get in. Having two doors seemed pretty redundant and dangerous. I would be extra cautious while in there.",Industry Kitchen
289,"WOWOWOWOWOWOW. The food here is amazing from the apps to the main course. (I didn't have dessert). Friendly and attentive waitstaff. You must get the sea bass with the grapes if they have it! Fluke ceviche and octopus were also top-notch. Only downside is the price = $$$$, but you get what you pay for!","Didn't feel like this place was as amazing as everyone says it is. I'm being honest here. Upon entry I was told there would be a wait for the bar, which was fine. As I watched from the outside door, I started noticing about 6 tables empty. They remained empty for about 40-45 minutes. The hostess kept turning people away. This place takes reservations, which is also fine. However that being said, I couldn't help but think that this was attributed to poor time management on behalf of the staff. At one point about 5 tables left. No one ever came to replace these tables until about an hour. I asked the hostess to alert me when something opened up at the bar. She kinda seemed checked out and clueless. I don't like to stand hovering over peoples tables because I feel that it's rude. So I waited outside but felt like I was going to miss my spot at the bar because she wasn't clearly paying attention. Now for the food. I felt that it was good but nothing over the top. This place was giving off somewhat of a Latin vibe with its dishes such as ceviche and Ecuadorian something else that I can't remember but on the menu. I appreciate Latin food as it's a childhood staple of mine. However,  if I go out to eat Italian that's what I expect. I don't really take to places that have an identity crisis. It's cool if you want to serve up different food but I would just like to know where I am. Staff was very friendly at the bar and made the experience a whole lot better. Decor was cool. Again nothing that made me say I gotta make it back to this place. Maybe people love it because it stands out among the rest in the neighborhood but wouldn't want to be trekking here thinking I'm about to have a life changing experience.","I wanted to really love this restaurant, however for the second time, it has severely disappointed .The service here is sloppy and poor. I went with several friends mid week and didn't have a booking however was able to get a table based on the premise it had to be available for a booking in 75 mins. Easy. We only needed a quick dinner and were moving on for drinks anyway. However from the second we were seated, we were pressured to order and once our starters were bought out, had our plates taken from us before we had even finished eating. Even when we mentioned that we weren't done, they continued clearing our plates as our mains were ready to be put down. Talk about rushing the customer! All the while, still plenty of time to eat, as the reservation was not coming for another 15 minutes.This entire experience was poorly handled, and this is not the first time I've had such bad service here. A real disappointment given how nice the space is. A word of advice, don't say yes to seating customers if you're only going to rush them, rush their meals and basically push them out the door.","Love the ambiance and feel of this place! Came on a Sunday with the family and everyone was pleased. Great service from the hostess, waitress was super friendly throughout our entire service for brunch. Lovely day to sit outside. Got a few apps to share but the octopus was the star! (Not sure if it's under the app section or main meal) Cocktails also amazing! Had the cocktail with mezcal and pineapple. Excited to return and try something new!","I've been to this place three times now and it has never disappointed.  The chargrilled octopus is bloody delicious.  The pasta with black pepper is everything you hope a pasta should be-- simple but extremely satisfying.  The mushroom pasta which they sometimes switch out to a ravioli is a must order as well. Their flank steak is prepared flawlessly.  Overall there's a good vibe at the restaurant, it's very chill and laid back. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. It's a really great neighborhood restaurant and I'll keep coming back.","This is a date spot. Evelina is everything you want if you're looking to impress someone. It's a beautiful space with what seems like a perpetually attractive crowd. They've designed a menu that quite literally makes me want to eat everything on it, and luckily the execution usually lives up to its promise, and the food isn't just tasty, but gorgeous as well.This is Brooklyn though, and you're going to pay for all this, so make sure you're bringing someone who's worth it. My wife brought me, which was probably a bad call. Pasta, fish, salads...we enjoyed almost everything, and the service most of all. The staff here cares about the details, and it shows. There was a tiny little clothespin holding a tiny sprig of herb to my excellent cocktail. And I liked it. A new favorite restaurant that could be my favorite restaurant if it were just a smidge more affordable and a little more consistent in deliciousness (nothing was bad, just some dishes were more worth the price tag than others). Judging by how hard it is to get a good reservation though, they probably don't need to make things cheaper on my account.Definitely coming back.",Evelina
290,After reading the reviews of 79 I had to try it for myself. I must say the food here is delicious and thr service was completely on point.  The only draw back is that parking is very tough around here.,"I've been here twice now - and the second time was because I forgotten I had gone here because the food was unremarkable during lunch my first visit. This time around I tried the som tum, pad Thai, red curry and basil eggplant stir fry. I think that the basil eggplant stir fry was the best dish we had on the table and it was the only one we finished. The rest was just average to subpar tasting Thai food that you can get anywhere else in the city. If it wasn't for the proximity of this restaurant to Elmhurst's mini Thai town I suppose that might be ok but I was disappointed and regretted not going to one of my favorite haunts there instead. My recommendation is skip this place and head to Elmhurst Av and eat over there instead.","According to my check ins I've been here 9 times- might be more! Noticing the food is changing. The Pad Thai is now overly sweet and more chewy. I had a whole fish here as well with a mango salad and I don't recall anything remarkable besides the fish's head. I am sad because this was my favorite Thai place in the area. P.S. They must be cleaning their dishes/utensils with bleach, but the smell for me on the cups is too much.","This place is a gem! It's spacious and the decor is very modern chic.My partner and I came with high expectations, and they were met.The flavors were so bold, but not overbearing. Everything was cooked just right.Everything was simply delicious- nothing was left behind!The service was great. No complaints.The only possible downside is that this location is very close to a train. Every time one passes by, you slightly hear/feel it. Nothing too crazy.Can't wait to come back!","The crispy duck in red curry is out of this world. Really high end. We also had the rice noodles in green curry (with chicken). So satisfying. The presentation of the dishes is careful and attractive. I ordered warm sake to go with the meal and was pleasantly surprised that the combination worked well. Chic ambiance, nice for a date. Very friendly to children too though.There are several thai restaurants in the neighborhood but this one is definitely #1!","Eaten in and ordered delivery via Yelp from Kitchen 79 for years so I've decided to leave a review. Interior is very modern though all of the glassware and close proximity to other tables have prevented us from bringing our young kids here. Service is always top notch here as they wait staff is has always been attentive to our needs. Here are some of our thoughtsPros:- reasonably priced and the food is consistently cooked well. #1 reason why we keep coming back with take out orders- very quick turnaround time from the time of our order to food at our table/at our door- nice mix of modern and traditional dishes- lots of healthier options/alternatives- clean bathroomCons:- don't bother leaving comments on online orders. For example, we've repeatedly requested that our order not include plastic utensils, plastic straws and white rice which is ignored (trying to reduce waste)- there were few times that our food was either over cooked, overly oily, or ended up being smaller than normal. However this is not the norm.- restaurant can be tight",Kitchen 79
291,"The pancakes are quite good but man, everything else is kind of a mess. The staff has that deer in the headlights look you see when they're overworked and understaffed and are equally as frustrated by the check in process as you are. Skip the rest of the food.",I came to this restaurant because it's always busy the week end ... How it's possible ? WTF Service was 0 Food was 0  Wine was 0 : cheapest wine you can find ! It's not French food at all ! Have you ever been to France ???What a disappointment ! I will never come back ...,"Can't vouch for the food... but I've never felt so ignored in a restaurant, EVER. Waited for 15 min to get even our drink order before just leaving. And no, it wasn't busy. We came at 2, after the brunch rush. Boy did the 4 waiters who went to the one table with the pretty girl seem to drop everything and ignore everyone else. They sat after us and legit, we watched 4 different waiters service the table. Way to make us feel unworthy. Won't be back... ps- go to Verde next door. Their menus is almost exact and the service won't leave you feeling like sloppy seconds","The food is pretty good and it comes out fast. I ordered the salmon Benedict and it was very tasty--a little salty for some but just right for me. The one thing they can improve on is the over-toasted muffin. It was so hard, I couldn't cut through the bottom. FYI--this place is CASH ONLY.","The wait was about 10-15 minutes at 10:30ish on Saturday morning. The pancakes were fluffy and crispy and just really great. However we were seated next to the kitchen sink and got splashed a few times. When I asked the waiter/hostess if the workers could be more careful, he dismissed me and told me not to worry. Really unkind response. The service wasn't attentive until I was 90% done with my meal and they kept asking me if I was done which made me feel rushed.","Outstanding pancakes! The pancakes are cooked to perfection. Light and fluffy on the inside. They had a thin crisp on the outside. The pancakes were served with blueberries, strawberries, and bananas.Our table was right next to the sink at the bar. Unfortunately, we got splashed a couple times. We asked the staff if they could be a little more mindful since we didn't want us or our food to be splashed with dish water. They simply said not to worry and carry on. I'd recommend avoiding the small tables at the front near the bar.",Cafe Luluc
292,Delicious drinks and food! Good service. I had the roast chicken and an old-fashioned. My friends had the pork sandwich and french fries. We had to order another round of french fries! I want to go back just for the spicy margarita. Decor is dark but what do you expect from a place called death Avenue!,Bad experience. Servers were rude as if we were a bother. Had to repeatedly ask for water and drink refills when glasses were visibly empty. Food was mediocre. Won't return!,"This place is pretty expensive. All items on the menu are around $20-25. During lunch, I went and got the baby back rib burger for around $25. It was not that great. The meat was hard and there was not much in the burger other than the meat. The fries kind of made up for the burger because they were topped with cheese but I wouldn't recommend this place. Maybe come for the bar next door but definitely not for the food. Note that the taco orders give only 2 tacos.","I stopped by this place on a humid, rainy day in NYC.  I got off at Penn Station and my first objective was to walk the Highline since I have never done that before.  After enduring heavy rain and dodging people like myself with huge umbrellas in tow, I decided it was time to get off and head back down to street level  Lo and behold, I saw that Death Ave. was already open in the afternoon!  I was thirsty and based on a quick search they had cocktails and beer.  Being that it was 3pm on a weekday afternoon, I wasn't surprised that it was empty.  There was one other person in there and she seemed to look really comfortable being the only person in there.  The bartender seemed friendly enough and he even gave me happy hour pricing on my drinks even though HH wouldn't start for another 30 minutes.It's probably not that fair for me to review a bar when it's empty.  Ever since I came here, I discovered that there were other Death Ave. locations in other cities in the US.  That made me open my eyes as I never thought anyone would go into any business that had the word ""death"" in there.  But based on my experience from that day, I had a glass and a half of cold beer and some respite from the heavy rain.Maybe they will open a location here in the SF Bay Area one day.  If so, then I definitely will want to go there when it's a bit busier.","This place is pretty overpriced . I used to love it here, but after my last experience I'm sad to say I won't be coming back, it kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. Shame too, because their food is pretty good. (No pun intended)When my friend and I walked in, it was pretty empty inside and because of this we asked if they were open or serving lunch. We were met with lots of attitude. The waitress was super reluctant to sit us outside when we had asked if we were allowed. Telling us ""it was was way too crowded"" and kept trying to make up other reasons why we couldn't. We didn't think much of it because why get upset about that? But then when we ordered our drinks she went ""well I guess you guys can sit outside if you'd like"". Almost like she didn't believe we'd order anything if we went outside. (Who loiters in a restaurant?) Our second drinks took over 20min to make too. We almost canceled them because we were just pretty tired at that point.Drinks are good, food is good, but just way to pricey for the quality. 4 drinks, $75, and an empty belly later, we were feeling pretty defeated. If you come here I suggest skipping the drinks and just ordering some food. The food won't disappoint I promise, but the prices and service may. ALSO!! If you sit outside, when you pay the check you can opt to leave it outside too. Shame on me I should've brought it to the front, since I left a cash tip. Really hope my server got it despite the slow service. Everyone has bad days, but I was having one as well and this experience just bummed me out. Oh well.",Came into death ave for a birthday dinner. The place itself is very nice and conveniently located in Hudson yards. The place provides a unique rustic vibe. In addition they provide a free beer if you checkin on yelp.The food itself was above average and very fairly priced. I ended up getting the steak tacos which tasted very fresh. It was mixed with zucchini and a few other sauces.My only complaint would have to be their policy about splitting check. They don't allow splitting checks by meal but rather equally. So please be prepared for that before coming here.,Death Ave
293,"Horrible service. It was our friend's birthday and we had a cake. We weren't even told that they were gonna charge $3/person service charge for having the cake. A restaurant is not just about the food, it is the service and people that bring guests back. So disappointed","Their food was decent. Come for their happy hour and get their half carat of white wine that's probably most worth as it gives you a little bit more than 3 glasses of wine. The calarami and zucchini fries was just what you expected from other places...and same for the pastas (eggplant, spaghetti, chicken parm) they were all just typical. No complaints here but also not like wow. However service was great and we always had attention when needed and the place was cozy.","I called the place a week ago to book a table at the back for my birthday because we have 9 people and thought the back could fit better. The reservation was successful. When I came there, we were close to the kitchen and right outside of the restrooms. The area was not covered by AC, so you can image how hot and humid it is when it's 90 degrees outside. The food was mediocre. I ordered a poached salmon with roasted veggie. It's farmed salmon  and the veggie feels a little too greasy. We also ordered a pear salad, but it's a bit of dull. Fried zucchini and calamari is good and worth a try. The supervisor covering weekend shifts was horrible and blaming my friends for bringing a cake and not ordering their desert! No going back!","After visiting Quality Italian last time I was in NYC, I was trying to not let my expectations get the better of me. My friend Callie and I haven't been to this place so we thought we'd try this place out. It's not a very small place, but not large either. It was a hot has day out so they kept turning on and off the AC so our experience in the place went from muggy and humid to cold. The place is nicely and minimally decorated with a decent bar in the middle even though I'm not sure if anyone actually say there given its side and location in the middle of the restaurant. We started off with the fried calamari aha zucchini which is definitely one of the best ones I've had! Top 5. Next we shared the chicken Milanese and penne vodka with Pancetta. Both were delicious but the pasta was my favorite! It was creamy and had a great amount of Pancetta. We were stuffed at the end and couldn't finish our appetizer and full carafe of wine (3 very generous glasses each)! Definitely would come back and make it to desert.","One-star because of the horrible service from supervisor Ricarte (I think that's his name. To be fair our waiter was nice). He is highly unprofessional with poor relationship management skill. Lack of transparency on cutting fees and blamed us when they were the ones who didn't clarify things upfront. After we resolved the issue, we gave him 4 credit cards (the max the restaurant allows) because we had a large group. Not only he double charged one of the credit cards, but also he forgot to return one.The food is mediocre. I'd give it a 3-star. I had the rigatoni with salmon and cream sauce (added mushroom for $3). It was pretty bland. The fried calamari and zucchini was ok. I like how they put pepper flakes in the dipping sauce which added a nice kick to it but that's pretty much it.","Amazing place for great food and great service at a great price. Went here with my boyfriend before catching ""Sleep No More"" nearby and it was a solid choice. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great dining experience.",Pepe Giallo
294,It's my 3rd visit to this place but I must say that I am fairly disappointed with their changed menu. Gone with some of  their authentic Izakaya dishes replaced with more mainstream sushi rolls. Still tasty but we were here for the Izakaya menu.,"I went to Mew with my boyfriend one night after work. We were able to get on the waitlist early through the Yelp app, and thanks to this feature, we were able to be seated right upon arrival.We decided to split a bottle of wine and some items off the menu. We got a bottle of pinot noir ($24) and we split the shishito peppers ($4.95), omu soba ($12.95), and a sexy roll ($10.95). Unfortunately, the roll was the only enjoyable part of our meal. The shishito peppers were a bit sour and the omu soba (which was one of the popular highlights on the menu) really didn't impress me. The noodles were greasy, and the sauce & bonito flakes were way too heavy & overwhelming for my liking. I've had Mew bookmarked for quite some time due to the hype on Yelp, but I would not return or recommend.",Izakaya MEW:What we order: 1. Salmon teriyaki2. Kimchi cream udon3. Spicy soft shell crab roll4. Eel avocado roll5. Matcha Warabimochi with sesame ice cream,"Great place for a Sapporo pitcher! They also have frozen beer everyone loves.Takoyaki Kara Age: 6 friend octopus balls with a, sweet brown sauce, topped with plenty of fish flakes. Great appetizer for a killer price $9.Kimchi cream Udon: This plate is to die for! Good amount of kimchi and a perfectly creamy sauce with a good amount of protein. Chikaten roll: this roll is fried with a great flavor profile. The downside is it is only 5 pieces of $12. It would be perfect if they added 3 more pieces: Service is very attentive and everyone works as team. Be sure to make a reservation or go early as they do tend to fill up quickly","I usually come here for their lunch. They got lots of option and everything around $10.This is my first time here for dinner.Every plates come with 4-5 pieces, very good for sharing.BFF roll: salmon tempura, avocado and cream cheese roll. Not bad, but I don't like cream cheese inside. MEW MUD: like poke bowl! Taste great with spicy tuna, salmon, seaweed salad, crab salad, avocado, spicy mayo.  Everything was perfect together!Yellowtail carpaccio: very fresh sashimi, and the ponzu sauce was so good with sashimi!Hatate Carpaccio: very fresh scallop, with mayo mustard. Never have this sauce with scallops before. Very unique and taste great.Kimchi udon. My favorite. Very creamy with kimchi inside!","The lavendar cocktail ,And all plates! Great Energy, amazing authentic food, great cocktails and sake choices -You cannot have a bad experience!",Izakaya MEW
295,"Happy hour was just amazing when you come in early and have reservations.  Service was quick, food came out  quick, and the oysters were crisp.  A must Roy if you are in the area and have some time to kill.","Food was okay, but my main concern is the lack of air conditioning during a freaking heat wave. In this heat I'm a little wary about how fresh their seafood really is.","Came here on a Monday night for Happy Hour; host was not happy about seating a group of five for a table of four and was a little weird about it.Ordered a lot from the HH menu:- Clam chowder: really, really tasty (wanted more of it!!!)- oysters were alright and very murky/ dirty looking not a great sign and got me a little worried- crunchy fish taco was tasty (wish there was more seasoning for the actual fish part)- calamari was great to share- shishito peppers were incredibly oily, but the lemon was a nice touch (wish they were seasoned better)","I had made reservations for the Mermaid Oyster Bar without any prior knowledge of the place, except for their happy hour from 5-7.We arrived right before 5 and there was already a line forming outside. A good sign. The interior had a very cozy and charming vibe to it accentuated by the candlelit tables. It looks pretty tight when you see the restaurant from the outside, but has a pretty spacious area in the back.We ordered strictly from menu. Quite honestly, it was one of the best happy hour menus I've seen for seafood. Here's what we ordered:1 dozen oysters and 1 1/2 dozen clams for $1 each - they have a rule where you can only order 2 dozen raw bar items at a time. The oysters and clams came with cocktail sauce with horseradish and mignonette. We asked for some tobasco. The shellfish were absolutely tasty and fresh. We enjoyed the clams more (had a delightful texture and sweetness) which is why we ordered a 1/2 dozen more after the first round.Calamari - a very decent portion considering it's happy hour and well cooked. Definitely get this.Clam chowder - literally a taster in a very tiny cup. Good for one person or if you want to share magbe 3 ppl can have 1 spoonful each. It was very tasty tho.Mini lobster roll - it was literally overflowing with chunks of juicy lobster pieces. You must order this!!!They also had drinks on happy hour so I had a aperol spritz, and a bloody mary and paloma for the rest of my group.Service was also amazing here. I cannot forget to mention the complimentary chocolate pudding and fish fortune teller that they will sadly be discontinuing due to environmental reasons (plastic waste).It was the perfect meal for a light but VERY satisfying dinner.","I got the Lobster Roll and it was delicious!!! I wish I made it to happy hour. They make tiny lobster rolls in their happy hour. It's so cute! The Bay Oysters from NY was good too. Sweet and smooth like the discription said. My friend got the fish taco. And of course, I ate one. It was delicious. Another cool detail, they have a fortune teller fish at the end. It was an overall great experience!!","I got the Lobster Roll and it was delicious!!! I wish I made it to happy hour. They make tiny lobster rolls in their happy hour. It's so cute!

296,Ordered several sandwiches here and they are mass produced with not much care at a premium price. My turkey sandwich was made with imd lettuce and the butt of under ripe  tomato. And it's expensive. Really  disappointed.  After I posted this someone responded asking me which location I visited- this tells me the ownership is absentee. Awful.,Ordered several sandwiches here and they are mass produced with not much care at a premium price. My turkey sandwich was made with old lettuce and the butt of an under ripe  tomato. And it's expensive. Really  disappointed.,"We will always post an honest review. Unbiased, regardless of quality or speed of service, this is strictly about food and the restaurant. We really wanted to believe that 2000-some reviews that were posted by others, giving this place four stars.We walked in and were seated pretty quickly. Was about 9:30 on a Sunday eve and the place was busy. Ordered our appetizers and entree which took average time to come out. Here are some details and opinions about the food:Corn appetizer: corn tasted old, over cooked, slimy cheese, cold. Empanadas: beef empanada has no flavor. Chicken empanada was great flavored, probably best tasting item of the whole meal. Combination plate: all three dishes were pretty much luke warm. Chicken cooked to death and dry in what looked like old oil. Pork was dry. Pulled pork was ok. Got side salad instead of rice and beans. Salad had old (sad and brown) leaves that showed that this was not one of their strong points - quality. Would not come back. Love Cuban food. Had a lot in the past around the country and islands but this was about the worst quality. Lastly, what was really a turn off about the noise level, was when they played music from the music box. It was extremely loud to the point that your ears would hurt. With a live band I would understand, but if you aren't playing music from speakers or tape, don't have it at a level that makes you want to cover your ears the entire meal time.","Ok. Let me start.  First off, restaurant wasn't crowded.  So seating wasn't an issue.  Sat down, checked in yelp style and boom got my free empanada. So far so good.  Got my mojito and it was a fabulous drink.  Made to perfection. Just enough alcohol.  The empanada came and t was good. I got the chicken and sofrito. Other members ordered the empanadas and they said they were great. Mac and cheese and shrimp and other flavors. I ordered mofongo and pernil.  OMGGFFFFFFGGGG TRULY AMAZING.  Just like mom use to make. Flavorful and so tender.  I can't wait to get back and have some more.  The waitress Zena was great. Knowledgeable and friendly. Eager to help us.  The only issue i had was the male barns like who kept on taking our dishes.  He basically rushed us in an empty restaurant.  Other than that the food and drinks and waitress were on point for a Times Square restaurant.","Right by Times Square, Havana central will make you feel like you're not in the middle of NYC. Two floors, tropical vibes & decent food. We got the steak, chicken in garlic sauce & pernil. Every entree comes with rice and beans and a side salad. Not bad for a restaurant that's catered towards all the tourists. I have ordered the arroz con pollo to my house & it's NOT WORTH IT. Take my word. PRO TIP: check in on yelp and get a free empanada","Came across this place while walking towards Times Square, and we thought about trying out something new(Cuban cuisine) on a Thursday night. They had live band and a very animated crowd when we got in. Got seated promptly and were taken good care through the night.Got started with the Ultimate Mojito(we were at a Cuban place duh), and the Caipirinha(Brazil's National cocktail). Drinks were on point. Would highly recommend getting some.For appetizers, we got some cuban garlic bread with a cheesy spinach dip(forgot the name). Got a couple entrees, pineapple pork chops and stuffed peppers. Wasn't very convinced by the peppers entree but I'd highly urge you to try out the pork chops(comes on a bed of yuca with some burnt rice on the side, yum yum).For desert, got the tres leches and it was creme supreme! Please try it out, you won't regret it.10/10 would go back again, for the food, music, and the Cuban experience!",Havana Central
297,Still great food but was recently treated very poorly by the server at the counter despite being a frequent customer. Will not be back!,"So of course i had to scroll thru all the photos 1st just to have something to compare. Now, the reason why i gave 3 stars is because i wish there was more hummus and falafel in my sandwich. From picture scouting i believe i got hijacked on the falafel. It was tasty but didnt make me go crazy. My suggestion: try for yourself u may feel diff. I wasnt crazy about it and there was soooo much red cabbage and white sauce that it over powered the sandwich. My 1st shot i ripped a piece off to see inside.","This place was good at getting the job done. Decent taste, portions at a reasonable price. Other than that, nothing spectacular. I'd venture out to Mamouns for a tastier falafel pita option.There is a bathroom here though! Keys are located at the counter where you pick up your order and when you're done, there's plenty of seating to return to in this spacious restaurant!","I lived near Paterson, NJ for quite sometime If you know anything about that place, there is a plethora of authentic delicious middle eastern food.While in Brooklyn, I found this Tunisian restaurant and wondered if there will be anything different here than other middle eastern or Mediterranean restaurants.There is.First, the owner and workers are polite.They were very kind to us, genuinely.And on top of that, the food was delicious.The shalafel, salad and falafel with chicken was really really good. I would eat that every dayWe also had their recommended lamb sausage sandwich which they said was a local meal...superbDecor is nice, food is great","I should start by saying I think the employees/seller are nice and polite, the restaurant is pleasent and clean, and the prices are relatively fair. That all being said, the food is just not good and nothing here is fresh.My go to is Mediterranean food. i ate in hundreds of places over my 34 years, and the food here is among the worst I had.The Hummus is not made in house. Its taste and texture is of a grocery store boxed hummus (and not even a good one) with some spice over it.The tahini is diluted with water and not made in house.The french fries is frozen and then deep fried. The shawarma is not a shawarma by texture, seasoning or flavor - it's frozen as well. It is more like a blend souvlaki.The baklave was old (not made in house). When the owner couldn't cut it, she brought it to the kitchen to be warmed and cut. Its texture was old and pretty awaful.I'm not sure about the falafel as I'm convinced about the other items, but I believe it is frozen and deep fried, and not made in house as well. It doesn't taste good by any means.If you have a benchmark for Mediterranean food, you will not like the food here (I wouldn't be surprised if the 5 stars here are paid for or something has significantly changed).On a positive note, the AC was good and the coke can was fresh...","I've never tasted something quite like the roasted cauliflower with labneh at La Goulette. Named after a seaside suburb of Tunis, the city's lone remaining Tunisian restaurant had been on my list for quite some time, and this week I finally had the chance to actually check it out. Roasted cauliflower is usually hit or miss for me, but their tangy rendition was probably the best I've ever had. I also tried the babaganoush which was flavourful and fresh.Will definitely be back to try the falafel and other menu items!",La Goulette
298,"I really wanted to like this concept, but I don't really understand the pasta here. For $20 I'd expect some more well-crafted flavors but the shiitake spaghetti I ordered unfortunately tasted like store bought tomato sauce. My friends pasta came overwhelmingly drowned in parmesan, to the point where the pasta was so thick and heavy you couldn't really consume it. Portion sizes are decent, but the flavors could use some work.","Excellent LunchFirst time dining here and it will not be the last. We opted for the prixe fix lunch, cavatelli and prosciutto for me and spaghetti with shrimp for my wife.The meal included a mixed green salad, coffee and sponge cake with ice cream for dessert.Great service, not always  a given, made this establishment a cut above the rest. We will be back for a repeat visit at dinner.","I used to frequent this restaurant when I lived downtown. Decided to return after a few years since I had friends visiting. The quality was noticeably sub-par - spaghetti noodles were crunchy, fish and veggies didn't taste fresh, and it was just nothing like what I remembered. It used to be a Japanese-Italian fusion restaurant, staffed by mostly Japanese too, but there was only 1 this time - which is fine - but it loses the authenticity and takes away from the experience.","Japanese Italian has to be one of my favorite combinations and Basta Pasta does it really well. You're not going to see a lot of Japanese cuisine but it definitely has a lot of influences on the dishes. We ordered the duck breast salad, the tobiko roe spaghetti and the sea urchin linguine. I love the light flavors each dish has. It really emphasizes the taste of the seafood flavors. The roe spaghetti was a little too light/flat to me though. The roe was good but definitely not strong enough to be a standalone protein in a pasta. The duck breast salad was good but the salad may be a bit bitter to some people. Definitely enjoyed the delicious sea urchin linguine though.Excellent service here. Also really enjoyed the easy going mellow vibe it gave off without being too noisy. Perfect for a casual date night. Overall, a really interesting spot if you enjoy pasta but want a more Japanese influence on it. It's solid alternative if you can't get a seat at any of the more popular fancy Italian restaurants.","I think on google it's listed as a japanese italian place & it really is. There are traces of japanese cuisine in the menu which make the normal pasta dishes seem more intriguing. We got:- duck salad 8/10: pretty good, the duck was certainly delicious but the salad could have used a little more something- white sauce seafood linguine 8/10: by white sauce they dont actually mean a cream sauce, which i was expecting. There was an ample amount of seafood however- spaghetti con prosciutto 9/10: this is the one that comes in the parmesan wheel and was really good!! The prosciutto is different from most and is thicker than your average one. - tiramisu 7/10: pretty standard nothing striking- cheesecake 7/10: sameOverall i had a good time but nothing impressed me enough for me to want to come again (esp when pasta places are a dime a dozen). And not like prices were all that cheap either.","Basta Pasta is an intimate, dimly lit restaurant. While it's Italian food, the chef is Asian so there's a twist on some of the dishes. We got wine to start, of which they didn't have any Chardonnay. However the waiter recommended something similar and we both ended up getting glasses. We started off with the duck breast salad which was light and refreshing - perfect for before having some pasta. For pasta, you HAVE to get the spaghetti con prosciutto as it comes in the cheese wheel. We also tried the salmon which was cooked perfectly. Overall I would definitely come back to try more dishes.",Basta Pasta
299,"Avoid this restaurant at all costs! Total rip off in the area. Came here for brunch to try the chicken and waffles as well as the shrimp and grits. Grits were gelatinous and only came with 5 shrimp while the chicken and waffles came with only 3 chicken wings. 3 chicken wings for $20?! Living in the city I know things are expensive, but this is just too much!Service was nice but incompetent. Avoid this place. There's a bunch of other restaurants in the area with better food.","Buttery deliciousness...that's what my lobster roll tasted like. I died as soon as I took a bite. I would definitely order it again. The service was great and it wasn't too busy, but you should still make a reservation. It was my birthday when I went, so I got creme brûlée on the house. Talk about delish!","Food is very well prepared but, the service and portion is not as good as used to be.

300,"I think the popularity of this spot really comes from the good atmosphere and the outdoor seating availability. We came at 9pm on a saturday and it was still completely packed with a 1 hour wait. The tacos were alright, nothing out of this world and the carne asada was very tough despite being cooked medium rare. We had to really cut it down to bite size pieces to be able to chew it. I probably wouldn't come back because the food isnt worth the wait.","THE WORST FOOD ON THE PLANET! The chicken tasted horrible, was not seasoned at all. Literally wanted to walk out the establishment! The only good thing was the sparkling water, chips and guacamole. Heard very good reviews on this place  extremely disappointed!","A delightful find while out shopping on a rather dreary Sunday. Prompt service in a very adorable setting. We came during brunch so the menu reflected that. The food was good but nothing really truly stood out to me except for one of the salsas that came with the chips, guac, and salsa (which is NOT free haha)",This place is great! Service was received really well.Plus the elotes are soooo good Overall experience was excellent,"Came here for my husband and friend's birthday dinner. It was packed and we didn't have a lot of time before we needed to be somewhere else for a show. The hostess was so nice and accommodating. She quickly found us a table with all smiles. The ambiance was lively but warm.  I loved the warm tones of the lighting. The decor was the standard kitschy Mexican that you see everywhere else. The food was really good. Small portions but filling. We had the fruit salad plate with honey and ricotta for the table and it was fantastic. The tacos were flavorful and the margarita I had was very tasty! At the end of our meal, the birthday people were brought out a surprise ice cream each with a candle. Their birthdays had been mentioned in passing when we arrived, and the hostess saw to it that our server knew and brought them out a free celebratory dessert. I thought that was so nice and unexpected! It's a little too pricy for the dishes but overall we had a very positive experience here.","One of the few places in the city with decent Mexican fare that does not make this former Texan wrinkle her nose. First of all it's cute in here. Secondly the ingredients are fresh and they balance out well in the dishes they offer. They have decent drink specials and can feed a temporary  vegetarian without leaving anyone hungry. I really enjoyed the ensalada de melon. That cantaloupe, watermelon, jícama action is really refreshing.I also enjoy the outdoor seating. Good for people watching and enjoying the weather although 2nd ave is a busy road in this section.",Rosie's
301,"Sitting at the bar.... I wouldn't come to this location again. Drinks are so weak and my partner saw a roach crawl up and tried to join us for our meal. Stopped eating, Paid and left ‍Blah.... The food at this location was disappointing anyways and that just grossed us out. This location needs work! ‍","Though this place has delicious HH cocktails (weak/light, but for HH prices), the food is completely mediocre.  Actually, I find it a bit pricey for what it really is.  I had the garlic fried rice (which I LOVED, but it was still a bit much...), and the kimchi chigae ramen (which was watery, overcooked, bland, and TERRIBLE).  I rarely leave food (to not take home), but here I just couldn't eat it (though I was HUNGRY) and was really disappointed.  I think it was prepackaged.  Or, powder-soup, watered down.The service was very odd.  I think IF I return, it would solely be for HH at the bar, with bar food (rice...)","Such a shitty location. I've been going to Gyu-Kaku's East Village location for years and it's always been a go-to for me. Came to the Times Square location on a Friday evening and it was crawling with tourists (but what can I expect at times sq?). The grill fire wasn't working properly, it wasn't burning enough; the meats were marinated way too much and so salty; and the service was very mediocre. The highlight of our meal was probably the s'mores we got at the end of our meal (that came with our bbq course). Would not recommend this location AT ALL!","Gyu Kaku is a Japanese BBQ place that has great deals if you come at the right time. Their hours may change, but right now (Sept 2019) they have double happy hours (one at a regular time and one that's a ""late-night"" happy hour from 9:30PM-closing (I think that's 11PM on most nights). I used to go to the other Gyu Kaku location after work near my old workplace (midtown east) and somehow forgot how good this place is.

There was about a 10 minute wait for dining-in, which wasn't really an issue since we walked in during the late happy hour and were able to grab some drinks at the bar and wait. Most of their drinks are half-off. I got the Coco-Mo for only $5, and it was really tasty and WELL-WORTH THE $! My boyfriend also got a cocktail and also a ""Mega-Beer"" for $6. Prices you almost never see in the city and the beer glass was larger than his head!For food, we did the two-person tasting menu (that was discounted because of the late happy hour) and also ordered a side of the spicy cucumbers (soo tasty).  We walked away extremely happy and full.The service was also amazing, everyone was really friendly and helpful. Even offering to change out the grill and advised us on how to cook/how long to cook each meat for. Will definitely be coming back to eat and drink more!","2 of us event there around 12:00pmIt was already about 70% fullThere were few option for lunch.Either 2 or 3 items lunch, or you can order single item separately for lunch price.We decide to order lunch Sakura course$39.95Which include the item below for starter:gyu kaku salad x2Miso soup x2White rice x2Japanese fried chicken For BBQ item we got :Bone in kalbi rib eye Yaki shabu beef misoToro beef tare sweet soy Spicy porkChicken breast basil And s'mores for dessert!All the meats were marinaded already,So no sauce needed. But if you like, there were ponzu, sweet soy or spicy sauce on the side for you.The meat quality was ok, with this price, I don't expect high quality of meats. All the marinaded meat were pretty salty, so you can't really taste anything but sauce. Not very juicy and tender either.","Guy-Kaku, at dinner time (around 8PM) was a little bit packed. There was an expected wait time of around 30 minutes, and we were barely able to find a seat at the bar. The happy hour special was pretty good (most of the drinks were between $3-8) and it felt like you were getting your money's worth with both the cocktails and the larger sized beers)Once we were seated at the table, we ordered two sets of barbecue meals (meant for two people each) ... which is when some of the chaos began. A few waiters and waitresses came over one at a time and asked if we already had a waiter. When our food came out, they forgot to give us sauces... despite the fact that each one of us was given an empty sauce dish. The waiter who initially took our order went missing, and we had to ask another one for water (and to my recollection, we never saw our initial waiter again).The food itself was quite expensive. With one beer and my portion of the barbecue, it came out to $46 after tax and tip (in the attached pictures, was a meal meant for four people in total). That being said, the food was quite good. The salad was exceptional, most of the cuts of beef were high quality and good tasting (some weren't, but most were good) but the highlight was the spicy sauce. The spicy sauce made the meal.Despite some mishaps, the meal was solid and I wouldn't mind coming back to try some of the other selections on the menu.",Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ
302,"Didn't get a table or order to go , arrived on Friday 8 pm , they said they completely booked ( party of 2 ) so we start looking for other options around and in mean time other group of 3 came , and I heard they taking to the host , she said if you can wait 10 minutes they might be able to find a table for them , we came back with same question, and she said NO for party of 2 , probably they didn't want to keep table for 4 busy only with 2 people , so they loosing money . After I watched video about owner and how he want to keep it oldschool and now it looks it's only business no oldschool","My favorite pizza in NYC (Juliana's is #2).  I could tell you the secrets of how to get a table, but then how would I beat the crowds?","Best pizza - no doubt 5 stars. Worst customer service experience of all time- 1 star. My 14 year old son researched this place and swore this was going to be the BOAT as were from the 1000 miles away. Well as for the pizza he was right. BUT the hostess was abrupt and rude to him (6'0 tall maybe mistaken for an adult). After not being able to get a table, we waited 2 hours for take out (not a problem). When we were given only three pizza in a box, he wanted napkins and hot peppers-sprinkles. He would not go ask. So I went and asked her. With a glare and bf I could finish my sentence she left to get napkins. When she returned I asked for peppers, she said she could go inside and grab a pepper container, as if I was going to decline. Greatest pizza, rudest service, and don't expect napkins and peppers on to go order. The first person you see at a restaurant sets the tone and communicates the business culture-message. I'm gonna guess maybe it was a bad day and she's usually great. Feedback- place someone up front that understands this principle and is on point w customers. Arrogance and poor customer service doesn't mix well with the best pizza.","Worth following the rules and waiting in line for the reservation.  If you plan to come with more than 4 people, just be prepared that you may be feasting on this delicious pizza closer to 9pm.  Be there by 4pm to wait in line for your reservation and be prepared to take any time slot you can.  The girls at the door are excellent, no games and they keep it moving.  Definitely appreciate that!  The crust of the pizza is light and crisps up beautifully.  The gents making the pizza are friendly, if you're stopping by the bathroom, say hello and thank you. You can't go wrong with the pepperoni and garlic pies, literally will melt in your mouth.  The ingredients are top notch.  Normally, pizza leaves me with a heart burn sensation because of cheap dough ingredients, but I have no issue at all with Lucali pizza.  It's a must have. Pro tip - If ordering the calzone, make sure to order a plate of pepperoni on the side to stuff in.  Bring your favorite bottle of wine and enjoy every bite.  The owner is fantastic, greets everyone dining. Highly appreciative and his story is pretty cool. Peak their website for the details. Last but not least, this is a staple in the pizza business, so you never know who you may run into. Jay Z and Beyonce are regulars, hint hint.  Just don't be star struck and appreciate that even the top 1% enjoy this phenomenal pizza. Definitely plan a day to visit Lucali, get your name on the reservation list and go visit some of the local breweries... Other Half is a great local option.","My boyfriend got in line on a Friday at about 3:45 (thanks babe). He was 6th in line. The host came around at about 5:15 to give out reservations. We got the first seating (5:45) but unfortunately I was stuck at work so he asked the hostess for the second seating at 6:30 (I know - major screw up on my part). She was somewhat annoyed but instructed him to find someone to switch with. As you can imagine it was super easy to find 2 people that were willing to switch. I arrived at 6 and we walked over to a cute wine shop on Union (Il Vignetto Fine Wine & Spirits) to grab our bottle of wine for dinner. It's BYOB - 1 - 750ml of wine or a 6 pack of beer per table. We returned just before 6:30 and sat on the bench out front and chatted with the hostess. She was very pleasant. When our name was called walked in and all of the staff greeted us, even the guys in the back cooking waived. Our waitress was also super friendly.Food was excellent. We ordered a pizza with pepperoni and basil and a small calzone with garlic. I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that we ate all of it! Definitely recommend! Just make sure to plan ahead and be okay with the waiting!","The experience didn't live up to the hype in my opinion.I think the pizza was delicious but the overall, I wouldn't call it exceptional by any means.I get that by keeping it a first come first serve type of business you make it an exclusive outing but I would not see myself wait in line on a cold and rainy day. Remember to bring cash as it is the only form of payment accepted.Also, it is bring your own bottle and they ask that you only bring one bottle as seating is limited to one hour. There is a few places to get wine nearby and highly recommended Scotto's; 5 minute walk.Another aspect I found unpleasant, and that's really a personal preference, was how loud and cramped the dining room was. It might be part of the charm but it is not my cup of tea.The kitchen is located in the dining room so you can witness where the magic actually happens. I thought the service was pleasant and quick. You can't have any other way if you want this kind of business to strive.",Lucali
303,"Mixed experience.  The hostess situation was bad - she checked us in and forgot we were there for over an hour (until I checked back in with her). Then seated us in the bar - which we specifically said not to.  The service- with Jesus as our main waiter- was very attentive.  The atmosphere is hip.Squash & ricotta app - surprisingly tasty!  My fav part of dinner.Calamari with pretzel app - good but not unique (tasted very typical of calamari).Bolognese pasta - good, though not sure I'd have again.  Spicy (which I like) but the spice took over the meaty flavor of the dish.  The pasta was done right.Sea bass - just not a fan.  Can't explain it, but was served in watery sauce with basil.  The basil overpowered.  The potatoes just didn't need to be there (lacked flavor). Disappointed.  Cookie appetizer - only liked the Malomar.  The rest was too sugary.","The food is still delicious and the bussing staff was wonderful, but I extend a 3 star rating because of the waiter that our table had. The waiter was rude from the first encounter. We had a five year old in the group, but he was behaving well and there was no reason to approach us sideways. We decided to share food and when a couple of plates were cleared, a busser visited to remove them. We continued to stack empty plates on the side of our table in order to make space and avoid a mess for our little one. Then, the waiter came and said we don't clear the table until everyone is finished, but in this case I will take them. I live in Las Vegas and hearing this instead of ""how is everything"" and simply removing the items was ridiculous. I felt like we were assumed to not belong in the restaurant, even though we caused no scene or trouble. While I thoroughly enjoyed my experience in 2016, I was disappointed this visit. Of the food we had, the crab toast was the best. Other items were good but not memorable. Our least favorite was the broccoli rabe. The chili was overpowering and the flavor combo was not appealing.",Generally a good ambience and flavorful dishes but not worth the price.Had high expectations for raw fluke which was disappointing.,"Beautiful decor inside!Went for lunch and although we did make a reservation, didn't seem too packed.We started with the crab toast and tomato salad - both very light, fresh and great for sharing. For my main entree, I went for the burger and it was HEAVENLY. Loved that it had a bit of a spicy kick to it. Highly recommended!","So as it turns out, Jean Georges Vongerichten (the top chef honcho at ABC Kitchen) is not Joel Robuchon, who features legendary mashed potato sides at every one of his restaurants. I was first in the city from a long flight, end of the day, and in the moment I had mixed up the two in my head. That said, the mashed potatoes side at ABC Kitchen were very good, as they were just as creamy and buttery as you'd want in any excellent version. While I have no shame in admitting that I have in the past eaten only potatoes as a meal, I was fortunate enough to have more than that here. The charcuterie and cheese plate is exactly what you'd want it to be if you ordered it. And the sea bass dish was perfect, with a surprising drops of diced, candied or preserved lemon of some kind. The dish was outstanding. The only downside was this bread that they served, which was dry and didn't have a great flavor. The service was all perfect and kind, so points for that!I overall enjoyed ABC Kitchen and would definitely return next time I'm in New York!","Love this place!! The servers are very kind and my only real complaint was the uncomfortable chairs. We sat at a high top table with metal chairs and no backs. I don't really get for it being part of a furniture - couldn't we have more comfortable chairs and still be stylish? Anyway back to the food:Escarole - 4/5 very light and a nice touch from the artichokes and sweet nectarines, good clean appCrab toast - 5/5 okay I get why everyone raves about this. Seems simple but it's so lemony and savory and delicious!Sea bass - 3/5 it was good! But not anything special and still expensive. A little spicy but the citrus on top was too sour in my opinionBurger - 5/5 okay I get why everyone love this as well! There was something about the cheese and the pickled jalapenos didn't make it that spicy if you're worried about. Fries were perfectly crisp yext soft!",ABC Kitchen
304,"came in here about 2 weeks ago. take a look at the menu and no allergens are listed (not the biggest deal), i inquired about which menu items don't contain dairy as the one i was looking at didn't have cheese listed as an ingredient but i was told contained it. the servers response to my polite question about dairy was, ""well i'mnot going to stand here and go through the whole menu."" in possibly the rudest tone i have ever heard from a front of house employee.got a little flustered as i have never dealt with hostility for no reason, and scrambled to find another option. the person i was with asked me whether this was fine or we should find somewhere else and the server said ""is there a problem?"" in an extremely confrontational way. literally sounded like she was gonna say ""should we take this outside?"" next.i just left. i guess it's a trendy area or whatever but this was ridiculous. if you're there and the server with the blue hair comes over to your table, i suggest you don't waste your time and just head out.","We first ordered the Brussels sprouts, they were good but definitely not worth the price. It was too hard and had too much of a burnt flavor. For my entree, I ordered the big breakie expecting a delicious brunch meal and suffice to say I was ultimately disappointed, the bread was inedible. Way too hard. I asked our server and he mentioned they use multigrain bread and toast it an additional time. The two girls next to my party also mentioned the same issue with the bread. It ruined the whole vibe of the meal. I left the restaurant with a sore jaw.","Worst ordering experience EVER --Tried to order through seamless for a nice lunch on Friday. I was quite excited after reading reviews about Dudley's online, but I would never expect what happened next...I submitted my order at 11:20am, then got a confirm email at 11:40am saying my order is accepted. But a few mins later, a staff at the Dudley's called me informing pastas are not available for lunch. Slightly disappointed, I decided to switch it to something else they serve for lunch since I'm really interested in this place. So I asked if rice bowls and burgers are available. The staff hesitated (possibly didn't know) but then said yes. Just when I started to order, the line was cut. I called back, he said the line was broken. ""It's ok. So I want these items instead ... "" I said. ""We don't except order through phone"" he interrupted me. ""No. It's about the order I placed through seamless"" I said. But abruptly, he just hung up the call. I tried to call back again, but no one picked up the phone. Then I received a phone call from seamless saying the order is canceled.Possibly worst experience ever... wasted 1.5hrs before I got delivery from another place.","Came here over the weekend and since my last visit, they have redone the space, making it much bigger and more aesthetically pleasing. The space now looks like an upscale restaurant, rather than a casual cafe and restaurant. Had the Bronte burger in between lunch and dinner hours, they do not automatically serve chips with it during day hours. I was craving a burger and it hit the spot, though the burger was served a little over cooked than what I had requested it to be. Overall a solid choice for food and burgers, not amazing.","Despite the trend of Australian cafes that New York seems to be overwhelmed with currently, there are some places that have established themselves as stalwarts despite the trendiness. Dudleys happens to be one of those places. We came in on a Saturday night at prime dinner hour and saw other groups being turned away, but since it was just two of us, we snagged two seats at the bar immediately. The staff brought us menus and water promptly, and we decided quickly on what to eat. The restaurant is pretty small, with a bar area, and space is tight. Music is loud on a Saturday night, and the acoustics of the restaurant make it a little hard to hear. Food was mistakenly brought to us once that was for the couple next to us. Our food came out shortly after, and we weren't disappointed. The Brussels sprouts were a tad on the salty side, and made it hard to finish the full dish, despite being delicious. The branzino, served with a cauliflower mash, was perfectly cooked and pleasing to eat. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his fried chicken sandwich, proclaiming it very flavorsome and made well. Service was brisk and efficient. Am now a fan of Dudleys and will be back to try brunch.",This brunch spot is very aesthetic and food is yum.+ came here around 2:50 and they let me order from the brunch/ breakfast menu which ends at 3pm! yay+ staff was friendly and checked up on us constantly + everything was super aesthetic and ig worthy (even the cocktails)+ they have a bar and outdoor seating as well,Dudley's
305,"On my first occasion at Noodle Pudding, I gave it five stars. The service was excellent, the staff friendly, and the food delicious. I told everyone I knew how amazing it was and that they had to try it. But, on my most recent visit, I waited over and hour and a half for a table for three, without much explanation. After searching for the person to put my name down with, I was told 45 minutes to an hour. Many parties who put their namedown after us were seated ahead of us and we were given no explanation as to why and our inquiries were rudely disregarded. After finally getting a seat, the wait staff was dismissive and cold. The food was not nearly as good as the last time. What an unfortunate turn of events.","Food was solid, but be prepared for a loud atmosphere and below average wait service and attention.  I would recommend arriving early, since they do not accept reservations.","Went here for dinner on a Friday night around 8:30-9pm. We were seated right away and greeted by our server to get drinks and food order. That was basically the last time we saw our server (tall gentleman with round glasses). Our wine glasses sat empty for over an hour, throughout our meal, which a bus boy brought out. Took forever to flag down our waiter for the bill as well. Decent food but horrible service.","I really don't want to tell people about this place to keep it to myself, but you will absolutely not be disappointed going here and pointing to anything on the menu. Been going here for years and is the one of the best restaurants in NYC. Cash only. Staff have a lot going on so don't expect a quick turnaround but come here hungry and with cash and you'll have one of the best dinners ever. Blue fish and if they have if, sea bass are my absolute favorites. Head chef prides himself on cooking fish to perfection and I've never wanted a blue fish off a menu until coming here.","On my trip to NYC, I wanted some Italian food and was recommended this place. As a heads up, it is cash only. I started with the kitchen sink salad which was absolutely delicious. When I asked the waitress what it was, she said it's just a mix of the vegetables the chef gets from the market that day. Whatever market he goes to must be amazing. Then I had the bruschetta and the bread was perfectly toasted and the ricotta on top tasted pretty fresh. After, I ordered the gnocchi with butter and sage. I literally did a happy dance it was so delicious. The gnocchi was creamy and they butter and sage enhanced the flavor of the gnocchi. When the waitress asked us where we lived in the city, we told her we were visiting from out of town and the owner, Tony, walked over, asked us how we liked the food, and asked the waitress to take care of us. We ended up with free watermelon and dessert! I have never been to a restaurant that has had such a home feeling and been so wonderful and welcoming. Highly recommend!","This has become hands-down my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn. The staff is so friendly and the food is perfect every time. The chef's (Tony's) version of Farm To Table which she has been doing his entire culinary career. Don't miss the calamri, zucchini flowers when you can get them!",Noodle Pudding
306,"The soup dumplings are stuck together, so that when you pick them up all the juice falls out. Woman calling out the numbers was rude. Bad service and bad food. Person taking orders was rude, too.","Growing up in a Shanghainese family, I spent a lot of time eating shanghainese food in both the Bay and in Shanghai, so I'm always trying to find places that serve my favorite dishes1. Crab xiaolongbao: Skin thick and gummy, crab flavor more of a hint than actual crab pieces or roe, meat not quite as fragrant as I would have liked...Would not return for the xlb really since their xlb are definitely worse quality than the ones at the bao or the ones at the old nanxiang xiao long (and maybe even worse than that of tourist chinatown)1/52. Meatballs over rice: I adore lion's head meatballs (shizitou) so was excited to see it on the menu. It was pretty good! Flavor was good: sweet as a lot of Shanghainese dishes are but not too sweet, savory in a lip smacking way. The sauce was thin, but I infinitely prefer that to places that use starch to thicken the sauce into a sad gloop. The meat was light and fluffy and didn't have the pork ""stink"" that marks ill-prepared pork in Chinese cuisine. The vegetable side choices confused me--lions head meatballs typically are served with green bok choy (aka qingcai) rather than the cabbage or the random veggie mix. To add more insult to injury, the cabbage was bland and a little undercooked. The egg I got was reminiscent of a tea egg but lacking flavor, as well as being overdone and weirdly wrinkly--a first for me.Meatballs: 4/5Sides: 1/53. Vegetable steamed buns: I loveeeee eating vegetable steamed buns for breakfast in Shanghai. I have yet to find any in New York, so I immediately knew I had to get these. Google what ""cai bao zi"" look like so you can see how these are Not It. I was kind of heartbroken. They filled the buns with cabbage instead of the customary filling of fragrant qingcai (shanghai bok choy) and it left me actually sad. Why take something perfect and ruin it? Why even put it on the menu if you can't find qingcai? Why give me hope? 0/5I would return for the meatballs maybe, but certainly nothing else.","I've been eyeing this place for a while and when I saw a deal on ritual I just had to go and check it out. I ended up getting the chicken soup dumpling, and it was interesting.My supervisor and I both thought the dough was light and not heavy, the first bite was juicy and not dry at all, however the broth was a bit flavorless and not much filling inside. They do offer different condiment such as hot sauce, soy, and a ginger sauce. The dumpling itself is missing something, it has potential to be better.The service was quick and the store was clean. 3.5 stars to be honest, but I haven't tried any of the other items they make.I wouldn't go out of my way to re-visit this place.","Delicious xiaolongbao and noodle soup (the ultimate comfort food) in Downtown Brooklyn. The pork xiaolongbao were well made -- the skin was not too thick or thin, had flavorful soup, and had great consistency and taste overall. It would be nicer if they had more than 4 dumplings per serving though. The Braised Beef Noodle Soup has a slight spice that made the soup even more flavorful. The Beef was tender and tasted great with the noodles, but it would've been even more amazing if there were more noodles in the dish, because there was definitely not enough. Overall, the food tasted great and I'll definitely be back. The portions are on the smaller end though, so keep that in mind when ordering.","I wanted something quick and easy but in a decent decor and with some flair to it. Then we tripped across this fast-casual-style Shanghainese restaurant and were glad that we did. We shared the spicy chicken with vegetables and rice which wasn't really spicy at all...just spiced, but that was OK. We also had the dry noodles with tofu and they were actually far more flavorful and interesting.All of the ordering is digital making for a quick and easy checkout process. The staff are extremely polite and as attentive as can be when they've got lots of orders flying at them from seemingly lots of apps and in-location customers. I'll likely be back at some point.",The food is delicious here... I appreciate the easy to read and see menu along with the authentic flavors of the foodS. I've noticed portion sizes have changed significantly and for that reason I'm going to give it a 3... however the rib tips and the meat ball are my favorites!!! Haven't tried the soup but that's next!,Yaso Tangbao
307,"Went here during brunch hour. Our waitress had a bad attitude when we requested to be moved away from the window she rolled her eyes, let out a huge sigh and sounded irritated. Food wasn't anything special we ordered meat pie and Brazilian breakfast. The size of the meat pies were in small soup cup and the bb just looked like a western breakfast. Combination of bad service and food I would go elsewhere.",These are the steak cutlets that were delivered to my office. Barely cooked. I could've gotten food poisoning or worse. I'm really disappointed because I've ordered from Samba Kitchen before and never had a problem. Seamless was able to get me a refund but I won't be ordering from here ever again.,"My friend made a reservation for 7pm on a weekday but it  wasn't busy so we probably didn't need it. I would give it 5 stars for my dish: Moqueca (seafood stew of whitefish, shrimp, mussels, palm oil, coconut milk, tomato, onion, green pepper) served with white rice. I would give it 3 stars for my friend's dish: Salada Samba (kale, tomato, mango, and passion fruit dressing). It was mostly kale and not particularly flavorful or filling. I would also give it 3 stars for the service: They weren't busy that night but it was difficult for us to flag down the waitress to order and to get the check. We were late to go dancing afterwards because the dinner/service took 30 minutes longer than we expected. But I would come back for that seafood stew if it doesn't take so long next time.","One of my absolute favorite places in Hell's Kitchen. There are very few restaurants that I visit often, but Samba is the exception. Samba is good for date nights, night our with friends or with family. Everyone I've taken here has loved the food. Here's what you should order:Drinks: CaprihanasApps: Strip Steak or ShrimpEntrees: Moqueca or Bufe a PortuguesaI've never been disappointed by this place. Food, drinks and service are always exceptional.","I made reservation but wasn't busy so we decided to just eat at the bar. Our bartender was very friendly which always help. I wanted to order everything (as usual) but settled for what I was craving (Moqueca and Camarao no Coco) since they are pretty heavy/ filling dishes.They bring 4 pao de queijos (cheese bread) complimentary when you order your food. I love cheese bread and they were delicious! Now, lets move on to the food part. Food was good, I can see why so many awesome reviews BUT not authentic... being Brazilian and traveling to Brazil often I was a bit let down. Again, if you are looking for good, tasty food you will definitely be happy here. However if you are looking for authentic tastes this is probably not it. I would recommend Emporium Brasil or Rice and Beans for that (my go to in Hells Kitchen area)","Came here to try their Brazilian steak and it was not appealing.. the portion was such a great size, 3 pcs of steak w rice and beans. But the steak itself tasted grainy. Maybe im not used to how Brazilian steaks are supposed to taste but it just wasnt for me..Service was great tho.",Samba Kitchen
308,"Booked a reservation for Wayla about a month out. Sadly on the day of our dinner, it was raining and the beautiful back patio was closed down. All the food we had was amazing, definitely order the lobster noodles and curry of the day. We didn't get a chance to try anything else because we are gluten free and don't eat pork (sad) but the fried fish looked insane.","Cute place, but mediocre food.  My curry was too salty.","Worth the wait.  Fun place. Moo sarong and house made sausage must order...and I'm not a big meateater Nim prakh wasn't great, skip, bunch of raw vegetables with dips. Daily curry, noodles, fried bronzino and Amish chicken are worth ordering.  Waiter steered us away from fried chicken.","My girl friend asked me to come to this place months ago but we didn't have chance to try because they only open in the evening. On Wednesday night we had chance to go so we went to the restaurant but still had to wait, the line to sit on a table it was about 1-1.30 hours so we decided just to sit at a bar instead. The bartender was so friendly, nice and professional. He gave us a nice and delicious drinks and we were enjoying the drinks so much. Food was good especially crab meat fried rice. We ordered a steak in medium rare but the meat was too rare and my friend was not crazy about. Overall we like this place so much and how cool the restaurant decoration.","I went with a group of 4 people and was able to try every dish that the server suggested that were customer favorites. There were only two dishes that I would reorder - the market vegetables which came with 3 dipping sauces that were all different and flavorful. The house vegetables curry, also the one and only curry on the menu. The sauce is flavorful and great with rice but the vegetables in there do not add anything to the overall dish. The star is the sauce, the vegetables are added in later. Now onto the bad. Please safe your money and do not get the lobster. It's a lobster with pad Thai, in short, it's a gimmick to get you to spend more money. The pad Thai has no place in that lobster, nor does the lobster have a place in that pad Thai. There were other dishes that were just so so- the crispy meatballs, whole fried fish and morning glory. They were all fine but not memorable. All in all, it is an authentic Thai restaurant that I would visit again but I would order differently next time.","Food allergy friendliness: 3/5Food: 2/5Ambiance: 5/5Wayla is a relatively new Thai restaurant in a hip, hard-to-find location down a flight of stairs in LES. The restaurant is very long and narrow, with a cool bar at the windows by the front, and leads to a garden patio with communal seating and citronella candles. I was really impressed by the patio and would go back there for a drink any time, but the food was underwhelming. We ordered the nam prik appetizer which was a confusing mix of raw vegetables and ""sauces"" that weren't really sauces but were bowls of ground meat. I wasn't sure how I was supposed to dip a raw carrot in a bowl of ground pork but maybe I was missing something. For an entree, we had the whole fried branzino, which comes conveniently pre-cut and fried in chunks so you don't have to pick around bones. The fish itself was kind of dry and flavorless though and we had to ask for a sauce to make it enjoyable. They're fairly attentive to food allergies and the menu can be made to accommodate most major food allergens, although if you have a severe peanut or seafood allergy it's probably not the place for you. Overall, if you're looking to eat appetizers with interesting cocktails in a cool outdoor setting, this is a good spot for you. If you're looking for good Thai food in the neighborhood, go to Uncle Boon's instead. The food is similarly priced and infinitely better.",Wayla
309,"This is the second time at this restaurant and we were shocked at the lack of service. The waitress was never around and appeared almost annoyed with having to serve us. We had to ask other waiters to get more drinks. After we finished our entrees the busboys cleared the table and we sat there for more than 30min waiting to see if the waitress would offer dessert or to check if we wanted anything else. We were there to celebrate our 7yr anniversary and felt so disappointed. After we couldn't wait any longer, my husband just asked for the check and we left. Additionally, the food was not so good as before. We ordered exactly the same items from 1yr ago and it was just blah. Sushi was the only good thing Very different service from the last time we celebrated our anniversary there. Was hoping this would be an annual visit. Id return only for drinks at the bar.","TOURIST TRAP. The bathrooms are absolutely disgusting, the service is slow and dismissive. We got a patio spot with zero view by the entrance. When we told the waiter we're only doing drinks at 3.30pm, we was rude saying there is a long line for tables. I ordered sparkling rose but received a glass of white. Avoid at all cost.",Came here for brunch on a Saturday and best to have a reservation. Even with a reservation if you want to sit outside there will be a wait of anywhere 20 to 45 mins. We set inside since we were seatee right away. The brunch is on the pricier at $29 per person but you get 4 appertizers to share. The ricotta and bean spread is a big portion. The Goat cheese croquet and bacon wrap dates were to die for. Only thing that wasn't so good was the salad which looked a little pitiful in its presentation and the lettuce was wilted. For entrees we had the burger and their speciality crispy duck confit waffles. The burger was especially good. The meat had good flavor. The crispy duck was very good but slightly overcooked and the waffle it came with was perfectly cooked. If visiting for the day at Brooklyn Bridge park this is a nice first stop.,Good things:Nice area. We were seated super fast and service was on point. Not so good things:The food was just OK. Thought it was expensive for the quality/quantity of the food. Small portions even the ones listed as 'large' but it's prime location. Still happy that we tried this place and will probably go back next time we visit NY.,"Probably one of the nicest outdoor patios with an amazing view of the Brooklyn Bridge.Eclectic menu - mostly seafood and sushi, but my friend and I shared the bone marrow appetizer, which was good with the exception that it didn't have a whole lot of bone marrow, but they made up for it by piling it high with beef cheek! Tasty! We also shared the bacon wrapped dates which were good. The duck fried rice was amazing and delicious. Drinks were so-so. I didn't like my strawberry cocktail, it was way too tart, I couldn't drink it. Service was friendly. We moved tables because the first table was wobbly and the waitress in that section was in a bad mood and not welcoming or friendly. Our new waiter at the new table was friendly and nice.","Went here for brunch on a beautiful LDW Sunday. This restaurant is tucked in a quaint area of Brooklyn between the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges, on walkway which brought me back to Europe. Although much of the view is obstructed by trees, the Sugarcane outdoor seating area provides a nice setting for a summer meal.We both had the signature brunch, which comes with a duo of dips (white bean and sweet ricotta), crunchy market salad, crispy artichokes and summer corn. The big winner of the starters was the ricotta dip, which was ever so creamy, yet light with the perfect dose of sweetness.The signature brunch also came with the choice of nine entrees, but I didn't have to look far down the list to find the duck & waffle. Although the duck egg was slightly overcooked and I would have preferred a bit more crisp on the duck leg, the dish had a fantastic balance of flavors and is worthy of a recommendation.My date, on the other hand, ordered the classic double burger. Despite the fact that she enjoyed it, I took a bite and was very disappointed. I know it's not exactly fair to judge a dish based on a single bite, but that bite reminded me of nothing more than a fast food burger. The takeaway here is not to order a burger at brunch.Overall, I was impressed with the value of the $29 signature brunch combined with the beautiful scenery. Although I hesitate to venture into Brooklyn for anything besides Luger's, I had an enjoyable experience at Sugarcane.",Sugarcane Raw Bar Grill
310,"SUPER affordable dumplings, very similar to Vanessa's (minus the sesame bread)! No frills, few seats.$2 for 6 dumplings (pork or chicken) and a little extra for the veggie. The dumplings are pan fried, and skin is thiccc. Be careful when biting into it because they're super hot !They also have an assortment of noodles (dry or with soup), rice dishes, and Chinese bun/burgers similar to Xian famous foods.Their 'spicy' is the MALA type, so if you get the cold sesame noodles spicy, be prepared for tongue numbing. I'd rather get that dish non-spicy to preserve its refreshing quality.Come here for cheap eats, but they're not the best dumplings you'll ever eat. I prefer mine steamed or boiled.But I definitely want to try their beef noodle soup.","Dumplings were good. I would go back again for their chicken dumplings. Price is well below the usually, which is awesome. I also had their beef noodles which wasn't the best. The noodles felt stringy and it felt as though A flavor was missing. I didn't end up finishing the noodles. The restaurant has a small homey vibe to it. Overall, a decent place.",Noodles or Noodies or whatever its name is not so good here.  Some other dishes I tasted are good in taste but high in prices,I've been harping about this place way too much but I just can't resist a good deal! This tiny little shop is slowly becoming my go to in Downtown BK. All their noodle and rice dishes are under $10 and they are so worth it. The beef noodle soup ($7) is packed with thick tender pieces of beef. We also got their zajiang noodle special with pork ($9) and it was equally delicious (mix well because it can be very salty).⁣⁣They have 6 dumplings for $3 as well as soup and egg rolls. I didn't personally enjoy those as much so recommend sticking to the mains!,"Dirt cheap dumplings and noodles off the beaten path of downtown Brooklyn. We were due to see a comedy show at Eastville and decided to come by Xifu for a bite. We ordered 2 orders of dumplings (chicken and pork that came 6 pieces per order) and a beef noodle soup. The total of everything came out to $13! Steal of a deal. The dumplings were meaty and well flavored. Leave it up to a true chinese hole in the wall joint to provide watered down sirarcha, soy sauce and vinegar at the table. Classic.I also asked the man behind the counter if they allowed us to bring alcohol and he said it was fine so we dropped by the wine shop down the block to pick up a bottle of wine! I mean, Xifu doesn't have quite the type of atmosphere where people are enjoying wine, but I definitely appreciate the option to.I'd like to believe that the sauvignon blanc brought out the flavors of the dumpling meat.","Chinese food that taste's just like my mom would make; homey, carby and doused in premade sauces from the Asian grocery store. This cheap, hole in the wall Chinese food spot makes fresh noodles and dumplings, and even offers vegetarian options! None of the food is particularly impressive flavorwise and I could easily replicate it at home, but at the price point why not just get some take out? I had the cold sesame noodles and the veggie dumplings. The skin to filling ratio was far too carb heavy for my taste and the dumpling itself was falling apart. Good vegetarian dumplings are a difficult thing to accomplish so I'd say they were only average if not slightly below average. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of fresh noodles in the cold sesame noodles dish. While the sauce wasn't well mixed (first bite was all sesame paste, last bite was all vinegar), it was tasty and hit that high sodium spot I crave when I want take out (because let's all admit there's no hope avoiding sodium in take out foods). There's little doubt that I will return to Xifu foods. While this kinda dinky, unassuming restaurant has a few tables the move is definitely to get take out. Xifu foods is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Fast, cheap, and hits the spot the way a local Chinese takeout restaurant should.",Xifu Food
311,"One of my favorite spots before a broadway show. It's about an 8 minute power walk from most theatres-located 2 blocks from Bryant Park. There is a good young professional crowd that comes here after work too. My staples are their flatbreads and Brussels sprouts.Fun fact, there are outlets underneath the bar so if you are running low on your cell phone's battery you can plug in here. The bar is connected to a hotel. All in all great drinks, standard American bar food & killer cocktail list.","Parker and Quinn provides a nice brunch experience. A pleasant ambience provides solid baseline for a Sunday funday. We were satisfied with our food, especially the Eggs in hell and the Shrimp tartine. The crab cakes Benny was actually somewhat disappointing, as the spinach didn't seem to fit the rest of the dish (are you just topping eggs Florentine with crab cakes?). The Kir royale was quite enjoyable, which made up for the disappointing other brunch beverages they offered.","Stopped by for a quick lunch. Had specific instructions from a friend to try the quinoa veggie burger (with chipotle aioli, feta yogurt, and pickles). Got that with a side of arugula salad. Also tried the regular burger (served in brioche bun with sour pickle; requested the goat cheese ; and added avocado) with a side of fries. The sad slim slices of avocado for $4 were a ripoff Typically I do not like brioche but the burgers overall were good/standard. Salad was basic; fries were perfectly salted although rather limp (I generally like double or thrice fried fries). No major complaints however also no lasting impression. If you're in the area and need a bite, this would do. Or just walk a little more to find other, albeit limited, interesting eats. I would even dare to just stop by Whole Foods for grub.","I have been here few times.  I brought my friends here for the birthday past Thursday.  First, I was a bit frustrated that they didn't find my reservation.  I said oh no, it's for my friend's birthday.  The hostess kept apologizing for it and tried her best to get us a table ASAP.  It was packed.  I guess we just needed to wait, so we went to the bar to order drinks, we didn't even order then the manage came over to have a table ready for us.  It was great and I really appreciated their fast and friendly service.  So I gave a star for it! We sat down and an appetizer coming to our table, I thought it's a mistake but it's for us on house, wow, good move!  Here is another star. Finally we ordered food and drinks, food came a bit slow but it's understanding because they were very busy.  At least we got an appetizer to eat with... haha!We ordered octopus appetizer to share, mains: Duck, Scallops, and Salmon, Brussels sprouts for side.  My birthday friend liked all of dishes especially her favorite scallops.  Me and my another friend liked dishes except the duck, it's not bad but could be better.  I personally tried their hanger steak, squid ink pasta (it's off from the menu) both were good when I came here other times.   So their food was pretty good! Desserts: we almost forgot to order desserts for our birthday friend, we were so full.  It's very thoughtful that the restaurant got us a dessert with a candle on it plus other two desserts, desserts on house too!  Also they thanks us again for choosing them.  The service was very impressed.  After we paid the bill, the manager even  walked us to the Jazz lounge in the hotel because we said we wanted to go to the Jazz lounge. So I very appreciated their service and good food for the night.  So I gave 5 stars to them.  I will keep going back as long as they keep up the service and food :).","We found this little restaurant on Yelp during our stay in NYC. Prices seemed reasonable with other restaurants in the area, and our server was very helpful and friendly!While they offer fancier options, my husband got grilled cheese with tomato soup and I got the smallportion of macaroni and cheese. Both of our meals arrived piping hot and were delicious!Reservations were confusing and the hostess was a little odd, but the menu had things for every price range, and service was excellent. The menu isn't large, but I felt like they offered enough.","Parker & Quinn is located in midtown Manhattan. It's a huge restaurant popular for its brunches.1.

The salad was served on the side which was full of greens and cherry tomatoes!3. Caramelized Apple French toast - totally delicious! The moist and soft French toast weren't too eggy. The caramelized flavour of apple with little pieces on the toast made it delicious! A must have here!As a vegetarian, my options were quite limited!",Parker & Quinn
312,"Man, I love this place's food usually but the service here on the weekend was just horrendous. We arrived thinking we'd get 2 or 3 drinks before our night out and have a nice dinner. Waitress sat us down, took our drink orders and took the drinks menu away (we wanted to keep it, but whatever.) My bf ordered chicken and waffles, I ordered vegetarian chicken and waffles. I was careful to check that she had written down that it needed to be vegetarian.30 mins later, our food arrives (a young pre-teen/teenage boy brought it out the kitchen?!), I take one bite and I realize it's not vegetarian. I flag him down and ask, ""Is this vegetarian?"" He looks at me like I'm crazy and goes, ""No, why?"" ""Because I ordered vegetarian."" He sighs, rolls his eyes and takes the plate away. No apology. It takes about 20 mins for them to redo my food, during which my boyfriend's food went cold. We tried multiple times to flag down someone - anyone! - for a drink in that time. We couldn't get anyone to stop. The restaurant was only about half full, with lots of servers - it just seemed like they'd forgotten to properly assign our table or something.Eventually, my food comes out with the correct order. They'd evidently rushed it because it was all undercooked but I'm starving and my boyfriend's food is cold so we eat. Again we try and flag down anyone for a drink - no dice. At the end of the meal, a completely different server again comes and whips the plates away. No ""How was your food?"" or ""Sorry we fed a vegetarian meat"" or ""Let me comp you a couple drinks"". A completely new server brought the check.I don't know what happened here but I just keep thinking, what would have happened if I had had an allergy? Not only was the whole experience really rude, but it was a potential food hazard and nobody seemed to think it was a big deal.","The lack of customer service was so bad tonight, I just walked out. If I could give them no stars, I would.  There was only 5 tables open and 3 of those were waiting on their checks.  I waited 20 minutes and no one came to even offer water.  The manager stood around, on his phone and doing nothing... The manager with the beard is the worst! He has no customer service skills.","This was a place that I've always wanted to try. I had their infamous chicken and waffles and I have to say, I wasn't impressed. The chicken was dry but the waffles were okay. I honestly don't have much to say about this place. I came early enough so the wait wasn't super long and they had a lot of tables and outdoor seating as well. The only problem with outdoor seating was when I was watching a couple battle a bee that kept coming towards their syrup. I think that was the main highlight of my meal.","Delicious! Great service. Went for brunch on a Sunday at noon and didn't have to wait long-- I like how they use the text service to let you know when your table is ready/you can see the queue.Had the chicken and waffles and it was the perfect portion! Waffle was light and fluffy; chicken was cooked perfectly. Loved the berry, lemon, and herbed butters that cake with it-- the lemon was my favorite. Would come back again!","PLEASE BEWARE WHEN USING CREDIT CARDS HERE! Maybe bring cash.  My experience was straight crazy!  It kinda messed up my experience a bit. Just to recap.The spot was perfect!! The set up was cool. The bar was eye catching!  The music was hot!!

And the butters!!! The freaking butters... was amazing. My hubs got the chicken and waffles and was highly satisfied. We came for brunch so the menu wasn't the full menu. However I will definitely be coming back to try the other items. Oh yea the home fries were amazing as well.,Sweet Chick
313,New place and it's going to be the death of me. It's such a convenient location.. I guess that just means more ramen for me!,"ICHIRAN. Famous for being super tasty and notorious for the long lines that follow upon opening. I came on a weekend in February 2019 and was greeted with a line around dinner time at 6 pm. Subsequent visit during the weekday at 7 had no line.Another difference between my two visits is that my second one did not have a free noodle voucher. Food: It is simple, consistent, and what I have come to expect from ICHIRAN since tasting it for the first time in Tokyo. Taste wise it is essentially the same as Japan's version with the exception of the egg. For some reason they have chosen to serve a hard boiled egg and for $2.90 at that! Many people have noted this and I don't think they overcook their eggs on accident. Hard boiled for the US even though their menu says soft boiled. Price is definitely up there with $24 for all add one on what you'd expect for a typical bowl of ramen. Even though it's no tip, that is still on the pricey side. In conclusion, not an everyday bowl but something to treat yourself every now and then. JUST DON'T GET THE EGG. Simply not worth it.",,If you've been to one you've been to them all. Love coming here so that I can literally eat my food in peace. I usually go for the recommended Ramen configuration. Right now they're having a promotion where a free noodle refill is included with your meal so I would definitely take advantage of that as much as possible before it ends.,"TLDR: Best ramen I've ever had!! If you're in New York, you MUST check this place out :) I'd just get their Recommended Set, but it's also fun to customize!Food: 10/10WOW. This ramen left me SPEECHLESS. The noodles had the perfect amount of bite to them and were so fresh! Also as you mix in the Hiden no Tare sauce, the flavors slowly become more complex. Definitely check out the history/the Ichiran way of eating ramen by reading the panel above your eating area. I don't think I'll ever have ramen that beats this!Price & Portion: 8/10It's a little more expensive than other ramen spots in NYC, but it's well worth your time! Personally I think the price is so worth it for the quality and experience.Service: 9/10It's so unique since you eat at your own booth! There's not too much interaction with the staff, but you press a button whenever you need something (ie you're ready to order, want more noodles, etc). The service is super super fast!Ambience: 9/10I love this experience! It's really cool to be able to just enjoy your meal. At Ichiran, the food truly comes first.","Ramen worth coming back for. I came here on a Thursday afternoon roughly at 2 pm with one other person and there was no wait. I have been told there is usually a line but off-peak is clearly Thursdays at 2 pm. Ordering on the menu is fairly straightforward, especially since you can get what they recommend; make it a flat $24 or pick as you wish. I followed their general outline (which is denoted on the menu with a circle of dashes) except I got it slightly spicier and with a hard-boiled egg. I was glad I did it except I am not sure an egg is worth $3. You could get a dozen of organic eggs for that price. If I were to come back, I would likely not get the egg. I am not a ramen expert but I have partaken in at least 50 bowls of ramen in my life and two things about this one stand out to me: the broth and the noodles. The broth had a sweet flavor to it that made it so easy to drink. They say it is expertly made, and while I typically never believe restaurants, they could be telling the truth; it was that good. The noodles, on the other hand, were just so soft and thin. It was a great deviation from the typical noodles I am accustomed to in ramen. I am used to thicker noodles that I need to bite hard on to cut, while these were eaten with ease. The part I thought was the worst was easily the pork. Just blah and not worth it. My friend also got the Matcha beer which is not worth the price (nearly $9) but it is good. Experience of the booth: For a group of two, it was fine. Service was fast, got our own waters and we were out within 30 minutes. If the group were any more than two, you would have to be looking back and forth constantly. It would be impossible to hold a conversation and I would never bring more than a single person. Overall: An above-average broth and noodles with a booth experience not for everyone.",ICHIRAN Midtown
314,"Went here on Saturday night,,When I saw the menu. Oemji! Pricey yess.Burn the money beybehhhI knew the menu is expensive seeing the cocktail was around 16 bucks.Small plate costs 18, entree can cost up to $39.My cocktail, the one with peach soju, was small, just OK. Omg. Not worth the money!! No no.So did the $19 scallop.Dang man, that place is not even fine dining.If you're the real rich new yorkers who doesnt care about price, disregard this post. But if you are a smart patron who want to spend bucks for what it worth, walk another 2 blocks, and you'll get to Japanese village with more reasonable price, everything half price and more filling.","Okay. The pork buns. They were good, but honestly just not $5 apiece good. I had pork buns at Cooper Craft & Kitchen just a little before this and I thought they were comparable, if not better. I think pork fat does make everything better.Also, their ham chips are a lie. Let me raise a parallel example for you: when you order potato chips, you expect your chips to be made out of potato, do you not? When you order pickle chips, you expect your chips to be made out of pickle, do you not?You do not expect your potato chips or pickle chips to merely be FLAVORED like potato or pickle. This was the exact issue we faced with the ""ham"" chips. These ""ham"" chips were essentially ham-flavored krupuk, or deep fried crackers. I think ham chips is seriously misleading. When I see ham chips I think little slivers of crisply fried ham, not a fried cracker that's vaguely reminiscent of ham. Just really, misleading menu wording is disappointing.","One of my friend recommend this place. We went here for lunch. We ordered iceberg wedge, pork and mushroom bums, pork roll, catfish sandwich, duck ssam, okonomiyaki, and pork sausage & rice cakes.Ice berg 4 great source  Catfish 3 too much cookedDuck ssam 4 um good!!Okonomiyaki 3 no idea. Japanese' okonomiyaki is better. Pork bun 4 juicy porkMushroom bun 3 no tastePork sausage & rice cakes 3 very saltyService(1) is horrible because we saw another table for service. They explained every dishes to customers. But, no explain to us. It was okay for foods. We will try another momofuku place next time.","Food was very delicious. We had the Ssam dinner, which I believe is meant for 10 people. We were a group of 8, so we had some left overs. Those of us who had cocktails enjoyed them very much. I had the seven spice sour and my cousins had the glitter punk and old fashioned.There was some misunderstanding regarding ordering a la carte vs ssam dinner and prefix menu. We made reservations wanting to order a la carte, but it wasn't very clear that the a la carte option is not available for a group of 6+. Regardless, it was cleared up with the manager and the food turned out great. They were very generous and gave us some additional appetizers to nibble on while waiting.Management was very patient in explaining the menu and the costs. The wait staff however, not so great. We requested a few times to increase the temp of the AC that was blowing directly at us, nothing happen and there was no explanation that they could not touch it. This was particularly annoying because it was raining and we walked in wet. Water was scarce and it was hard to get their attention, considering there were only 3 groups in the back dining area.The restaurant had a good ambiance, but the acoustics was not conducive to conversations.Overall, I still give it four stars, the quality of the food and drink outweighed the annoyance with the wait staff. We will return to try the a la carte menu.","Came by just before lunch closing on a Friday afternoon and had the place to ourselves with Jake, the bartender, and longtime employee who used to be at Ma Peche, one of David Chang's other restaurants.We had already had a huge breakfast and had plans for a huge dinner so we sat at the bar, had a few drinks and picked a few dishes.  We shared the pork belly buns of course, the summer corn, and the duck.That was enough.  The pork belly was amazing, but the corn took it to another level with the sauce.  Oh man were our mouths tingling!!  Then came the duck! Oh man!  I love duck but have to say it was not just the duck!  It was the white rice.......the duck fat soaked rice!  I'm telling you it was like crack! (Mind you I've never done drugs in my life).  There is no way I will pass on this dish when I return.","Worth the hype! Make reservations online to save time! Their popular items like the rice cakes and pork buns aren't on the menu, the servers will usually tell you about them verbally. Originally had made a reservation around 9:15, but got there between 8:30 and 8:45 and asked if we could be seated early. We waited a couple minutes and they were able to seat us. There were just two of us but we wanted to try more things so we ended up sharing the sizzling flat iron, pork buns, and rice cakes. The pork buns were absolutely delicious. The meat was tender and the buns were steamed to perfection. The cucumber included a nice mix in the textures. The rice cakes, while super tasty, were a tad too spicy for me. When I ate the first piece it was okay, but as I had more and more the spiciness got more and more unbearable. Needless to say, I downed hella water. The sizzling flatiron was one of two of the large plates that got my attention. The meat was nice and pink and got just a teensy bit lighter as it got a little more heat from the plate. The creamy sauce and enoki mushrooms were such a great combo with the meat. I will say, I don't know if you're supposed to eat those leaves on top, but they weren't very good. I'd recommend all three of the items that we ordered!",Momofuku Ssam Bar
315,"Veggie burger and cocktails were beyond delicious. Ambiance and service were second to none. Gorgeous place, wonderful food, 10/10 would recommend.","Esme used to be a solid neighborhood spot but it's gone downhill over the last year. The ambiance and staff are still as lovely as usual (hence the two stars) but the food is subpar. Dinner is simply ok. Brunch is downright disappointing.1. The avocado toast is barely edible. The bread is cut way too thick, lacks flavor, and is barely toasted. The avocado is overly processed, tastes stale, and is no better then the guacamole served as a side at Chipotle. The worst part of it is that they give you two oversized pieces of bread but only one poached egg.... the thought process behind that is just beyond me. Just give one piece of toast if you want to cheap out on eggs. 2. They use the hot water tap on an espresso machine for tea. This is a major no-no. The water in the machine is boiled over and over again and becomes incredibly chalky and tastes terrible. In addition, the temp is way to high for tea and burns it. Not what you would expect when you are paying $4 a cup.3. The quality of the rest of the food has gone down as well. The beignets have lost their fluffiness, the blueberries taste frozen, the espresso was terrible, etc etc. 4. The food took 30mins to come out.The place seems to be suffering from the consequences of bad judgement and general ambivalence by the management. Do better for yourself and the poor staff. Do better for our neighborhood.",This place didn't live up to the hype for me. Everything was really fattening and the cocktail was lackluster. Had the burger it was just ok.,"What a great place. Me and my work place come here almost every three weeks at the same time. And they're always ready for us. The waiter was so polite, tall gentleman with long black hair. He was funny and interactive. He sat us outside on a gorgeous day. The beer is great, the atmosphere convinced you to be off your phone and actually care about the person you're eating with. And the chicken sandwich... oh the chicken sandwich. It was so delicious. I'm pretty sure it's popular because he told me they sold out of it that day. Which doesn't surprise me and didn't disappoint anyone knowing how good it is. Rate this place 5 stars for sure!","Really liked this brunch spot! $32/person for a party of 5 with 4/5 of us getting a cocktail (the fifth getting a latte) and an order of table pancakes, in addition to our own entrees. Adorable garden, although the interior of the restaurant is also nice. The avocado toast was large and delicious, as was the side salad it came with. I also appreciated the fact it already comes with a poached egg, instead of having to pay extra for it!The blueberry pancakes we got for the table were DELICIOUS, and I am not normally a sweet brunch eater, and will only have a bite or two. I didn't want to stop eating. Would absolutely get these on the table. Only gripe was that the Bloody Mary wasn't great, I honestly wish I had skipped it. Seemed watered down and lacked the punchy flavor I look for when I order one. All in all, though, I would absolutely recommend Esme for a brunch in Greenpoint!","Came for the blueberry pancakes and will return for the fried chicken sandwich! Esme is super cute and reasonably priced. I came for brunch, so can only speak to that, but the menu was stocked with great options. The pancakes were everything I was promised - thin, slightly crispy on the edges, and beautifully buttery. We also grabbed an order of the fried chicken sandwich and it was wildly good; they add bacon (genius) and an especially delicious sauce. I opted for the brunch punch - it was sweet and had a nice kick. The Bloody Mary was typical Brooklyn style with a little too much horseradish. My only complaint was the service. While I know brunch on a Saturday gets nutty, we waited about 25 minutes for our drinks after we ordered them. I'll be back as I'm sure it was just a busy brunch morning!",Esme

After she asked my nationality and told that all Ukrainians are stupid as Americans . WHAT? She continued here monologue for 15 min and after she was laughing as a pschyco","I had heard incredible things about Gaia so I was extremely excited when I was able to get a reservation for a group of couples that my husband and I were hosting from out of town. Much to my surprise, I received a text message the day before the reservation telling me that the restaurant had overbooked and they would have to cancel my reservation but 'come back for a free dessert another time'. I was upset because it is impossible to find a Friday night dinner reservation for 6 in the city on Thursday afternoon. When I called, I asked the owner if there was anyone else they could move to another time because I had guests from out of town and I was worried I wouldn't be able to find a another reservation so last minute. She quickly got defensive and said that it was not possible so i responded telling her how I thought this was unprofessional and poor customer service. Any other restaurant owner/manager would be empathetic with the patron and apologize and perhaps offer a dinner on the house and ask for my availability to take her up on that offer the next week. If that were the case, I would have appreciated the apology and offer and I would have found another time to visit the restaurant - mistakes happen sometimes and I am an understanding person. Instead, this manager/owner proceeded to use age discrimination saying that I was a young girl and I needed to learn how to communicate. I was completely caught off guard but it didn't end there. This woman proceeded to chew me out saying that I was wrong for saying that what they did was bad customer service and that I am 'in the wrong place because the Eastern European show love and peace'. If I had perhaps yelled at this woman or cussed her out maybe i could understand that she would behave this way but I simply stated the fact that cancelling on a patron because the restaurant overbooked and not showing any empathy whatsoever is completely unprofessional and is, in fact, poor customer service. Safe to say, I will not be going back to this restaurant - there are plenty of other incredible Italian places in the city that treat their patrons with respect.","Cheapest/highest quality Italian food you can find. Homemade bread, BYOB, fresh pasta all at low prices. It's a first come first serve kind of place so not the restaurant to go for a long dinner date. I recommend it for a causal lunch or quick dinner.","This restaurant has their rules and information so be sure to either read online in advance or be a respectful guest when you visit. Gaia takes the food and the experience you will have very seriously. If you want to here you must show up as a full party all together and wait to be seated. At this point it may sound strict but they're all really just rules that call for you to be respectful and for you to come as a community and share you food together enjoying a table and filling your stomachs with good food and good company.As a person who likes to try new restaurants if I were to ever eat out, this place is of the select few that I would go over and over again! The quality of the food and atmosphere almost feels like I've walked into an Italian grandmother's home and was served with a sauce that has been cooked with care and thought out flavor balances. Our favorite starter is always the octopus salad. Has lots of octopus pieces and just enough dressing that's not too dry but also not sopping wet. The mozzarella was very smooth. Each pasta dish was served one by one which helped us pace and not rush the meal. Each time I've come I was able to try different pasta dishes and every single thing on their menu tastes like home!","Update: The response to the owner I sent just now via message.  Please read the other negative reviews...there is a persistent issue and what I wrote about is not isolated.  TLDR: the food is great, the service can at times make you feel like you're being bitchslapped.  Hi Gaia,I understand where you are coming from with your response.  Yes I do want to be treated well when I go eat out, not especially nice, but gently and kindly, which you did treat me in the few times I've come to your restaurant before.  Writing a review in a public forum is an effective way to have my opinion heard by the public and by the owner, so that something can change.  I feel it's important that good and bad service be told, and I did only have one baby octopus in my dish.  I know running a business is difficult, and dealing with people is difficult too, but we all have a right to voice our opinions without being personally attacked.  I have nothing personal against you and I hope you can coach your staff to be a bit more gentler with your customers.While I was there, there was a group of people and she and maybe you argued publicly about whether they can sit down before ordering.  It just really seemed like unnecessary drama.I think maybe what you want is for me to never have posted my review, because my review hurts your rating, but if this situation were reversed, would you want to be silenced as well?----original post-----Gaia, I've sought you out over the years for authentic Italian cooking in a great, hideaway spot.  You felt like a great kept secret, and Gaia, you yourself were cool.  I remember when you gave me extra cookies because you liked my parents and me that one rainy afternoon about a year ago.I know you yourself are straight-forward, sometimes acerbic in your approach, and I never minded that, but alas, who is that new woman with glasses behind the counter who was so mean to me yesterday? She ruined my experience.I brought a friend and sought you out because I like you so much, and when I got up to get dessert, I asked for 3 cookies, and without looking at me, and roughly, she said, ""they're $0.50 a piece, so do you want 4?"" I didn't, but I obliged to be nice (Yeah I'm working on that ""saying no"" shit).  And I added a nutella puff, which turned out....aiiight.Then without prompting, the same woman started tallying up my lunch and dessert order.  Apparently my friend did not pay when he ordered for us, which is fine.  But now I was in a quandary because my friend had wanted to treat me, and I wanted to treat the dessert.  The woman behind the counter was impatient and visibly exasperated because I hesitated on what to do.  I asked to just pay for the dessert and she didn't seem to want to let me.  I had no idea why...it was bewildering.  I ended up treating my friend by paying for everything, and I tipped 15%....and I was happy to do so, but I didn't like the treatment I received by this new lady behind the counter.  Gaia herself was very absentminded and not making eye contact...I dunno, this put a pretty big damper on my experience here.  Not sure I'd want to come back to be treated like this for a nice outing.Oh, and the food itself? The pasta with baby octopus special I had was pretty good, as the food is always pretty good and fresh here.  BUT: there was one single baby octopus in my entire dish....so.............what's really good, Gaia?Addition! I forgot to mention that I'm pretty sure I've used the bathroom before at Gaia, but this time when I asked nicely if I can use the restroom, the same woman who was rude to me flat out told me there wasn't one.","I've been here three times now with my friends. It's located in the front of an apt building but at a sub-ground level so I have walked by it many times in my neighborhood and only went when my friend's found out about the place.The menu is simple and there are daily specials. I feel like the food is simple in a good way. You can tell the owner really cares about the place as if it's her own home kitchen. Some ingredients and meals have a limited amount and once it's done, its off the menu for the day. My group ordered all four special dishes of the day (an octopus salad, an eggplant lasagna, a shrimp pasta, and another lasagna dish) along with some appetizers.One thing to note as other reviewers have also stated, there are strict rules regarding reservations and as the owner treats it like having you over to her home kitchen/dining room, she is also particular about the chairs and table placements. I came a bit late for my party's reservation of 5 people so Gaia seated them as 4. I pulled another chair over from an empty 2 seat table and my friends were kind of concerned about being scolded by Gaia. I forgot about the strictness so I was confused. Luckily Gaia was busy cooking the whole time we were there but we were all definitely keeping an eye out on if she would come over and say something about our setup.",Gaia Italian Café
317,"The green sauce was too chunky. I ordered rotisserie chicken breast and dark meat was substituted without asking me because they ran out of white meat. The green sauce was the right amount of spicy but lacked flavor and had the wrong texture. The one-quarter chicken was too salty and the portion was tiny.  You would need two pieces to equal a traditional quarter piece.The sangaria was very weak and lacked body. It was like drinking a virgin sangaria.If you want good Peruvian rotisserie chicken, Pio Pio is the place to go. The sangaria at Pio will get you buzzed after three sips.Warning  Pio chicken can occasionally cause massive thirst within two hours of eating.","My great-grandfather came to Cebu on a boat from Peru. Yes, I am a poet and I know it. My titos told me he was a pirate; I've got pictures of him raising fighting cocks and playing jai alai. Yes, you should google that. WTF does that have to do with this joint? Nothing, bro. It's called filler. Super casual spot. TV on- playing Football, aka soccer, probs a South American team or...wait for it...the Peru national team in some kind of tournament where every attack sends the room into a frenzy. You know it's legit when the cooks come running out from the kitchen after a goal is scored and celebrate with the fanatics in the dining room. Speaking of cooking...That Jalea- fire. And those onions are soooo necessary. The Lomo Saltado is loco el good'oh. I'm drooling thinking about that beef and that sauce... son, do yourself a solid and hop on that train to flavor town. The paella isn't bad. $17 for 1 is decent. You'll be full. #goals Don't skip the maduros. Ever. As in life, not just here. I don't order roast chicken (or pad thai) when I eat out, because I'm not a basic batch. That said- the roast chicken looked decent as it past by on the way to the basics sitting next to us. Do Skip the HH sangria and go straight to the pitcher of sangria. You're only fooling yourself if you think you're maxing out at two, bro. It's summer. You got time and they don't rush you here, think island time. Fuck it, that's why you got Uber and activated charcoal waiting inside your medicine cabinet.","I was really bummed with my experience here. I probably just ordered wrong, but I just wanted a bite to eat and I'm a vegetarian​, so there wasn't​ much I could have ordered anyway.I popped in and got the Papas Huancaina (which I normally love), but I was extremely unimpressed with the ones at Rikos... It was literally 3 slices of completely bland potatoes, an overcooked​ boiled egg and barely enough sauce to coat them... FOR $10!The service was okay, not bad but nothing impressive, and the prices were on the high side.Don't think I'll be returning here in the future.","I definitely recommend giving this place a try! What may seem like a normal Peruvian chicken restaurant actually has a great seafood selection. You're started off with some fried(?) corn with some classic Peruvian sauces- I really enjoyed this as a salty snack that tastes like a combination between a nut and a corn chip. You can also use the check in deal to get a $4 sangria! I got the white fish ceviche and the quarter chicken. The chicken was good, pretty standard Peruvian chicken- you can choose between breast or leg. What really stood out and makes this 5 stars is the ceviche. You can get it spicy and it has a good amount of spice and a perfect level of tangy flavor. You get a ton of fish, honestly I was pretty full just after the ceviche and didn't need the chicken as well. The sourness of the ceviche is well balanced with the corn and especially the sweet potato. It'd be a great shared plate between two people.","My niece came in from Brooklyn and met with us in Manhattan. She told us about this restaurant. We walked over (it was just a few minutes from the hotel). We walked in and it was pretty full but we were able to be seated quickly and order our food pretty rapidly as well. First off, we started with our Pisco sour followed by fried fish with shrimp on top. White rice and beans. Yum!! 2nd dish Picada La Mena,which entailedAnticuchos, Papa Huancaina, y Choclo Peruano con Queso and Grilled Beef Hearts , which were tasty and tender. The papas a la Huancaina delicious and the hominy were all perfect. It was just perfect. We tasted each other's food and  all was perfecto.  Our waitress, a true sweetie with a great personality. OMG, I'm blanking on her name - Valencia?  Anyway, she brought over a small courtesy drink (Margarita) to say thank you and it was welcomed. Try it out for yourself and I'm sure you'll agree. Bon appetite!Flavorful food Clean environment Friendly atmosphereGreat service","Amazing! Every dish. The green mussels appetizer, which is very much like a cerviche ! Paella Valenciana! Tres Leches for desert. I cant say enough. Genuine Peruvian and delicious. Go and enjoy!!",Riko Peruvian Cuisine
318,"Kogane is a solid ramen spot.  It's not the best ramen in the city, but it's the best ramen in the surrounding 5-6 neighborhoods and one of my go-to spots when I have visitors and they become sick of pizza.The curry ramen and spicy miso are household favorites, but I've never had anything bad here.It's usually possible to walk right in, though weekend nights there can be a short wait.","Overall the food was really good, just was disappointed that the card machine wasn't working, and we literally had to walk down to court street in the rain to get cash from the bank. Literally this is the first time this has ever happened  to me while out to eat.Overall the food was decent.",Tried the red tonkotsu ramen ($13) and seaweed salad ($6). The ramen still leaves much to be desired :(,Delicious pork gyoza and tonkatsu ramen. The ramen burger was amazing! Crunchy and totally different than I expected (in a good way!)Inside was nice and cozy and staff was friendly! We will definitely come back here!,I have been here a few times since I live close by. This visit I had the spicy tonkotsu ramen and my boyfriend had the regular tonkotsu ramen. They didnt skimp on the pork. The broth was rich and flavorful.The staff is very friendly and attentive. There is a patio out front if the weather is nice. It even started to sprinkle while we were sitting and the staff immediately covered us with an umbrella.Solid option for ramen in Brooklyn.,This is the first restaurant in Kogane restaurant franchise. I had the red ton... ramen. The chachu pork was nice. 3 pieces of 1 cm cut. The broth was thick and really good. This is certainly one of the best ramen place in town at this price range. Now I'm too full to do rock climbing. Better find somewhere to take a nap.Will be back for more.,Kogane Ramen
319,It's solid but not amazing. Best things hummus falafel and mushroom onion Isreali salad Greek salad. Worse things saving and shackshouka. It's more of a 3.5 but the inconsistency lead to 3 stars,"So it's true I guess. You can never really go back. The waiter that was so nice no longer works there. Current waitress forgot almost everything we asked for (and worse, did not seem to care). Food was still good but not as great as remembered (except for the phenomenal bread). Maybe they should just sell the bread? Maybe she can remember that?",I had food delivered at home on Saturday and got food poisoned. I am very disappointed and have been sick for 48 hours. It's crazy to be so sick by only ordering cocked food. Don't ever GO there!!! There is many better Israeli restaurants in Soho! This restaurant is disgusting.,"Super cozy and delightful!  I was fortunate enough to beat the crowd and snag a seat at the little bar space and had great service. Went with the mini lamb kebabs, some babaganoush, and falafel. The babaganoush came with the absolute most amazing pitas I have ever had. They were like pita clouds! So soft and fresh, and they have ruined regular pitas for me now as these were just too good! And their tahini sauce too. The babaganoush was super smooth. The mini lamb kebabs were more like lamb meat balls, and had a perfect blend of spices and great flavor.  Really lovely place!","Terrific food! Came here for the first time on Thursday at lunch time and loved the food. The menu is great and varied with typical Middle Eastern/ Israeli dishes.Everything from the presentation to the flavors of each dish were second to none. The service is friendly and cool.Appetizers we got the hummus with mushrooms and caramelizei onions ( simply amazing) and falafel. Main entree I got shakshuka and my friend went for the liver with onions. Everything was just DELICIOUS! Loved this restaurant and will be coming back many, many times!!!",My daughter recommended 12 chairs so we planned a night out. It's on a nice street in the village that if you arrive early you should take a stroll towards NYU/north. The hummus was delicious and the pita was large and soft/fresh. Probably the best pita and hummus we had for awhile. They serve wine and beer. The waitresses spoke Hebrew to my Israeli husband which was a nice value add/he felt like he was home.Nice place to go with another couple-- small so I would not suggest a large group but perfect for 4. They need to have a better online reservation-- either through yelp or open table. The app they use wasn't listed on their website and they could do more business possibly with a moreMainstream reservation process.  The waitresses recommendations were good and everyone was happy with their dinners.  Definitely a place to try and if you like middle eastern Israeli food wirh friendly service this place is perfect!,12 Chairs
320,"So many amazing food options so little room in my stomach. I found this place that did ice cream sandwiches with churros as the bun and another place that did Hennessey infused mini donuts. Cell reception isn't great down there, but who cares when there's so much great food around!","3.5. It's pretty much a big food court.   There were many vendors.  Once you go in, take the escalator downstairs and that's where the food hall is.  There is food from all over the place.  There's also beer in the food hall.","Ordered a Briskets sandwich for quick-bite. [Smoky & Tender] just what you needed on a hot summer day.Lovee- the seasoning on their Waffles fries, well it could be 10/10 if their fries wasnt that soggy soft. Maybe it was my preference that fries must be firm and hard.Overall [9/10]","If you ever find yourself in Brooklyn anywhere near the Dekalb Market Hall, by all means... stop by. There are so many options, even if you are not hungry, you can enjoy a good brew, juice, dessert or some good grub.We have had the opportunity to stop here several times for a meal, and have yet to be disappointed. Seating space can be at a premium doing busy times, but don't be deterred as you should be able to find a spot soon enough.I like the variety and diversity of foods here, we are really fortunate to have places like that this where we can try out new culinary concoctions or fall back on the old familiar ones, either way... you win.","Came here at 9 and 3/4 of the hall was closed before the advertised 10PM time. I do like the mix of vendors and it's a great place to grab food with an indecisive crowd. Depending on where you choose you can have a reasonably-priced meal or pay as much as a sit-down(better quality) restaurant. My favorites are the pierogi dudes, the crepe place by the escalator, and the churros by the Ample Hills. Han Dynasty is always a winner if we have time.   This place would be a better asset to the neighborhood if they could keep things open later, or at least make it all consistent. Frustrating to trek all the way over for dinner after work for half of the vendors to be shrugging their shoulders and washing up.","In Southern CA we have Grand Central Market in DTLA as the foodie Mecca. This is the Brooklyn version of Grand Central Market as it a big food hall with a unimaginable list of food  choices to choose from. You can get anything from Columbian Arepas to Vietnamese Banh Mi to unique dessert choices. To be sure, if you're not satisfied after grabbing food from any one of the vendors here, you can stop by Trader Joe's and grab groceries for dinner here as well. It's hot in there as it is underground, inundated with a mass amount of folks (who are emitting body heat) and the vendors have hot kitchens. The Women's restroom needed a little bit of work. There was toilet paper on the floor; some stalls lacked seat protectors; some soap dispensers lacked hand soap. If you're simply not sure what to eat in Brooklyn, check this place out, I promise you'll find something you'll like.",Dekalb Market Hall
321,"I came here for a company dinner and there were flies everywhere. Throughout the whole breakfast there were about four flies all over us, flying into our food and onto us. It almost seemed unreal and was quite disturbing . Which sucks because this is a beautiful place, with a DOPE bathroom. The staff is friendly and the food is very good and filling. However of that doesn't matter if there's flies everywhere interrupting your meal.","One of the brunch dishes we ordered had a worm crawling in it. We called the waiter over and sent the dish back and cancelled the order for the dish because we felt a bit finicky post incident. We were shaken by the incident but proceeded to not make a big deal about it. I was hoping that the restaurant would make some reparations for the incident and provide a discount of some sort (or a totally free meal) but to my dismay, no such thing happened. I have sneaky feeling that the treatment and service for such an incident would have been handled differently for more Caucasian patrons of this establishment. This review has nothing to do with the food itself, which I find to be quite delicious. I've been here here in three separate occasions  however, I'm disappointed by the level of service offered and how the situation was handled and will not be returning back as a result.",Recommendation:1: Soya Marinated Tuna Tostada2:Tlayuda OxomocoThe tuna really made my day!,"We have eaten at Oxomoco many times but I only just now took photos to give readers a glimpse of the amazing food here. The restaurant has a nice outdoor seating area and a well-decorated interior as well which gives off a very ""hip"" vibe upon entry. The staff is accommodating and friendly which helps tie everything together. We've eaten dinner here before (which was great as well) but I find the Oxomoco brunch experience to be the most enjoyable. Drink wise, you really can't go wrong but we really love the Spicy Mango margarita (don't worry, it's pretty mild) and the Smoked Strawberry. Appetizer wise, we enjoy the guacamole (which comes with large tortilla chips) but recently discovered the Chorizo Tlayuda which has a tortilla base topped with cheese, beans, salsa, and chorizo. Believe it or not, the tlayuda was not as heavy as you'd expect but very delicious. Lastly, we tend to order the Hamburguesa Pambazo, Bacon Burrito, or the Concha Especial. Between the three, the Hamburguesa Pambazo and Concha Especial are the best tasting and most unique in terms of flavor and presentation. The Hamburguesa Pambazo has a salsa macha that adds a nice flavor to the already juicy burger while the Concha Especial creates a wonderful sweet and savory taste by combining the pan dulce (Mexican sweet bread) with chorizo verde. Overall, I highly recommend everyone to grab brunch here ASAP and get a taste of the Oxomoco experience. Oxomoco consistently offers great food, drink, and service. We look forward to coming back again soon!","My boyfriend is obsessed with Bobby Flay so we were watching the Flay List and this restaraunt was in it. Bobby Flay's daughter recommended it. I come to Greenpoint all the time and walk past this place but never went so we thought to try it.We knew it was going to be expensive so was prepared for that. But we were really disappointed in the food quality for the price. You get two small tacos for $17. In the chicken taco the flavor was good, but I had a huge bone in mine! Good I didn't chomp down or would have lost a tooth. The steak one was very chewy. Also wasn't crazy about the tortilla used, it was too starchy tasting. And The horchata agua fresca was mostly ice. We ordered two desserts. The flan and the chocolate cake. The chocolate cake was definitely better than the flan. The cake was dense and rich, i liked the crunchies on top which added a nice texture with the creamy coffee ice cream. The flan dish was a mess though. It was a rectangle of gelatin. Totally the wrong texture, and it was swimming in a blueberry sauce. That blueberry sauce did not go with the flan or compliment it in anyway. There was supposed to be lemon on it and I tasted no lemon. I just tasted overwellming blueberry jam with gelatin. The corn crisps on the top added a crisp respite to the gelatinous dish but did not compliment it in flavor. The best thing we tried was the $4 smoked mango. My boyfriend loves smokey, spicy things and dried fruit so this was right up his alley. The mango had a nice chewy juicy texture to it and the spices were a nice combo. A bit too spicy for me but he really liked it. Also the bathrooms have disco balls in them. A very wierd experience. Not a fan. So we paid $100 for an icey drink, some dried fruit, bones in tacos, chewy steak and gelatinous dessert. We are okay with spending $40 on tacos but they better be the most amazing tacos we ever had. And they were very far from it. Skip this place and go to los tacos no. 1. Which is my favorite taco place and also coincidently Bobby Flay's pick on the show.","This is an excellent brunch spot for those who are a little bored of average brunch. I ordered the spicy mango margarita- which was flavored so well- mango-y, spicy, and salty. Just enough alcohol to have a little buzz at the end of the glass- best cocktail I've had in a while. My friends had the smoked strawberry and the bloody Maria, which they enjoyed too. The Soya marinated tuna tostada was the first item to come out to our table, which was raw tuna layered carefully atop of a large flat tostada disc. I thought that the salt in the tostada may have overpowered the tuna itself. Lamb barbacoa quesadilla: the watercress and squash blossoms add a different dimension to the lamb.Bacon burrito: not your ordinary plain old brunch burrito. The crispy potato gave this a satisfying crunch, and the salsa, cream, and quesillo cheese worked really well. Concha especial: delicious pork and egg sandwich. I wasn't in love with the fairly sweet bun but it had a lovely texture. I had an outstanding brunch experience and want to come back for dinner!",Oxomoco
322,"Pretty disappointing pizza, especially cause there are so many other good options.  Place looks smaller than it actually is. Small line out front at 5pm on a Monday.  We were seated after about 5 minute wait.Ordered a small pizza (feeds two easily) and a salad.  House salad was in a thick vinaigrette. It was so thick that it was almost inedible.  After choking down the salad they brought out the pizza.  Let's just say the salad was the highlight of the meal.  Pizza was bland and soggy.  I'm not sure if they used sauce or just soaked the thing in water.  Toppings were plentiful but the pepperoni has no kick to it either.  You can do better than this place.","I really wanted to enjoy this place but I was severely disappointed to find out it's nothing but hype.First things first:5 stars for my server-he was polite, attentive, and informative. There was no wait and we were a party of 5 so thats great. The buildings are old and interconnected so we were taken up to the enclosed terrace which had a blasting A/C unit right above my chair-no worries we shuffled around the table and moved away from it. Not mention there is some odd electrical box/panel right next to the seat and behind 2 other seats-knowing how NY DOB works, this can't be good-moving on.The caesar salad had grape tomatoes in it-since when does caesar salad have tomatoes in it? Overall it was ok.Margherita pizza: doesn't get any easier right? WRONG-the sauce is weak, bland, flavorless. The mozzarella was sparse and the dough was unimpressive. The raspberry and italian soda is syrup, seltzer, and whip cream-no big dealYou want great tasting thin crust pizza bursting with flavor, go to Posto in Gramercy.There ya have it folks, I did my good deed for the year for all you foodies out there.","One of my biggest disappointments.   Ordered Pizza and Iced tea.   The Pizza was soggy, the sauce tasted like bitter cheap canned tomato sauce and when I asked for a refill on my iced tea, I was told that there are no refills.   Seriously?","There is a reason this place has as many reviews as it does. Whether or not the claims of it being the OG of pizza places in NY is true or not, I have no idea HOWEVER, the pizza and authenticity of the ambiance make it seem like the realest if deals. My husband and I have dined here the past two times we have visited New York and have left very please both times. The service has been quick and friendly (despite how busy they can be) and the pizza is very fresh and tasty. I also really love the simplicity of their menu!The only negative is that it is cash only so prepare for that!","After hearing about this oldest and most famous pizza place, i decided to go for dinner. I ordered half original and half white pizza as we wanted to try both these options. White pizza was decent but the original pizza wasn't great , definitely not as we had expected. There are such good places in Brooklyn and around that area that have better pizzas. Surely wasn't up to the hype and serves mediocre slices and it was $20. Also, there was no wait line and almost all tables were filled.",Has to stop by USA's first pizza spot.  This is a cash only restaurant.  Menu is small.  Not offering too much.  Our pizza was good.  But I'm taking away 1 star because I was expecting more flavor.  The pizza was nothing spectacular but it was not horrible.  Our waitress was not very interested and repeated maybe 3 times that this is an old school restaurant When my wife asked for ranch.  When asked if they had wings.  When asked if they had any pasta I would most likely of return if I'm in the city again. But it was well worth the visit and history.,Lombardi's Pizza
323,"Came here with a Time Out coupon, but it wasn't particularly good. Tried the fried calamari, the steak and the salmon. Everything was on the blander side. The salmon came in a soup bowl and was difficult for me to cut the salmon without turning over the bowl. Wouldn't come here again.","Pros: The cauliflower was full of flavor especially with the two complimenting sauces. There was also a generous amount.The escargot was fresh.Cons: The top of my second clam was slightly overcooked/burnt.The brussel sprouts and bacon were littered with salt. It was almost inedible for me.The branzino special was a little wet, but that's probably because of the watermelon. Either way, the crispiness suffered. Not my preference.","Very average brunch food, service was awful (if you are sat in the back room forget getting anyone's attention). It took a party of 4 over 40 minutes to get some very basic brunch food. We ordered 3 drinks and a coffee and they forgot my coffee until I reminded them about 10 minutes later. Fairly pricy considering the location. I would not return.","Overall: This is a fantastic spot, underground speakeasy feel which is perfect for a late night dinner or an afternoon brunch. There is outdoor seating, although limited. The food ( cauliflower ) was so delicious! I would give 4.5 stars because cocktails were not particularly tasty, perhaps a little watered down, but regardless... this is a great spot!Atmosphere: walk down stairs, divided in two areas which both open up to small outdoor areas 1) bar soace 2) dining area which are nice and intimate with mirrors creating a nice effect. Again, 1920s French , speakeasy feel would be the best way I could describe it. Food: If you love veggies- please get the cauliflower.... it was so incredibly delicious , full of complex flavors of lemon/ lime citrus garnishing and cooked to perfect perfection. I will return just for this! Service: wonderful!!!Drinks: Again, not my favorite, a little watered down. I got a Mescal drink. Would return for cauliflower","Our dinner was delicious, the servers were friendly and attentive and the atmosphere where amazing.They have gorgeous marble tables, lovely lighting and comfortable upholstered booth.Black Derby is a gem!","GREAT BRUNCH SPOTSuper cute seating + amazing food + solid brunch drinks deal.* Breakfast Sandwich 10/10* Tuna Tostada 10/10Both were INCREDIBLE. Sandwich is super filling, honestly could've been full from the tostada alone. Drink deal was good relative to NYC and I LOVE that they have the option to switch out bottomless mimosas for another boozy brunch drink for a couple extra $$",The Black Derby
324,"The food was idyllic (I'll upload photos soon!) and was of nice quality but was not mind-blowing. What WAS mind-blowing was the waitress who served us, which completely overshadowed the otherwise pleasant meal. We ordered the Brussels sprout appetizer, and unfortunately, the dish was incredibly bland yet uncomfortably oily. Believing the restaurant to be trendy, I thought I would communicate and let them know. I also asked if we could change out the Brussels sprout dish for another. The waitress's mind-blowing response was, ""I don't understand, you ate some already"". I was dumbfounded at her response and figured I should just let it go. Of course I ate some. That is how I know the Brussels sprout was were lackluster. While she was not polite, it would not be fair of me to classify the interaction as rude either.","Lots of nice wine selections; cocktails are mostly ice.Male staffs are quite friendly but one lady waitress was oh my god rude and rude and oh well.Escargot was very good (as anywhere else)Cacio e Pepe Cauliflower - was okay, way too much cheese",The hostess is beyond rude... will not be returning to this place and I wouldn't recommend going here unless you enjoy being in the presence of an absolutely crazy person and verbally assaulted in the bathroom.,"A French restaurant in this neighborhood? Bollocks.The bartender/waiter was just oh-so-incredibly-cool. Super nice guy with dreads and a tilted hat that knew exactly what he was doing. Killer drinks (and it's not even quite a cocktail bar). My friend is a cocktail ""snob"" and loved the Old Fashioned's - so much that he had two. Also, attentive service. All around great attitude.The Duck Crostini was delicious, the fig jam and truffle complimented each other so well. And the slice of duck. Oh yeah.La Bitteroise tarte flambee (french pizza/flatbread) was yum - soft dough, a crowd pleaser.The potatoes au gratin was cheesy and rich, went well with bread, but half our crowd was vegetarian and didn't realize it had meat.Our one friend went rogue and had the Boeuf Bourguignon and it was fiiiine. But I think that's a ""me"" thing. The flavors fall flat for me. Almost like it does for Veal Marsala.But they never disappointed, regardless. Sure, the prices for certain things weren't reflective of the portions, but French restaurants tend to be like that. And the service and mood was too good to care.","This is a late review.  I came here on a Friday in April for my bday dinner with my girlfriends.  We made a reservation for 6pm, but totally not necessary because the place was empty.  I'm not saying that's a bad thing either, I love space and that's really hard to find in NYC.  That being said, it started to get packed about an hour later so if you plan on coming after 7, I highly recommend making a reservation!We ordered and shared the following:-  Rosemary and roasted brie:  They give you a whole wheel of brie.  I love brie and have been known to eat a whole wheel by myself in one sitting.  I was in heaven.  -  Duck crostini:  I was skeptical, but this was really delicious.  Very creamy and they give you extra bread if you ask-  Escargots:  Who doesn't like escargots?-  Organic brussel sprouts:  Also delish-  Meatballs:  Pretty good, but probably my least favorite out of everything we ordered-  Octopus:  Very good-  Lots of French red wine:  YummyAll in all, highly recommend.  Friendly staff, great ambiance, fantastic food.  I'll be back here :)Also, if you're looking for a place to stumble into after, The Flower Shop is a block away.","Came here for Sunday Brunch and it was great! Loved the vibes/decor. The food was good as well! Highly recommend getting a couple items and sharing it as a group. Prices are great as well. It wasn't too expensive and the portions were good. If in the area, will come back for dinner and drinks!",LĒNA
325,"I blame myself and Buzzfeed Worth It for giving into the hype of Red Rooster. Bad service and dry/over cooked food was a bad way to end my weekend in NY. We had reservations at 4:30 and got sat immediately. After we got greeted drink orders were taken, our waitress didn't show up again till 5:07 to take food orders.For starters, the wild wild wings were good but wayyyy too overdressed. The sauce was good in small doses but not drenched and dripping. The entrees though... everything just derailed from there.The hot honey yardbird was drier than the Sahara. On Worth It, the hosts chicken was DRIPPING with sauce and I understand I'm just some pleb eating a meal and not hosting a show but the chicken was just bad. No sauce, overcooked, and underseasoned. My guests got the Lenox burger (said it was one of the worst burgers she ever had and the bun was stale) while my other guest got the G.O.A.T. He also didn't enjoy it and for goat that's braised, the meat was tough and underseasoned. Just overall really disappointed but the Chef's Choice Mocktail was good, under than that I was severely underwhelmed.","This place has mixed reviews but I decided to give it a shot. Well, I was wrong. Waste of time since we drive all the way from Brooklyn to Harlem and waste of money: totally a waste. Over price and bad food. The food and drink is horrible for the price. We got a table right away. Ordered 2 cocktails : Harlem mule and Yes Chef, the cocktails were super weak, water down. Almost take nothing like alcohol. Chicken with waffle for $17: pathetic, worse than Chinese take out chicken wing. Seriously?! Waffle was cold, soft. Block party ribs :$29 small portion, taste like $5 ribs with lousy seasoning and sauce. Total 2 cocktails and 1 entree, 1 appetizer is almost $80. Never come back",Dissatisfied with my food. The meat was still too tough. Think it might have needed another hour or so on slow cook. Service was good.Loved the ambience and decor.,"I'm New York celebrating my friend's 40th Birthday and kicked off Friday-Eve at Red Rooster. The food is always great!  This time we came at lunch time which was great because we had plenty of time to chat and giggle. The atmosphere is always laid back and the server, Rahan (sp), made sure to take care of us. The table had the Cornbread w/ sweet potato butter, Wild Wings, Mac-n-Greens, Deviled Eggs, Lenox Burger, Hot Honey Yardbird, the Peach Cobbler Doughnut and Strawberry Tres Leches cake. Oh and the Rooster Punch.All the food was exceptional but the desserts weren't their best. However I must admit I'm not much of a sweets person. I'll always recommend Red Rooster to anyone coming to NYC (Harlem). You can never go wrong with anything on the menu.","My boyfriend and I have been meaning to try this place for a while now, and we finally did it last Thursday night. But we were very disappointed after waiting a while for our food to come out and spending a couple hundred dollars at this establishment to be asked to leave by a hostess because another party was waiting for our table. Not a request I would have expected from a restaurant of Chef Marcus Sammuelson. I found it to be disrespectful and unprofessional to patrons that have never been to the restaurant and place a time limit on how long they could enjoy their meal. If we continued on with dessert, would they have asked us to leave as well? I understand it is a very well known and sought out restaurant. But please give the respect to your paying customers that are already seated and want to enjoy themselves at the restaurant without having to feel rushed. Despite this unfortunate event, the food was excellent as we expected it would be. Below is my account of our meal:Starter- Bottle of Pinot Grigio and Mac & Greens. Both excellent. Highly recommend if it is your first time. The collard greens made the dish. Main course- Poppa Eddie's Shrimp n Grits, Hot Honey Yardbird, and BBQ spiced waffle fries.  We loved every bite of the mains and we could have done without the waffle fries. It was not anything different from the waffle fries you would get elsewhere with bbq seasoning that is similar to Lay's potato chips. Our fries also came out cold. But highly recommend the 2 mains.","Poor, unwelcoming customer service. My wife and I attempted to visit this establishment after seeing a show at The Apollo. Visiting NYC/Harlem from California, we had received recommendations from a another couple to give it a try while in Harlem. Reviews were OK, so we thought we would stop by before we headed back to our AirBnB for the night.We were pleasantly greeted by the door staff and we headed over to the the restaurant area. There wasn't anyone at the podium and various workers (waitstaff, bussers and the gentleman that looked like he may have been in charge) all pretty much avoided eye contact with us while we stood at the empty podium looking confused. We waited for about 3 minutes. We eventually flagged down the guy who looked like a manager. He was passing near us (for a second time) and obviously avoiding eye contact. I wasn't sure if he actually worked there because he never said hello, nor did he welcome us to the establishment. He stepped over to us and just waited for us to say something first.  (Body language said ""I'm listening"" as he turned one ear toward me.) So, I asked if they were still open and he sharply responded, ""We're closed.""Suprised, I explained that I was confused because we were let in. He said, ""Well, the bar is open but you can't get food there because the kitchen is closed.""  I asked for confirmation, ""The bar is open, huh?"". He confirmed, ""Yes, the bar is open for another couple of hours."" His expression was not inviting and it seemed like he was just giving us information, but wasn't responsible what we did with it. I responded ""OK....."" and he responded with a nod and walked away. At that point I felt like I was being welcomed and I don't know why. I expected better service from a place like this - at least, a Hello or a smile. I never said that we wanted food, but we did want to sit down and at least have some cocktails. I was uncomfortable to squeeze in any more questions about that possibility, and since it wasn't offered I decided that it wasn't worth spending my money there and went some place less pretentious. My wife turned to me and said ""Apparently, they don't need to make money here - can we go back to the place we went to last night?"" We did just that and were properly greeted there.",Red Rooster Harlem
326,"I was debating whether to get Royal Grill Halal Food or Xi'an Famous Foods for dinner and in the end I chose Xi'an. - Pork Zha Jiang noodles: Noodles were acceptable but really salty. - Stewed pork burger: the bun was soggy from the pork, doughy and dense. This was the worst dish. - Tiger vegetables salad: given how greasy the noodles were and how doughy the burger was. It was good and necessary to have the salad. Given that I spent close to $30 with drinks I would have chosen halal food if I can do it again.",I've been to Xian since 2013 and I have loved this place. I moved to Austin and was craving for Xian so I was excited to be back. Result? Full disappointment. I got NS10. The noodles and veggies werent cooked at all. The noodles tasted raw. It seems like the people over there didn't care much about the quality of the food. They just lost it. It is not the Xian I used to know.,"Always reliable and on the cheaper side to get full. Flavorful. I would get the spicy lamb with noodles. Skip the soup version, as there's a lot of spices that accumulate and is not pleasant to eat. Also, they should add cilantro to all the dishes to cut some of the oil.","Wow!! What a delicious find for me in NYC. I know Bourdain helped put this on the map a while ago. I finally got around to it. What was I waiting for?!We started with delicious soup dumplings. I finally got the scoop on how to eat them without melting my tongue, which definitely helped my tastebuds for the meal to come. The dumplings were hefty and flavor filled!! A few drops of vinegar in the spoon, place the dumpling, nibble off the top, add a few more drops of vinegar. The soup inside the dumpling will cool a bit Now you're ready to slurp pain-free.Next we had the lamb  ""burger"" and oxtail noodles. The lamb is perfectly and piquantly seasoned. The oxtail is braised tender. I tossed it with a bit of the spicy sauce. Absolutely delicious.The midtown location is adequate with no frills seating. The prices are a bargain. The quantity and quality of the food is outstanding. And the staff is friendly and helpful. This was the perfect stop to lay a nice base before beginning our cocktail and fun filled evening. The food is filling, not at all oily, and absolutely savory. Great place for a low key start to your evening with friends or a satisfying lunch time treat.","From all of the talk about Xi'an, I had to find out what the hype was about. Showed up at this location around 11:30am just before the rush of people!I ordered the N2 (my spice tolerance is pretty low) and V ordered the N1. We decided to get some veggies knowing that the dishes don't really have much so we got the cucumber salad. Food was cooked pretty quickly. The consistency of the noodles were very chewy, with some undercooked in mine. The beef reminded me a lot of my mom's homemade dishes so that hit close to home. Although my dish was mild spice, I was feeling the burn!V's dish was super spicy. I did not know that cumin could make a dish that spicy! The spice made him sweat a lot, but the spice level was not completely unbearable. There was A LOT of noodles overall for both dishes. V couldn't finish his dish because it got to the point that it was too spicy. The cucumbers helped balance the spice for both of us; it added a refreshing touch to our meal. Overall, good noodles. I would not come here every week but would come back again if I'm ever craving some spice.","Still my favorite quick bite Chinese spot! A must try for Chinese handmade style noodles. Cold skin noodles is my all time favorite, very close to what the motherland has. If you are not a thick noodle fan, the Chinese style pork or lamb ""burger"" is an good option. It doesn't look that big but pretty filling.",Xi'an Famous Foods
327,"This place was a complete EMBARRASSMENT on NYE. Beauty & Essex handled this event like total amateurs. We purchased Lounge Seated VIP tickets for $150+ each which clearly states reserved seating and a VIP line. The multiple websites stated that open bar is from 9:30 pm-1:30 am and doors open until 4:00am. We arrived around 9:30 to a ""VIP Line""- more like a throng of angry, drenched people waiting to get inside and a GA Line that went to the end of the block, neither of which were moving. After an hour of figuring out why no one was getting in they told us they were denying access to all VIP because they couldn't find wristbands. Seriously. We finally got in at 11:00 pm and checked our coats. We then had to ask FOUR different staff members where the seated lounge area was. Clueless. We went upstairs and flagged down a waitress who actually was very helpful (wish I knew her name, that 1 star is for you girl) and found us our table - she had to clear out the group of people that weren't supposed to be there. It is now 11:30. Missed the countdown/ ball drop due to the LONG line at the bar to get champagne, so that was cool.Night starts to get better; we're drinking and dancing, then the lights go on, music stops. It's 1:50. They start clearing everyone out. I will repeat it is ONE-FIFTY AM. I honestly thought this was a joke. Then coat check. What a nightmare. The stampede of people pushing and shoving to get into the tiny doorway/stairway was insane. We even tried staying at our table to finish our drinks and wait for it clear up. They took our half finished drinks away and insisted we had to leave the lounge and go get our coats because they needed us out. Luckily once we got to the basement we recovered all of our belongings but I witnessed numerous people around me freaking out because their jackets were missing and had been stolen- WITHOUT APOLOGY. The staff were so unaffected by it like no big deal, talk to management. Never in my right mind will I EVER go back to this place. Unbelievable. False advertising.","I wanted to come here for so long. I was going to give the food 4 stars until I went to bed and got the feeling I had to sh*t my pants. My stomach hurt so bad, but I had ate a lot of food that day so to make sure it was Beauty & Essex that gave me food poisoning, I texted my friend: ""I think I got food poisoning from dinner, are you ok?"" She responded, ""literally was thinking the same thing! I had such a bad stomachache and could barely stand up/walk back. Had to lay down immediately. I think it was the salmon tartare."" The salmon tartare wasn't even that good. It came on top of rice crackers and it just was a weird texture combination. The ""crispy"" fish tacos were NOT crispy. The breading of the batter is not meant to be give you that crispy outer layer. Not only was it soft and not warm, the taco was the driest taco shell I've ever had. It tasted like a cheap fast food taco. What a rip off. It could have also been the food poisoning culprit because it tasted like it's been sitting out for a while. If you deep fry a fish, it's supposed to come out piping hot. The food was room temperature, you can guess for yourself how long it's been sitting out. The only decent dish was the octopus cassoulet. It was spicy and had chorizo that saved the fish. The octopus as really tender, the beans could have been more tender.Obviously, I know you run the risk of food poisoning if you consume raw food, and that's why the put the * so they don't incur liability. But it's not ACTUALLY supposed to give you food poisoning unless your restaurant is unsanitary. I eat sushi all the time and have had no problems. I didn't expect such a local favorite to give me and my friend food poisoning.They serve champagne in the bathroom. But I would be so hesitant to get it because the place looks dingy. When I walked into the the restaurant, I caught a whiff of urine smell. I was like whatever, it's new york. But she lead us upstairs to our table and the smell continued. I can't tell if it's their cleaning supplies or the diffuser they use but I can't be the only person to think it smelled like urine in the whole restaurant!!!! Anyways, it's the next morning and I thankfully did not sh*t my pants but my stomach STILL HURTS.","Ambience:  art deco decor combined with loud clubbing music.  I could barely have a conversation with anyone at my table.Food: had the lobster and hash for appetizer and then fish tacos for entree. The lobster and hash dish was drenched in Cajun spices and could hardly taste any of the actual ingredients.  There's something truly rewarding about tasting actual ingredients themselves, rather than be coated in spices. Entree was not any better and drowned out  by the spicy mayo.If you are looking for a party vibe during brunch then come here.","This entire place is absolutely stunning in terms of atmosphere alone. Speakeasy style is a huge plus, but when you walk past the doors of its vintage styled shop you entire a ballroom like venue with large staircase bar and tons of seating. All of the food on the menu is delicious and the drinks are very well made. It's clear that each dish was thought about with extreme attention to detail and flavor. We had oysters, fish tacos, soup dumplings, scallops, Mac and cheese and a couple mixed drinks. The standouts dishes were the Lobster Mac and Cheese and the Grilled Cheese, Bacon and Soup Dumplings. Mind you, everything is delicious, but the flavor and portion size was perfect for these in particular. We are coming back just to try other things on the menu and have dessert.","First speakeasy experience! This place is located in a pawn shop which I thought was very cool. Upon entering, you are greeted with darkness and a beautiful chandelier and the front desk. I made reservations for dinner as my friend had recommended this place for us. We were led upstairs where there was another bar area and multiple tables. The area we sat in was very dark and very loud but this is expected. The drinks and food were all delicious but I don't know if I would have a nice intimate dinner here. It is more for hanging out or something casual. I know a table next to us was having a hard time hearing each other and it was easy to tell they were annoyed. Anyways, the nice surprise is in the ladies' bathroom. There was a free champagne bar!!! Not sure if it is available every day but it was a Friday when I went so there was champagne set up. It claims free but tips are accepted. I did not take a glass but I did see some other girls drinking it.It was a cool experience but a little bit too noisy for my liking. I would probably only come back for drinks and bites but not a full dinner!","On a recent trip to NYC, I let my sister plan an entire night for us; and she started with Beauty and Essex. I knew nothing about it, and so was incredibly delighted by every part of the experience.  We ducked through the unconvincing but still-cool pawn shop and entered a restaurant that is the restaurant you see in movies about New York. The place was gorgeous (anchored by a genius lighting design), hopping with NYC elites and had just the right amount of schmooze going. We were seated quickly, and got right down to it: starting with the grilled cheese dumplins. These, my sister told me, were the real reason that we came there: fried, delicious pieces of grilled cheese, nestled in a spoon with tomato soup and herbs. One bite, one little taste of heaven. I cannot recommend them enough. Next up were the chile rellenos empanadas, which were spicy and delicious, and had a unique flavor. The only disappointment was the lemon chicken.  While the mashed potatoes were decadent, the chicken was fatty, with pieces of bone or gristle in most bites. The flavor was delicious, and it had been seasoned perfectly, but the actual meat wasn't as good. Still, we ate it and enjoyed the parts we weren't spitting out in napkins.  Last up was dessert, and while our desserts were good, we did feel that the dessert menu wasn't as adventurous as the main menu: my sister got little donuts with three dipping sauces (A common dessert in Denver) and I got the peach cobbler with sweet corn ice cream, which was pretty amazing.All in all, I would say that this is a restaurant very much worth visiting if you are in NYC, especially for the euphoric vibe. The buzzing atmosphere and the beautiful design of the restaurant would make it five stars. The food? Four stars, but enthusiastic ones.",Beauty & Essex
328,"Service was extremely poor. From the time of seating at the bar, to getting transferred to a table. Not one server seemed interested in taking an order, serving water, providing bread or recommendations. After finishing our drinks we were never offered another refill on cocktails. We had to remind the manager about to please check the status of our main course. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.","Really yummy food, no complaints. Just a bit pricey for what it is. I had the mushroom ravioli and was not disappointed - very pillowy and creamy!",I went to Aurora to get a pasta to go. It was delicious! Will literally go back for the food. Unfortunately like many other reviews the service was not up to par with the food so I can't give this place 5 stars. The hostess is there to Host and provide customer service. Unfortunately that was not my experience.,"Nice wine collection, knowledgeable friendly staff. The octopus was grilled to perfection, the gnochetti was delectable and the homemade pasta amazing . This place is a must if you want simple good Italian with great service.Couple friendly w nice atmosphere","A day in Brooklyn @ Aurora.Since it was a Sunday, we only had the pleasure of having the brunch menu.As an Italian restaurant, the pasta menu selection was much better than anything else - Rigatoni with Ragu sauce & squid ink pasta.They also had mostly Italian wines on the menu ....As for the service, the bus boys were very ""rushing"" ... almost throwing the dishes, not even making the room for us before serving the dishes. Should be clearing the empty plates first !!!!","My friend suggested we do Aurora for brunch on Sunday, so we made a reservation via OpenTable and headed over. Making a reservation was super easy and quick! We were able to be seated in their outdoor patio right when we arrived which was great. The patio is gorgeous and the whole place really has a straight out of Italy vibe to it. The ambience was very lax and this is a great place to have a date or go to brunch with friends. The food is superb! We started out with the pancetta appetizer. Which was great, however our service experience was not so great. It took our waiter almost 15 mins to acknowledge us. Once he finally did we decided that we would order everything at once to avoid the wait. Our appetizer arrived 20 mins later and at that point we didn't even have drinks- just the Lukewarm tap water. We waited over an hour for our main courses- to the point where our Waiter, who I believe his name was William(listed on receipt) asked us if we were Interested in dessert????? I was extremely disappointed because had he checked in on our table he would have realized we hadn't been served in over an hour- no drink refills-nothing. Out of frustration , we spoke to the manager Stefano who was very courteous and made sure we were taken care of for the rest of our time there. However our waiter never apologized nor did he make an effort to try to mend the experience for us. Aurora Management- you guys have a beautiful establishment, please hire people that will take care of your customers properly so they're able to enjoy their experience there. Not sure if I will be coming back, again everything was great aside from the service.",Aurora
329,"Walked in hearing good reviews , as I walked in quite tiny seeming cozy . The food was decent nothing really rememberable just decent . As we were drinking we had the waiter/bartender come to our table and said 'There are people waiting to sit down if this can be our last drink , or go next door' As a person that Comes from a restaurant background . I will never come back obviously , but I guess the owner likes to lose customers .",The food here is terribly dry. Over cooked. Hate to be negative but honestly not worth it :/,"Other from the chocolate soufflé (served without cream) and the gracious staff (gentleman) the food lacked, The sirloin steak ordered was so bloody and cold in center, our plate looked like a murder scene. It must have been sitting on ice. Price doesn't equal quality. Would prob come for wine and dessert if needed","Wowow - so good. There's a good reason that it's so hard to get a table here! We tried on a weeknight a few weeks ago and were quoted an hour wait, which was too long for us at that time. This time around, we had luck with two seats available at the bar. We each had a couple of ciders which were delicious. The food was incredible though! We shared an order of chorizo tacos (3). Really delicious but wish they came with rice and beans or something else for the price point. The lobster Mac and cheese stole the show though. The cheesy, crunchy crust was baked to perfection! All in all, we were highly satisfied with what we tried here. Would love to come back and try some other items on the menu. Next time, we will also save room for the chocolate soufflé!","Low key, homey restaurant/bar in the UES consisting of 2 small rooms (one for dinner and one for drinking). My friend and I sat in the dinner room and split the macaroni and cheese with jalapeños ($19) and the pasta of the day (gnocchi with tomatoes, basil, and Parmesan) with a side salad ($28). Both dishes were delicious, came out hot, and tasted homemade/fresh. We also each enjoyed a glass of wine ($12).I thought that the prices were a bit steep for the value, but would come back for the great food and ambience.","The ultimate neighborhood restaurant, in my opinion. Their menu isn't huge, but they always have great specials (the gnocchi with duck ragu is a common one, and it is outstanding), and their staples (eg mac & cheese, paella, and maybe the best burger on the UES) are almost universally excellent.Very small, but early an early dinner on weekdays seems to be a good time to get in.",Heidi's House By The Side Of The Road
330,Disappointed. Mamas oven roasted chicken 1/5 - SOOOOO dry! The chicken was super dry and overcook. The sauce that came w it didn't add much flavor to the dry chicken. The only point I gave was for the fries that came w it. Tzatiki 3.5/5 - the dipping was good and fresh but the pita breads that came w it was old - you def can tell it wasn't made to order. Spaghetti 1/5 - this literally taste like school spaghetti! Not joking BUT even worse. It was overcook not al dente at all. The shrimps were ok. The sauce was so plain - couldn't taste the tomato. Sat at a bar - our server was friendly but busy w making drinks. Toward 8pm the crowds started and a lot of ppl were waiting at the bar trying to get the bar customers out so they can sit which was soo annoying and obnoxious. One of the person even purposely hit my friend head and didn't say anything or apologize to her; instead his friend did. GET A TABLE if you can! Avoid this place too! Not worth it and waste of money!,"What a greedy restaurant. They charge their patron a 3% surcharge for using their credit card. I've never experienced anything like this before and if anything, restaurants usually will give their patrons an added discount just for using using cash. Krok restaurant, in Brooklyn, is an example that offers a 10% discount to their customers. I'm sorry, but for me, this was just pure shady business that's unnecessary. What are they going to charge us next, city water?? What's even more annoying was when I gave them my card, the waitress could have easily informed me that there will be a 3% surcharge so I had the option to use cash if I wanted to but they didn't. When I inquired about the added charge, she just coldly responded it's because I used a credit card. For me a professional restaurant would never do this. This is just tacky business in my opinion.","Short Version: Don't go here. I waited for several hours, was ignored multiple times, was never given food but was almost charged for a meal (that was never given to me).I ALWAYS give restaurants/people the benefit of the doubt, but this place is truly deserving of a ""1 star"" rating (but is undeserving of your business). In fact, this may have been the worst restaurant experience I've ever had in my life. To start things off, we had to wait over two hours for a table. No big deal for a great place right? Wrong; this place was not worth it at all.Our waiter took over twenty minutes after we were seated to take our order, but not only that, HE SKIPPED THREE PEOPLE and left. Who does that?Luckily, ten minutes later, somebody was able to flag our waiter down to order the rest of our drinks. Whatever, not so bad.This same guy does the same thing again while we were ordering food; HE SKIPPED PART OF THE TABLE WHO WANTED TO ORDER (and left)!No big deal, we'll flag the guy down and order food for the people he skipped, right (just like the drinks)? Wrong. We flagged him down, ordered the food, WERE CHARGED FOR THE MEAL BUT WERE GIVEN NOTHING. I waited over twenty-five minutes for my food (after ordering) but was just handed the bill. After nearly 3 hours of waiting and repeatedly requesting food I was given a couple of pieces of pita bread and a bill. Thankfully he took the food off the charge (that he obviously didn't care enough to put in), but it was very annoying to those who wanted to eat.I swear this is the first time I've ever reviewed a restaurant. I did this for a reason. Don't give this place your business/a chance. Please go somewhere else.","Kikis, my dear Kikis. I love this place. The food: Greek Salad, romaine salad, whole fish, shrimp in a garlic sauce, potatoes in yellow sauce, greek yogurt and cherriesThe Vibe: Always packed, no reservations, expect to wait at least 30-45 minutes and more on weekends. If they say, there's no wait at Kikis Sister, the restaurant across the street, same brand, don't do it. I've been a few times and the food and vibe are never as good.Love this place","I just got home from Kiki's with a bag of leftovers, another trending neighborhood restaurant that specialize Greek food, and  located in between Chinatown and lower east side area. Kiki's has been on my radar for a while ever since they opened last year. Although I have been here with a friend before, and ended up he ordering food and I just had a drink. So I decide to go with my sister for dinner tonight, the restaurant already packed with people at 7pm when we got there, not to mention there are 6 group of parties ahead of us. After we put down our information and have been told the wait time is 45 minutes, I went to get a quick drink afterward. Even after we came back 45 minutes it's still packed. You know when a restaurant is packed with full of customers, either the food is good or the place has good reputation. The only thing I want to complain is that they don't serve cocktail, they only have beers and wine. We've gotten two appetizers, the octopus and sausage, then we also ordered the spaghetti with shrimp in shell and the lamb chop, we asked for medium rare and it came out just perfect. The meat tasted so good and have the great texture. The spaghetti is my favorite since its seafood and I love seafood, it was a little spicy and I bring it home for lunch. two appetizers that I ordered, It was fine nothing too special. I went to Kiki's again for some reasons, it's a walking distance from my apartment. I haven't have chance to explore the full menu in my previous visit. And I have only been to Greek restaurant once before. Overall, I think this is a good place to go with friends on the weekend, the is also go for small plates.","I just got home from Kiki's with a bag of leftovers, another trending neighborhood restaurant that specialize Greek food, and  located in between Chinatown and lower east side area.

331,"Booked a reservation to this place a month or so in advance to celebrate a 20th wedding anniversary. Chose this location due to the live music and overall ratings. Not sure I've ever been more disappointed in a dinner choice.  After being guided to our table we ordered drinks and our meal then asked what time the music starts and we were told something came up so no music tonight. We should have been told that when checking in for our table. We could have gone elsewhere. While they was disappointing it wasn't nearly as disappointing as the bland non flavorful over priced food.  I had the sea bass and literally no taste involved. My wife had the chicken and again it was even more bland. Service was decent at best? Ran out of water early and never got a refill. Just overall a bad experience, and not sure how this place has such great reviews.","The high and mighty hostess actually did me a favor tonight because the food here is average at best! The music is always good but tonight I was actually discriminated against and it didn't feel very good. the very average looking hostess, not cool guy with a hat - she stops us as we are walking to our table and loudly says in front of other people that we weren't dressed to her meager standards. As a life long New Yorker who considers fashion a part of my life I was sadly shocked into writing this review. If you worked for me I would have fired you on the spot for your disgusting behavior tonight!I'm happy to report that both the owner and the GM contacted me and assured me this was an isolated event and that they will be working to address this issue with staff. Mistakes happen to err is be human. Thank you Tommy and the team for making us feel welcome again!",Come here for the drinks only. Don't expect good service or good food. The host was the nicest all evening. Ordered steak tacos & couple next to me order the same and sent it back. Wasn't enjoyable just meat & soggy messy tortilla. I noticed most guest come here for drinks & live band was not good nor was it jazz.,Ultimate date spot with amazing drinks and live jazz !No cover charge great drinks menu and mixologists shaking their stuff.,"Great happy hour 5-7 pm . All specialty cocktails 10 bucks a piece and flatbreads discounted ...the flatbreads are a great , I recommend the mushroom.The place is perfectly lit and great for a date or a catch up ...live Jazz in the background but perfectly placed that it doesn't over kill .I ordered the 'matador' consists of  tequila, Cointreau, and jalapeno ..well balanced and a little spicy .Tip  .Order the scotch egg ...it comes in with 2 portions so perfect for a share . Its not the best scotch egg in the city but it definitely  hits the spot. Over all this place is a great little drop in after work and staff are very friendly and knowledgeable.","Went there for the first time recently. Great ambiance, I love the atmosphere in there. They had live jazz music and the girl singing was phenomenal! The food is very tasty. HOWEVER, our waiter told us that the servings are made for sharing. Maybe they are if there's only 2 of you but there were 5 of us. The servings are small and not very ""sharing friendly"". We ordered fried chicken and it came out with 2 whole pieces. It was a little awkward to share that as it was. Perhaps they could have cut them up and made them a little more shareable? The macaroni and cheese was heaven but again, it's a small dish. I could've eaten a whole one by myself! It's a little on the pricey side. Overall it was a great place! Dress a little nicer than casual but they didn't seem to have a dress code or anything. And be prepared to not share the dishes unless you're a couple! And even then, I don't think I would've shared my macaroni and cheese!",The Flatiron Room
332,"Stopped by the hole in the wall for lunch on my recent trip to Manhattan Chinatown. I'm Taiwanese and thought this was a good spot to check out. Meh, it was ok. The pork chop rice was good but that's about it. My wife got a roast duck noodle soup that she said smelled and tasted odd. Also the dumplings in red chili oil were tasteless... probably because they were full sized dumplings! Don't think I'll be back in the future!","The fried chicken legs and fried pork chops are good ($2.50 alone and $5.75 with preserved vegetables and noodle soup), but everyone else is just okay. The oyster pancake ($6.95) was too wet and not crispy enough, and the fried crispy shrimp ($5.50) were very artificial tasting. The salt and pepper chicken ($4.75) was decent.","So, maybe high expectations follow average to low experiences...Noodles with preserved veggies (noodles tending to be bland and veggies ok), Pork chops, which should be the popular dish of the house was too fried and greasyBoiled soy eggs were good, a pity they put only hoisin sauce on the top (scallion and sesame oil would have given much more flavour).Best thing: seaweed. Would only go for the seaweed.Oh and I know what I am talking about, Taiwanese-Spanish with relatives in Taiwan...","Some of my favorite restaurants in Chinatown are on Doyers street, and Taiwan Pork Chop House made that list. I can't believe it took me so long to try this place out. Not only is their food super cheap, the quality is good and the portions are really big. You could definitely spend less than $10 per person and still get dessert here. I've tried their salt and pepper chicken + rice, chicken over rice, and one of my favorite Asian desserts: the taiwanese shaved ice. Their chicken dishes come on top of rice with minced meat and picked greens/cabbage, and the flavors are literally amazing. For almost $6 a bowl, it is such a great deal and most of the time, I can't even finish it. I also really like their Taiwanese shaved ice -- you can either choose toppings for $0.50 each or just get a ""pre-set"" bowl. I usually just get the pre-set Taro Ball Shaved Ice because it comes with grass jelly, crystal jelly, taro balls, ice, corn, taro, and tapioca. The dessert is big and filling, and it's literally $5.50. You can even share with someone else! There are so few places that have as good of a deal on food & desserts as Taiwan Pork Chop House. Service is also pretty good and outdoor/indoor seating is plentiful. I've already come back multiple times, but I'll be coming back more.","Place went downhill...further.I actually had to walk out today with my father.We were in the neighborhood and wanted something simple. I've come here a few times prior and loved their pork chops, was in the mood for them. I was also thinking of having my father discover jellyfish for the first time to get a laugh in. (I actually liked the jellyfish dish when I tried it here for the first time a few years ago)  I have not visited for awhile because another time I attempted to dine the staff ignored me when I entered and would not offer a place to sit, even though there were plenty of seats. But of course they became friendly with the man who cam in after me and seated him promptly. So, I figured I'd give them one more shot... What a mistake! We were quickly seated and reviewed the menu. As we were brought our water we already made a decision on what we would like to order. The waitress listened to our order, two meals and a appetizer and I pointed to each thing on the menu and the waitress was repeating along with me.I then handed her back to menus and she whisked away.As we were waiting a few different staff members asked us if we ordered and we explained someone took are order already. My father I figured it was just such a busy place, they wanted to make sure our order was in. Finally a woman approached us and asked us what we wanted to order, I told her our order was already placed. She asked us what we ordered and off the top of my mind I recited what we ordered. She said no one took our order and they did not have it. So I was upset and asked ""our order was not placed"" She said ""no"". I replied ""unbelievable"" and walked out with my father. We decided to take our business elsewhere and had a better experience. I do feel like this place does treat not asian customers a bit differently and not for the better, again this is based on multiple times i've come.I've never had to walkout of a place ever. Well Taiwan Pork Chop House we have had two firsts together. Eating jellyfish and walking out of a restaurant. It has been a pleasure but I bid you adieu.","Shaved ice/dessert review. Came here to try their Taiwanese style shaved ice and grass jelly desserts. It was still super busy at 8pm on a Saturday night. The 5 of us still got seated fairly easily, but had to split a round table with 3 other people. We did not mind this at all and it's common in Chinatown's busier restaurants. I ordered the mango shaved ice and the house made grass jelly deluxe or something. The mango ice tasted very good. The homemade grass jelly was interesting and something I've never had before. Unlike the canned grass jelly, this one was thicker and glutenous. I think I prefer the canned one better and will know to order it next time. The taro balls were very very chewy and filing. We also got a fried popcorn chicken, which was not fresh, thus, not great. Another friend was hungry and ordered a noodle dish which was pretty delicious. Open to coming back to eat the minced pork rice, pork chop, and another noodle dish.",Taiwan Pork Chop House
333,Seriously good Italian deli with ridiculous portions. You ain't going home hungry! Place is a throwback but every penny!!,"Great sandwiches and quick, no nonsense service. Well manned counter gets you in and out fast. A NY gem.","One of the best sandwiches you can find in NYC. The corned beef reuben and pastrami & swiss are other-worldly.  The staff is surprisingly warm and patient for being an old school Brooklyn shop. It's off the beaten path so it's rarely crowded-another thing I like. The seating inside is very limited (one table and a couple of standing-room only counters), but when it's warm enough, they set up a few picnic tables outside in the parking lot.","Defonte's is a no-frills, classic NY-style sandwich shop, so there's a counter that you can stand at to eat, but no formal seating. I had a great experience with the staff, who are very friendly and attentive.Defonte's eggplant parmesan sandwich is a hot mess in all the right ways. Let me tell you about it.The eggplant is breaded and fried, but not greasy (eggplant has a habit of absorbing oil, which is usually what goes wrong in eggplant parm). A thick layer of gooey cheese blankets that fried eggplant goodness, and the whole thing is tied together with a fantastic marinara sauce that's on the sweeter side, with great flavor. Defonte's is a classic throw back shop well worth your time, you will NOT leave hungry but definitely  come early while the good food is still available","What a hidden gem. A true old-school Italian sandwich shop tucked away in the sleepy back end of Red Hook. Cash only.I had the ""Golden Boy"" which comes with chicken cutlet, mozz and prosciutto all smothered in vodka sauce. It was a great mix of savory, sweet, and salty. A large cost me $12 and lasted for 2 meals. All in all, there's nothing I can say against Defontes. It's a throwback, a relic of a bygone era in New York when flavor and culture mattered more than media and virality. There's a deep gastronomic satisfaction that comes from eating at places like this, and there seem to be fewer of them left every year. I can't wait to go back and try more of their sandwich combinations. I highly, highly recommend you check them out too.","In a city filled with delicious sandwiches, Defontes might just make the best Italian subs you can buy.  After ten years in Brooklyn, my family is leaving for another town.  We threw a going away party and I ordered two party subs from the best place I know - Defontes.  The sandwiches came with plates and silverware, and were pre-sliced and individually packaged.  This made everything easy, and was certainly a lot of extra work on their part.  They also included two gigantic orders of potato salad and macaroni salad.  But let's be honest, you don't go to Defontes for the potato salad.We ordered a chicken cutlet sandwich, which was delicious.  But let me be clear, the Italian sandwich is a national treasure.  Nicolas Cage should have just gone to Red Hook.  Mystery solved.  Layers of delicious deli meat and cheese were piled high.  Hiding in the middle was a mysterious, thin slice of fried eggplant (?) and sweet red peppers.  All of this was stuffed between two perfectly crispy pieces of fresh Italian bread.  Marone - that's one hell of a sandwich.  Damn, I'm going to miss Brooklyn.",Defontes
334,"Very underwhelmed at this spot, which really bums me out because I was looking forward to it so much. Seated promptly when we arrived. It's very dark in there so just beware! Minimal interior decorating- looks very ""brooklyn""i found our apps (cacio e pepe and cauliflower) overly salty and nothing that special. The cacio e pepe fritters' flavors definitely work better as a pasta. As for our pastas, we ordered three (mafaldini, fettuccini, and the agnolotti) and I found all three uninteresting. maybe i was expecting too much from this place, but overall i'd say i was disappointed in the flavors although the pastas were all cooked pretty well. The mafaldini in particular tasted uninspired. Maybe it was an off day? I'm not sure, but I don't think I'll be making a trek out here any time soon.","I've come here twice and despite the hype, it is not a 5/5 place because it doesn't live up to it. Even though it's good I only give it a 3/5 because I'd expect a restaurant so nationally recognized to be, well...better. For a Best Chef nominated restaurant, I'd expect more. The Rigatoni was slightly too al dente. The gnocchi pasta lacked some flavor. I get what she was trying to do with the artichoke but it's honestly just kind of hard to eat and there isn't much artichoke. The special ice cream dessert - nothing impressive. Last time we got the olive oil cake and the chocolate torta and both were not impressive. The torta was not creamy/rich, more flaky like a chocolate cake. When it's so hard to get reservations, you'd expect a once in a lifetime kind of meal. Sorry to disappoint but that month long wait might not be worth it!","I've come here twice and despite the hype, it is not a 5/5 place because it doesn't live up to it.

We got the reservation exactly 30 days in advance through a hustle with the online reservation site. It's in a fun neighbourhood and the restaurant is a little out of place among some warehouses and apartment buildings. We got seated at the whole inside atmosphere is very lively and energetic. We picked 8 dishes for a party of 5 girls. It was more than enough!! The service was fast and friendly. My favorites were the clams and the ""pillow"" pasta bites! I also really really liked the secret off menu desert the ""Italian job"" - olive oil, vanilla ice cream and honey. Amazing. Would come back again in a heart beat. Would bring more of my friends.","I came here on a weekday evening and with reservations, I was seated right away. I got the reservations easily the night before as I had signed up for daily notifications for any cancellations on Resy.I thought the ambiance was minimalist. I mean for pictures, it does require flash. I think I would have preferred if the place was more well lit but I understand that it was an aesthetic choice. The service was great!For the food, I had the chicken liver crostini ($17). It was decadent, creamy, and flavorful-- it was absolutely everything I'd want it to be and more.We also tried the clams ($18), which were disappointing for me. The spiciness had a sort of sour taste to it which I did not particularly enjoy. Also, I would say the spiciness did not pair well with the clams and it tasted out of sync somehow.I also tried the Agnolotti pasta ($25). This is a must try for this restaurant and it did not disappoint. I loved the notes of cheese milk and honey. It was very rich, creamy, and filling.I also shared the Fettuccine with lamb ($24), which we thoroughly enjoyed. It juxtaposed well with the other pasta as they were both so different and unique. The lamb pieces were flavorful and larger than your average Bolognese pieces of meat, which I enjoyed. The sauce was slightly spicy which worked as it was not overpowering.For the dessert, I had the Italian Job ($11). The pairings of sea salt, honey, and Polifemo Sicilian olive oil were simply divine! I did see the similarity between Lilia and its sister restaurant, Misi. For the chicken liver crostini, it looked similar to the charred peppers with whipped ricotta crostini. *Although, these tasted unique from each other. The olive oil ice cream at Misi mimicked the Italian job at Lilia. Also, the butter and honey infused into the pasta held the same appeal. I am only mentioning this to say both are worth going to, if you are looking for that vibe! I loved my experiences at both of them.","Finally got to try this place and so worth the wait. Three of us got here around 5pm on a Thursday evening and waited for them to open. If you're not able to make a reservation, try to get there 20 minutes before they open and they'll probably be able to sit you without a reservation. If you don't do this, you will unlikely to be able to sit in the next 5 hours. It started to rain while we waited and someone from the restaurant cane out and brought umbrellas. Service throughout our meal was also excellent. Now onto the food...The focaccia bread IS A MUST. Our other appetizers were the cauliflower and the house made mozzarella. Both are also VERY good. For my main dish I had the sheep's milk cheese agnolotti which I was told is the cheesiest dish they have. And it was delicious. The other people I came with both got the mafaldini and I thought it was very tasty but a little dry (no cheese and no sauce). Seasoning was on point though. Would come back.",Lilia
335,"I have a huge weakness for Korean fried chicken and this place perfectly satisfies it. Stopped by for a weekday lunch and there was no wait. I've had KFC before (Bonchon, Kyochon - now closed), but severely underestimated the sizes of these wings while ordering a 20 piece platter. Soy garlic flavor is always my go to flavor and it didn't disappoint. The only downside was that the wait time was at least 25+ mins...for a place that specializes in chicken...crazy. Hell our potato twister came out 20 mins before the main meal. The atmosphere inside is cool, dark and trendy. The hostesses/servers are slow and would much rather prefer chatting amongst themselves. Come for the chicken, nothing else.","Great ambiance and prices. The service is good but the place gets really crowded to prepare to wait!The chicken does come out freshly cooked so, again, prepare to wait.I would NOT recommend drinking - every alcohol is overpriced.","Just ok. Had the hush puppies and they were very dry and bland unfortunately - the sauce was its saving grace. Then we had both the garlic and spicy chicken. Although both definitely juicy and cooked to perfection, the flavors were just ok. We also had a couple of beers from the tap and they were so flat that we exchanged them for new ones, and when we did, the second round was flat as well. I hate that I'm comparing them to Mad for Chicken (which I loved), but it's Korean fried chicken so it's hard not to. I probably won't be back.","My friend and I were starving after getting back to the city from hiking Breakneck Ridge and made a beeline for ktown. We shared the medium-size drum and wings combo and the kimchi pancake. Didn't even think to take pics when the food came and just devoured everything (whoops). The wings were mildly spicy - very crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The kimchi pancake was good too. Do eat it with the sauce that comes with! Service was good and vibe was chill. Wasn't too busy around 6pm on a Sunday.The drumsticks and wings take about 20 minutes to prepare, so if you are super hungry like we were, do order an appetizer!","Went here with a group of four and we shared the following dishes: spicy rice cakes dish - not aggressively spicy, suitable for those with a weaker palate. Fantastic sauce not too sweet like some. Nice big portion too.Chicken wings, garlic soy flavor - perhaps the best texture I've EVER had on a chicken wing! Even with the sauce on them, the skin was still seriously crispy. As in actually crunchy. No soggy breading here! Great flavor.Bulgogi- flavorful and delicious. Small portion.Twister Potato on a stick - meh. I mean, it was good. But it's a fried sliced potato. Price is high for a root vegetable that costs like 30 cents at a store. Reminded me of overpriced boardwalk food. Fried Dumplings, half spicy, half garlic soy - above average dumplings, great crispy texture on the wrapper! The spicy ones were no joke, beware! I was in heaven because I love spicy food, but they're not for the faint of heart!Speaking of spicy, the Jalapeño margarita was SO F-ING GOOD! It was make-you-cough, gets stuck in the back of your throat spicy, and I LOVED it! Bonus, it was so hot, I had to sip my drink slowly, which meant it lasted a long time! I'd go back just for that drink and the wings!","Came here for a birthday party last night and I'm in AWE I haven't been here sooner. The food is incredible. The chicken is unique and tender. Not dry whatsoever. Warning the spicy is pretty hot. I enjoy spice and my mouth was burning but if you order soy garlic as a half order it pairs well together. Drinks are fairly priced, they serve beer in lava lamps and the decor almost makes you forget you are in NYC. It transports you to a different time period and the food transports you to an advanced cuisine. Delicious!! Will be back!What I ordered--hush puppies, pickled radishes, soy garlic breasts and spicy breasts, and grilled edamame.",Turntable Chicken Jazz
336,"I'll start off by saying that their boil sauce taste amazing and their potato was just soft enough and corn were flavorful and sweet. Their drinks are also really tasty also.  On to why I leave a review today.This place tasted great for a while, but recent delivery had tons of sand in their boiled clams, so much so that you can see literal sand patches on the clams.  Not sure if they didn't rinse the clams long enough, but it was crunchy like cheetos, and believe me that's not a good thing for clams.  The snow crabs had gotten really salty and wasn't a good combination with their recommended sauce :( .  The shrimps were also soft and pasty when you peel off the shell, which told us they weren't that fresh, even for frozen shrimp.  I never had issues until today, I guess their quality has dropped since their open, which sucks because I really liked this restaurant.",I was super excited that something like this opened up in the neighborhood but it is so disappointing. If this place doesn't change their food they will not last. The food is tasteless. It is missing salt in everything! Also there is no spice at all. How can this place be cajun/creole? First off cajun food doesn't even use old bay. Even the fries weren't good. I won't be going back here until they change the food. As for the service they were good an attentive but it could have been because there was only 1 other table other then mine. The decor is cute but too dark inside.,They're the absolute best ! The mac & cheese (with and without lobster) is delicious .,"I went here on a Saturday afternoon date with my wife. The atmosphere is fun. Very clean inside and everything is new. Fun decor on the wall and cool chairs and tables.The service was great. Friendly staff and attentive.We ordered the shrimp / dungeness crab combo, and the King Crab. The seafood was really fresh, the sauce was delicious.We had a great experience. We would certainly go back and recommend it to friends.","Four of us went to Oceanic Boil for dinner on a Saturday night and ordered fried calamari, soft shell crab, combo of 1 lb shrimp and whole lobster with oceanic boil sauce, 1 lb king crab legs with oceanic boil sauce and a side of sausages.The sausages had a nice spicy kick to it. The calamari and soft shelled crab were crunchy and good. It came with a spicy mayo sauce which was yummy and a side of fries which were tasty as well. The corn that came with it wasn't very good- it could have done without the corn.The lobster and king crab legs were full of meat and  so I would definitely recommend these. The shrimp was ok - they were kind of on the smaller side compared to other boil places I've been to. The oceanic sauce that came with it was subpar. It lacked real full flavor. The sauce could've been made slightly saltier and it really wasn't that memorable. I was disappointed by the oceanic boil sauce. I didn't try the other sauces though. Overall, I've had better seafood boils at other restaurants. Everything is in the sauce and the oceanic boil sauce was lacking. Other than that, the appetizers and sides were good and service is good too.","Oh Oceanic Boil how I love thee. I've been here 3 separate times and each time I leave satisfied. I love seafood (shrimp and crab legs are my absolute favorite) so when I saw the other yelp reviews I knew I had to check it out. I'm glad I did because the spicy garlic butter sauce is delicious! There is usually no wait for seats when I've come here so that's a plus. Speaking of seats, the ones here are not particularly comfortable but they work. The staff is delightful. Every server I've had and even the bartender at the back bar are always so helpful with suggestions on food and drinks. Tips: - The appetizers come with a side of Cajun fries (the fries are perfection) -  1 combo platter is enough for 2 people. - The calamari appetizer is decent. It comes with fries as I mentioned above so if you order the calamari you may get too full before your meal comes out. - I'm on the edge about the chicken wings appetizer. The first time I ordered them they were delicious and the second time I ordered them they were very crispy as we asked for but did not have much flavor. I had to use lots of hot sauce on them. - The combo platters come with corn and potatoes. The corn and potatoes are soaked in whatever sauce you ordered the seafood in. *This was not an issue for me but other people may not care for this. - I suggest trying the snow crab legs - Try the spicy garlic butter sauce. The spice level is mild. My favorite. I know I'll be back and maybe I'll try the fried lobster next time.",Oceanic Boil
337,"The food here is authentic and good.  You probably won't be disappointed with the food specifically unless you order something like general tso chicken.  However you may be disappointed for numerous other reasons...1.  This place is expensive for casual Chinese.  Restaurant signs state that tips are included which might partially explain that, but it seems unfair carryout orders should pay for included tips.  I've tried following the instructions on their website for a carryout order discount, and it never works.2.  When dining-in, the workers never agree that tips are included even though it says so around the restaurant.  When I pointed to a specific sign stating so, his response was ""that's an old sign.""  This has happened to me twice here.   3.  They don't clean the chairs well.  I got a chili oil stain on my white pants before I had even opened the menu.  Not worth it.","Walked in for Lunch. We ordered cabbages with pork slices and dry noodles with beef, none greasy  Again the dishes that served were well prepared.The issue is being that it is a No-Tipping establishment, and indeed there is a sign for no tipping in front of the store, however it is the only sign for the entire store that has, should someone had missed out on that sign, there would be no one stopping you in giving extra tip, a credit card charge slip also has a tip column blanked for extra tip.Note to the management:1. Post your none tipping policy signs inside.2. Block that credit slip tipping option.If you would like to claim yourself a none tipping establishment, then do it with 100%Thank you for your attention.","Ordered delivery from this place and was slightly disappointed with their pig intestine noodles. It tasted like they didn't clean it right so it had a strong odor AMA gamey taste. I probably wouldn't order delivery from this place again but maybe it's different if I went in and ordered food. Nonetheless, it's an okay Chinese spot for the neighborhood and area.",I am so glad that there is China Xiang in my neighborhood. Now I have a place walking distance from my apartment for homey Chinese food. Food here is pretty authentic and good. Prices are reasonable too. Their Hunan rice noodle soup is perfect whenever I am feeling under the weather or just want something soupy. The taste reminds me of home and warms my tummy with every bite. My roommate came with her parents on a separate occasion and they all really liked the food here. She said the fish in chili sauce was super delicious. Most entree dishes are meant to be shared family style so I would recommend coming with friends so you can try more things.The service here was fast. I will definitely be back to try their other dishes.,"Great place for lunch mean. I felt health as I ordered steamed sliced white fish and tofu, on top of pickled paper spicy sauce. - Do not order the free soup that comes with the lunch, totally Not consumable!! It was just like a paddle of glue!- tipping is not required for this establishment.","Got Chicken Lo Mein for take out from this restaurant. Was packed well and was still hot when I got home. But the noodles were not properly mixed in the sauce and just the lower portion of it had soy sauce on it. For a price of $13, there was really less amount of chicken. Also, it was surprising that they only add bok choy and no other veggies to the lo mein. Definitely disappointed with the food since the lower portion of the noodles actually tasted good but the rest of it was pretty much bland.",China Xiang 中国湘
338,"3.5 starsThe waffle was delicious but the biscuits and gravy was underwhelming, the gravy was too salty and the biscuits were not crispy at all (didn't taste like fresh out of the oven) The host and the waiters are all friendly but my waiter forgot to bring me water. It's very unusual that I already got my food but still my water was no where to be seen. I end up asking another waiter to bring me water.","It was a Sunday morning after a long night of drinking and I was looking for some brunch with my SO. We were staying at a hotel just north of Grand Central so we wanted something relatively close as we needed to check out that day by 2 PM. I called to make a reservation for 11:30, and we were promptly seated. It was awkward though because the hostess stand was just off to the side of the main walkway so she always looked out of place. Anyways, our server was very responsive and actively refilled our coffee. We got two dishes, and both were executed well. My potatoes and veg I thought was a little on the oily side and I filling for a hash, but the eggs were well done. I think it was just the sheer amount of oil and butter that made the meal a little unpleasant. The other dish was executed well, but a little salty. My other complaint with this place is that the restroom is just one single stall and there is no indicator to say that someone is in the bathroom. We had a line from outside of the bathroom to go and were waiting for someone to exit for about 20 min before we realized that the door was just jammed. The hostess did not want to help us. Food 3/5, service 3.5/5, ambiance 4/5","It's one thing for some of the tables to be uncomfortably low so that they scrape your legs. It's another thing for the tables to be low and have nails protruding from them so that they scrape and rip your pants (see pic.)And it's another thing altogether to report this to your server, who then reports it to their manager, who then doesn't even acknowledge the situation. No apology, no comp, no closure. I had to follow up and ask what was going on, only to be told that they're to to file it down at the end of the shift.Well that really doesn't help me now, does it?",Came here because I was in the area and the reviews sounded really great! I have to agree with them as the food and service was on point. The menu had a lot of options to choose from that all sounded delicious so it was hard to choose.This was for brunch on a Saturday and it was busy but in the early afternoon we didn't have to wait too long luckily!I got a Bellini to drink which was very good albeit on the pricey side. For food I had the very filling breakfast skillet with a side of biscuits. The skillet has potatoes and sausage mixed together with poached eggs and a cheese topping. It was so good! The biscuits were also yummy especially because they have nice herbs inside and came with a honey butter topping.I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the city and looking for a cute spot!,"Solid brunch here all around. Right off the bat the menu is very attractive with many good sounding choices which is a good start. Came on a Saturday afternoon for brunch and the wait wasn't too bad as there is a fair amount of seating, of course though if you choose to sit at the counter, you'll more than likely be seated right away.I had the Biscuits and gravy skillet and it delivered. Very filling coming out hot in an actual little skillet. The gravy had a nice spiced tasted to it, while the biscuits had a sort of sweet flavor. This was confirmed as out server who made adequate checks on the table also talked a bit about the food and made recommendations. The poached eggs are an egg-cellent touch. I had drunken lemonade, which was a nicely sour hard lemonade drink.Solid meal here, definitely recommend and would brunch here again or even consider for another meal of the day.","Came here for breakfast and it was DELICIOUS! Pancakes were amazing - fluffy, just sweet enough and the whipped butter was creamy and light. The special was avocado toast with smoked salmon and a poach egg - again DELICIOUS! Servers were more than attentive and friendly.The decor is super cute too!",Spoon Table & Bar
339,It's like Chinatown's very own Chelsea Market but smaller. Limited selection of food/vendors; Boba GuysBonsai KakigoriMission CevicheIpuddo Izakaya x SamuriceThere's a boutique shop right next door that is connected. Plenty of seating in the back of the building and island tables in the aisle across from the vendors.,"Came in to get a drink from Boba Guys. Tried the strawberry matcha latte. There are also a bunch of other stalls with different types of food, but not a lot of seating, more standing tables and countertops. If you go towards the back, there are some seats and small low tables. Would definitely come back to check out the other food options. There's also another side that has jewelry and clothing being sold.","This modern market is located on bustling Canal Street in Chinatown.  It has about a handful of food stalls with a connected side devoted to arts and crafts type stalls.  As for the food, the well known Nom Wah restaurant is here, as well as a place San Franciscans will know - the Boba Guys.  I tried the shaved ice from Kakigori.I haven't been very impressed with any of the food markets I've seen in Manhattan, but this one is distinct with its artsy half.  I certainly wouldn't make a special trip here though, unless there's a specific stall you want to visit.  For food, there are tons of Asian restaurants all over in surrounding Chinatown that I would choose any day over any of the food vendors I saw in this market.",So much going on here. Cute boutiques but definitely soho prices ($$$). You can find unique things from the shops and it's fun just to look at what they have. The food section has a great selection of different foods that are unique and all in one place. Take picky eaters here and everyone can be happy.,"My friend brought me here because he knew I was a sucker for chill vibes and good food. Canal Street Market definitely did not disappoint! Imagine a tiny Chelsea Market with predominantly Asian options ranging from a Korean-Mexican spot endearingly named Azumma to SF favorite Boba Guys. I had the ramen from Kuro-Obi, the fast-food version of Ippudo, and enjoyed it a lot. Of course, I had to swing by Boba Guys for my daily boba-fix afterwards. Do expect to pay higher prices compared to what you'd pay at other spots in Chinatown. After eating, I strolled around the shops in the adjacent hall. A bunch of cute trinkets and knickknacks that's pretty fun to look at, but with ridiculous price tags. I do appreciate the fact that there's a space for locals in the area to promote and sell their products.","Tons of options here, ranging from Chinese food to Boba to Pizza. There is shopping and food here, as you can see from all the pictures. Definitely an interesting addition to Chinatown overall.Coffee, boba, pizza, bao, and Chinese food. Can't go wrong.",Canal Street Market
340,"Incredible. Portions are ginormous, even the starters. One sandwich split in half is the size really is the size of two sandwiches elsewhere. Maison is top 5 (maybe top 3) on the UWS.","Sadly our bartender was not a regular, maybe filling in because our spicy margarita was sad. Place looked nyc upscale right. I will try again cause Jacobs Pickles sent us to their sister bar. ‍","Delicious Brunch experience. Super indulgent, fast and friendly service with loads of left overs! We tried their infamous challah French toast in the lumber jack stack, the challah croque madame, honey butter pull apart bread and a to-go funfetti 24 layer cake. Cant comment on drinks as we did just coffee, which was average but served unlimited. Only bummer but nothing out of the normal in nyc- is that they wont let you sit without your full party. Will deff visit again!","**HUGE PORTIONS!** My friend and I made reservations for brunch at Maison Pickle for noon on a Tuesday.  At this time, the restaurant was not crowded at all, so I would recommend this time if you want to enjoy your food in a calmer environment.  The restaurant ambiance goes with their concept of elevated comfort food.  My friend ordered the Bananas-n-Caramel challah french toast ($17), and I got the Fried Chicken-n-Toast challah french toast ($19).  When our orders came out, our eyes widened at the sheer massiveness of the portions.  If there is one thing to take away from the reviews, it's that the portions here are crazy large.  The amount of food you get justifies the pricing.  For someone with a medium-sized appetite, I would recommend sharing any of the french toast options.  The couple next to us got the three-course brunch and also thought the portioning on their food was large.  Regarding taste, I thought my friend's french toast was decent.  The banana is on the sweeter side leaning toward overly-sweet.  The toast is soft but needs syrup or has little to no flavor.  I was decently impressed by the fried chicken.  It was moist and the shredded bacon enhanced the delicious flavor of the skin.  While I think the price is worth the size, I would personally rather have a more reasonable portion that I could finish in one sitting for a cheaper price.For dessert, I wanted to try the 24-Layer Chocolate Cake ($14) after seeing it on Instagram.  This cake was a major disappointment.  The actual cake tasted like the cake inside a Baskin-Robbins ice cream cake.  Because it came out cold, it had a more solid consistency from being in the fridge.  The flavor of the cake was a very generic chocolate flavor that can be found from supermarket cupcakes.  It was not decadent, rich, or chocolaty.  The same critique goes for the frosting.  It had that artificial frosting flavor and did nothing to enhance the cake.  I was expecting  moist, rich, and soft layers of chocolate, but instead got a $14 supermarket chocolate cake with artificial chocolate frosting.  I wish I saved more of my stomach for finishing my french toast instead of this cake.The person who was helping us was also acting as the bartender so after we got our food, she rarely came to check back in on us.  Also, since Maison Pickle is on the pricier side, I think it's always worth asking customers what they thought of something if it's half eaten and they do not want to take it home (i.e. the cake).  In addition, I needed to go up to the host stand to request the check.  Overall, I was impressed with the fried chicken but otherwise, Maison Pickle left me expecting more from the dessert and service.","Just as delish as a year ago, although service was lacking this time around.For apps we had:- Buffalo mac and cheese (small size) sooo filling.- Caesar salad (delicious !!)For entrees:- Patty melt --it wasn't bad but it also was out of this world good- Chicken and french toast. So. Frickin.' Good.Dessert:Peanut butter and banana cheesecake. So decadent. Soooooo scrumptious.We couldn't finish anything and took almost all the above home with us. Though I stated it was my sister's bday and wanted a candle in her cake, it didn't come with a sparkler, which was super disappointing. I did request one and they quickly brought it out once more.",Everything here was phenomenal. The first dish I ordered I ended up sending back because it wasn't to my liking. But the next dish I ordered (can't remember the name) came out perfectly. That was the only slight bump in the road. The service was impeccable. Drinks were strong. And food was scrumptious,Maison Pickle
341,"Place states on yelp open until 2am, Took a uber here got here at 1:20am, just to tell me the kitchen is closed. Very disappointed need to get your hours updated. Paid a $9 uber thinking some seafood will be available for me.  This place needs to get updated","First time was good because they tried their best to do their best. 2nd n 3rd time was disappointed even thought we spent over $600 In 2 weeks. All crabs & clams were not fresh.

Overall: do not recommend this place but I do late night snack so what the hell. Get good ratings so that you guys can survive for late night",It's really just so so compared to what I had in BK's Chinatown. The seafood was definitely not fresh. And the taste is a little too salty for me. Disappointed... don't think I would recommend anyone to go.,"I can't believe I walked past this place so many times when it first opened, but didn't try it until this year. Come early or put yourself on the Yelp waitlist to avoid waiting too long. The longest I've waited was about 20-30 min.I have yet to try the crawfish boil, but the skewers are are bomb and come out so fast. You can't go wrong with any of their skewers, but my favorites are the intestines and chicken gizzard. They fry the intestines, so the skin is a bit crispy and the flavor is so intense. I usually get multiple skewers of just the intestines. Other solid choices are the lamb, pork belly, pork trotters, king oyster mushrooms, and squid tentacles. The beef tendon is a hit or miss. Once time I had it, it was really soft and delicious, but a different time it was hard and chewy. If you get the garlic eggplant, it'll be the most garlicky eggplant you'll ever eat. For larger dishes, I also tried their fried noodles and braised rice, what they called etouffee. Both were good and the etouffee actually tasted like a slightly Asian version of the Southern dish. I would still pass on their larger dishes and just go for the skewers. I'll definitely have to come back for the crawfish boil some other time.","We came to Le Sia for a lunch with some friends a couple months back. It's definitely got a bit more of a casual East Village vibe to it, with the table we sat at more like a picnic table with wooden benches to sit on. The service was fairly quick if unremarkable, and the drink options were on the more limited end, so I stuck with water. As for the food, it can make you break into a sweat like a Sichuan meal could, but the Cajun-oriented nature of the flavors are softer on the palate and make it easier to chow down without breaking into a sweat. Nonetheless, while some of the dishes are noteworthy - I enjoyed the seafood hot pot, which infused everything in it with a good amount of spiced flavors - I felt the overall technique and quality of both the seafood and the meats were merely average at best. I didn't get the sense we were getting as fresh seafood as one would if they were eating a seafood boil in New Orleans, so the texture ended up being a bit generic for the non-crab, non-lobster pieces of fish in the stew. The meat skewers were flavorful as well (and sprinkled with what seemed like very generous quantities of cumin), but the pieces were stringy, with some being just blobs of fat that you could spit out or choke down - basically the same quality of meat (or sometimes worse) that you could find at one of the street fairs in NYC that pop up from time to time.I wouldn't mind coming back to give it another go, but I didn't come away from the experience blown away and feeling that I had to make it back. It's a concept that I would view as toned-down Sichuan more than a restaurant that feels like it owes anything to what I would view as Louisianian cuisine. An interesting meal overall, but not one that particularly stands out among the myriad of other Chinese restaurants one can find in the city.","Casual Cajun Chinese food restaurant near Astor place with good customer service and a delicious menu. The decorations are fun and there are waiters who speak Cantonese and Mandarin. There are plenty of skewers and seafood options.Recommend:King crab legsGarlic oysterSquid feetGrilled lamb chopsTiger shrimp with pineapple (sweet, with a mayo)Spicy and sour cucumber in garlic sauceHarbin sausage (it's fatty)Garlic eggplantThere is also alcohol. Stella seems decently refreshing for the meal. There is also jambala rice, which tastes mostly like fried rice. In the washroom, there is mouthwash. Overall, a good place for a birthday dinner or hanging out with friends.",Le Sia
342,"A group of three stop by around 7 PM on Saturday, the wait was about an hour and 45 minutes. Roughly similar to what others on yelp have already suggested.The meat was superb, and not the cheap meats that you normally get elsewhere. I think that is one of the highlights of this place. There's also a specialty sauce bar includes sesame paste among other things.While the other three star reviews complained about the service. My visit did not have any of those, and my water was always filled every time I turned over. Someone was always asking for our next order even though we are working on the current one. The struggle was realll, especially towards the eighth and ninth round. Funny thing was that we got to the fifth round within 30 minutes thinking we have been there for an hour.Def will be back for more, especially when starving!",Came here with friends. Saw it was always busy and packed. Wanted to try so stopped by one weekend. It was not as good as I was expecting. The food is very similar to 99 flavor. First time here and that's enough for me.  If you want all you can eat hot pot and bbq come here to try. But don't expect anything amazing. It's just normal here,"In the depths of Little Italy you can find Hometown tucked away next to a plethora of enticing Chinatown pastries and boba shops, you stop by and see a hotpot place, so naturally you want to fill up before you stop by elsewhere!Sadly, it's a real shame though, because although Hometown has a great inner ambience and variety of options for you to dive right in to, the service is severely lacking and the the broths are not amazing in quality. The menu truly is extensive and I applaud them for that but we waited 12 minutes before actually having someone stop by to offer us a drink, on a slow day with only 2 other tables in house AND after asking the hostess. We ordered everything all at that time to ensure we would at least have a chance at eating before our ""server"" went M.I.A. I think that with more attentiveness this spot could really bring up it's ratings, especially with how much they really do have to offer.","Great modern AYCE hotpot place in Chinatown. TLDR: Had most hotpot staples, fast seating and good service on a Wednesday night. Broths err on herbal, don't expect too much spice. Maybe skip the cocktail dribks.My friend and I went there after waiting an hour for 99 Flavour Taste and being told that it was another hour estimate. We came in on a Wednesday during peak dinner time, but Hometown was mostly empty in the upstairs seating area, so we were seated immediately. I appreciated that we got to have a family style hotpot between the two of us and that we were able to choose up to 3 broths. We got the1. Plain Chicken: was super bland, didn't know what I expected 2. Chinese Herbal: potent and richly herbal! The medicinal taste came through way more than the broths I've had at other places and this was a highlight for me.3. Spicy Ma La: Was not as spicy as I had hoped and was definitely not anywhere near authentic Sichuan hotpot taste. It had a strong herbal taste behind the bite, but really had neither ma or la. Other hotpot places do it much better, but despite it being not what I expected, I really enjoyed it still.The service was attentive and it was fairly easy to flag down servers for more food. The meat portions were generous, though they served surprisingly small non meat portions compared to my expectations. They had most staple hotpot items, and the ingredients were really agreeable. In addition, we also got two drinks, a lychee cocktail and some blue one that tasted of pineapples. The drinks were sugary and not very strong, so I'd suggest skipping them!","I've been here several times with friends and family and I think this is one of the better spots in the city. Located on the side of a hotel in prime Little Italy, this spot is well positioned to attract folk from all over town. Quality of meat is decent. Seafood is fresh. However it does err on the skimpy side. Portions are small for certain things. Kinda annoying because then you are forced to constantly order the same thing. Getting the attention of the staff is a challenge most of the time. They're just not looking around and alert. Most of the time they're not very present. You literally have to flag them down. That said the restaurant is relatively clean compared to some other hot pot joints in the area and is fairly priced. I don't think they take reservations unless your are a large party so if you're a small group good luck waiting for a table.","This place is pretty solid for AYCE hotpot! (We didn't do the BBQ) You get your own single pot which I really like and the selection for meats, veggies, seafood and other random stuff is so extensive and they give you a good amount! I absolutely love how many sauces they have at the sauce bar - you can get one of those 3 dipper sauce plates and just experiment. I got the mala spicy pot and while I did enjoy the flavors (it wasn't too spicy), it was also very oily. After awhile, I was kind of deterred to keep eating because I felt like I was just dipping everything in oil, so if I come back, I'd prob opt for another soup base. They even offer chinese deserts right next to the sauce bar - a cold honeydew puree with sago or warm coconut milk with sweet potatoes. If you check in on yelp you can get free ice cream!If it's your birthday, you can eat for free if you come in a group of 6. Definitely worth it in my opinion! It's a huge restaurant so it can definitely accommodate even 10+ towards the backroom.",Hometown Hotpot & BBQ
343,Went to. Peaches for lunch. Brooklyn wings are delish! Add the shrimp po boy and catfish,"Sitting with a few colleagues, I read through the menu quickly as the continual conversation had questions directed towards me, so I decided quickly.I'm not sure what makes a chicken wing a Brooklyn wing not having enough menu nor waiter time to ask, but I know a bit about Alabama White sauce. Unfortunately it was served as a tiny dipping sauce on the side, I had thought it would have been prepared into the wings flavor. As it stood by itself, the flavor did not impress me, I did not get a hint of vinegar, horseradish, cayenne, mustard powder. I did however get the mayonnaise taste, but without the other ingredients whisked together, it was not anything special unfortunately.When I see grits, I'm a buyer and there is rare occasion that I'll stray. Oven Baked Grits oddly does not appear on the websites lunch nor dinner menu, but was on the passed menus. The quality of the slow cooked braised ribs was quite good, as were the additional cheeses  inside and on top.However, the  portion was small for the money and after the meal I was gnawing the chicken bones for the marrow, I was still hungry.Eight dollars for a twelve ounce imported pear cider hit my eves hard, but I tried it anyway and the served temperature hurt the taste.A employee conversation was going on jyst to my left about how one hit another then told him ""yo yo something something"", completely low in vocabulary, quite inappropriate and was detracting from my groups time together.","My friend has stopped into Peaches a few times for brunch and dragged me along today.Walked in to request a table for 4, said it was roughly a 25 minute wait. Turned out to be an hour... Hostess was clueless and allowed multiple parties to be seated before our group. 2 people here another 4 here....she said we were next on the list so needless to say I was more than frustrated. Not to mention she was also carrying plates of food and her hair was not tied back which made me nervous.Finally sat down around an hour later...Long story short there was a hair in my spinach dip appetizer, brought it to the manager and got it free.The shrimp Po boy was good but not great. Service was lacking all around. There are a million other places you can get great soul food with decent service. Take my advice and skip this place...","The first time I came here, I forgot what I ordered with my cousin and didn't care much for their food until my recent return.I recently returned when I was invited out for brunch by two friends. We were seated outside, which was fine because indoors was packed. I'm not a drinker but my friend ordered a pitcher of dusse and lemonade for all of us. I definitely enjoyed that mix lol. For my meal, I ordered the shrimp po boy with fries and a side of granola French toast. I enjoyed it all!!! It was delicious and very fulfilling. Now I understand why my cousin always raves about Peaches and I'm glad my second time there made a different impression. The only thing is that the service is slow, the food took a while to be brought out but it was worth the wait!","So this place has been around for a while and I never stopped into check it out until today. I decided toTry the blackened catfish witih grits. It came with onions and chopped tomatoes which mixed together with this fish tastes pretty good. However, I know grits and these grits I receive will not on point at all. It's a possibility I may have come across the grits in the afternoon which were not the best but grits should be  thicker than what was presented to me. Yeah I think the  chef's recipe  has to be tweaked on this one. The the decore of the place is nothing toobrag on. Just the typical tables and chairs plain wall nothing fancy. I must admit I did like the bathroom sink although it has a leak in the faucet I like the small sink and the turn handle. I guess I will have to try another dish and I will let you guys know what I think about it I saw some one with salmon maybe that will be the next dish I try and if that doesn't hit the spot then as per my opinion this place maybe a little overrated and possibly for no reason other than a black person doesn't own it.","Very cute brunch option if you're in the Bedstuy/downtown BK area. I've now been twice(for brunch only) but both experiences were great. The wait was about 20 minutes for a table of 4 on Sunday at around 12, which was great!Definitely gives you chill neighborhood vibes and if weather permits, there is an outdoor eating option. The food is definitely southern inspired and very tasty. I had the salmon hash & farmers breakfast(on different visits, you only need to order one because the portions are decent!). Everything tasted good! The cheddar grits were great & I'm usually picky about grits. The service was excellent, even with how crowded the restaurant was.Would 100% recommend this to anyone.",Peaches
344,"I ordered 3 jumbo lump crab cakes for $24.95 through Seamless. I received my order with only 2 crab cakes, that were burnt and also NOT jumbo lump crab meat. I called the restaurant immediately, 2x, to only a recorded message. There is no way they should be charging $25 on their best day for their lackluster burnt af crab cakes. The flavor isn't even good. I will never order from this restaurant again. Trash crab cakes and trash service",Ouuuu they pissed me off last time. I drove from Clinton hills to Harlem for bland salmon and my food was cold. The buffalo wings were cold. I had nightmares after i left here. The date was a nightmare and so was my food. I rave about this place and it was an epic fail. I shouldn't have to use hot sauce on grilled salmon.,"Wanted to love my meal but it was okay...  Customer service was excellent! I love this area of Harlem. I will return for another meal option. I was expecting more flavor. I know folks who live and die by this place.i ordered th e smothered chicken because they had no smothered pork chops . Mac and cheese, greens and potato salad","I was in New York for the weekend, and we wanted chicken!! Im an avid fan of the food network and one day I saw Melbas. Friends have told me how good this place was and the Fn  confirmed it.We went in one late Saturday afternoon on an empty stomach.  Trust me, this is a prerequisite to come here!!We had a friendly waitress.. Place is definitely cozy for a date night.  I had chicken, mac.n cheese and greens.  Lemme tell you, I very picky when it comes to mac, and greens and this place gets my stamp of approval.  Mac and cheese tastes homemade and definitely no hints that it came from the box.  Greens were good but a little to overcooked. Chicken was love! Hot flavorful and  fresh.My friend had chicken, and waffles. Tasty tasty!!!  Next trip: well their brunch and ribs!!This place is definitely a must!!","Great staff and communal feeling in this place.First I was a bit flabbergasted that every 10mins there is a unison of Stevie Wonder Happy Birthday song (I did hear that Black neighborhoods seldom sing the usual ""white"" happy birthday song, and the rumor was true)  being chanted in the entire restaurants, but after 2or 3 iterations I became one in that happy chorus.Very good food all throughoutWhen it comes down to each food item(Fried chicken, waffle, candied yams, collard greens, short ribs) I might have had better food in few different places but what's impressive is that while other places have stronger specialty in certain dishes, Melba's were much-above average and good in pretty much every 10+ dishes I tried.","Found out about this place thanks to infatuation! We came here on Saturday for brunch -- at around 1:30 (they close at 2pm) and the place wasn't too packed which was nice! I'd say for brunch you have to get anything with chicken. If you get something else you are missing out/not worth getting. I got the chicken and egg nog waffles and man it was so so good! Best chicken and waffles i've ever had! I recommend getting the dark meat chicken (more juicy) only thing i was sad about was that there wasn't a good chicken to waffle ratio, a lot more waffle than chicken. Service here was great 10/10 our waitress was very personable!",Melba's
345,"Always excited to try a new ramen shop in Long Island City, I visited Mu Ramen after reading about the NYTimes article and subsequent popup closing, reopening and relocation.A one-star review may seem harsh, but I feel it's necessary to reflect my frustration with the restaurant. Considering that the place is called 'Mu Ramen,' I deemed it most appropriate to try its ramen, though they seem to be popular for their $19 burger (because having an overpriced burger somehow instantaneously makes restaurants relevant these days). The spicy miso ramen's pork-based broth was entirely undetectable, but not so much as was the flavor of miso. While it was sufficiently spicy, the flavor of a tonkotsu broth was entirely absent, as was even the umami bomb offered by so many superior ramen joints in the area.Upon receiving the bill for my $19 bowl of spicy miso ramen, for which I did not request any add-ons or toppings, I was charged an additional $2.50 for the egg. This brought the total to $21.50 before tax and tip. Before I knew it, I had just paid $25 for a bowl of mediocre ramen, and to top it all off - they don't take card! I was hastily pointed to an ATM in the corner of the restaurant to cover this straight-up exorbitant bill.Save yourself the money and trouble - opt for a comparably flavorful meal at the deli/grocery next door. They sell Nongshim microwave ramen for $1.50.","Hard to recognize. It has a red lantern out front and a Japanese character on the door.Surprisingly popular around 9p on a Tuesday. We didn't have reservations, but were able to be seated at the bar.Honestly, I'd go back for the U&I appetizer alone! It was warm and flavorful and the ingredients complemented one another so well! Warning: maybe the most expensive thing on the menu (MP).Other than that:(I forget what this was called on the menu) fried chicken leg - D (too salty and greasy, not worth $8)Tonkotsu ramen - A- (Pork was thick and juicy; egg was just slightly more raw than normal, which I didn't enjoy)PS this place is CASH ONLY! But they have an atm machine inside. Also the menu seems to change up quite often.",The ramen here is delicious but the service seem to get worse with every visit. This time the server was rushing us out. Can I at least finish eating the food that I paid for. Service is trash.,"Cute restaurant in LIC. Although expensive, the U&I listed as MP was about $30 when we went, was absolutely delicious! The flavors blended so well together that it's an explosion in your mouth. No joke. Mussels were also a delight! Their ramen is definitely interesting since I am not use to udon like noodles for ramen. This was their choice of noodle in the spicy miso ramen. I had the tonkotsu ramen which had the regular ramen noodle. Both were good however the size is definitely on the smaller end. To this day, I think I still prefer the ramen at Mitsuwa.PSA: Cash Only!","Tonight was my last night of a 2800 mile culinary road trip, and being in NYC I need to cross off Mu Ramen on the ramen list! I got sucked into this location with its eclectic and at times over the top menu choices such as fois gras stuffed chicken wings, uni dish and wagyu beef hand rolls.We were a four top which allowed a wide range of dishes at the table.I asked not to be rushed and specifically requested that our waitress hold off firing our mains until we had finished all of our apps ( we had many in front of us ) which she agreed to do and and made a point of telling us that it was not a problem! I should of simply ordered our apps to insure we would not be bombarded with 12 covers at the table but that just what happened and it really was infuriating.The dishes were the savior of the meal: our U & I uni dish was delicate fresh and brine and paired well with the roe it came with, our OKONOMIYAKI scallion pancake was a riff on blinis and caviar in its presentation but the flavor profile was subtle and flavorful, our dry aged wagyu ribeye hand rolls were deconstructed in presentation and the tartare missed the mark in flavor and texture, and finally our stuffed chicken wings stuffed with fois gras and brioche, well this one was my biggest disappointment as one could easily say it had more brioche then fois. The fry batter was pedestrian at best no color or seasoning! The wings were cooked perfectly tender. They were large full wings but we were hard pressed to find the fois which appeared to be sparingly placed under the skin rather than truly stuffed. They could of done a better job on those. They sounded grand but I would hold on to your $ on that one.   Our 3 ramens broths ( Tonkotsu, 2 spicy miso ) were on point. Each bowl was creamy, had depth of flavor and was presented well, I was taken a back to see that udon noodles were used in the spicy miso and soba were used in the Tonkotsu?? Since no description was made on the menu, I would've like to have known that!CONCLUSION:Location was easy to find, reservations secured a good table, very small venue, noise level was moderate, staff was fair at best. Food was fair to good at times. One visit was enough after getting sucked into the hype.","I ordered the duck broth ramen and it was alright. The soup was a bit salty but wasn't anything special. The foie gras chicken wings were good though.For the quality of food, I don't think it was worth the wait. The place is so small, and everyone's squished together on large tables. You can get better ramen elsewhere.",Mu Ramen
346,"I don't understand the hype about this place. we ordered the soy garlic and the spicy wings, both were bland. The soy garlic had no taste and the spicy ones tasted like ketchup. The cheesy corn pancake was just ok. Also tried some dumplings and they're deep fried - probably previously frozen. :( the only thing i didn't mind was the complimentary egg in the stone bowl","First off, I would return to Bangia just for the kpop music videos playing non stop. They were playing some throwbacks from like 2008!! Back when I got into kpop, it was a litttle nostalgic for me. I liked the vibe of Bangia and the drinks were decent--I ordered a Lychee Martini which was good. I would come back and order that again + try other drinks. As for food this is where things fell short. We ordered the seafood pancake and boneless chicken wings--half sweet & spicy half soy garlic. The seafood pancake was made with little effort. Kind of soggy ..? No crispness too it. As if it had been reheated although it wasn't. It was kind of strange tbh, probably the worst tasting pajeon I've had. Chicken texture was good for boneless but the flavor was kind of weird. I'll come back for drinks and I'm willing to try other menu options but do not recommend the pancake or the chicken.","A few friends and I came to Bangia right at opening on a Friday night and ordered the grilled pork belly, spicy pork belly & fried rice in stone pot, and the soy garlic wings. The food wasn't the best; the wings were dry and the fried rice was one of the saltiest things I've ever tasted. The service, as well, wasn't the best. We had to wait 10 minutes at the hostess stand (this was after opening time) before someone would come and seat us. Even after we were seated, we still had to wait another 10-15 minutes just to get water. We thought this was a bit strange considering we were the only party there at the time. However, the real problem occurred after we left the restaurant. I paid for the bill using my card and the total (after writing in tip) came out to $69 for three people. A few days later, upon logging into my banking app, I was shocked to see that Bangia had charged me $971.88 for the meal, $902.88 MORE than the $69 total that I had indicated on the receipt. I always make an effort to make the tip and total very clear when filling out the receipts: the ""cent"" numbers are always written smaller and underlined, so there should be no room for confusion, let alone room for an extra $902.88 charge. That evening we contacted the restaurant and spoke with the manager, who said that he knew that he had made a mistake, but was ""waiting for us to contact him"", before fixing his mistake and issuing a refund. What if I never noticed, and as a result, never contacted him? Was he planning on just keeping the extra $900, even if he KNEW that a mistake had occurred? Interestingly, a quick search (there's another review here on Yelp) shows that other customers ALSO had issues with being charged extra tip. Hmm.I don't recommend this restaurant at all-- there's no point in risking an extra $900 charge on your card to eat mediocre food and receive mediocre service. There are a ton of better options in Koreatown.","Came here with my girlfriend to try the army stew and the spicy seafood cheese tteokbokki. I am lactose intolerant so was afraid of all the cheese, but I had to try it. My first reaction was wow the cheese works well with the sauce. It was worth the pain later on haha. I would definitely recommend this. I give this dish a 4.5/5.The army stew was being heated in front of us. I think the spiciness of the broth took over all the flavors making everything just spicy. It had a lot of ingredients. They also put cheese in this. I give this dish a 3/5.Overall experience was good. The portions they give is huge. I would say 3-4 servings each dish. Would come again to try other dishes.","I made random friends with a Korean man outside a karaoke bar while showing a friend from out of town around and we all ended up having dinner together here based off of his recommendation. I never would have known about this place otherwise and I'm so happy I got to experience this meal! He started us off with something I can't seem to find on their menu, a piping hot bowl of boiled egg with scallions. All the eggs are liquefied together but still hold a solid form, like they've been softly scrambled and then kept stable enough to be like an egg porridge. Definitely get this, it's magic. The Spicy Squid and Pork Belly arrives on a sizzling platter with onions, peppers, and cabbage. Not overbearingly spicy, but it does pack a punch. The protein could have been more tender, I love a pork belly that's really fatty and melts in your mouth, but it was far from being tough. I would happily order this again.The sauce from that also went really well with their fried dumplings, which were great on their own too. The dough looks thicker than it is, it's actually just right and they don't over fry them. The Spicy Cheese Tteokbokki was not something I was particularly eager to try and it turned out to be my favorite dish of the night! It's made up of rice cakes and seafood in a spicy sauce, all baked over with mozzarella. It's extremely filling and hearty, it's also massive in size can can be shared between 3-4 people. The rice cakes soak up the sauce so well and go great with the gooey cheese. The seafood includes shrimp, mussels, and squid. There's an even a boiled egg in there! I want this again right now. Our new friend also recommended The Clam Soup and Hangover Ramen which I'm definitely going to try next time I visit.","Bangia is a great place to catch up with friends over fried chicken wings and soju cocktail. The food is served family style. My go-to dishes are budae jjigae (army stew), spicy cheese tteokbokki, corn cheese pancake, and soy garlic wings. Food is delicious, packed with flavor, and very filling. Prices are consistent with what you'll find at nearby restaurants. Happy hour is Sunday - Thursday from 5pm - 7pm. It gets crowded and wait times can go upwards to an hour so make a reservation beforehand. There are rooms off the main area that can host parties of 8. It gets loud and lively here. Service is great.",Bangia
347,Got 3 pastas and 2 of them were room temperature.Occasionally we'd get a somewhat warm bite.Expected more not for the price.Not to mention all of the buzz.Interesting wine selection and good location. But disappointing overall when you pay that much and get barely lukewarm pastas.,DAMN GINA! Only reso my NY-based bestie could snag was an 11:30 on a Friday. We all skipped breakfast so we could HOUSE pasta...And boy did we house some carbs my friends. Everything was phenomenal and we were rolled out of the restaurant. We got all of the Yelp-recommended items plus the seasonal roasted tomatoes with warm honey. Eat that with your ricotta bread. FECK ITS GOOOOOD.,Interior and pricepoint very misleading and food not really worth the wait and all that. BUT i will say the desserts are phenomenal and the two stars are PURELY for the dessert.,"For 2 people, get 3 pastas. you wont be disappointed, but you will be full. Just so much to try.Classic = Fettuccine with buffalo butterPockets of Sunshine = Sheep's Milk Ricotta filled OcchiMy Favorite = Spinach and Mascarpone filled tortelliGo.","Food: 5/5   Price: 4/5  Service 5/5  Ambiance: 5/5  Bang for your buck: 4/5 Recommendations: You have to get the whipped ricotta crostini. No question. Would I come back?: YES!!! Tips: Put your name down on the waitlist and enjoy the Brooklyn farm across the street as you wait. Review: This place was amazing. One of the best pasta places I've ever been too. The ambiance was perfect for a date or a group outing. There seems to be the right amount of seats at both the bar and table. The people saying that the pasta dishes are too small have not had handmade pasta before at a restaurant. The well-priced pasta dishes was just enough to satisfy you. We had three people and got two appetizers and our pasta dishes, which was the right amount of food. The whipped ricotta with the crostini with the marinated shishito peppers was well balanced, while the mushroom antipasti with lemon gave an umami bomb to the meal. You really can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes, but the one I liked the most was Spinach and Mascarpone.","Came here at 5:00 right when it opened on a Sunday. We were able to get in immediately without a reservation. It was two of us and we were seated at the bar top. We started with the artichokes to share - was just okay in my opinion. Then we got the tortelli which was melt in your mouth amazing. Must try! Also got the linguine which was really tasty but a little less unique. Finally ended with the strawberry shortcake gelato, which was enjoyable and definitely a large enough portion to share. Overall definitely a tasty meal but probably a bit overrated for how difficult it is to get a reservation. Also pretty pricey for the portion sizes. The atmosphere is crisp, clean, and bright.",Misi
348,"If you're on your way here - go to plan b. Never tried the food until now - ordered for delivery.Burger was absolutely horrendous and not edible. Hard and stuffed with large pieces of onions inside the meat. It was weird The Mac and cheese was bland but had a nicely-flavored bread crumb topping. This too also had large pieces of onions in it. Large UNCOOKED onions in the Mac and cheese. Someone was lazy today....I love onions but if I wanted the amount of onions provided, I would've ordered a French onion soup.This place is not for me. Two stars because food was delivered on time.","If you order take out from here, use Seamless only. Their delivery service is solely bike messengers, and the food will always arrive late and cold.","Yum. Came here for brunch and had a hearty, homey meal. I ordered the meatloaf benny, which I thought was a creative comfort-food take on eggs benedict. The parmesan home fries were delish. My brunch date had the chicken schnitzel and waffle and thought it was alright, but not better than regular chicken and waffles, I think. As far as vibe, this place has a very casual feel and is not overly cozy. Next time I'd order takeout or delivery :).","The food: The chicken in the chicken schnitzel sandwich is juicy, flavorful and crispy. They really made it with love. The bread was crispy and buttered. The portions are very fair for the prices. The tahini dressing is house made you will definitely want extra. The salad portions are huge considering the price. The fries taste great on their own without ketchup and light yet crispy and tender on the inside. The service: All of the workers are happy to see you. If you dine in the bring your food to your table. They are all extremely helpful, patient and kind. The ambiance: Very homely, flowers are on the table in old coca cola bottles. Has a hole in the wall gem kind of feel. The art painted on the walls is a nice touch as well. Bathroom is clean and nicely decorated. The music selection: I thoroughly enjoyed the playlist. Its chill yet funky. Really matches the place well. Definitely would recommend. 5 stars :)","Hearty and healthy meals here at the Brooklyn Tree! Came here on a Saturday afternoon at 5pm right before an event. Came in a group of 6, and the restaurant was pretty full. I ordered the meatloaf with two sides ($15), and had a spinach and quinoa salad and french fries as my side. I also got a Moscow Mule ($9) to pair with my meal.Food was great! Meatloaf was baked fresh, portions were big! Meatloaf was seasoned very well, and I really liked their french fries. They were light, airy, crispy, and seasoned really well. The quinoa spinach salad was also a surprise hit. It was slightly citrusy and acidic, has a slight hint of sweetness. Pairs very well with the meatloaf and the fries!Moscow mule was also made really well. I was afraid they would water it down here since it doesn't seem to be a full on bar, but that was a surprising hit and was a great drink to pair with this hot summer day. Lowkey, non-pretentious, good portion sizes, and great prices. BK Tree defines hearty, healthy, and high quality affordable food.","People need to RELAX on drinking so much haterade. Brooklyn Tree is not bad at all so I'm extremely surprised to see two star reviews in here, especially ones that seem like they've only eaten here once. I usually always have to eat at a place AT LEAST 3 times before adding a Yelp review (unless I'm just visiting). I've never actually dined here, I usually just order takeout & by the time I come back home, yes the food has already gotten cold, but it still tastes delicious -- which obviously is a sign that the food is good, even when it's cold!Their grass-fed burger is SOOO on point. It's so on point they were like, ""Screw the toppings! It's all about the cow, baby!"" Ok, they didn't actually say that when creating this burger, but that's what I imagined.Bold move if you ask me, to not to add your traditional onions, tomatoes & greens, or any toppings matter of fact. But also smart because you can tell they wanted to highlight the quality of the beef & let me tell you...GRASS-FED makes a HUGE difference in quality. I usually come for their burger, but I've definitely had their chicken cutlet & mac & cheese. Their chicken cutlet is nothing extraordinary & I will agree with some of the other reviews that their mac & cheese has way too many (thick) onions in it, but it's definitely not enough for me to give them a 2-star review.  Come on people!Their healthy options are quite tasty (haven't tried their veggie burgers though) like their kale & quinoa salad & their sugar snap pea slaw, which is soo delicious & refreshing. Next time I think I'll dine in so I can get some pictures!",The Brooklyn Tree
349,"Service HORRIBLEWaited an hour for the main dishes to come out after the appetizer. The other tables were being served properly. There were many waiters with bearable amount of people in the restaurant. Some tables weren't even occupied and still, the serving took forever, resulting a bad conditioned pasta. The food weren't even good. Pasta tasted like a university cafeteria pasta. The waiters even dropped a box of forks on one of our member. It was supposed to be a perfect birthday party but SO DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SERVICE. I could see the waiters trying to make up by giving chefs specialty small dish out for free and the birthday deserts but what's the use of giving out some unordered dish when the main dishes aren't coming out and after ruining the birthday? NEVER WILL VISIT AGAIN.","I use to be a huge Scarpetta fan when they were at their previous location. My coworkers and I came for dinner to take advantage of restaurant week. We ordered our usuals; the creamy polenta, the spaghetti and the olive oil cake for dessert. For some reason everything besides the polenta did not taste the same. The spaghetti, which is usually bursting with flavor, now tasted bland and watered down. The olive oil cake, which is usually moist, is now comparable to cornbread. Although the food was disappointing, what hasn't changed is the amazing service and overall beauty of Scarpetta. The old location was very nice but this new location is much bigger (although the bar space was extremely crowded) and even more exquisite. Our waiter was also very accommodating and extremely apologetic about our disappointing experience.","This places deserves 1 star but I may round up to 2 stars because my server seemed nice but was definitely overworked as he was the only one in the entire front section, ridiculous  imoThe maitre d was not the same but I did see him later, the guy with the glasses was terrible & didn't understand a  simple request of giving a table in the main dining room even though I requested one after having been placed in a table with a draft of air coming on to me. Odd music and loud ambience of the front room were a big turn offNo vegetarian menu like they used to have? No vegetarian focacio? All three breads were equally bad 0/5The prices are higher and the quality is not as good as it used to be My creamy polenta was not hot but I was too irritated to send it back, I guy asked me two times if I was done? I guess they don't understand silverware etiquette 1/5the time between when they cleared my first course and the arrival of the second course was long (20 minutes minimum)The spagetti tasted great and was the best part of the meal 3/520 minutes after waiting for desert the waiter comes with the check?  Wfh I said I'm take a chocolate cake to go and booom the check came without a cake or on an apology, it was a waste of time and the irritation was priceless People were randomly bring seated, getting up and leaving or moving around and there were too many hotel staff loitering around without paying attention to patrons New York has plenty of great restaurants so I don't need to visit this hotmess & maybe that's why Scott Conant the founder is no longer affiliated with this place!!!","This review is way overdue. We've been going to Scarpetta for years. I've been to the one in Montauk and Philly, but the Meatpacking now Madison location is by far the best - it's close to our apt too.   I highly recommend having dinner at the bar -- the service is much better (while the dining room is beautiful, it takes forever to get your server's attention).  The bartenders are outstanding -- attentive, personable and, extremely knowledgeable. My favorites are the yellowtail sashimi, spaghetti and the espresso budino.  Also don't skip out on the bread - it's homemade stromboli, and it's delicious. This place always delivers - great ambiance, incredible food and wine, and excellent service. I love Scarpetta.","Solid lunch at Scarpetta. Lunch prices are pretty good for being such a nice restaurant, with a $32 prix fixe. The meal starts with a fantastic bread bowl that includes a soppressata Stromboli that is heaven in your mouth. We followed it up with a straciatella, which was delicious and came with peach and fig. For my prix fixe, I got the beet salad because I'm clearly a very healthy eater and it was very good plus it had goat cheese so hello. Next I had the grilled branzino and it was absolutely delicious. Lastly came the biscottis and caffe - I don't drink coffee so I dipped mine in a blood orange chamomile and those biscottis were so good and not overpowering. My client had the raw yellowtail as an app and I tried some and it was soooo good. Great service, excellent place for a client lunch and I'd love to go back for dinner.","I had a lovely time at this beautiful place . The food was outstanding and Claudio and Bledar are amazing servers . Very accommodating. The ambiance is amazing and I will definitely be back.Second time back and it's even better and I'm at the bar and the bartenders are outstanding. A rude women was yelling at them and Elio handled the situation like a boss!!! Of course Brad was very nice and attentive, but Elio was the star of the show. Also a server was very gracious and found me a seat because I was standing and my feet hurt at the bar .. service is amazing",Scarpetta
350,"One star for excellent service and one star for the perfectly al dente pasta. Everything else about this place falls flat. A friend and I did the pasta tasting and the actual pasta is great, but there are very strange flavors going on in the sauces. Also, the cherry blossom tiramisu tasted AWFUL. Nearly inedible. I don't know what is going on at this restaurant. It is almost as if they are just trying to be different and inventive without actually caring about the taste of their food. I will not be back.","Momofuku Nishi:What we order:Campanelle - jonah crab, old bay Smoked Brisket Hash - salsa verde, sunnyside Tin of sardines","I came to Momofuku Nishi to try their famous bucatini, but to my disappointment, the portion was really really small. It tasted good, but not amazing. Compared to the other Momofuku restaurants, I would go elsewhere, especially with Bāng Bar taking over the Time Warner Center (huge fan of Bāng Bar).My review of Momofuku Nishi was salvaged by the pork chop sandwich. It was amazing!!! I'm surprised Momofuku Nishi isn't more well known for the pork chop sandwich. Maybe it is and I'm just ignorant? But if you come, you have to order it! The meat was cooked perfectly and the jus that it comes with adds so much flavor.","Wow. Honestly, I never believed in the Momofuku hype but let me tell you... it is real! Wow wow wow. Slap me and call me Suzy! I came here with a friend and we made reservations the day of. We were able to secure the bar seats and was quickly brought to our area once we arrived. The bartender was very attentive and made sure our waters were always filled. We ordered the endives and some other appetizer that I forgot but holy cow the endives were extremely delicious. I still have dreams about it even though it's been over 2 months. Anyways I forgot what pasta dish I got but was able to order it with an egg. My friend got some other pasta dish that I don't remember but was good. When my pasta dish came out I thought that it was pretty small but ended up being a good sized portion. Overall I was blown away by all the food and really impressed with everything. I'll definitely need to come back again and try their other dishes!","This venue is classier and more refined than the casual Momofuku outlets (ramen bar, ssam bar) that I've been to downtown. While it's focused on pasta with a faint Asian flair, you'll find a modern, sleek interior, a thumpingly upbeat soundtrack, and joyfully upbeat service from Erica at the bar. Note that unless you're in line at opening for a potential bar seat, you'll most likely need reservations for a table. I opted for the $68 tasting menu, which looked a bit pricey at first, especially as the first few courses were rather petite. But each dish was packed with unique flavors, and by the end of the meal, I was sufficiently stuffed. To start, the English pea agnolotti was a surprisingly sweet and filling dish, despite its small size, thanks to the natural pea flavors that were evident in the pasta as well as the presence of a mint oil. Next, the bucatini was prepared with a nicely firm texture and had a sharp flavor reminiscent of rosemary or capers.Two savory courses followed. Like the ones before, the tortellini with mushroom and wakame packed an outsized, filling punch relative to its small size - as did the orecchiette, thanks to a strong tomato sauce. The desserts were also full of flavor, whether a dense blueberry sorbet whose strong, sharp, fruity notes were juxtaposed interestingly against a lemon verbena sauce. Finally, a cherry blossom tiramisu provided a grounding denouement to a most satisfying meal.Despite the not-so-small price tag for the small portions, I felt that the food, quality, and overall experience was definitely worth 5 Yelp stars. This might not be for everyone, but if you're willing to tickle your taste buds with some provocative flavors, then Momofuku Nishi is a great choice.","I'm so happy to have finally tried Momofuku Nishi! While it didn't blow my mind, the food was very tasty, and the service was great!So I came in on a Wednesday evening, around 5:30p. The place was empty, which means that I got A+ service. Everybody was very attentive and that was really nice.For food, I got the hiramasa (yellowtail amberjack) appetizer and the tagliatelle (like an Asian interpretation of a classic bolognese). The hiramasa was simply divine. The fish was soooo tasty and didn't taste super stale (I'm used to Texas sashimi). The lemon, green chili, and salt complemented the fish PERFECTLY. Seriously, the fish alone gets 5 stars and it was so refreshing. The tagliatelle was a little disappointing. It was recommended to be by the waitress (she said it was her favorite) but the flavor was far from unique. It tasted very yummy to be sure, and was homey -- reminded me of a hot home cooked meal, but with tagliatelle instead of Asian noodles. The portion sizes weren't bad, but this isn't a place you come to stuff your face.Over all, I would come back again, but would probably try a different pasta. The bolognese sauce is basically just pork and chive dumpling filling, plus tomato and Chinese douchi. It was very good, but I think I would rather try something more unique, like the cheese-less chickpea cacio e pepe. I also want them to put their uni pasta back on the menu (waitress said they might sometime in the future so don't despair just yet).",Momofuku Nishi
351,"I came here for drinks after work on a Wednesday. My friend got there by 5ish and I got there by 5:40- One thing I loved about this spot was the space! So much seating at the bar, and it's not obnoxiously loud. It's a mature spot - lots of corporate employees enjoying drinks or dinner after work. With that being said, I had high expectations for the drinks, especially at $15 a drink. They are handcrafted and it's NYC so $15 is average for a drink, but since they're handcrafted, I expected more unique flavors and mind-blowing drinks. (drinks are pictured with names) Drink names and quick descriptions, with my personal rating here: Pale Princess: Gin Grapefruit drink (7.5)De Profundis: Vodka shrub drink (9)Harlot House: spicy agave drink (5/10)Lady Speranza: white rum hibiscus drink (8.5)Writers Block : cucumber vodka drink (8.5)Autumns Purple: gin-plum egg white drink (requested lavender) (7.5) If I was to go back, I'd order De profundities and writers block. The goblet drinks seemed appealing too. Just come here and order something you know you'd like, otherwise you won't have the best experience.","Went with a friend to Saturday Tea. Very disappointed in lackluster service. The young girl looked bored and clueless; the young guy was amiable but stressed out. The food took almost 30 minutes to arrive. It was very tasty once it came. IMO, this place suffers from a staff without panache and from an identity crisis. Much effort, money, and time were spent on creating an elegant atmosphere. But for some reason the management doesn't want to call this a gay establishment despite the fact it's named after a gay icon.","So sad to give this place anything but a great review, because it's such an Oscar Wilde wonderland. Also, everyone I know who has been here has given me great reviews. However, the food really disappointed me at brunch today. My steak and eggs was not a dish anyone should charge money for. The steak was dry and hard. You had to chew each piece for a long time and then you'd feel it scratching down your throat. It was inedible, so we didn't eat it. Such a shame. Steak and eggs is an easy dish to pull off. Also my bread was so burnt that I couldn't eat it either. I asked for the grilled ciabatta but they gave me burnt wonder bread and charged $4 for it. Sad stuff.","Good food, good drinks & great ambiance! Oscar Wilde is a fun place to check out when you're in the city. The ambiance is crazy fancy with some really gaudy decor that makes for a good time. Our waiter was excellent and offered recommendations on various food and drink items. I made my decision solely on his recommendations and they didn't disappoint (Fusilli Pasta & a Gin cocktail)!","One of the coolest bars I've been to in a while. The decor is super eclectic, fancy, chill- all at the same time. Even the restrooms are very cool. Was so awed by the place that I forgot to take a picture :P. Will update my review with a nice picture the next time I go there. It was super crowded even on a Wednesday evening so try and go early and find a spot by the bar. The smoky old fashioned is one of the best ones I've had till date and it's not even that expensive. I think it cost me 15 bucks. The place is super loud but I guess that is every New York City bar. Would definitely go back here and recommend it!","We came in for my friend's birthday last night and had such a blast.  The interior is not only eloquent and incredible, but the place is HUGE with multiple bars throughout.  The host is so accommodating and makes sure that all of the bar guests can find a bar stool.  We were a party of 5 and he made sure to get us 5 stools together without any wait.Luis, the restaurant manager, was so accommodating and bought us a round of shots because we ""were the most fun group in the bar.""  The bartender was also so sweet and attentive.I am 100% coming back here.  All the time.  I might even move in.",Oscar Wilde
352,"Smoked salmon from heaven.  Yes there is a god, i'm going to going to church, i don't care which one.  Go here, and that other LES establishment a few blocks north, but this one first.","Food can't be beat! Best smoked salmon, herring, latkes, kugel in the city. Our waitress was very friendly and didn't rush us. The layout of the cafe is a bit odd and the wait is ridiculous. They had several empty seats the entire time we waited. They know it is an extremely popular place so not sure why they don't either keep it fully staffed or have the waitlist better organized. Seems sloppy and unprofessional. I recommend getting take-out from the Russ & Daughter store instead","Poor service, my server to kick my bag under the table and then spilt my juice as it was put down. If that was a 'fine' establishment a new one should have swiftly followed with cleaning of the spill. Neither happened. Food was ok, but I was so put off by the antics of the server that the meal was ruined from that point for me.","This was a must when I was planning my trip to NYC. I love bagels and smoked salmon so I had to stop by this place. There was no wait when my friend and I arrived and got seated right away. It didn't take long for us to decide what to order. Food:-Classic board (Gaspe Smoked Nova Salmon, cream cheese, tomato, onion and capers). The smoked salmon was so yummy!! I love how they put the ingredients on the board and we got to assemble our own bagel. Such a fun experience!-Whitefish Croquettes (smoked whitefish, potato w/ tartar sauce). Everyone needs to try these because they are amazing! They're crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. The tartar sauce gave a nice balance and added the perfect touch to this dish!I wish they had this back in CA, craving for this as I type.","Food: 5/5   Price: 3/5  Service 3.5/5 Ambiance: 5/5  Bang for your buck: 3/5 Recommendations: If you want to splurge, you have to get the latkas. Would I come back?: Yes! Tips: Get there early to get a table or put your name down. On a first date? Get a seat at the bar to sit next to your date and have a more intimate talk. Review: Russ & Daughters is probably one of my favorite bagel shops, so I was very excited to get a chance to go to the cafe finally. We made a mistake on going on Memorial Day, which made the cafe packed and chaotic. Since it was closing at 3 (make sure to check for holiday times), there was a waitlist and wait for an hour for two people. They continued to take names and phone numbers until 2, where they would rudely turn people away. Once we were alerted for our table, it was another 15-minute wait until we were finally seated. However, once we were sitting, it was a fantastic experience. The cafe has a modern diner feel, with waiters wearing stylish white coats. The menu had a range of items to enjoy from challah toast to eggs benedict. However, the classic is a build your lox plate with your choice of bagel. FYI, your menu also serves as a food mat, which makes it all the better. The bagel was amazing as a Russ & Daughter's bagel should be and the option to make your lox bagel the way you want it was delicious.","I've been a frequent visitor for Russ & Daughters for 3 years and never been to this cafe. It's really popular!!Came here on Tuesday around 11am, the wait for 2 was about 15-25 min, which was not too bad for us. We ordered eggs benny, chopped liver & lower sunny side. The chopped liver was fresh, and the amount was pretty good in terms of the price. (We didn't finish the liver with all the crackers) highly recommended if you are fan for this.The eggs benny & lower sunny side are classics for brunch, the eggs were cooked just the way we like, and the lox were so fresh.",Russ & Daughters Cafe
353,"I was pretty excited to come here with my friend and his wife who is originally from Sichuan. I arrived at 11:50 to get us a table but because they didn't arrive until 12:10, we had to wait until 12:40 for the first round of patrons to leave to be seated.We ordered a variety of dishes including the pork belly, pepper chicken, bamboo shoots with eel, tomato beef stew, pickled fish stew, and eggplant. There were not any stand out dishes and everything ordered was expensive. The tomato beef stew didn't taste like Chinese food and my friend's wife remarked she had never had anything like it in Sichuan. The bamboo shoot with eel lacked flavor and was difficult to eat.Perhaps we ordered the wrong dishes but considering the  the price point of this restaurant and long wait, I do not think I would bother to return.",Same menu as the one in flushing. Almost same taste but smaller portion and much longer waiting time (space is tiny inside). Only because it's in Manhattan - if not because of the convenience I would still go to the flushing one. 很喜欢一开始送的泡菜。酸汤肥牛不错的。石锅青椒鱼味道差不多一样（不咋辣）。炝白菜很失望，全是老白菜梆子炒得也非常生都嚼不怎么动。麻婆豆腐正常。最后送的红豆水挺好的。,"A patron was allowed to bring her DOG into the restaurant and sit at the table where food was being served.Lunchtime on a weekday, it was busy, including CANINES dining at the table.","As someone from Sichuan, this really lives up to the standard! All dishes were a really good sized portion, four dishes just about enough for three people. 1) Loofah: just the dish to escape a little bit of spiciness. It is light and flavorful. 2) Blood curd: there are plenty of other things in this pot like bean sprouts and spam. The peppers give both of these a slight kick and is perfect pairing with rice too. 3) Eggplant: so so tender. This one was a little bit salty but the taste is there! Usually my go-to and just-order dish at a Sichuan restaurant. 4) Favorite from this meal was definitely the fish. Went well with everything else and at a level of spicy and numbness that doesn't kick in till later. You only want to eat more though! The fish was very tender and you get the option to have boneless or with bone. Pretty busy for a Tuesday lunch time, but most people were seemingly students. Would recommend coming early for dinner especially on the weekends if it's like this on a weekday!","This is a great, authentic Szechuan restaurant in East Village. Meals here are super affordable considering how much food you receive for the price.My go-tos are the fish in chili oil, house special chicken (cold), mapo tofu, and steamed crab with sticky rice. I also love the loofa, green beans, pork belly slices, La Zi Ji chicken, garlic prawns, beef slices with enoki mushroom in sour soup... I could go on. Amazingly everything here tastes very clean and healthy!The only annoying thing about this place is that they don't take reservations, so show up early and be prepared for a long wait. It's worth it though!","Sichuan restaurant with a wide range of menu at reasonable price and nice atmosphere! My friend and I shared sliced pork belly with chili garlic sauce and braised chicken with chili (with bone) and they were both pretty good! The sliced pork belly was light yet flavorful because of the garlic sauce and the braised chicken was a bit too spicy for me because I'm not good with spicy food, but I was still able to enjoy the flavor. The amount was perfect for sharing between two people! Definitely get white rice on the side so it balances out the spiciness. With great atmosphere and interior decor inside the restaurant, this would be a great place for a sit down meal or introduce anyone to the cuisine!",Szechuan Mountain House
354,"This place is really good.I came here because the Tsurutonton Udon place was packed. It's like tapas sort of. You can order a bunch of dishes. I got the Chuwanmushi, some root vegetable dish simmered with a bit of chicken, their hot udon and the buta kakuni. I'm not the biggest fan of that bacon like thin strips that restaurants use in hot pot. It was tender. Definitely order that. I came here for lunch once. I wasn't too impressed with lunch. Go here for dinner. They have a larger selection of food.","Quite difficult to find and as it's tucked away in the basement of an office. Authentic izakaya with an extensive sake list and Japanese eats. Definitely pricier than I expected for the food quality. We tried the unagi don, beef cubes, and braised pork belly. The pork belly was delicious but the other two were just average and something you can find at other restaurants for half the price.","Probably the best izakaya in NYC. We used to frequent Aburiya Kinnosuke, but it has gone way downhill since it's ownership change. Nearby Soba Totto has also dropped off dramatically since it was sold to new owners. Very few of the staff can speak Japanese and selection has declined along with quality. Too bad that new owners cannot maintain the quality and authenticity. BTW, Sakagura has opened an outpost in the East Village, but that restaurant has not yet come up to the level of Sakagura in Midtown","Visit here again on a Saturday night, I know I just went to their new location in east village, but we still come back for a business diner with our guests. We came here at 8:30pm, a lot of people waiting in line, luckily we made the reservation couple days ago, love their atmosphere and high quality. See the pictures of our flavor dishes.","I was here with Andrew and my parents. They wanted Japanese food and this seems close by. They are the classic Japanese type where you had this great compartment to preserve privacy. Tatami is available upon request.To see the subcategories of the overall 3 star: I'd give the food a 3.5 star rating, service 4 star, and value 3 star. This general rating serves the purpose of future reminder that I won't get what I pay for.We had quite a few dishes and there's nothing super special that I would remember on the positive side. I've been to many Japanese bar throughout the world and every single time I will order the black cod. The dish from this restaurant is less creamy, less tender and more rigid. You can clearly see the slice, as if it were not properly defrost. I was just making a guess as I've been making this dish at home as well and I got millions of trials and had to remember the failure cases. Edamame is worth a try as it's pretty unique. The eel on the rice is probably the best dish we've had during the night. We had wagyu stir fried noodles which went way too salty, and probably too much oil.","I thought I had a good lunch. However, my lunch ended on a really sour note. I don't know if that's the case in Japan but this is what happened. By the end of my lunch, I was asking the bartender, who is a skinny Japanese lady with glasses questions about the desert menu. I couldn't understand her so well and she didn't seem to understand my question either. That's why I kept asking her which of the deserts were less sweet.I don't see what's wrong with asking my server, the bartender, questions about the menu.So when I left, after tipping them, the same lady talked behind my back. Just as I was leaving the restaurant. She said ""oh she kept asking me questions about the menu."" I'm sorry but that left my lunch on a bad tone. It's unfortunate because their soba is good. But she left me feeling so uncomfortable. What's wrong with asking about the menu??? Especially when I couldn't understand her very well. I've been coming to this restaurant on and off when I get the chance. It's a shame that I can't anymore. When you eat out, you want to be relaxed. That last thing you want is your server (at the bar) bad mouthing you the moment you leave the restaurant. I can't shake off that sour experience.",Sakagura
355,"The food is good here - I've had the cowboy burger and the burrito multiple times. However, the service is subpar and not worth the price for standard bar fare. The past few times I've ordered the hostess working the phones has been less than friendly and impatient when taking my pickup order. The last time I ordered out, I arrived for pick up and was barely greeted or given an approximate time my order would be done. When I got home, I realized they forgot to give me condiments and one of the orders of fries was missing. Last month I gave it one more try because my girlfriend was a big fan of the burger. The waitress had little to no knowledge of the drink specials and hardly tended to us. Poor management has created a dining experience that lacks common courtesy and professionalism. I understand they are running a restaurant in a very hipster area and they want to reflect that kind of atmosphere, but this is now among a number of hip spots in the bushwick area which seems to have abandoned regular service industry standards because of it.",Girlfriend ordered breakfast sandwich with bacon. I got the steak and fries. Both came with what I highly suspect were frozen potatoes (see photos). Steak was like chewing gum and took me forever to get through.,"My g/f and I ordered delivery here. It said organic chicken breast for the buffalo chicken sandwich and had decent reviews. For the two buffalo chicken sandwiches it came out to over $40 bucks. Delivery prices have gone up due to outsourcing delivery people and using a private delivery services. However this meal was disgusting, the chicken was flattened out, as if someone beat it with a hammer, or even worst ran over by a car. I questioned the flavor of the meat, but felt so bad that my gf spent over $40 bucks on the food, that I tried to eat all of it. It had no flavor and the blue cheese tasted like old mayo or something worse. I had to drench the flattened out ""organic chicken breast"" in crystal hot sauce, just to get the questionable, gamey taste out of my mouth. I really can't believe this was chicken, if it was, something was wrong with it. I ate my meal, watching our movie, only to later find out that my gf had only eaten one bite before she gave up on this lousy meal. I'm only giving an extra star bc I did not get sick from the meal. But with so many great buffalo chicken sandwiches to choose from, hard times, Clara's, or hell; the deli across the street. This was a waste of money and I'm very disappointed. Oh and the fries were soggy.","I've been here a few times with my sister who lives nearby. It's one of her favorite spots. I usually get the huevos rancheros. I LOVE how they have a fried crispy tortilla underneath the eggs and cheese! The service is really nice, and I love how they play old movies. Today they were playing XMen 2 and some other oldies. Overall, great experience!","Cheap, cheerful, always great portion sizes.Gluten free buns & bread are really handy if you fancy a sandwich or burger in here. They're super accommodating and the food always turns out great.The rosemary fries are amazing, and I would definitely recommend their BBQ wings. They're always solid!","Cute brunch spot. Very busy place and great service. Yummy food and mamosa. Yes,Mamosa.",983-Bushwick's Living Room
356,"We came here because it was featured in Eater, yet I am quite surprised that their ramen didn't wow us. The portion is adequate in their smaller-than-normal bowl, however we both thought our noodles were just normal. Admittedly, the salmon bowl is different from all the usual pork slices you get in many ramen shops, so that's a plus; personally, I think it tastes better than the yaoyao. Their special of the day is cheese and ramps quiche, so we gave that a shot. Not bad, but not great. Also, we order the spam musubi since Suzume is supposed to be a Hawaiian-esque joint (or maybe full-on Hawaiian?). It was good, but not worth the price tag.","I stopped eating pork and the salmon ramen is just as delicious. Yum, Missing this spot from LA.","Went here with my boyfriend and was somewhat sketched out because instead of a grade outside, their grade was ""pending"". This leads me to believe that they failed a previous inspection or had some sort of infestation or issue, but can't say for sure. We walked in and sat at the bar and ordered the salmon ramen, and the pork ramen and a few drinks. About halfway through eating the salmon ramen (which I am also hesitant to eat seafood at restaurants because of possibly getting sick), I found a bug in my soup. I was immediately disappointed and let the waitress know what happened. She was really helpful and nice apologizing for what happened, but I was still upset. While sitting at the bar, I also did see the lady behind the bar rinsing the water glasses in a sink of water instead of actually washing them which seems really gross to me. Anyways, if I was to go here again( which I probably won't), I would wait to see the rating and be cautious of what you order. Just was an unpleasant experience and freaked me out a lot.","I've been a regular at Suzume for several years. -Sometimes I have the same dish twice in one day even though the menu has changed slightly in the last couple years.I notice the same dedication to a quality/consistent product AND service, which can be respected by anyone within the hospitality industry.The warm lit/chill environment can be misconstrued for uncleanliness, in this modern day in age, but It sure BEATS the ambiance of a department store or that ""club scene"" you see in Williamsburg.-Suzume is TRULY a GEM of the neighborhood and I'm happy to have this around the corner of my home-","The interior of the restaurant makes you feel very warm. We went around early evening and it was perfect because there was no wait and we were seated immediately. As we looked at the menu, we agreed on ordering just the snacks.We ordered:-Syd's Peashoot & Bok Choy SaladThe Syd's Peashoot & Bok Choy Salad was very tasty. I am not sure what the crunchy brown stuff was on top of the salad but it was great. - Fish TacosThe fish tacos were very tasty. Not only was the fish fried perfectly but also the taco shell was soft as well. I was expecting a soft or hard shell;however, it was a soft crispy shell.- Blistered Shishito PeppersI love shishito peppers and these were very good. I just wished that the seasoning was a bit lighter. After eating a few, the seasoning got to much for me.- Spam MusubiThe Spam Musubi was tasty. If you love spam then you should order this. It is snack size so you may want to order other things as well if you are a hungry guy like me.- Lumpia Spring RollsThese were awesome. It came out very hot so take caution when you take the first bite. It was very crispy and the meat inside was delicious as well.- Scallop Hand RollsOverall I would say it was a great experience and I would come back to try the noodles and rice bowls.",I love love loved it. Reading the reviews people rated it lower from their sushi experience.  We didn't eat their sushi but we did order their yaoyao ramen bowl and their fried chicken bowl. The appetizer of ribs were finger licking good and really filling for two! Its $10 and I totally recommend it 100%! Vibe was good except they're really laid back and u have to wait for them to come over or really work hard to be seated and flag ppl down for some service (I knocked a star off for their inattentive service tho that might just be their style...?) It's small so I recommend go in smaller groups. Itll be hard to seat a big group in. IG eatsumbap,Suzume

If you are ordering anything but the Bee Sting (which doesn't appear on the menu) you are not living your best life... hashtag or otherwise. The atmosphere here is electric and trendy. The service is great and attentive. While it is a bit noisy, quiet restaurants are empty and usually have bad food. I choose a busy place like this. Be prepared for a bit of a wait if going during peak times.","Unpopular opinion: pizza is pretty good. Just pretty good. The REAL treats here are the salads and entrees. They're unreal. The well rounded and full bodied flavors. The different textures and colors. They're an experience. I mean don't get me wrong, you'll enjoy the pizza, it's just a REAL waste if that's all you get. Service is ok. The hostess was sweet, but they placed us under an air conditioner next to the door and when we wanted to move (because I like enjoying my food not freezing) you were able to tell they got annoyed. ‍ the wait is usually long but VERY worth it.","You know those girls who did a year abroad in ITALIA and feel alive when they practice Italian, and talk about weekends in FIRENZE?? Yeah, this is where they eat. The food lacks flavor too.","Saturday night, tried to get seating inside for two people, but there was a long wait. Alternatively, there is a take out area around the corner which you can order at, then take the food to their backyard. Decided on the Margherita Pizza ($17), which took a little over half an hour to be ready. Meanwhile, took advantage of the outdoor bar at the backyard (cocktails from $10, beers $6-8). Pizza is still hot once we get it back to the table - a soft crust with a layering of mozzarella and tomato sauce. Simple overall but great flavor (and not burnt).Despite the crowd, it wasn't too difficult finding a spot to sit down, nor was it too loud. Would come back during warm weather again, can see it being harder to get a spot when it's cold out.",Roberta's
358,1. Very slow / poor service2. Saw cockroach crawling on my table and on the ceiling3. Mediocre food,"Friends and I came to La Lanterna for lunch on Saturday. Will admit the menu really wasn't for me. It was hard finding something on the menu I wanted to order. Ended up going with the Canadian bacon (similar to ham) and brie panini on focaccia bread (which came with a side salad), as I thought it'd be a safe option. I enjoyed the focaccia bread, but otherwise the panini was quite boring. Thought it'd be more crowded at 12:30pm on a Saturday, but there were plenty of unoccupied tables around us. Taste | 3Atmosphere | 4Presentation | 3Service | 3.5OVERALL | 3","I got the cheese lasagna! I thought it had tomato sauce in it, but I was wrong. If you order this dish, it is basically mac and cheese, but BETTER. A four cheese mac and cheese, and no elbow shaped pasta. This place is very intimate; not great for big crowds. But I would recommend for a low key dinner with a friend or even a date! It is a bit on the pricey side, but 100% worth! If you're not feeling the cheese lasagna, the PESTO one is to die for. I have to go back to try to bolognese one!","I'd been to La Lanterna before for drinks but got dinner there for the first time this week. I got the mushroom pizza and it was absolutely delicious. My friend ordered the calzone and we shared both items. I definitely preferred the pizza and the portions gave both of us leftovers. The calzone was really tasty but a little too cheesy/bready for my taste. It was filled with mozzarella, ricotta and small diced tomatoes. I definitely recommend requesting to sit in the back garden. It was such a wonderful atmosphere. Great food, quick service and reasonably priced--highly recommend.","Came in for lunch and had the Lasagna bolognese.  Satisfied with the portion, and its easy to pace yourself since it comes out very hot.  Subtle flavors, it might not be the lasagna youve come to know - bechamel instead of ricotta, light on all the ingredients.  A real comfort food.  Enjoyed it with the black truffle paste. Good service and low-key ambiance as well. Ive worked across the street for 2 years and recently saw another yelpers dish which prompted my first visit.  Will definitely come back.","Three friends and I came in with a 6 pm reservation for a Friday night. (They accept ressos for 4 people or more, but you just have to call them). It seemed pretty busy by then already, but our food still came out relatively quickly.We decided to just order a bunch of things and share:3-cheese course ($15) - choose any three cheese from the list. We went with the brie, stracchino, and mozzarella di bufala. All were great. You really can't go wrong with a cheese plateMesclun Con Anatra Affumicata ($14.50) - warm smoked duck breast with mixed greens in a lemon mustard dressing. This was a nice way to start the meal. I was afraid the smoked duck would be too salty, but it was perfect. The lemon mustard dressing was nice and light - not too mustardy. Even my friend, who doesn't like mustard, said it was goodPizza con Prosciutto Arrostito ($16) - pizza topped with tomato sauce, ham, mozzarella, basil & EVOO. This was nice and thin (not overly thin) and was the perfect size for four people (one slice each)Lasagna al Pesto ($15.50) - homemade pasta layered with pesto sauce,bechamel & parmigiano cheese. This was definitely the star of the show. I had never even heard of pesto replacing tomato sauce for lasagna before, so it was a welcomed twist to a classic. It would be pretty heavy for one person, so I'm really glad that we decided to do family-style with all the dishesWe also ordered a bottle of wine, and our total for everything came out to $40 pp. With all that food, I don't think you'd find a better price for the quality elsewhere. Our waiter wasn't that friendly, but then again, I'm not really that friendly either, so it's not a deal-breaker for me. At least he was attentive.Can't wait to come back!",La Lanterna Di Vittorio
359,"This place was okay. Was passing through NYC for business and had dinner on a Tuesday night. Showed up at 7:30 and had to wait 10 mins for a table for two (not bad; had beers while waiting). Our waitress forgot about us after we ordered drinks so we had to flag her down to place our food order. Roast beef spring rolls were good, not great. Cheeseburger was good, but nothing special. I'll try another spot next time.","Went here for brunch and had a very ""meh"" experience. We got the $25 pitcher and it was so bitter and just left me feeling queasy. I also had the eggs Benedict and it was a let down. Won't be coming back","I personally didn't find the food to be flavorful or well put together. My Bf and I had the hangover breakfast sandwich, it immediately fell apart when it was delivered. It got soggy, the break crust was too hard so it was hard to bite into.The fries that came with it were cold and also not really good. Really strange Bc I didn't think messing up French fries was a thing? We also had a pitcher of the cucumber mimosa- I do not suggest that. I love cucumber cocktails, but definitely made a mistake thinking it was refreshing... but the combo of cucumber and champagne was just odd. On the bright side, the dessert - blueberry donut was good! The service was good and quick, and the decor was nice. That's pretty much what my 3 starts are for","Absolutely delicious! French toast is not too sweet and melts in your mouth. The bacon cheeseburger with a fried egg on top is an amazing savory choice but be sure to keep your silverware handy as the bun is a little small for all the brunch goodness on top of it. Now onto the atmosphere, for 1:45pm on a Saturday it was relatively quite and not necessary to make a reservation, but we did so anyways just to be on the safe side. Cozy but with large tables perfect for sharing plates and catching up! Blood orange mimosa was delicious and the drinks list is extensive - worth a try!All in all, wonderful brunch spot for a day in the city!","Cask's Bar is a great place to stop by for drinks and small plates. Although they do have a full menu, the setting can get slightly louder, which may inhibit you from having an undisturbed meal. Their Happy Hour is Monday-Saturday 3-8 pm, with select cocktails priced at $8- definitely worth it! The service is fantastic. Make sure to check out the bar downstairs for a more private and intimate setting!","This place usually gets very crowded. Try to come early, beat the crowd and enjoy their awesome happy hour deals. I don't know why I don't come more often. The food is delicious, the drinks are yummy and the service is amazing too.I made a reservation on Yelp, and was seating promptly when my party arrived. My friends loved everything we ordered on the menu. Nothing was a miss. We got the cod taco, which was only $4 each during happy hour. It's hard to find good fish tacos, and this place got it right. We also got the lamb nachos and coconut curry mussels. Our server was super nice and attentive. I can't wait to come back!",Cask Bar & Kitchen
360,"So disappointing. I took my wife, brother and fiancé here on a Saturday afternoon. I had eaten here once before and remembered that it was a decent spot. We came in hungry and sat down at an outside table. Once we finally got menus it took us about 15 minutes to order. Then we waited, and waited, and asked about our food, and then waited even more. Over an hour and still nothing. Then the waitress offered us shots. We said no. We just wanted our food. She then brought a round of beers on the house instead and said our ticket somehow got lost. When we finally got our food, the burgers were incredibly over cooked, almost inedible. But we were starving that we just forced it down. $100 bucks and 2+ hours later we left. I not only felt embarrassed that I recommended such a place but also felt cheated out of what should've been a special and pleasant experience. Shame on you Brooklyn Icehouse!","Really chill backyard space! Small menu; the sweet potato fries were so salty that I feared for my organs. Average service, and reasonable prices except for the $5 in ATM fees you're going to swallow since they don't make it clear until your bill comes that it's cash only :O",Nice dive. Large Backyard. Large drinks $6 draft pint beer. Chill music. TVs. Inside has plenty of tables to eat at. Bar is smaller but you can always chill in the back.,"Why am I ancient but I still love dive bars?  Because for $6 for a shot and a beer you can get messssed up before heading to brunch in the neighborhood. This place is convenient walking distance from the South Brooklyn Ferry when getting off at the Red Hook stop.  The bartenders are cool and the patrons are too.   Nice BIG TV for watching your sports.We had a fun chat with the chef and as a Brooklyn native he knows some great sounding dishes.  Didn't try anything, but we will be back for our pork chops.  Stop in if you're anywhere near here.","We arrived here for some late night grub, and I wish the kitchen was still serving the full menu... but unfortunately, we could only order wings, fries, and some key lime pie.  The wings were pretty tasty and the blue cheese/ranch mix dressing was phenomenal.  The fries were delectable. The key lime pie was from a local joint called Steve's.  It was average at best.  Only downfall, the dude serving behind the bar was as friendly as a door stop.","Came here after hanging out in the area for a few hours for some drinks. The inside is real divey and can get full pretty quick as it isn't all that big. What makes this an even bigger draw is the back yard area which has several tables and chairs so chilling here with drinks and bar grub was great. Unfortunately this makes it limited to the warmer months of the year.The drink selection was pretty decent best I can tell. I had some beers and a few of a cider that I'd never seen before so that was cool and the staff were pretty cool despite how busy it became as the evening crowd rolled in. I didnt have any of the food but some of the choices sounded pretty good. If I find myself outbthis way again maybe I'll try something. Again the best part is the backyard area, so if you're coming through, make it a warm night.",Brooklyn Ice House

I asked her a question and she replied ""are you speaking to me?""  No. No I'm not. I'm speaking to the bottles (!!!). Never offered us a drink. I mean. You are in the service industry right?  Our server was like a ghost. Where could she have possibly gone?  And then I ordered a double latte and she looked appalled...  food was delicious.

We made a reservation through the Open Table at11am for brunch with my friends who haven't seen each others for 8 years. It was our reunion. When i got to the restaurant, they asked to sit outdoor seating and the waitress said she can make a room for us if we wait at the bar. And she even told me that she will not let anyone sit in the middle table for us to have 2 tables for 3 people. (Attached picture)And suddenly the manager came up to us.This manager is very RUDE !!! VERY !!! He wears glasses and not tall. He said how many ? And we said 3 and we are waiting for the seat at outdoor. And he said no you can't. He literally said ""No You Can't""But there were white people waited at the bar. And he said he'll give the table to them. But 1. they even came after us. 2. They just walked in. We made a reservation! So i said i wanna talk to the lady that i talked And he said it doesn't matter I'm the manager. He Didnt even apologize that they was a miscommunication. And the attitude was so rude. Is he racist? Maybe If you are not white, think about going to this place again. I've been here before with my boyfriend for Sat brunch and the food was average. Only because we picked this place because we needed to meet at Soho. Ruined our reunion totally.Thanks","I was disappointed with Aurora since I initially wanted lunch however at 3:30pm on a Sunday they were only serving brunch. The crab beignets are worth trying, the duck and waffle was okay. The bloody Mary was not good at all, tasted diluted and lacked spices.","Aurora is my staple go to restaurant here in New York City. At its $$$ price point, Aurora has delivered stellar food and service consistently for the last four years I've gone here. The managers David and Giancarlo are both wonderful, and it's a pleasure for me to host my annual parties here because these people go above and beyond. Truth be told, I don't believe there's a single dish on the menu that hadn't left me satisfied. Portion sizes are solid, and so is the cooking. Steaks are cooked true to medium rare for me. Pastas are delicious. And the appetizers keep me coming back. How is that bruchetta toast so darn good? Verdict: You don't come to Aurora expecting the most impressive fancy meal you've ever had. You come for the consistency, and knowing for certain that it's going to be a great meal that won't break the bank, every single time. And if it did break the bank when the check arrives, the emergency exit door is in the back right corner near the bathroom. You're welcome.","Well the pasta dishes I had there were some of the best of my life.  The person who was serving us however was really getting me annoyed and had this kind of ""you must have asked for a substitution because you don't understand the ingredient, because it's the ONLY kind or noddle that a rational person would ever choose"".  Something like that to the point where they kept cutting me off to explain again the shape of the pasta which I've only had like 17 getthafuckouttahere times.That said, this person turned it around after half time and ended up not detracting from the evening (you know when you start making comments like ""wow, they didn't seem to be annoyed that time, see it's all good"").My obviously un-dealt with resentments around authority and dominance aside, this was just some of the best fucking pasta.Hear me??  SOME OF THE BEST FUCKING PASTA.Even the god damned Cacio e Pepe was hands down the best I've had.Unfortunately, like many pasta dishes in New York, when they served it all I felt was ""where's the beef?"".  Cause it's fucking small that's why.Really too fucking small.But really good.  Order two.","Lovely food, great service and perfect ambience.

362,"We stopped by for brunch due to the 4 stars ratings on Yelp. The wait was 10-15 mins for weekend brunch after 1pm. Perhaps it was the cold weather hence not a lot of people were out and about. The cafe was packed with hipsters and a few young families - relaxed vibes. We like the big windows which brought in a lot of light. The food was a big disappointment. We got the eggs with sausage and toast; the toast was burned and the edges of the eggs were also burnt (you can see the photos). Furthermore my frittata was a sad small piece of pie and a glob of hash brown. Not visually appealing or appetizing to say the least. Suffice to say, we were surprised this cafe had such a high ratings considering the food was bland and mediocre. The burger and fries were the only highlight from this experience.","Perhaps the woman who seated me at the bar, as a party of one, thought that I wanted to be crammed in on both sides by other diners. Not only was the noise level excruciating, after a couple to my right kindly moved over to give me more room, another woman (who knew the bartender apparently) plopped herself down. She was joined by her friend who PULLED UP A STOOL BEHIND ME next to her and proceeded to jostle me, yell in my ear and insist that she ""couldn't help it. "" The only other way she could have been closer is if she had sat in my lap. $45 later for a teensy plate of pasta, I gulped my water and left. Never again my friends, never again.",It's still 5 stars solid. Full 5.  From service to food to atmosphere. If only we lived closer.,"This place has been 5 stars for many years! Even that one time my appetizer wasn't on point, this team is so great, they had a great save. I love this place. I take everyone I know here because it will always be a solid experience.Through the years I still see a lot of the same faces working here, which shows solid ownership and management. This is one of the few places that runs like a well oiled machine. They have a lovely diverse staff that caters perfectly to their diverse guests.In this age of increasing discrimination, this place has consistently treated me and my guests like human beings and for that, I will always support this establishment!May Walters exist forever and always!I love this place and all it's staff!","Atmosphere: Walter's is dark and romantic around dinnertime. It can be intimidating at first, but once you get a feel for the restaurant, it quickly becomes a cozy environment that feels like a good balance between classy and comfortable.Service: Our server was friendly and professional. He checked on us over the course of the meal and gave a fun, lighthearted tone to the more serious ambience of the restaurant.Food: We started with the grilled octopus and had the Roasted Chicken and Fried Chicken as entrées. The grilled octopus was very well seasoned and did not have a chewy texture. The Roasted Chicken was flavorful and cooked well; we really enjoyed this dish. The Fried Chicken was the best value item on the menu and really filled us up. We also got the Diablo and Walter's Cooler, which paired well with the chicken.Overall: Walter's was a good choice for dinner + drinks. You get the feeling of being in an intimate, fancy restaurant without breaking the bank. Not necessarily the first choice for a dinner date but it's definitely up there. We would love to come back and try their brunch to see the change in atmosphere!","I am new to exploring the Fort Greene area and decided to try out Walters for a late dinner with two of my friends. Upon arrival we were seated right away and greeted by a very cheery waitress who proceeded to provide us with the special for the evening which was a burrata salad. Thank God we were immediately informed because this special was the highlight of the evening. When it arrived it came with a lovely array of roasted vegetables and then we proceeded to ask for bread to dip with. The waitress provided us with a sourdough loaf as well as a baguette. Obviously the carbs were amazing and came with delicious olive oil. For my entree, I ordered the fried chicken. I will say that I thought the breading on the fried chicken was a little thick but the chicken was cooked to perfection and the hot honey was a great complement. Overall I think I'd like to come back and experience their happy hour and brunch!",Walter's
363,Too expensive and food wasn't good either. Even simple thing like eggs weren't cooked properly. Would only go back for drinks there.,"Where do I start! The restaurant is cute but very small like the size of a living room maybe. The pictures online make it seem a lot larger than what it is. The menu for restaurant week is a rip off so instead we sat at the bar and ordered separate and I had the burger which was pretty tasty. The cauliflower tots are extremely salty jus an FYI. We told the bartender he said that's how they make them. He messed my friends order up twice which was pretty annoying. The drinks are good a little pricey but good. And last but not least, we told the bartender for our tab separate which he forgot to do so he just said he would just ring ours separately. Instead he didn't he charge my whole card for both of our meals then said he was sorry and voided it then charged my card AGAIN for just my meal. Long story short he said at the end of the day it would be reversed and I should get it right back. Lies! Fast forward to a week later I still don't have my $90 plus back so I called the restaurant and a lady said the person who can handle that doesn't do refund that late, mind you it was like 5 pm. She said someone would call me the Next day and handle it. It's been two days still no call. Just an all around horrible experience so they deserve one star after all of this. Unprofessional and dishonest!","I've been dying to try this trendy spot. Sadly, the food was really disappointing. And being sandwiched against the window in the summer heat didn't help - it was stifling, so hot! Kudos to their photographer who makes the place look much much larger than it is in the Instagram photos.","3.5/5 Visited there because of the attractive Instagram pictures. The place is very cute and cozy. Unfortunately we didn't make the reservation online so we cannot get a standard seat. Sitting by the window is no that comfortable. As for the food, the orange juice is really diluted. The avocado toast is ok, but I think the omelette is delicious.Not very impressed. Maybe will not visit there again.","I heard so many great things about the delicious cocktails here and decided to celebrate my husband's birthday here.The restaurant called the day of to confirm the reservation and when I asked if they can do something special for my husband's birthday, they mentioned they will bring out a dessert with a candle. The place is very cute and cozy, make sure you get a table reservation if you are dinning there.I asked for the ""If you are a bird, I am a Bird"" cocktail as it reminded me of another drink I had in Stockholm that also came in a birdie glass. The waitress told me that all the birdie glasses were broken while they wait for the new shipment to arrive. Nonetheless, I ordered the drink anyway, in a regular glass. Interestingly enough, the glass came with ice, which was a bit odd as the birdie glass didn't have any ice in it. In conclusion, the drink was just OK, aside from a hint of lavender and honey, I couldn't taste anything else. Mind you, it was $18!!We had the 2 course prix fixe menu. For starters, we got the tuna tartare and avocado salad. Both were delicious. For entrees, we were both eyeing on the While We Were Young burger so we got that and substituted one of the fries for the truffle fries and another fries for the brussels sprouts. I wish they had the cauliflower dots as an option. If you go for the burger, do not order anything else, it was big and filling! Also, don't substitute for the truffle fries, it wasn't that special.Then it was time for the dessert. There wasn't a dessert menu so I left it up to the restaurant to surprise us. And sure, they surprised us with a plate of french toast. It was..probably one of the worst desserts we ever had. The toast was hard and dry without much taste. And here comes the real surprise, a hefty price tag of $18!!! And I had thought this would be on the house after we ordered 3 cocktails and 2 prix fixe between 2 people.This is probably more of a brunch place. For cocktails, check out Mace or The Reception Bar.","Had an amazing meal last night. NYC is saturated with restaurants so it's hard to know what's good or even worth the money. If you want food that not only tastes amazing but makes you feel great, look no further than the avocado ""salad"". The Mexican street corn salad (deconstructed elotes) was light and extremely flavorful. The truffle fries were loaded with truffles and Parmesan cheese, rich and delectable. The watermelon radish on the tuna tartare provided a fun (and unexpected kick) to a beautifully plated dish. The cauliflower tots were unexpectedly light and the spicy aioli was the perfect compliment. The burrata was fresh and light but it was the stone fruit salad that stole the show. Finally, the spicy chicken dumplings were plump and meaty served over a chili oil base that I could've drank with a spoon.I cannot wait to try the rest of this menu in its quaint surrounding. Did I mention the service was on-point? My glass never went empty and attention was properly given without being overbearing.In a city of 1M restaurants, this restaurant truly shines.If you haven't been, you need to make a trip to the West Village and indulge in everything the menu has to offer.Dishes:Tuna tartarCauliflower totsBurrata w/ stone fruit saladTruffle fries Avocado ""salad"" with pickled chiliesSpicy chicken dumplings#WhileWeWereYoung #NYC #WestVillage #ChefBrianCartenuto #classy #latenight #amazingFood #sustainable #local #fresh",While We Were Young
364,"So sad. Walked forty minutes to find out the kitchen was closed. Had a vegan fix I needed and I thought this place could do it. They would make so much more money if they kept their kitchen open. It's a silly looking bar with a sillier name. Middle aged men pretending to be 23 serving drinks. Cheap. Not too cheap though. The crowd definitely is what you'd expect; an eclectic hodgepodge with one thing in common, alcohol and ostentatious standoffishness. Must be something in the water!","5 star brunch atmosphere!!-(but our experience was just fine.) Walked in at 11am on a super busy Sunday, tables filled with people and a live band! We took an open table and ordered coffees while looking over the menu. While ordering our meals, we were told Brunch menu items can't be modified, and that we'd only be able to add things, so I'm assuming things were not made to order(?). Sucks, as I was having brunch with a vegetarian and someone with multiple food allergies. They did have a few vegetarian options, but we wouldn't be able to customize items without meat, so choices were very limited. (tragic.) My friend with allergies originally wanted to order an item, asking it be made without avocados- but they couldn't do that for him so he ordered the biscuits. My boyfriend (vegetarian) ordered a breakfast burrito, they offered the chorizo add for meat eaters. I ordered the mushroom hash and added two poached eggs. For being pre-made or whatever the case, the food took a bit of time to come out. The server accidentally brought my boyfriend the burrito with chorizo, which he wouldn't have realized it had meat had I not tasted it first. Would've been unfortunate. :( My food -the mushroom hash- looked boring and plain with the arugula and greens on top, HOWEVER, the flavors of the beets and runny eggs and hashbrowns (with a ton of hot sauce) is something I still dream about today!! And with all the greens on my plate, it made it seem guilt free. hehe. My meal was very filling. If I ever have the time to make it back to Father's, I would order the hash again and try the chorizo patties add on. Thanks, Father's !!!","Not ADA accessible. To enter there's a step, should have a ramp option to get in. Once you're in, all the tables are high top stools. There is one lower table in the back...but it's on a platform. Not helpful if you're on crutches or in a wheel chair like myself.The food is fine, but took forever. We received appetizer after our entree - no attempt to make it right from staff. Drinks were good.  We left early as it was uncomfortable for my injury. Won't be back until it's ADA accesible.","As good as it gets for a professionally ran edgier spot in a gentrifying neighborhood. Vibe depends on the day/night, the place is popular with hipsters outspriced of Morgan/jefferson, those that priced the hipsters our and the locals that think hipsters are weird as hell.Staff is lovely. Drinks are good and fairly priced.",Fathers is such a staple in the Bushwick community. I couldn't imagine this place not existing. The food is exceptional and the people are so warm. The vibes are cool and the music is great anytime of the day! Highly Suggest!,"I might be dating myself here but you know that song that goes ""Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name and they're always glad you came..""? For those not born in the 80's, that's the intro song for the hit show Cheers. Well that's what plays in my head each and every time I walk into Father Knows Best. I've been coming here at least one night a week, for the last three years. This morning however, was my first time 'working from from home' so I decided to bring my laptop here and grab me an ice coffee. I was a bit nervous thinking I wouldn't be productive but to my surprise, I felt like I walked into a hip WeWork as there were about 15 others doing the same, all locked in their zone, and typing away on their laptops. Whether it's a Monday morning or a Saturday night, I highly recommend Fathers. Pro tip #1: Ask for Greg, he makes a mean Old Fashion. Prop tip #2: Located right off the Wilson stop on L train and they have a digital sign that tells you how far the next train is (I need one for my apartment!).",Father Knows Best
365,Two stars for friendly service. Ordered Farmer's Bowl. Hard boiled eggs tasted like metal refrigerator and old vegetables. Kale and/or arugula were not washed- there was gritty dirt in every bite. :(,Terrible experience. I had a bouncer assault me for literally no reason. Came up to my face as I was talking to my friends (had not interacted with him once since I got the bar) terrible service. I saw four fights break out including a woman getting punched in the face. So bad. Be better.,My go to place for some drinks and just unwind .it does get crowded so if you get there early you can snag a table in the far back.,"I took my wife here recently for a brunch date and I have to say the food was very good. However it was quite dark, even though it was really in the day. I suppose that's the vibe they want, but I personally don't want soft lighting for brunch.Anyway, onto the food. I had the ham and cheese frittata, which I thought was delicious. I guess it's hard to mess up ham and cheese, but it was very well prepared, and you could tell the base ingredients were fresh! My wife had the salmon salad, which it seemed early for fish to me, but she seemed to thoroughly enjoy it. We split some sides too- which were also all quality. I definitely recommend you get some home fries.","They implemented the hipster bar design manual perfectly.  The wood bar, candlelight  and not much real lighting give the place that purposefully distressed look.Service was good though not great as had to wait awhile for the food even though place was not that busy. Wine list is limited but good as did have a California chard.  My weekender Bloody Mary was good as liked the spiced rim.  Next time likely go for spicier one as found weekender a bite tame.  The waffle which was under shares for some reason was well made with plenty of fruit.  The smoked trout salad had nice smoky flavor.  Overall good option in the  area.",Can't start this review without mentioning the old fashions..I had 8. My favorite in the area. My friend and I got burgers and they were as solid as it gets. Good vibes for a date and a chill night out.,The Wren
366,Awesome vegan food. I was skeptical at first because I'm generally not a fan of vegan food but this place left me stuffed by the end,"Pretty dishes, and interesting sounding combinations....but the execution falls a bit below par (the dishes either lacked a little touch of something, or had too much of something).The service was also quite bored and lackluster...for e.g., when you take all of 10 minutes to seat guests in an almost empty restaurant, it raises an eyebrow. We also had to try multiple times to get someone's attention when we needed to (again, the restaurant was 2/3rd empty...so I shouldn't have to jostle for your attention!). At the end, the server cleared out my glass of wine when I clearly had a few sips left. Hmmmppphhh.Back to the food:Beet manti - the dumpling cover was a bit dry, and the flavors were quite flat (except for the aleppo jam which had a nice heat to it)Green pea and fava falafel - ok, but felt a bit too denseCauliflower - the texture was a bit blah, and felt boiled rather than roasted, and was a tad bit under-seasonedWild mushrooms - the mushrooms themselves were fresh, but the dish had tooo much lemon and was a bit too sour / tart (they should have cut down on the lemon juice since there were tomatoes adding to the sourness too)Sigh, another fashionable but lackluster vegan spot :/","I was underwhelmed by the lack of options at this restaurant. Ordered the gazpacho and cashew halloumi. The gazpacho had cilantro although not stated on the menu (cilantro is very polarizing folks - if you're putting it in a dish, put it on the menu). Although it tasted nothing like halloumi, the cashew halloumi tasted great.","I have to say, this place is such a gem. Especially for vegans and vegetarians. I've been there several times and just love how creative and tasty their food is. The ambiance in the restaurant it amazing too, very cozy and usually not too crowded. The food is a little carb and fat heavy, but that's any veggie place in my opinion. Although I'm not only eating plant-based, I go because I like it and it's different. Try the cashew halloumi or any of the hummus options!Service has always been good, maybe on the slower side, but honestly I don't mind because I'm not always in a rush to get out. A little pricy perhaps, but worth the experience in my opinion. If you want to go just for a drink the bar is also a good option. Oh- and they have a small outdoor space when the weather permits!","I almost can't believe this place is only 2 years old. Rustic decor in the main dining room, beautiful bathroom accent pieces in frames of vegetables and a quaint outdoor area are only a few reasons why XYST is so special. It was my belated birthday celebration and the cuisine and presentations of all dishes were exceptional. We began with the truffle cheese crostini followed by smoked hummus, cauliflower, and avocado dukkah. We tried both of the low proofs drinks (so refreshing) and at the end the strawberry cheesecake with a rose matcha latte and chai. I wish I got our servers names but we dined on 9/23 at 6:30 pm. The lady and gentlemen were such a great pair and we felt taken care of from start to finish. They were hospitable, made us laugh and graciously took our picture at the end. I would highly recommend this gem of a restaurant.","Absolutely beautiful food! Their menu is great for sharing, with a mix of mezzes and mains. We got the smoked hummus, the chickpea and fava falafel, and the grilled eggplant. Everything was cooked perfectly and plated so prettily. It was quiet for a Saturday night, and the service was quick and warm. I would love to come back here for brunch and to try one of their desserts next time! I also definitely recommend their cocktails, especially the XYST Tonic.",XYST
367,The food and service here is excellent.. I've been back a few times and ordered a variety of dishes and I have always been pleased.. The only thing is that its considerably expensive... I get it's Manhattan but its a bit pricey.,"Ate for lunch today, had the fish cakes and the siem reap noodles.  Tasted okay, but not amazing.  Got food poisoning, suffering 12 hours later, muscle aches, chills, diarrhea, fatigue, the works.   Ate nothing but oatmeal and a grapefruit for breakfast, so this is almost certainly the source of the food poisoning.  Could be bad luck, but I won't be back.","This place is very good.The service was good and the food was excellent.It's a mix of Thai, Vietnamese, and Indian with a French influence.",THIS PLACE IS AWESOME- such a hidden gem with authentic food. Great atmosphere with a peaceful dining experience. Definitely a welcome break from the rush of midtown. Will definitely be back soon. Fish cakes are bomb. STILL FREAKING AMAZING. I had the Loc Lac and it was seriously the best beef I've had this year. Amazingly tender and worth every penny. I,THIS PLACE IS AWESOME- such a hidden gem with authentic food. Great atmosphere with a peaceful dining experience. Definitely a welcome break from the rush of midtown. Will definitely be back soon. Fish cakes are bomb.,"Went back for the third time. Still great ambience and laid back and consistent yummy food. Fish Cakes are highly recommended (that lemongrass is mwah) and the pork steamed dumplings too. We tried the steamed mussels too (I missed bread with my mussels tbh). I obviously ordered the Baked amok and it so delicious. The fish is perfectly cooked and has flavors complimenting the meat in the dish. The tricky part about curries is salt. Angkor is on point with that. We also had the roast duck dish (sorry had with names). DELICIOUS. This is now my must order here. The duck is tender with skin on so a tad crispy too. The veggies pair perfectly well with the dish. We tried the Banh Chao and that filling is so yummy. Crepe was burnt at places but I did not mind. Overall this place has not disappointed so far. ....This is my second time here. Both times I have received excellent food, service, and ambience. The veg dumplings, chicken skewer, and fish cakes are yummy. The baked amok and all their noodles (yes we needed up ordering one of each kind) was amazing. The baked amok comes with veggies and rice and is soft and flavorful. They explain their dishes very nicely if you ask them. They also suggest good wine pairs. I never had place for desert either times because the food is so good you tend to overeat. I highly recommend this place and I might come again :)",Angkor Cambodian Bistro
368,"Absolutely amazing, delicious, and affordable food. The pita bread is so fresh, i can't think of a better place to go anytime I'm craving this food. There's so many places in nyc to get Mediterranean/middle eastern food but I keep coming back to this place!It's the little things, like when they make their pita in house.",Went here while on a work trip to NYC. Small spot more so for take out or delivery. Food was fresh. They were out of all salads which at a med spot is not ok. Hence the 4 stars I ended up having falafel as I was hungry. It was flavorful l. Hummus was also well done.,"Hours on website, yelp, google maps and the window of the store note it is open till 11, though they close and turn down customers as early as 9:45. Pity.","Zyara is one of those local restaurants that I will never tire of. A small shop set in the bustling restaurant strip of Clinton Street, it can fit about 10 customers inside at a given time, and is easy to miss if you're not looking for it. And when you go once, you'll look for it every time. The first time I ever went in to check out the menu, the owner himself helped me at the counter and walked me through the menu. This kind of personal touch is truly what differentiates Zyara and makes it an establishment I will continue to return to in Manhattan. The food is incredibly flavorful, not to mention at an amazing price (especially for New York). The Vegan Arabic Sandwich has a mix of grilled vegetables and falafel, with a bit of spice and LOTS of flavor. I have also tried the chicken shawarma and baba ghanouj, both of which were splendid. If you don't have the time to visit the counter in person, they do deliver on Caviar and Seamless, however I recommend getting it fresh from the grill so that the pita is fresh!","Zyara is a cozy Middle Eastern counter-service eatery, thriving in the Lower East Side.Zyara is a relaxed takeout restaurant. the space is clean and brightly lit. there are a couple of small tables to dine in- max seating is like 7-9 people. there's also an additional two-top table outside. there's been a resurgence of casual Middle Eastern / Mediterranean eateries in the LES area and Zyara has been helping to lead that charge as evidenced by New York Magazine coverage of Zyara,. i can't say Zyara serves the best falafel ever, but it's pretty damn great. the falafel is on-point. crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, full of flavor and Middle Eastern spices. four of these falafel gems are stuffed into a pita along with jerusalem salad. and tahini is served on the side with the falafel pita. let me tell you the pita sandwiching all of these deliciousness are thick, yet pillowy...i'd guess they are baked in-house because they have that homemade touch. all said and done, the food here tastes fresh and you can smell, taste, and see it in the eats here.falafel pita is $7.75 + tax + tip. the menu is fairly wallet-friendly. however prices here have been rising rapidly. i feel like the falafel pita as well as other platter and sandwich options have has gone up a couple of dollars in just about a year. if you are ordering takeout/delivery, avoid Seamless/GrubHub, and just call the restaurant directly as the prices are much lower. the service is friendly and pretty much a one-man show by the owner. you can tell a lot of care goes into each dish served. when i was last here, the owner gave me a tiny cup of complimentary hot tea with my order and though it is a hot humid summer...that tea hit the spot! drops mic cuz i pita the fool who hasn't eat herei outzzz","Love, love, love. This small little unassuming spot serves up some excellent Mediterranean food. My boyfriend and I stopped in for a late dinner and the place was packed. You know it's gonna be good when a place is popular even at the off hours.We ordered the Arabic Shawarma and the Lamb Gyro plate to split. Both were delicious! The Arabic was crisp and slightly greasy from the press. It had this addicting garlic sauce that soaked up into the wrap. So satisfying. Also, the fries are crisp just how I like 'em. I only wish it came with an extra side of that sauce for dipping.The plate had similar elements, but was served with fresh Jerusalem salad and the best rice I've had in maybe, well, forever. It was fragrant, flavorful, and so memorable. I hate raisins with a fiery passion, but I loved them in the rice. It added a subtle sweetness that balanced out the other spices. The meat itself was on the drier side which I didn't mind since there was all that good good sauce. The ingredients themselves seem higher quality than your typical takeout spot which is A+ considering the prices are affordable.It's only been three days since we ate here and I'm already looking for an excuse to come back. If you haven't tried them yet, GO!",Zyara NY
369,"Made our way here on a Sunday afternoon and found 5 open tables to a surprise. Came with my wife and son so it was a relief to find it fairly empty. We ordered as soon as we sat as we know our son needs to eat right away before he gets not hungry but hAngry. After about 35 minutes, still no $1 oysters or cocktails to start. We saw the bartender making drinks for everyone at the bar first and finally got our drinks after we made it known to the waiter. 45 minutes later still no food and everyone that came after us had already gotten their food. At this point, my son was impatient and was crying nonstop. We finally got our oysters, steak tartare and pork cheeks. Oysters were tiny.  Steak tartare was dry and saltier than we would've liked with a strong lime aftertaste. Pork cheeks were tender with a great jaew sauce. At this point, we were rushing to finish our food to leave but had to wait another 20 minutes for our crab curry. Table in front of us got their crab curry dish before us and they arrived after us. No apology whatsoever for the delay but instead the server says, ""yes of course, it's on the way"". Seriously? When? Next year? Service took so long that people who arrived after us finished their meal before we did. Was the food good? Yea. But not worth the price point and delay of service.","Cuisine: 6Service: 7Decor: 7Value: 6Overall: 6Let's be honest, it's a Thai restaurant in downtown Manhattan. If you want truly authentic Thai food for a decent price, go to Woodside, Queens. Take a trip out there and try Ayada Thai, Sripraphai, Playground, and many more. However, if you're simply looking for some Thai cuisine that taste good and don't care about money, then this could be the place for you.The space is long and narrow, with a bar in the back of the restaurant where the open kitchen is. The aromas of different Thai spices permeate the room. Everything was decent but nothing was special. The crab curry did have the largest lump crab meat I have ever seen, however the curry was so salty that I needed lots of water. Another dish was tasty, but a bit lost since it's spicier than anything I had in Bangkok. If they can fix up some of these problems, I would love to try those dishes again.",Most bang for your buck Malaysian fare I've ever come across. Rice will make any Asian cry from happiness.,"The dollar oysters (from CAN) were forgettable but the cocktails were not. I fell in love with my spicy mango... that was channeling sticky mango rice, I think... but was a cold slushy perfect dessert in a glass that has complex notes and good liquor while still keeping you on diet track. Beautiful. And his Thai old fashion was certainly different and he thoroughly enjoyed it. Attention to detail and accoutrement is key. Decor, plateware, sauces even the shrimp chip table starter was so smart. Now let's get the meat. We shared the crab fried rice and the shrimp curry in a bowl with an amazing assortment of veggies and starfruit. The crab fried rice was perfect golden fluffy and simple. But littered with chunks of crabmeat. Yes. That is a good thing you did there FC. And that curry! I'm sorry I may be butchering a most elaborate name for this dish (on the mid-bottom right of the menu) but I most certainly wouldn't skimp on description. A gorgeous soft turmeric coat that is almost butter rich and round filled a bowl of select shrimp meat and topped with bits of shallot and a bit a citrus. White Napa, long beans, skinless stalks of cucumber, mango, starfruit completed with basil and mint surrounded this curry for dipping or wrapping and dousing. We did both of course and were unanimous that this dish should come with a bowl of white rice it was so so flavorful. Course we had our fried rice and used that. Needless to say we did all but lick both plates clean. Holy heck, FC i get the hype. You deserve it and more. I can't wait to be back to try more thoughtfully and uniquely concocted dishes. Props to the petite manager with super style and great bedside manners in explaining every question we had as well.","I was so excited to try Fish Cheeks after hearing it toted as a trendy new casual-upscale Thai place in downtown NYC. We can always use more places like this! The restaurant itself evokes the feel of a Southeast asian eatery with tables packed closely together, lovely wooden basket lights hanging from a high ceiling, and a colorful, bright interior. We made reservations in advance which I would highly recommend as this place gets packed. Unfortunately, we missed the happy hour which goes from 5-7pm. We arrived early, but were informed that since our reservation was at 7pm we would not be allowed to order drinks before that time. I was pretty surprised considering there is a bar that you would think would be available to customers who are waiting for their table. The whole thing was kind of surprising and disappointing. Once we were finally seated and then (finally) allowed to order drinks and we chose the spicy mango and the butterfly effect. The spicy mango was a hit but I would stay away from the butterfly effect which has a pretty unpleasant flavor. Luckily, things improved once we ordered the food. A word of warning that this is a VERY seafood heavy menu. We decided to try the grilled pork cheeks, grilled branzino, and the vegan green curry. The grilled pork cheeks were very juicy and flavorful strips, perfect for a meat eater looking for a more decadent appetizer. We were very leased with the mains as well. The grilled branzino comes wrapped in foil and when opened revealed a perfectly cooked piece of white fish accompanied by a lovely peanut sauce. Additionally, the vegan curry was very well done - with vegetables including broccoli and eggplant simmered in a flavorful thai basil and red finger chili curry. This was both light and filling at the same time. We were very pleased. Overall, despite a rocky start with the happy hour, we had a very nice time and thought that the food really met the mark. I would recommend coming with a small group due to the tight space and making a reservation, but it's definitely worth a try!",Food: 2/5Is it me or is the food subpar now? I think the best thing we ordered were the oysters. It came with friend shallots and a green sauce. Very tasty and only $1 during HH! Would definitely recommend! The crab with glass noodles were very very very dry and lacked flavor. Definitely not worth the $25 price. The presentation was nice but easily duplicable at home. Nothing special. The crab curry was also mediocre. It was packed with spice which I somewhat enjoyed but it sort of tasted like melted peanut butter and chili.Did I order wrong?Service: 5/5Our waitress was super nice and attentive. She was such a dear!Ambiance: 3/5Cute and cozy. This place is called Fishcheek so expect fish/scales decor everywhere. There's only one toilet for the establishment.

370,My boyfriend and I went to DeStefanos with a groupon for brunch. He ordered the steak and eggs and I ordered the French Toast with berry compote and a cannoli-cream topping. The food was excellent. The only negative thing I could say is that there was very little steak with the steak and eggs but the groupon deal made the meal worth it overall.,Had brunch steak and had to order another because the steak was so damn good. Juicy fatty and just right amount of saltiness. Perfect brunch experiece. Took out 1 star bc of the interior which I wasnt too fond of. It is just personal preference.,"One of my least favorite steakhouse in NYC. My friends and I came here awhile back on a Saturday night for a spontaneous dinner. The only reason we went here was because of the availability during prime time, otherwise we would've went to another steakhouse if we had time to make reservations. The bacon was good and crispy. The steak was a little dry and chewy, even though we asked for medium rare. They had different steak sauces, and their signature one was meh. I mixed it with another sauce and it tasked better.One thing that made this experience very below mediocre is their knives. It's steakhouse and you should expect sharp steak knives! Instead we got knives that resembled butter knives. It was not sharp. We also suspect the waiter overheard our dissatisfaction and scratched my boyfriend's card on purpose. After this night, he was not able to use his card again because it was damaged.","My husband and I love going to DeStefano's for birthdays! The food is on par with all of the big steakhouses, but it is so much easier to get a reservation here. The steaks - done to perfection! The sides - the bacon is a must!! The desserts - go for the creme brulee cheesecake!! If you happen to be in NYC and are trying to get into Peter Lugers - just go here instead, it wont disappoint.","My fiancée and I came for a celebration dinner. We ordered a half bottle of a Pinot noir to share for the dinner. We started with the burrata caprese . The balsamic vinaigrette on the dish was delicious. I was sure to dip the bread and to scrap off every last bit of vinaigrette.For our main course, we stared the porterhouse cooked medium rare with sides of mashed potatoes and creamer spinach. Their steak preparation is different in that there was a black pepper crust. The service was attentive, helpful, and wonderfully friendly. All the other parties in the room were celebrating birthdays so it seems like DeStefano's is the spot for celebrations!","Review is for the veal and the ribeye.Wow.The veal was very lean, which isn't my favorite, but I didn't order it - my wife did. Anyway, be forewarned. The sauce is incredible though.The ribeye was phenomenal. Herbaceous sauce and oil was fantastic, and the cook was insane.Uh... what else to say?

They are ok in terms of food taste, authenticity, or quality -- it's just that they are not particularly good or bad.  Having been in the NYC restaurant scene the past two decades, however, it's difficult to recommend this place.  It's probably ok for those living in Chinatown or downtown area, but for others with more discerning palate or who prefer the vibrancy and diversity of Korean cuisines, go head out to K-town.","We stopped by early on a Saturday evening after reading the Yelp reviews and were seated immediately. We ordered the fried chicken appetizer and the tofu soup/bulgogi combo which was more than enough food for two people. The fried chicken was perfectly moist, the soup was just right for a cold day, and the bulgogi was light but flavorful. I would try Tofu Tofu again in a heartbeat.","This was my first time here and I have to say, the customer service here is great! I love Korean food and the vibe in the restaurant was all around calm and cozy. The place is warm for a cold weather outside which is very nice. It is nicely decorated all around and very clean. K-Pop was also playing on the speaker and I really enjoyed it since I am a big K-Pop fan. My friends and I ordered food took share for dinner. We ordered Seafood Pancake, Tteokbokki, LA Short Ribs combo, and a Bibimbap. We also received complimentary side dishes which they refilled when we finished. In addition, they also give you a complimentary steamed egg to share which was delicious. The food was all very good, but I feel like the Short Ribs aren't what I wanted because they didn't have much meat on it. Our waitress was very kind and even refilled our cups when she noticed we were running low of water. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this restaurant! The free WiFi here is a plus as well! Update: This was my third time here and I expect to come regularly whenever I wrap up late at night. The owner is super nice and humble towards her customers. I 100% recommend this place for their food and customer. Update: I am now basically a regular at the restaurant. The owner here is soooooo down to earth and she even remembers my friends and I! We haven't visited in a while, but she was so warm and welcoming. She even gave us dumplings on the house!

372,"I didn't know that The Grey Dog had multiple locations other than the one in SoHo. The one in Chelsea has a low key vibe and quite spacious, and also comes with Wi-fi. The coffee and the pastry were good! It starts to get a little rowdy when it hits happy hour. But I think it's a great cafe to kill time and chill!","We had so much fun here! I am such an animal love that I just couldn't help myself!!!  with this being our first time here.... It helps to know (now) that when you walk in, go to the right and stand in line to place your order. After you order, they'll give you your drinks and you find a table. When your food is ready they will call your name and bring it to your table. We ordered the Ahi (tuna) taco's and seared tuna salad. Everything tasted good, but I think I should have gone with my (gut) and had the French toast!  I saw that they had pancakes in the shape of dog bones on the menu! I'm getting that next time too! It is a little loud but we could still hear each other so no biggie. They are open to all types as we had a grouchy weird guy sit next to us ‍ We still had a good time.","Had a breakfast here this morning and ordered a classic burger. For a 13 dollar burger, this is maybe the worst I've had in NYC. The bread was soaking wet when served (maybe because of the salad seasoning?) and the taste was very blend - as if there was no seasoning to the beef at all.That's okay if the beef patty was at least fresh - but unfortunately that was not the case. The beef tastes like the ones you forgot in the fridge for weeks - it has that rotten smell in it.The place is surely in a good location and I liked the vibe. But the burger is a no no for me.","Hey business ownerThanks for all the great Gluten free optionsThanks for the cocoa dog paws on my lattes Thanks for your staff being so upbeat And, please take note and recognize:*Haley!!!*","I gave this location another chance after having regular excellent experiences at the Mulberry street location.What can I say... Nothing but amazing!Always give 'em a second chance: even Darth Vader found redemption :)The staff's always been super nice, they've told me when the kitchen's open, coffee's been great, they give me the often-neglected end of the GF zucchini loaf, the seating is cozy...When I have a work day that promises to be a challenge, I try to go here for breakfast and it always sets my mood back on a better course!","Wow - what a disappointment.I was in the neighborhood early and thought it would be great to have breakfast before work for a change.  Sign says open at 6:30, at 7:15 it seemed safe.  I went in and the seemingly very helpful counterperson told me that the kitchen opens at 7:30.  Not a problem, I ordered my breakfast, took my tea, and sat down to read and wait.At 7:30 she came over to tell me that the kitchen is just now starting to prep and my food ""won't be ready"" - she offered me a refund for the eggs, which I took but I'm still out the time I wasted, the cost of the unconsumed, then unwanted tea, the chance for breakfast and the $2 I put in the tip jar.What a joke.

373,"John Michael = #1 bartender. Also, get the veggie burger.","Friday at 6:30pm June 17th, 2016, lot of people but shouldn't be too much for 2 bartenders (white guy wth short hair and a white lady w/ brown blonde ombré hair)Took him 15min for our 2 drinks, but it really wasn't the bartender's fault. STOP IT- DON'T JUDGE HIM; He was EXTREMELY BUSY MACKIN' on 2 girls at the end of the bar for about 10min (While I saw him pouring my whiskey at a snail-pace). ALSO, in between making our drinks, he was flirting/touching/tickling his fellow lady bartender, so I get it, it's all about priorities people! Find a job you love and you'll never work a day in your life, because HE DEFN WAS doing more lovin' than workin'!! She would also come over and tickle/ interrupt him while he made drinks for other ppl as well..Ampersand Old Fashioned - Went down smooth, but maybe the brandy made this a little too sweet","This dimly lit, cocktail bar with chill industrial vibes has delicious drinks without being too snooty. Came on a Wednesday night and it was about 80% full. Still happening but noise level was easily low enough to have a conversation. I got the poblano sour which consisted of mezcal, chili, lemon, and egg white. It was creamy and not too sweet with a smoky finish. 110% would recommend. The bartender an attentive ninja. Never noticed his presence yet my water was always refilled and he was there when we needed him.","Classic. Stylish. Fantastic.This bar offers a unique blend of true cocktail drinks without the typical pretentiousness one might expect from a bar of this caliber. My friends and I came here on a busy Friday night without any expectations and were blown away by the drinks menu. Pages of cocktail combinations and a bartender that served us pretty quickly amidst other waiting customers. The lighting is smooth and dimly lit, perfect for a true evening out with coolness. Many of their drinks looked outstanding including the Oaxaca Old Fashioned - mixed with mescal and erved exceptionally smoky. I ordered the negroni which contained the perfect combo of ingredients. The music was non-intrusive lounge. The bar had plenty of seating available while the walls were industrial and polished: a nice mix of classy chic and authentic rustic. A+ service, drinks and ambiance - what more could you ask for?",My friends and I went here late last night. I had the Oaxaca Old Fashioned and it was spectacular! It's made with mezcal and makes it exceptionally smoky and very very tasty. My friends tried a few different drinks and they loved their selection as well. Their menu has something for everyone!!! I love the setting of this place! Great seating options for larger groups or couples and a very nice bar area. My bill came out to be $28 not including my tip yet. I think that's great pricing for the drink I got. I would definitely come back to this spot next time I am back in town.,"Fantastic bar that's not too far from me! My friend was in town for a weekend so our group wanted to take the evening to hang out together. We were looking for something that was more low key and Ampersand had the perfect vibe. We went around midnight and grabbed seats at the bar. Service was a bit slow but it was busy so it was understandable. Most of us started off with the Hot One, which was a delicious tequila drink. A table ended up opening so our group migrated over. Ampersand was the perfect setting for our lively group as the atmosphere was energetic but subdued enough for our thorough catching up conversations! It was a perfect night and we ended up staying for a few hours. The drinks were fantastic as well and I definitely look forward to coming back and trying more!",Ampersand
374,The food here is always solid. The service can be spotty on busier nights. Ambiance consistently vibrant. You can't go wrong with the pasta dishes but I haven't had anything here I didn't like.,"Taste was great! We were blown away by every dish. Not quite traditional Italian as we expected, but somewhat adapted to American flavor. But overall the food, service, and drinks all exceeded our expectation! The only disappointment we had was the environment - it wasn't quite impressive. We were attracted by the first few images posted on Yelp. In the end, those images turned out to be just about the private dining room, which wouldn't be accessed unless you book a private event. The interior decor, ambience, bar settings outside the private room were pretty much average - didn't quite match our expectation!","ADDENDUM:  The manager of Locanda Verde was kind enough to phone, and he asked specifically what went wrong.  I realize how amazingly vigilant and magnanimous his query was.  He certainly wanted to make amends.  I shall return to Locanda Verde and give them a chance to return to their former glory. I was horribly disappointed by my Saturday lunch at Locanda Verde.  Locanda Verde has been a regular ""go to"" for years, and I have never been disappointed.  Is it under new management or ownership, because the food and service were subpar? My older sister drove over two hours from her home in Woodstock to join us, and I was embarrassed by the lassez faire service and the amateurish and boring food.  Our poor experience started at the bar, where my Pimm's Cup took over 15 minutes to make.  This is not a complicated cocktail.  The bartenders never maintained eye contact or explained the delay. It was uncomfortable and disquieting.  We moved to a table once my sister arrived, and the server was rushed, impersonal, and flippant.  Food arrived and every dish, including our Bolognese pasta, was chain restaurant weak, created with no skill or creativity.  I must surmise there was a change at Locanda Verde and now there is no expectation of quality. Sadly, another one of my favorite NYC restaurants bites the dust.  Nothing lasts forever,",Fresh food in a dark smoky modern house. I read that dim restaurants make you eat more. This is not a problem with what's being served at Locanda verde. Each dish had fresh ingredients and were obviously sourced from high quality markets. I particularly enjoyed eating the prosciutto with Asian pear which was a different touch. My tagliatelle although vegetarian was hearty but the best pasta dish was truly the ravioli.The high ceilings don't seem to detract from the intimate atmosphere here. Definitely a nice place to just have a drink as well. Our server had excellent knowledge of the wine options here and what to expect.,"Made a reservation in advance for 2 in a Saturday night and ended up sitting outside. - complimentary bread: just one piece per person, but so good - octopus starter: so good - my husband got a fish main. Cod maybe? It was actually very tasty & seemed like it has some broth-type sauce on it, as in healthy and tasty! - I got the scallops - larger than I was expecting, and very good - we thought we needed a side so we got the broccoli. Meh on the broccoli, but by this point we were saving room for dessert - shared the peach cobbler, which is highly recommend I was stuffed when we left and can't wait to go back and try more. Like the ricotta toast. It's probs ~$100/person for dinner, depending on drinks of course","Came here for brunch with a couple of girlfriends and enjoyed the experience, some dishes are better than others. Pros:- Beautiful space in a lovely neighborhood- Attentive and friendly service- Love and recommend the Black & White Banana Monkey Bread for the table, Sheep's Milk Ricotta, Insalata di Rucola, and Scampi and Grits. The dishes are perfectly cooked with fresh ingredients and super flavorful. Cons:- I ordered the very popular Hazelnut-Crusted French Toast (garnished with citrus & mint) but was completely disappointed with the dish. For a steep price of $22, I was presented with 2 pieces of DRY, tasteless toast which I had to douse in maple syrup to enjoy. The hazelnuts were not even truly part of the toast, but was just laid around and on top as decoration along with a couple of small slices of oranges. It was so subpar I barely finished 1 piece and should have called it back. Not sure why this was raved about on Yelp. - My friend had the Uova Modenese (cotechino hash, spinach, tomato hollandaise) and the hash was so salty it was hard to eat.",Locanda Verde
375,"Went on a Saturday night, way too loud (92+db). Food was good. I wouldn't go back because of the noise.",We were extremely disappointed with dinner at Glasserie. The food was very heavy and the flavors were off. We found it extremely overpriced for being outside of Manhattan. The mezzes do not come with bread and the griddle bread ($8) was very greasy. We also did not care for the wine we ordered and ended up leaving half the bottle. Overall there are much better Mediterranean/Middle Eastern options.,"We were 4 people for dinner. Got seated on 4 broken, wobbly wooden folding chairs at a three foot table. We were squirming uncomfortably before our water glasses were filled. Then a waiter passes by bringing food to another table, his body odor made us get up and leave. Have no idea how the food is, but the atmosphere is horrible.","Come here for brunch or dinner!! Or have a drink because the decor is beautiful.Mezze feast for brunch (the bread is to die for), the cauliflower, spring salad, and lamb.. their menu is seasonal but everything is delicious!","what came on the plate didn't match the price(s) that were charged AND the ""scam"" pricing structure for the bread to eat with dishes that traditionally come with bread in the first place was a complete turn-off.$8 for 4 pieces of grilled bread as an add-on to a dish that one would expect to come with bread in the first place. two orders of bread were needed to properly compliment that dishe(s).$19 for a standard Manhattan is also a price point that was WELL above what was in my glass. ESPECIALLY since their signature cocktails are listed at $14. ($16 for the rye and +$3 to complete the cocktail.  scam!)I won't be going back to this restaurant.","Oof, madon'! Really charming Mediterranean restaurant. For starters, I loved how all the tables were around this big central bar. The vibe was rustic chic, as many of this cuisine tends to be.We had this fun, funky wine. Delicious.The chicken was juicy and cooked well. The fish was well-cooked, but a more difficult dish. Both cooked super well, though I preferred the chicken. The clams in rice dish was good, more for the rice drenched in clam/whatever sauce.The olives were plentiful. The labneh is delicious. So refreshing. The smoked eggplant was great, too. The pita breads are sooo good, but the baked, crispy, buttery one is phenomenal. We ordered it twice.A bit pricey, to be honest. But such a great vibe, whatever.",Glasserie
376,Very authentic polish food and nice atmosphere inside. The food is very heavy and oily but it was tasty.,"#A big Roasted Hock in Beer, which I had with a large beer. #A lot of food and good price. #Tasty",Best polish food in Brooklyn always fresh..I recommend the salmon tartar ..love the decor and the way the waitress dress...only bad thing is that they dont take reservations,"Karczma, where do I begin? Everything in this place is sooo good. When you walk in, you'll see that this place looks very traditionally adorned. There is a full bar to your left, and there are wooden tables throughout the restaurant. The restaurant is a decent size, and has plenty of booth- seating. They have a few tables that are in the middle of the booths, but it doesn't seem like they can accommodate a large party. The menu has very traditional Polish dishes. They have a platter of Polish specialties which I love ordering because it has a mix of some of their popular appetizers: hunter's stew, potato pancakes, stuffed cabbage, kielbasa, and pierogis. They have several different kinds of pierogis (cheese, sauerkraut) but the meat one is my favorite. I recommend getting them fried. The plate of Polish specialties is generous portion, sufficient enough to be an entree for 1 person, or shared appetizer for 2-3 people. For the soup, I recommend the white borscht soup - ask for it to be served in a bread bowl. For the entrees, we ordered a special of the day - the rabbit stew with potato dumplings and a beet salad, and also the spicy beef goulash, which was served on top of potato pancakes. Our favorite part of the meal was the appetizers. We thought the sauce for the rabbit wasn't that flavorful, but the beet salad that it came with was just soooo good and addicting. It was a nice balance of sweet and freshness to cut the heaviness of the meals. My spicy beef goulash was a nice hearty portion, but I was a little disappointed that it wasn't spicy at all (it was good nevertheless).For dessert, we ordered apple pie. Let me tell you, this apple pie was one of the best ones I've ever had, even though they didn't have ice cream here. It had copious amounts of sliced apples, and the crust portion of the pie was dense and cake-like. The pie was drizzled in chocolate sauce, and served with dollops of whipped cream. It wasn't too sweet nor too heavy, but the portion is quite large and is more than enough to share amongst two people. I love coming back here because of how great the food is, but the prices make it even more appealing to come back. Two large beers, one appetizer, two entrees, a dessert, and a dessert cocktail (plus tip) was less than $100, plus we had leftovers to bring home!","I came with my mom on a holiday weekend evening, and we got the last table. We were asked to switch to a smaller table while we were looking at the menu, which we happily obliged because the table we were at was huge for two.Anyway, we decided to share the Polish platter, which came with 1 sauerkraut & mushroom / 1 meat / 1 potato & cheese pierogi, a piece of Kielbasa sausage, one stuffed cabbage with tomato sauce, 2 potato pancakes, hunter stew, and a container of sour cream. To preface my review, the first time I had Polish food was in Poland, so my standards may be a bit high. The food here was pretty good with regards to other Polish food I've had in the US, but of course not as good as in Poland. The pierogi skin was chewy and not too thick, which is rare to find in the US. The meat one had too much meat and it was basically just eating a chunk of meat without any other flavor, and the sauerkraut & mushroom was sticky, which I've never experienced before at any Polish restaurant. I didn't like the stickiness at all. My favorite pierogi was the potato and cheese one because it was flavorful and light. The Kielbasa sausage was quite tasty as well, even though the piece was small. I usually love goblaki, which is the stuffed cabbage, but this one just had way too much meat and too little rice; the balance was off, and there was too little sauce. The potato pancakes were thick and had a great thickness and consistency, but it didn't have much flavor. The hunter stew was really sour and I didn't enjoy it, but I didn't like hunter stew in Poland either so it may not be this particular restaurant's hunter stew that I don't like.It was a lot of food, and service was present. I would say I might return for the cheese and potato pierogi and maybe potato pancakes if they serve it with some flavorful sauce, but I wouldn't return for anything else we had on that plate.Price was quite fair for the amount of food as it came out to be around $16 post-tax.","PURCHASED: Chicken noodle soup + Pierogies w/ that meat covered in cabbage (see photos)TOTAL: $ ~14.00 with t. and t. PROS:+ excellent portion: once again, cannot express how they fill you up. Most restaurants that you go to will make you pay $14 for something that leaves you feeling hungry. In my last review I made the note that I was a moderate to heavy eater. That means I like to eat a lot like a fat american. I hope that says something about what I can handle. + waitresses: are polish. They're straight forward and nice. Owner is a man. + popular spot: I came for lunch at this most recent time. The other times I have come were at dinner. I have missed checking in on multiple occasions. I have really been here plenty of times. CONS:- NothingIMPRESSION:This is a 5-star restaurant because it leaves me feeling heavy--literally the portions are heavy. If it's lunch time, go for the lunch special (first few pages). Choose the chicken noodle soup (SO GOOD, way better than canned generic chicken noodle soup) + the pierogies with the stuffed cabbage. It is bomb and I will certainly come back. Please see photos for the lunch I received. Note: there are other things that you saw photos of that were from other occasions. I do not recommend the Hunter's Stew with a sausage. Karczma is EXCELLENT.",Karczma
377,"Food is just meh though and quite pricey for the portions. We got the head on peel n' eat shrimp, king crab roll, and New England clam chowder. Shrimp barely had any flavor even though it was supposed to be cooked in a spicy cajun boil. Quality was questionable as well as some of the shrimp heads were all black. Clam chowder and King Crab roll were just okay. I think after a beer, soda, food, and tip/tax, it was around $80. Cool place to hang out in the summer to grab a drink and play corn hole, but would pass on the food.","Generally anywhere that serves crab I am all for- however, charging $34 for about a pound of snow crab is a bit ridiculous.. there are multiple places in Manhattan alone that have a better bang for your buck, as well as better flavor.I ordered the snow crab basket with cajun seasoning and garlic butter. I'm not sure how they put on their cajun seasoning, but I couldn't even get it off my fingers let alone on the crab itself. The garlic butter was also a bit of a disappointment. Wouldn't order the basket here again.The other people I was with had decent looking meals, but again, the portion sizes were just way too small for the price and the quality. If they elevated the restaurant, I could understand it a bit more, but for what it is - wouldn't go back unfortunately","Solid stop on a quiet Friday post-holiday afternoon with the boyfriend. We were lucky that we got there early enough so we found parking right on Reed and there wasn't too long of a wait for corn hole. The staff is always super kind and very attentive. We did some damage on some king crab claws, popcorn shrimp, a few beers and some mixed drinks.For those who complain about long lines and wait times, you get what you come for. You get in late, you'll wait. No doubt. If you play your cards right and start early you can still have a reasonable experience. I've had the cramped, long line, wave-at-the-bartender, kind of evenings, but that's when I drag a$$ and take too long to get there.","Love! We've been twice now, it's one of the few restaurants I don't mind receiving a longer wait time since the bar/downstairs area is awesome! Food is consistent, drinks are a bit pricey considering the beach shack vibe but hey it's NY. Definitely reccomend.UPDATE: my friend left their work briefcase here after a group of us came for dinner. When we called the next day, we were told the closing manager put it in a safe and we could come pick it up anytime. Beyond grateful for the manager going above and beyond to keep it safe.","Love!

My fiancé ordered the popcorn shrimp which was pretty solid, but the Alaskan crab roll that I ordered was really tiny and had a lot of shell in the meat. We also got a side of Mac and cheese that looked good but turned out to be pretty disappointing. Zero flavor, just tasted like a thick unseasoned mess.

378,Welp! I don't know if it was because we were the last customers but.... disappointed it how we left. It was our anniversary and all I wanted was fish and chips. My husband ordered a fish sandwich. The fries were crispy and hot but the fish was a soggy mushy tasteless mess. The best part of the meal was the appetizer(general tso cauliflower) and the desert (churros/ice cream). The drinks weren't good either. It just felt like a complete waste of our anniversary dinner and a waste of money. $105 dollars later we are home trying to find something appetizing to eat. The service was great but we can't eat that.,"First of all, we waited for a host to seat us for about 10 minutes. Nobody greeted us or paid attention to the fact that we walked in. I had to ask the bartender to seat us. He did. Second of all, we waited another 10-15 minutes to at least GET WATER!!! Well... nobody greeted us at the table either. I asked for the manager and bartender came and brought us water AT LAST. What is this? Is this for real??? I have meant to try this place for a while and this is the kind of service I get? Disgusting.",I came in for nice fish and chips but was quiet disappointing honestly. It was not crunch at all and was very wet :( cole slaw was okay nothing special. Malt vinegar was pretty bland.

(Three Stars?).  What do I like?  Well, this restaurant offers an assortment of fresh and tasty seafood at an accessible price point; the restaurant is spacious and modern; and the service is warm and attentive.But, the service was ""too attentive.""  The meal was rushed.  Our entrees were served before we could finish our appetizer and we were in and out the door in under an hour.  Our meal was mixed.  The appetizer was disappointing.  We ordered the Maryland Crab Dip - which had plenty of cheese, but not a lot of crab (there were no chunks of crab).  It tasted like cheese purée with crab flavoring.  For $22, I expect crab and more than a handful of tortilla chips.  The chips are only good for half the amount of dip served, and we required a tortilla refill.  Our entrees were solid - Fish & Chips and The Reel Deal (make your own meal!).  The fish was tasty, well prepared, well seasoned, and well portioned.I think this place has potential - certain menu items required better execution and the pacing was just off.  Also, turn down the volume on the music.  It's not a club!  It was difficult to converse without raising my voice.","Clam chowder runny, had one clam in it.

First impression was so good we ordered again for a business lunch. First impressions are always the lasting ones so thankfully our first impression was stellar but not so much for our second impression.First time I ordered lunch the person delivering came in with such enthusiasm and setup the food with such PRIDE! The second time I ordered the delivery person was not exactly enthusiastic and in my haste I gave the guy only like a 5% tip on a $600 order. Granted I normally tip at the very least 10% but I was so busy I quickly wrote a tip and didn't think twice about it until the delivery guy looked down at the receipt then looked up at me in sheer dread!I was kind of confused to the change in temperament and thought, ""Is he mad that I couldn't find him and he waited outside too long?"" but I did ask him specifically where was he outside. As he left to the freight elevator and his demeanor still felt a little hostile it dawned on me I didn't even consider how much I tipped him. I even helped carry the bags of food upstairs so I should get half his tip (LOL)! I'm the type to call a restaurant back to demand they add additional tip if I realize my error, I work a very busy office and it's usually easier to include tips with the order but Galata doesn't have online ordering (it's over the phone). I'm not a total douchebag and do normally tip fairly. I've even been told by my finance department I sometimes tip too much!Shitty delivery guy aside. Food is absolutely amazing and they make catering easy with 3 pre-fixed menu choices to select from. The two occasions we've ordered from here my business guests were extremely pleased with the food.",Galata Mediterranean Cuisine
380,"given so many Japanese restaurant options around, this ""Izakaya"" offers bad food. really salty fried chicken. really wet omelette. and certainly overcharged main dishes. you cannot feel any protein in their fried rice, ramen or curry. it's just not worth it. i really do not know how it getting the 4-ish scoreplus it offers Chinese food?! what is that? an Asian fusion?","It's my first time to write absolutely negative review. Really bad food, they can't do fried chicken well, use one type of sauce to deal with different dishes, almost no chicken In curry chicken.","Location: east village. Place is extremely tiny so be prepared with sharing space with others.  Because of the limited space, you have to reserve to secure your spot especially on a Friday night. The dining atmosphere is bad if you decide to come in the winter time. I was cold AF while seating there waiting for the food and the owner/waitresses seems to give 0 fuck about how customers felt. I mean, if you see lots of customers start to rewear their coat in your restaurant, you should know that something is wrong with your air conditioner?!Food: addictive cabbage is too salty to keep eating. Agexxxtofu is okay but not the best from my Japanese dining history at NYC. Japanese styles fries is just a joke that I would rather buy McDonald'ss fries. And the best we had was the nanbang chicken. Well, to be honest with eveyone, still not the best fried chicken. Service: horrible. We were there very early and probably was the first/second order. But they kept us waiting for our food while people who were behind us got their dishes. You may argue: it's because we ordered the different dishes. But the truth is that's exactly the same dishes we order and somehow they decide to give out to others and kept us waiting. I barely encountered things like this in NYC. This is bit unprofessional. I had many good Japanese dining experience here in NYC. I never complained. I seldom gave 1 star for restaurant because I know this can impact lots of peoples lives. But being cheap doesn't allow you to give bad service to customers. This is for sure a 1 star experience I","I visited Izakaya on a Friday night with my boyfriend. We made reservations ahead of time because this place is super busy, especially on weekends. We started off our meal with the Addictive cabbage, the addictive cucumbers, and the corn fritters. We LOVED the cabbage and cucumbers. They are a must try. The corn fritters were a bit of a miss for us, but the rest of the meal made up for their mediocrity.  My boyfriend really enjoyed his salmon onigiri and salmon sashimi. The absolute star of the show, however, was the chicken and cheese curry dish we shared. It was honestly one of the best things I've ever eaten. I finished the meal with the chicken nanban which was super yummy too. I highly recommend it. For drinks throughout the evening, I had the lemon fizz (soju, lemon, and seltzer) and the boyf had their ube plum wine cocktail. We both loved our drinks. This is some of the best Japanese in all of NYC! Five stars are well deserved.","Relaxed spot to hang out, drink sake and eat Japanese-style pub food in a group.I came in a group of four on a Saturday night w/o reservation (wait was 1.5 hours) and the majority of the restaurant was also filled with groups leisurely eating and drinking. We had the addictive cabbage (it was sort of just cabbage...), scallop sashimi (fresh!), grilled eggplant, seaweed tempura (ordered this twice it was so good to snack on), ponzu fried chicken, skirt steak yakiniku, mentaiko omelette, and vongole ramen spaghetti (sounds strange, tastes great). We were stuffed and could've done with one less dish.Also one reviewer wrote that there's no tipping but I do not remember seeing that anywhere on the menu or website, and the receipt had a line to add tips, so I recommend double checking when you pay.","*takes reservations**no tipping restaurant* Small hole in the walls rarely ever disappoint, and Izakaya is just another great example of that. Chicken Nanban - very juicyAddictive Cabbage - indeed addictive, and refreshingAddictive Cucumber - refreshing and yummyThick Salmon Sashimi - good sized pieces and freshYakitori skewer - yummyIzakaya Pudding - kind of like flanMatcha Brulee - personally I wish this was a bit more bitter",Izakaya
381,"Came here the tonight, order the classic meatball with spaghetti but it wasn't fully cooked.  I felt nauseous afterwards, since the meatballs has pork in it shouldn't they make sure it's cooked fully. Unacceptable.","Weird that for the bowl, it says any side, but when I tried to order the cucumber salad side or the quinoa salad side, I was told those couldn't go into a bowl because they were ""cold dishes""? Kind of weird and didn't make sense to me","This place is great but what they don't tell you is that there is pork in EVERY ball except the veggie which is not tasty. I was here with people who cannot eat pork because of their religious beliefs and found out too late they did. The menu should state as the description of their meatballs  ""chicken and pork"" and ""classic beef and pork"" instead of just ""chicken"" and ""classic  beef"".  At the very least include a food description with the ingredients like every other restaurant in NYC does. To do less with so many Muslims and Jews in this city is just shameful.","Passed by a few of these locations during my driving thru the city. But to be honest with you, this one, I have passed numerous times, but wasn't aware it was there. They do not have their name on the awning! They have it on the side walk signs, so if I car is parked there, you don't know it's the Meatball Shop! But we chose this one because of the reviews. And they were true!  Rey good food, excellent service. I would go back again. We shared the wedge salad, wasn't the best I have had, but it was good. I had the spicy pork meatballs over polenta! It was amazing to the last fork full! My husband had the quinoa salad with the spicy pork balls. All was very good. And so reasonably priced!","I went to the Meatball Shop around 1 pm on a Sunday. There was no wait and we were able to be seated immediately. Despite there not being much people in the restaurant, service was fairly slow. We had to wait a bit to order and paying our bill took a bit of time. However and most importantly, we did not have to wait very long for food once we placed our order. The food itself was just okay. I got a bowl with the spicy sauce with pork meatballs. The meatballs themselves were fairly plain - without the sauce on them they didn't have much seasoning. Given they give you 4 meatballs in a serving, it was very filling and I did leave satisfied which is a concern for me at Italian restaurants especially in New York where they are so stingy on meat portions. Overall just okay for sit down, but think it would be a great carry out option. They are also open fairly late if you're craving Italian late night!","Grabbed an early dinner here after doing some shopping on the west side. Got street parking about a block away and walked over. Got there about 4:30 and some tables were taken but we managed to get a nice table near the window, small but nice.Being our first time there the waitress explained how the balls worked, naked, with sides, build a bowl, etc. she also told us the specials. We split the wedge salad which was good but could have used a bit more dressing. Then my wife had the spicy pork balls with polenta and classic sauce and I had the spicy pork balls over quinoa and cauliflower with pesto sauce on the side. Both were very good. Service was excellent and bathroom was very clean. Definitely would come back here.",The Meatball Shop
382,"Came here for the city harvest lunch menu, now $57/person, at the lounge. The check shows as $5 donation to City Harvest program and $52 for 3-course lunch.No reservation is needed. Business casual dress code is acceptable, jacket is not mandatory for men. The striped bass was really tender and juicy. Other than that, the lunch menu items are decent, but not too impressive. We also ordered a mocktail and the lobster cappuccino from the lounge menu, both were tasty. Overall worth to try once but probably won't come back again.","I agree with the other reviewers, the service is appalling. Came here this evening expecting to dine with their prix-fixed menu as I had in the past, and the host Cesar, was appalling as he suggested we dine at the bar, despite the open seating available. He argued with me for 5 minutes about how he needed to save those tables, which never ended up committed and he let me know that one is for ""older people who need to sit while they wait for their tables."" Amazing. This ruined the experience and we opted to get lounge food instead of the main dining food and go somewhere else. We ordered their lounge dishes and nothing was impressive and we left shortly thereafter despite empty seating throughout the place. Awful service. Don't bring anyone you care to impress.","Came here for lunch for the first time. Not sure what happened but they were serving cold bread. When we came here for dinner a few years ago, they served warm bread, which was something that neither does Per Se nor Eleven Park Madison do. A bit sad and disappointed with that, which is why I knocked one star off...","I understand why this place has three Michelin stars. Even though my friends and I simply had a casual lounge dining experience and no reservations, it was an experience that dwarfed all other fine dining adventures I have had around the world. I am not even exaggerating. The old couple seated next to us informed us that at one point this was the best restaurant in the world and I completely believe it. The service and space was literally out of the movies. I have attached the lounge menu but everything changes seasonally and I will definitely be back for the chef's tasting but so far let me just say it has quickly become my favorite restaurant in the city. The culinary expertise and marriage of flavors from the crystallized wasabi to my first time experiencing Canadian oysters juxtaposed with East Coast Maine  ones was nothing short of revolutionary. The le Bernadine signature smoked salmon Was flaked in chunks Instead of the traditional Thin slices. As someone who normally keeps a low carb food profile, I was literally blown away by their bread selection. They had the softest olive oil bread that was pre-salted and ready to be buttered in the best of ways. My favorite was the sun-dried tomato focaccia. But the quinoa in the multi grain and the cute little French baguette we're all authentic experiences. Very importantly that was a small victory for the Halal keeping person in me: their lamb is so source from Australia !!! Halal alert!!! We tried their lychee mock tail which did not disappoint but was not the best but I have had in all honesty in the category of mocktails in Manhattan.Before I dive into a Somewhat detailed analysis Of the menu and food I will make an overall important observation : that this was French cooking techniques and passion for food taken to the next level by fusing with all other compatible cuisine such as the Peruvian fluke, the Asian tuna tartare and the wasabi crystallized himachi. There were even American influences such as in the seafood causa with its lime and avocado notes which were particularly refreshing and paired perfectly with all the prevailing textures and flavors.The lobster cappuccino and seafood causa were truly inspired.Finally the signature egg is definitely an important dessert to experience but it was the charred milk ice cream with hibiscus that truly stole our heart. The hazelnut with gold leaf was the aesthetic star of the show and while the flavor was not short of magical the other two desserts on the table might have overshadowed in taste.I'll definitely be back for the chef's tasting and will report back on the lamb Full dining room experience, which as noted by reviewer is below me did in fact have a slightly musty smell...","I've been taking every opportunity I can to use the lunch prix fixe menus as an affordable way to sample the food at New York's best restaurants and so I was very excited when I found out about the City Harvest lunch at Le Bernardin. For $60 ( + tax and tip) I was treated to a stunning lunch, where the food didn't just taste amazing, but also opened my mind to flavors, ingredients, and techniques that I wasn't accustomed to.The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and helpful in navigating it as many of the ingredients were unfamiliar to me. The appetizer course of Maine lobster in a saffron soup was served in a teacup and was very flavorful. The subtle flavor of the small cubes of lobster and mussels contrasted well with the intensely aromatic saffron soup. My entree was the first time I ate skate, and the texture was very interesting to me, especially the way the wing easily pulled apart along the visible segments. The sweet and sour sauce it was served in added some punchiness to the otherwise mild skate. A waiter walked around with a selection of breads which I attacked multiple times during my meal - I particularly enjoyed the focaccia with olives.The dessert was a spectacle in itself. A run soaked piece of brioche bread coated in white chocolate served with vanilla bean ice cream, liquid honey, honeycomb, and dehydrated honey. The latter was intriguing to me and for a brief moment I was hesitant about digging in. I'm glad I did as together all those ingredients complement each other as well as they sound like they do, and my only complain was that I ran out of ice cream before I finished the rum-bread.The City Harvest menu changes every week and I'm definitely going to be back if I ever get some time for lunch in New York. Don't worry if you don't have a reservation for it; like many high-end restaurants at lunch time on a weekday, tables don't seem too hard to come by.","We were a bit reticent about having dinner so late.  However our experience at Le Bernardin from the beautiful, relaxing setting, to the fine attentive staff and the incredible four course prix fixe meal with amazing Amuse bouches was so enjoyable we felt time had frozen and we had a wonderful dinner.  Just a few details to share... reservations must be made 2 months in advance.  I missed the first day, and by the next the earliest dinner reservation was at 9:30pm or later.  Planning ahead is essential.  But as I mentioned once we arrived, I did not look once at my watch because the evening and dining experience was amazing.Reynaldo and Patrick were our serving team, and they were polite, helpful and attentive.  It is the small, but significant touches that create a memorable evening.  The lighting is subtle and the spacing very comfortable.  The seating is incredibly comfortable.  My wife has a very bad back, but the lumbar support of the back seat was excellent.  So many times, you find the seating hard or somehow uncomfortable which would work great if the establishment doesn't want you to linger.Every review comments on the Michelin starred menu which is well deserved.  Since the selections change seasonally I won't even delve into the deliciousness of each selection we had except to say there was tremendous choice in each of the four courses and the preparations were perfect for each dish.  It was indeed, one for the finest seafood restaurants we have been to.We look forward to enjoying another fine meal on a future visit.  Merci Chef Eric!",Le Bernardin
383,"So disappointed at the moment. I usually love Westville but this evening I found a bug in my meal. I ordered my meal to go. I had the pesto mash, broccoli, peas. And boy Choy. I went to take a bite of my bok choy and some fell off of my fork. At first thought it was bundled bok choy but after inspection and realizing it had eyes, that is was a bug. I don't even know what kind of bug it is and the scary part about it all is the bug is green and I almost ate it along with the other veggies I had in my meal. I am so sad right now because I was really looking forward to my meal. This means that the veggies were not properly cleaned beforehand and that is very upsetting.","Went for Thursday lunch. We both got the lunch Mediterranean rice bowl. It was very hearty - has rice, chickpeas, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. with pita bread yummmmm portion was so big, only finished half and packed the rest. Will be back to try out other dishes!",Misleading menu. Clarified with server before ordering and was given wrong information. Billing turn out to be so much and manager was unable to rectify the mistake and did not say sorry.,"A classic favorite. Known for fresh and season fare. My favorite are the market plates. So many delicious veggies to choose from - cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and more. When it's in season, the watermelon mint salad is a must have. Last trip, I had the grilled salmon. It was incredibly flavorful! This location doesn't take reservations so consider your time of arrival and group size in planning to attend.","I came here with my family for one of my last meals before having my daughter. There was four of us, my father, sister and son. We didn't have reservations and they tend to get pretty packed but they easily accommodated us all.The staff is SUPER friendly! We all were famished after doing a bit of work in the area. We were ready for a huge brunch. My sister had their fried chicken sando on one of their Portuguese muffins. These muffins are soooo good! The bread is soft and spongy, soaking up all the flavors without getting soggy. I had an egg scramble with mushrooms on one also. My son also had an egg scramble with salmon but kept his muffin on the side. Dad had a chicken gyro with the creamiest tzatziki sauce.After our meals we had a bunch of desserts; apple pie, many scoops of ice cream, cookies and molten cake. It was all soooo great! I loved every bite. I definitely want to go back soon. Luckily, I get to go to the area more often than before. Mostly, I just want to thank the staff for making us feel so very much at home. They were all so very sweet to all of us. We really felt welcomed.","Update:  My daughter does not feel well today.  Can't be sure it's because she was glutened here so I'm not changing my review.  Just want to add no guarantees that it's celiac safe .  Will stay away from items cooked on shared grills going forward even if the establishment says they clean it before cooking for patron with allergies.  Came here for lunch on a Tuesday.  Very lively and busy which bodes well.  There were plenty of options for my daughter who has celiac.  Although the menu doesn't specify any gluten free options, we called ahead and they assured us that there were options. The waitress told us all the things to stay away from and told us they clean the grill for the patrons with food allergies.  (I know celiac is not a food allergy but as long as the outcome is safe for my daughter they can call it whatever they want!) Everyone was very happy with the food.  We had the sweet chili lime rice bowl, market plate (choice of 4 veggies), chicken parm, grilled cheese, and chicken with pesto mashed potato (am so trying to recreate that at home).  And the cocktails were awesome as well!  We tried the orange shandy, cucumber lemonade with Prosecco ( and working on making this at home too), and mango saki margarita.  The waitress was lovely and efficient and helpfulI will back!  Want to try so many things on this menu.",Westville Chelsea
384,"Mediocre food and terrible service.  The waiter had the nerve to chase after us and ask why we didn't tip him more.  If you rewind an hour, you will find 5 happy, hungry people who waited 45 minutes for some simple food from a waiter that was rude and unhappy from the get-go.  He was slow, lazy and absolutely didn't pay any attention to our table...oh except when he handed us the bill.  Never going back.",Sad to have visited last month and the borscht is no longer vegan. Now contains beef broth. :( This was such a unique dish and it's a shame they've abandoned their own classic recipe. I hope they bring it back.,"I was definitely expecting more based on having so many high reviews. I ordered the French toast and my fiancé ordered an omelette. The French toast was very simple and not very flavorful at all. I also found some food in my water and I didn't appreciate having fly's flying around me and landing on me while I was eating. It wasn't terrible, but I won't be back and wouldn't recommend this place. Not sure what the hype is about.","What can I say that you don't already know about this New York icon? It looks like a diner, and yes it has some diner items, but why would you want to order pancakes here?! Yes, you're insane if that's what you're eating here. Perogies duh!I prefer boiled perogies but we decided to go fried this time. They're still amazing. Dumplings are great in every culture. The goulash was pretty on point too. This is absolutely stick to your ribs food but so worth it. I have nothing bad to say about this 24 hour food haven.","Veselka is the PERFECT spot for late night munchies! My friends and I were looking for something yummy to eat late at night after a concert, and to my surprise, Veselka was open! It's open 24 hours, so the place was pretty packed when we walked in. We were able to sit down almost immediately. I ordered the watermelon iced tea and an order of 4 fried pierogi's. It came with a side of sour cream and apple sauce, which paired really nicely with the richness of the pierogis. I got 4 different fillings, and you can choose different ones for each as long as you get them cooked the same way: fried or boiled! The watermelon iced tea was very refreshing as well. I would highly recommend both items I got! One of my friends got the meatballs and mashed potato meal, and the other got a bowl of chili. All of our food was delicious, came out quickly, and really hit the spot at 2 AM. Our server was also very sweet and friendly despite it being so late!","When realizing that I would be staying in the Ukrainian Village for my NYC trip, I researched some Ukrainian restaurants in the area and found Veselka immediately. I absolutely love pierogies and I knew that I wanted to see what types were offered here! We came in at around 8pm for a late dinner on a Sunday and we were seated immediately. I had no idea what I wanted, because there are so many great choices! Our waiter (guy with long, silver hair??) was so helpful and told me which dishes he liked and which sides went well with it.I decided to order four different pierogies (fried) - mushroom, potato, arugula+cheese, and meat. The arugula and cheese was by far my favorite pierogi! I also got the beef stroganoff with mashed potatoes, which was also very good. I have to say, it did not seem any different from an American egg noodles + beef dish that I could find anywhere, but it certainly satisfied my hunger and had a great sauce. The mashed potatoes also went very well with it (tip: try putting the mashed potatoes in the leftover sauce).Overall, I think that my meal at Veselka was very good. However, the dishes are a bit pricey for my taste. I would like to come back and order more pierogies!",Veselka

I prefer a warm buttered roll w/buttery lobster, but this style of roll was well worth the money and was very good. why? well, there is no filler. its an abundant amount of lobster meat, with very little mayo and seasoning. topped with some scallions. however, the lobster is cold. more like a chilled lobster salad. also, it comes on a challah style roll/loaf, thats buttered but not heated up. we ordered the shelly. for 99.00 you get 6 lobster rolls. its one huge loaf on a wooden board, they dont cut it up. make sure youre sober enough to cut it up evenly if youre with guests. for 25.00 a person, we each got basically a lobster roll and a half. it comes with a large bag of kettle cooked chips and a large plastic bin of coleslaw. coleslaw is okay, nothing to rave about. however, the lobster roll was good. its in my top 5 and mainly because of the amount of meat and no filler. boat ride goes up north towards the GW Bridge, takes 20 to 25 mins. which doesnt give you enough time to eat. hence why they allow you to stay on. i did 2 rides to the north and had enough time to eat, grab more drinks on the pier, snack, and hang out. beautiful sunset and clean boat.would come back in a heart beat and try the truffle lobster roll!","I think some of the reviews on here are a little harsh. Is the food mind-blowing? Absolutely not. But it's pretty good. And you get to eat and drink on a boat.

There was a ton of lobster and very little filler which was good, but I think the $24 was a bit pricey considering the bacon on the roll was ice cold and it didn't even come with fries- but again, I'm trying to consider the experience in it's entirety. The food was a solid 3.5 in my opinion, but not something I'd go out of my way to eat in the future.The drinks, again, were pricey but not terrible. I opted for the classic margarita ($16) which was good and STRONG. I was only able to drink 2 of these during our 2 hour cruise. Other folks in my group opted for other mixed drinks or beer from the buckets we ordered. The overall consensus was that the drinks were pretty decent.The service was awesome. Our waitress and some additional staff members were super patient in seating our group of 15 inside for a portion of our stay. They happily moved tables and chairs around for us to have 1 larger communal table so we could all dine family style. Our waitress was patient in taking our orders, brought our food out promptly, and even snagged us a reserved spot outside on the boat so we could enjoy our drinks in the sun. She really did go above and beyond for us which we all definitely appreciated.The views were awesome, naturally. Come here on a sunny day to enjoy the afternoon or in the evening to enjoy the sunset and I guarantee you'll be in for a treat.Definitely a cool experience, especially for groups. Not something I'd do more than once a summer so the summer pass wouldn't be worth it for me, but I'd visit again next year.",North River Lobster Co
386,"This is a small wine bar with a single row of seats at the bar. Word of caution: the seats do not have backs, and the bartop was just a tad too high for 5'3"" me, so this really isn't too comfortable of a place to lounge for a while. However, the wine list is really unique - a bunch of Eastern European wines I know nothing about, in which I let the bartender select what I want based on what I was in the mood for.I might come back if/when I'm in the neighborhood and am looking for a pre- or post-dinner tipple.","Despite the bar brimming with some of New York's rudest faux bourgeoisie, Ruffian was an incredible experience.We ordered the Camembert and Pork (highly recommend) which were both exceptional. But I think what made our experience were the chefs and the waitress who were incredibly nice and accommodating.","Went to see two friends. Wasn't ready to order wine as I just finished dinner. Was trying to decide what I wanted, but needed a 10 min pause before as I was full. My friends had wine and an app. I order water and they asked me to leave and dump the water before I got up. The bartender and host were SO rude. Will never come back and will never recommend. Do not go here unless your into customer service being rude to you.","Cute little wine bar in the East Village, I will definitely bookmark this spot to come back and try the food as it looked and smelled fantastic. After brunch one Sunday, my gf suggested we go here, so we went trolling the streets trying to find the place (as other reviewers say, it's very small and therefore, a bit difficult to find!) We finally found it and as luck would have it, there were 4 seats available at the bar. (The place only seats ~25 people total at the bar). We ordered a delightful orange sparkling wine to start (they have an excellent wine menu, lots of unique options). As we were waiting for our wine, we sat watching the chefs prep and make all of the food. We asked if they had another kitchen and they said no, the two chefs prep and make everything right there in front of you. The food looked delicious. It's like watching two people try to cook in a small NYC apartment. I praise them for being able to work so diligently in such a  confined space! After the four of us finished our first bottle of wine, we grabbed another bottle of bubbles. I enjoyed this one even more. The server was very friendly and very knowledgeable too. As the day got longer, the bar became full and they had to turn people away/tell them to come back later. We all enjoyed our experience here and as luck would have it, I ended up running into a good friend of mine who told us that this place was her favorite spot in the neighborhood. (I could see why, it had a very neighborhood like feel to it).","So much to love about this place. The ever changing menu is seasonal, creative and delicious. The guy who seems to be in charge of the wine list could not be more friendly. The chefs just all seemso grumpy though.","Ruffian has quickly and unexpectedly become one of my favorite food/wine spots in the city. This 19-seat bar is easy to pass, very snug, yet still manages to bring all the vibes.This spot is walk in only but always worth the wait and the staff is super kind and make the waiting process bearable even when waiting in the cold for a bit. The team behind the bar is extremely knowledgeable about each of its wines (natural) on the menu + the region/producers they are working with. They're super friendly + open to giving suggestions to pair with your food.Considering the size of the space, it's pretty insane the caliber of food they are able to whip out from behind the bar. The dishes are inventive, satisfying and I have yet to be disappointed.Ruffian is the perfect date spot or place to bring your friend to impress, not to mention the bathroom is (in my opinion) one of the best in the city and worth the trip alone :)",Ruffian
387,"Saturday night Flamingo dancers show You need to make reservations...they do get busy on weekend ... they ran out of food we ordered Very disappointed but the one we've got was decent , cute place right on the corner","I heard this place was amazing. So I decided to give it a try. I was really expecting the food to be better.  However, the sangria was on point I will say. We got the barriga de cerdo, costilla tempura, and a few other small plates. I don't want to say anything was bad, cause it wasn't, it just wasn't worth more than 3 stars. Would I try it again? Definitely, but would try all new plates.","Brought a group of girlfriends that were visiting me in the city. The sangria, brussel sprouts, pork belly, patatas bravas, and costilla tempura were all very good. However: -it took us 20 minutes to get seated even though we had a reservation-then it took 20 more minutes for someone to take our drink order-there wasn't even a flamenco showOverall it was a pretty disappointing evening.","What a great place! The restaurant is a cute east village location. The windows are floor to ceiling so.they open up . The most important is the food and drinks. Great cocktails, i had a spicy cocktail with whiskey yummy!(sorry don't remember name)Also had the octopus and lamb shank. Both were delicious but the lamb !was one of the best in the city yes ! It us a must try . Great service.","This new location is great! I used to go to the older one that was on 1st Avenue, and what an update. The interior looks so great and modern now and I feel everything has become more refined and mature from the last restaurant. I love the new look and the sophisticated casual vibe of this new location-the furniture has its own personality with mismatched chairs and utensils, the lighting fixtures are beautiful and the ambience is on point-great for taking someone on a date and a nice place to take friends. What a facelift!The food has gotten better than we last dined as well-my absolute favorites were the Alioli Prime rib Katsu and the Tostada de Lubina (honey glazed sea bass). Such great textures and flavors, the batter and frying is just right and the sauced paired beautifully. Apart from that, we also had some of the items we had in the old restaurant that were still on the menu like the chorizo, the brussel sprouts, and the patatas bravas. There's definitely more on the menu we would love the try, and we'll have to come back around to test out the rest. The servers were very friendly, very experienced and also had the feeling of a true Spanish restaurant. I loved the fact that this place very much has their own personality and the chef makes a personal connection with the customers on small things like a hand-written note to start off the menu and little notes and suggestions with some illustrations here and there. It reminds me a lot of Barcelona and the restaurant scene I saw there.Love it! And fun fact, my husband and I met for the first time at their old restaurant-so we come back not only for the food but also the memories.","Wow, just WOW. Came here for dinner on a Tuesday around 7 pm and there was no wait. I really dig the aesthetic of the restaurant decor, it's very modern and clean. I ordered the cheese plate, croquettes, octopus, pasta paella, and coconut flan (and yes, that was wayyyy too much food for two people). They were more pricey than other tapas place I've been to but the portions for each were also wayyyyyy bigger. Everything was pretty delicious and similar to what I had had before (shoutout to the octopus which was literally the most tender I've ever had).But let me tell you about the pasta paella. It was under their Modern Tapas section of their menu and was made of shortly cut pasta with seafood (shrimp and scallops) and SEAWEED. I was not expecting getting seaweed at a tapas place but it was really good and definitely worked. I recommend getting it for a taste of something different!Besides that, they also have around 8 different flavored sangrias (my sister had the tropical one and it was really good!!)",Nai Tapas
388,"Overall this was a run-of-the-mill meal; nothing went terribly wrong but I also won't be recommending this place to a friend. What I couldn't get over though was the Green Pie pizza that we got, which looked very different than the other pictures I've seen on yelp. There were barely any toppings, the whole pizza was drenched in oil and soggy, and it was too salty. Honestly I'd prefer the 99 cent pizza around the corner. We ate one slice and couldn't finish the rest, which I was really sad about since I hate wasting food. Anyway, enough about the pizza...the lamb lasagna tasted fine. (But wasn't good enough to offset the pizza experience.)Lastly the service was pretty curt, with a waiter who didn't smile, took our order, and disappeared. In a city with countless tasty options, I'd be hard pressed to come back here again.",Extremely bad quality Italian restaurant. We order the lobster and shrimp dishes and the noodle is not cook well and hard to chew. The noodle lay on top of shit load of oil underneath. The sauce is full of cream and you will be full just by eating the sauce. Ridiculous,"If I wanted rubber, I would have gone to a tire shop. Working south of Central Park on a beautiful August summer, I thought it only makes sense that I order the fitting Midtown Salad with Chicken Parm. It came at a reasonable time. Nothing bad to say about the appearance of the common New Yorker go-to Italian food. With haste, I took a bite of the glimmering chicken parm.Man was I blown away. In fact I was blown so far, I thought I was sent back in time to the industrial revolution in the area we now call the Rust Belt. The chicken cutlet was tough as Metal, rubbery like car tires, and insulting like the current state of affairs. I am dumbfounded and have to believe the chicken was reheated from the day before or the chicken was treated terribly at its walking stages.Cheers","What an amazing place. It's been on my list of Italian restaurants (my current obsession). And, it was date night. We had VIP tickets to see Ben Platt around the corner at Radio City Music Hall. So, it was the perfect location. For starters, it's absolutely darling. It's not too big, but not too small. Dim enough lighting for a night out with your honey, but not too dim that you can't come with a group of friends for a festive night out either (as the table towards the back of the place were enjoying.)The staff was beyond friendly and attentive, which is too often a forgotten must at NYC restaurants. The waiter who sat us was super nice, and very accommodating when I asked to switch tables. (I have a thing about not wanting to sit where I can see the kitchen).Our waitress was Kris, who was personable and delightful and sweet. I started with the charred octopus, which is one of my favorite starters. Jayson chose the burrata, one of his favorite dishes. What I loved (loved) about the octopus was that it wasn't prepared or served as most places do. It was cut up and served with cooked green mango, black chili and zucchini puree. Even Jayson, who normally hates mango, loved this dish. Just writing about it makes me ready to go back, which I may just do tonight. For dinner, I chose the spaghetti dish, but had them swap out the spaghetti with fettuccine and add shrimp, which they were more than willing to do for a small up-charge, which was absolutely understandable and appropriate. It was prepared with san marzano tomatoes, fresh ricotta and soft herbs.It was delish. Perfectly seasoned, and the shrimp were fresh and cooked just right. It was exactly what I wanted that night.Jayson went with the wild mushroom ravioli for dinner. I think he started to tear up a bit on the first bite, because it was just that good. This was absolutely just a wonderful, delicious dinner and casual night out with the hubby. It's definitely on our list to go back to and highly recommend.","Food was pretty solid but then again, where can't you find good Italian food in NYC. I would highly recommend getting a reservation as the space is pretty small. Ordered the lasagnette after we were told that it was big enough to share. Thankfully we were not too hungry after a large brunch earlier in the day as the dish was just big enough for one hungry diner and two semi hungry diners. The brownie nutella dessert was good but slathered in too much nutella, so much so that it completely overwhelmed the taste of the really delicious brownie underneath.In terms of alcohol selection, tons of wine options (what else would you expect) and very few beer options. What you see on the taps at the bar and in the fridge behind the counter are all that they have to offer.Pretty good spot but I'll be trying another Italian yelp hotspot next time for dinner.","This is a great Italian option in midtown! Visited this spot for the first time with coworkers over a lunch break.I have nothing bad to say, and refuse to shut up about how bomb this food was.... WOW! I bet of you, order the truffle Mac and cheese bites! Such a delicious appetizer. For an entree, I ordered the spaghetti al pomodoro and that sauce is unforgettable. I think the only bad part of the entire experience is that I was too full to finish my food. 10/10 recommend!",Nino's 46
389,"I'm not coming back because the service was a real letdown. The food was good but definitely not worth bearing their bad service. We had four people, and all of us hated their service. It was a disappointment!","The food quality and size has decreased quite a bit! So does the service quality. The waiter saw me waiving me hands twice and just stood there, then passed by me as he was blind. Later at the dinner, the other waiter saw me was looking at him, which normally would mean that I am trying to get his attention. Buy again, he just stood there and didn't do anything. I gave up and let me girlfriend deal with them afterwards. Also, at last year, about hundred dollars will get two people pretty good and full meals. But I feel this year the food plates are not as full. We either have to order two more plates or leave and feel half full. I don't think I will ever come back. No wonder we didn't have to wait in line this time. Not many people are coming at even Friday evening.","Food was good, but really disappointing service. After a thirty minute wait, we were given a little piece of paper and asked to go to their alternative dining room, which was on the next street over. Not a great start. Once we found the place, the first thing I noticed was how stuffy the place was. They also had plenty of empty seats, but those might be for reservations. We were nearly sat down at a small table close to the door when another waiter told ours that the table wasn't meant for us, and we were taken over to tiny bar seats instead. By bar seats, I meant tall stools facing a short glass divide behind which there were sinks and counter space--neither a little bar nor the kitchen space. In addition, the bathroom was in our direct line of vision and all throughout the meal we had to see people come in and out of the toilets. I think I would've minded less if we were asked (as is usually done) whether we'd be okay with ""bar seating,"" but we were neither asked nor warned, and little electric stove for the pot was so far at the edge of the table that one of us could not reach the food. All in all, these seats were 100% an effort to maximize space, but in all honesty should not exist.To second an earlier review by another Yelper, there was a big group that came in a little after us, and what was a decently quiet little space became a rowdy sports-bar situation. I understand this isn't the fault of the restaurant, but the group was so obnoxiously loud that it was annoying the restaurant didn't do anything. It was obvious that every other diner there was annoyed.","I was here in a Saturday, fully booked. Would definitely recommend reservations because it's small. The broth for the hot pot was really good. Very light flavor. Pork belly and garlic rice was very flavorful. The broth has collagen in it so we finished most of it. Good service.","Heard good things about this place but was surprised to find them struggling to find a non-reserved seat for us at an off-peak time. Menu revolves around ""pork feet"" which is an interesting idea, but unfortunately had poor execution. The taste of the meat changed radically in between dishes (unfortunately it was for the worse). We ordered some of the ""recommended items"" from the menu, which included garlic pork feet and pork feet dumplings. The taste of the first dish was good (but there was barely anything edible on the bones, and was overall an extremely poor value for the cost) and the second dish (dumplings) tasted radically different, and notably worse. We also ordered the monkfish liver (which was served with barely any of the usual accompaniments and was far too strong of a taste to eat on its own) and a salad, which was fine. Service was quite slow (we waited for roughly 30 minutes to get our check after we had finished) and prices were high. Overall, though some of the flavors were good and the interior decor is nice, I don't believe I would return here. As a side note, they're most recent NYC DOH rating counted 57 points of food safety violations against them which is well above the threshold for a C rating (28), after finding that out, I highly regret bringing my mother here.","This was definitely an experience to say the least and I have mixed feelings about this place. Here's why:As a party of four, we called ahead to see if we needed a reservation. We were told that we can just walk in and that we would be seated right away. After a short walk from where we were in the West Village we arrived at one part of the restaurant. The woman that we spoke with on the phone greeted us and told us it would only be a moment. We stood there for 10 minutes and were very confused as to why we were waiting because there were at least three tables that seat four people open.  She finally came back to us with a ticket and told us to walk around to the other entrance of the restaurant where we will be seated. Even more confused, we left the restaurant and walked to the other entrance. It was a bit more livelier and we were greeted and finally seated. Shortly after our server came and explained the menu. One thing I really liked about this place was the eclectic menu and their hot pot items. As much as I would have liked to try a hot pot, it was way to warm outside to have a hot pot, but their other menu items looked amazing. So we ordered iced teas and then delved into the menu. We started with lobster gyoza. It came with four dipping sauces:- a seasoned vinegar sauce- a chili sauce - a tomato ponzu sauce - a mayo based sauceWe each had a gyoza and tried each sauce, all of them really complementing the gyoza in their own way. My favorite was the chili sauce. There was huge chunks of lobster meat which was also a nice surprise. I should note at this time we are still waiting on our iced teas. Next we had one of their special rolls, the spicy shrimp roll. This was also quite delicious. What I wasn't expecting was the scallion that was incorporated into the roll. Still no iced teas...this was when we mentioned that they still had not arrived and we finally got them on the servers next visit. The next three items that came to the table were not as impressive as the other dishes. The pork belly was very tough and hard to eat. The pork buns were flavorful but very fatty. It came with four pieces of pork but only two buns and we were told that another two buns were going to cost extra.  A little annoyed we ordered the extra buns that did not come until very much later. We also had an order of the fried chicken. We were told it was a popular item on the menu. To be quite honest it wasn't anything to hoot and holler over. The best part of the meal was the last item that came to our table which was the Garlic Fried Rice which had pigs feet and is traditionally found in the part of Japan where the restaurant's cuisine originated from. This fried rice was phenomenal. It was very garlicky but I was all about it! Dining here wasn't terrible. Our server was very nice and apologetic for the items that came late. And some of the food was great, but some of it was subpar. I don't think I would go back here on my own accord, but I wouldn't rule out never coming back.",Hakata Tonton

Once again, our server/bartender was absolutely fantastic--I wish I could remember her name. The reason I have to give 3 stars is because the food really disappointed this time. The pork bun wasn't as meaty or savory as it was the last time. The biggest disappointment was the Dan Dan noodles. They looked alright at first, but upon diving in I realized that the noodles were terribly undercooked and hard. What a shame.","Filipino + Mexican + Korean = YAS. it works.Cool decor (the wall art and they have skateboards on the wall as the menu)! Pricing was fair and staff was friendly and they played 90's music (throwback for all the 90's kids). Very chill vibe, I love it! So many vibrant colors & they have three sauces available and I suggest using them cause they're awesome. Adobo-Rito - Soy Braised Chicken, Kimchi Fried Rice & Shredded Romaine Wrapped in a BurritoThis burrito is fire! I loved the kimchi fried rice & every bite into the burrito was like heaven! & it's really filling :) Slow Braised Short Rib TacoSO perfect, SO flavorful - will definitely order again whenever I go! Must get, highly recommend. Still dreaming about it. Soy Braised Chicken TacoThe chicken was well cooked & well seasoned! Not as flavorful as the short rib taco, but still pretty good!Butter Poached Fresh Catch TacoI truly appreciate how well cooked the fish was - I'm a fish girl so this was delicious for me! I can see why some might think it doesn't have enough flavor, but that's what the sauces are for! :) Sinigang Flip Bowl - Short Rib, Garlic Coconut Steamed Rice, Tomatoes, Carrots, Bok Choy, ScallionsI was pretty excited for this because of the garlic coconut steamed rice, but I think it can use a bit more flavor on its own. I ended up drowning it in sauce. But when it was in sauce, it was yummy","Ok, I've had my eye on this place for YEARS now. It's been all over my instagram so I knew I had to try it. We had a variety of things, from pork belly tacos to burritos (Cali and Plan B), taco sampler, and Dan Dan noodles. The food was good, not great, but good. It's just a fast casual taqueria with a Filipino twist so you can't expect too much. I could've done without the tacos and bao buns. The Dan Dan noodles were extremely sauced, not a good flavor either. But the BURRITOS gave me life. The Plan B is so legit, man. They offer your money back if you don't like it and claim that it is the ""best breakfast burrito""Oh, we also had to try to ube ice cream - THIS made the meal. SHEESH! So good. Anywho, I'm glad I gave this place a try but may not be coming back anytime soon.","5/5Just shy of a 5/5 because the burrito filling wasn't even throughout but too small of a reason to take off a starThe burrito is pretty up there in flavor, the ingredients didn't taste that special individually, but together they're pretty greatThat being said, it's hard to enjoy them together when half the burrito had all the avocado and the other half had 80% of the chicken That's really it. That's the only critic I have for it On a side note, the sauces are really good but none of them too spicy to handle (which is good) it doesn't need the sauces but the added flavor helps make it even better Also, there was one burnt/ hard piece in the wrap, felt like a bone at first but no big deal, you might get that in your food too FYIWould come back and recommend this place, not amazing or a place to go out of your way for, but solid for sure",Flip Sigi
391,"Do not expect anything from the foods..Other than the fact that you are dining right next to water, terrible... waste of money.Ordered crab cake, burger, and salmon.First of all, service was very poor and slow.I know its in central park right next the fountain.Servers need to focus when you're working, they were just carrying dishes looking with angry faces and fake smiles at the same time..Breads came after the appetizer and ruined my appetite^^Ordered burger medium and brought me a extra crispy more than well done chewy patty... buns were chewy as well didn't even bother to eat them.Salmon was okay compare to other foods.. just okay..When I received a check, there was a gratuity included asked the server and he told me that ""it says on the menu!"" Okay.. asked for menu and at the bottom very very tiny small saying 15% is blah blah blah..I attached the menu just in case people want to know how small is it..Never going back again","We arrived shortly before 7 PM on a Saturday evening in July.to rent a boat. There were about 25 people in front of us and we were told by an employee that the wait would be about 50 minutes but that their ""system was down."" We waited patiently for about 20 minutes without the line moving. Multiple groups of passengers exiting the boats walked past us during our wait. Some groups in line left. Finally, the line began moving at 7:12 PM. We got our boat at 7:17 PM.The $15/hour price was a great deal. Five stars on price.The downed system was frustrating but the boat was okay. Two stars for equipment quality.The employee taking the money was not very friendly and seemed annoyed. The gentleman who helped us into the boat was pleasant. Three stars for Customer Service.","Unless I'm crazy, this used to be a nice place for a chill dinner.  Upon arrival tonight, the harried hostesses handed us a shake shack-like Frisbee sized disc to hold until the table was ready.  The Frisbee lit up and vibrated  after thirty minutes.  We were on time for the reservation.The group at the bar rolling dice and screaming as loudly as possible wasn't appreciated by the diners, but the inattentive bartenders oddly didn't seem to care.  A harmless, except for the money, but bizarre night. Probably a decent short-term business model, but certainly not fine dining.  Nice location.","This was better than I expected...this was my sister's choice and based on what others said I had set my expectations pretty low...but everything (except my brother-in-law's steak) was really tasty. We ordered beets as well as as the  burrata app's both delicious, my scallops and husband's salmon were perfect, sister had pasta and she gave a thumbs up as well. The only downside was our primary server, the 2 guys helping (bread guy and guy who cleared) were great, but our actual waiter was super impatient and obviously didn't want to be there.","You can go lowbrow or high-end here- because you really get a little bit of both worlds. Between all the waking hubs and I did in Central Park, stumbling on Loeb at 4:35pm was the perfect spot to unwind. Hubs enjoyed his 2 Mimosas while I had a Mojito Mocktail at the Bar. By the way, hubs' Mimosas were filled 3/4 of the way up with bubbly first and the rest with oj. That's the way to do it! And if that doesn't hit you- I don't know which other Mimosa will! We threw the idea of eating at the bar out the window quick- because no one actually ate there. But I noticed the Boathouse's main lakefront dining area was popping from where we sat and asked the host if we can sit for Lunch without a reservation. Negative. Host mentioned Lunch stops at 4pm. (Dinner reopens at 6pm). So...the outdoor Café it was. Aside from the main Bar and lakefront dining, Loeb also has a casual eating area and think it's part of their indoor Café with a large overhead menu listing Soups, Breakfast, Sandwiches and other light stuff. The identical menu is also outdoors- if you rather enjoy your lunch in Loeb's al fresco café. Between hubs' Sausage & Peppers- which he liked, my Garden Burger, fries we shared and our 2 waters- it was good. Drinks at the Bar? $38. We couldn't stay for dinner as we caught a concert nearby, but I'd love to come for a rendezvous and take in that old-timey, lakefront dining feel in Central Park.",Cute date night spot with great food and a view. Very romantic. It's right in the middle of the park and can get pretty packed on the weekends. Try to come during the week evenings for a more chill vibe.,The Loeb Boathouse
392,"I've been dining here for years, back when it was a tiny spot with seating for 7 people & cash only. I have no idea how I've never written a review. So here it is:The soba is amazing, albeit the menu has grown extensively and is confusing.There's two serving sizes of noodles and the large doesn't mean a larger bowl--just an extra serving of noodz.  Be aware that there is no take away/take out/take home. It's rude in Japanese culture to leave unfinished food, so order mindfully. The small portion with an appetizer is always the perfect amount for me. You can always add extra noodz after the fact if you're still hungry. If you don't know where to start, the Kimchi Pork soba & the Ginger Veggie soba are my usual go go's. I swear the ginger one will cure any ailments you might have. It's still cash only.","To start off, my first impressions of the place weren't the best.The rules in this restaurant are strange. The menu states no takeout allowed, cash only, and give your seats after the meal if we have a long line. Now, its common courtesy, for customers to leave quickly after a meal when there is a line but for a restaurant to blatantly demand it in their menu comes off as very tone deaf and even rude. I give this a pass since I heard that some of these rules are common in Japanese culture.Next, I order the warm Mera Mera Soup only to ask the server to change my order to the dip after 1 min or 2 later after she left. She asked the chefs and they claimed that they couldn't change the order since they were already making it... ok.. she just literally put the order in.. but again I'm not aware of their cooking process so I give this a pass too. Funny thing is, the appetizer and my friends food comes out first. My dish comes out last. The duck dish appetizer was a solid 3/5 My warm Mera Mera Soup was 3.5/5. It was tasty but in my opinion overpriced given that it was mainly noodles with very little meat and veggies.The server was obviously new and clueless so I can relate being in her position until she knocked over a container on own table and proceeds to NOT CLEAN IT UP the entire remaining time we were there. Now this INFURIATED me because not only were we the only customers in the restaurant so there was no one else to attend to but also because this is such a dangerous hazard.  As you can see from the picture, the liquid spread to other tables and all over the floor. Not only is this a slip hazard to us but also to her other coworkers who may not see this. Im not mad she spilled something, it happens to the best of us, but im mad she chose to totally ignore the spill and endanger everyone else. Im glad we were the only customers in the restaurant because if it happened at a busier time, it could have endangered more people. GOD AWFUL EXPERIENCE. I rarely give places 1 star but this place reeks of incompetence.","VASTLY underwhelming compared to its Kenmare Street location just a couple blocks down. The quality of food and service just don't compare at all.First off, my boyfriend and I ordered the Fried Chicken as our appetizer, along with our mains. The mains arrived within minutes and I immediately noticed that the flavor was not as strong and food did not taste as fresh as the other location. I ordered my go-to, the Chicken Burdock Dip Soba, which usually comes in a small pot with a fire underneath it to keep it warm. Not sure if this was an oversight or if they just don't light the fire in the summer, but it was not lit this time. The broth also tasted very bland and the chicken was flavorless.At this point, we had both finished our mains and upon doing a quick time-check, I noticed that it's been 30 minutes since we placed our order... still no sight of the Fried Chicken. We ask our waiter who checks on the order for us and advises it's coming right out (read: you need to wait another 5-10 minutes but it's being made). 40 minutes since placing our order, the Fried Chicken comes and it's the most bizarre Fried Chicken I'd ever seen. It looked like it has been chewed and the breading was falling off. The chicken itself was just OK; not worth the price or the wait.I love Cocoron so I will keep going, but only to the Kenmare Street location.Also, CASH ONLY.","Cocoron had me at ""small, unpretentious Japanese noodle shop"" & let me tell you, these noods were EXACTLY that. Stopped in for a bowl of their famous Warm MERA MERA SOBA which consists of homemade soba noodles with bonito flake and spicy sesame based soup, minced chicken, bean sprouts, bok choy, scallion, and sesame chili oil. This noodle shop has become Top 5 on my list. Their broth has SO much flavor and each bite of noodle is so tender. It's a perfect harmony of what warm soba should be","So disappointed. I had very high hopes for Cocoron's Japanese soba, but sadly, this place fell short. Starting off, the service wasn't good. The man serving us had an annoyed face from the start. Ordered the signature Mera Mera warm soba and the signature Mera Mera dip soba. Sadly, I didn't realize the Mera mera was spicy when I read the menu, so when the food came out, I asked the man if the signature was supposed to be spicy. The man was already annoyed, didn't make eye contact with me, and mumbled that it was, in fact, the signature. So yes, the signature was spicy. (He just answered my question oddly). I normally don't eat spicy, but I could tell the broth lacked flavor. Both of the Mera Mera dip soba and Mera Mera warm soba tasted like nothing. Kind of like water with a whole bunch of spicy powder to create the spicy flavor, when it was supposed to be ""juicy spicy sesame based broth"". Of course, I didn't want to waste the food and was trying my best to finish at least, the meat and noodles. My brother who isn't picky and would always finish his food, struggled to finish his portion. The soba noddles themselves were fine, but without any good flavor, the meal was suffering to eat. The only pleasing part of our time here, was the one lady who was friendly when taking our order and she was the ONLY staff member who came to refill our waters and check up on us, while the others just walked around rushing the customers to hurry up and eat so they could go on their lunch break. So props to her! At the end, the man came back and tossed our check on our table without saying anything and returned to the counter to eat his lunch. Such great service, am I right? (The price for each bowl was also a bit pricey. $16-$17/ bowl for hardly any meat and no flavor.) Yeah... no. 99% sure I'm not returning to eat here. I'm sure there are many other soba restaurants that cater authentic flavor and good service. Food quality: 5/10Pricing: 7/10Service: 2/10","You can't go wrong at Co-co-Ron.I'm more of a ramen guy but they say Soba is better for you.  They're cash only so bring that cashishi with you.  Sweet Japanese people run all of their locations and they're stuff is consistently good.Catch me here on a winter weekday, going to town on a bowl of soba.",Cocoron
393,"Amazing New Orleans gumbo and po'boy joint right in the heart of Brooklyn. If you're looking for a taste of NOLA in New York, this is the place to go. It's a tiny shop, probably seats about 20 or so people. You order at the counter and the cashier will bring over the food when it's ready. We got the classic fried shrimp po'boy, the catfish po'boy, seafood gumbo, and chicken and sausage gumbo. No complaints, just happy tongues and tums. My only regret was not having the stomach space for beignets. One downside is there's no AC or fans. A bit toasty for dining in on a hot summer day, but bearable enough.","We've ordered  po boys from here many times even though we thought it was an over priced sandwiches we still went back. Today we were given a little extra with our sandwich, specifically a strand of hair 3 inches long in the batter of the chicken sandwich. It was enough to make my stomach churn. I mean how does this happen? Aren't you supposed to wear hair nets or something? When I called to let them know they said they would refund us (not really sure if they will since they didn't seem to know who we were) or it would take over an hour to get another sandwich. No thanks, we won't bother ordering here ever again.",Such an authentic experience felt as if I was in Nola again. I had the Spicy Honey Chicken Po-Boy.,"I saw a review on YouTube before going to NYC and I just had to put this place on my list.Being from Brazil, I love spicy food and I have to say that New Orleans is one of my favorite places in the world. When I leaned that Gumbo Brothers had the most authentic creole food outside of Louisiana I had to try it.My best friend and I went on a quiet Wednesday afternoon. The place is small but because it was about 3 pm on a week day, we found plenty of seating and didn't have to wait at all. We had the traditional Gumbo with 1/2 a PoBoy sandwich eqch and it was enough for us! It is prepared hot. REALLY HOT! borderline what I could eat. May not be suitable for people who are not used to hot sauce. I'm not sure if they can make it less spicy on demand, but it's worth asking. The guy who took our orders was extremely nice and very professional and recommended some less known beers. For desert I couldn't help not getting a pecan pie - delicious!!! I would give this place a 5 star review and if I lived in NY I would probably go there at least once a week. Highly recommend!!","Catfish PoBoy that was good enough to want to make you smack (you fill in The Who). Foodie haven.Catfish PoBoy was Crispy on the outside and flaky inside. Bread and add on we're all great quality. Co-worker had the shrimp gumbo that was delish as well. I was envious.I'd take the food to go however not sure if the crisp on the catfish would stay but the gumbo would get better all the way home. When I'm on Atlantic hankering for Creole fun , I'll be here.","Love it! Been a regular of Gumbo Bros since their days at Urban Eats in Herald Square & Columbus Circle!  The gumbos (seafood, chicken/sausage, And vegetarian) are ALL amazing! Alllllll of their PO Boys are delicious too!  Oh and those delicious beignets are a sinfully good dessert! I was SO excited to visit the Gumbo Bros' new brick & mortar location, and it does not disappoint!  The place is cosy, with a brick wall on one side, complete with pics and descriptions of their 2 featured foods: Gumbo (""a big bowl of southern comfort"") and Po'Boys (""the best sandwich you'll ever scarf"").  There are 3 tables (2 tall, for standing/stools; and one short, with regular chairs) lining a red wall on the left side. You order and pay up front at the back, with a peek-view of the kitchen (where they work their magic!). If you're lucky enough to meet the owners, they are so so nice too, and very open and friendly!(I'm also hoping for a return of the Rabbit Stew they featured once during their days at Urban Bites!) Either way though, The Gumbo Bros is Definitely worth a special trip from Manhattan for, and that's saying a lot!!",The Gumbo Bros
394,I don't understand the hype. Server looked unhappy when I didn't order the bottomless 90 min mimosa for $29.95. Personally I think that's pricey compared to other bottomless places. Then we ordered the chorizo & hash and eggs Benedict w/ pulled pork. Both dishes lacked seasoning. At least provide hot sauce.,"So came here for Sunday brunch with Lebom. We had some time to kill waiting for Jimz to get off work. The site made it seem like an interesting fusion of Chinese and Cuban culture. So we struck off towards there. As we got there, the place was pretty empty. We ask the hostess for 2. She asked if we had reservations. We said no. She goes ohhh... It was a bit odd because there were about 5 parties seated. We didn't care so we sat at the bar. The bartender gave us pretty prompt service given no one else was at the bar. We ordered yucca fries, the unlimited drinks for 90 minutes, chorizo hash and cuban eggs benedict. Yucca fries were steaming hot. Nice crispy exterior with a starchy interior that didn't feel heavy at all. So chorizo hash was bomb. The sauce on it really made the dish. The chorizo was well flavored. The egg yolks helped to blend the flavors. No for the benedict. It came with pulled pork that was dry. Dry that egg yolk couldn't save it. The poached eggs were slightly overcooked and the yolk didn't quite run as it should. So it did get a little busier over time. Still, we were confused because there was always at least 1 empty table the entire time we were there. Also, for about the last 20 minutes, no one asked if we wanted another drink. Stars docked for service and the dry pulled pork. Chorizo hash was good, but not enough to save the experience and bump it to 4 stars.","The drinks were average and It's a cute bar. The prosecco was $16 which is fine but my issue was that I came for one drink with my friends but because we were six people apparently, even when you sitv at the bar they charge you a 20% tip. He literally just poured a drink then gave himself a $3.20 tip. The drink was not worth $20.62. I don't appreciate that way of doing business.","My friend and I went to Calle Dao over the weekend for brunch before a Broadway show and we were very impressed! To start, we decided to do the bottomless brunch. It was annoying because it was required that we both order it. I get that they're probably trying to make sure people aren't drinking another's cocktails for free, but something to note in case you are a large group. I was very impressed with the service. Unlike other bottomless brunch spots, they actually were attentive and kept refilling our drinks. You could mix and match cocktails throughout the service. The food was great too. I had the chorizo hash which came with two sunny side up eggs, and had delicious aioli on it. Yum!Would highly recommend for anyone forced to be in midtown. Was a delight.","I liked the ambiance but the food was just okayI wouldn't consider it to be good Chinese or Cuban food. We had the pork dumplings, lechon asado with fried rice, the steak with rice and maduros. The lechon was pale and under seasoned, everything else was simply okay. The best part of the meal were the dumplings. No need to go back for seconds.","Really pricey, although what we tried was good enough.My favorite has to be the paella - other dishes were just ok, and pretty forgettable. Service was fun, however, and I think it'd be a good place for a larger group dinner with all of the space in the back. Happy Hour could also be fun, as the drinks and food would be less expensive.Cuban Chinese food might sound enticing, but I would probably not come back to Calle Dao.",Calle Dao - Bryant Park
395,"Shengjian is not ""pan fired Xiao long bao"" . This is so disappointing! I thought it will be authentic Shanghai shengjian, but it's not.","Ok, this is the last time I will dine here. I already give this restaurant many chances. (Current location and previous location). The food quality and the service is just below average. Some dishes look authentic on the menu but in reality it's just not flavorful with smaller portions. By the way, they are so lazy, they tried to get people use Chinese WeChat to order food. Come on.",Came here with my girlfriend and another couple on a Friday night.  Food was just fine for authentic Shanghai cuisine.  The vegetable dishes were pretty good but when it came to the meat dishes we were a little disappointed.  All in all probably won't return.,"Good Shanghainese food with amazing Xiaolongbao! I ordered the Steamed Xiaolongbao, Pan Fried Pork Xiaolongbao, Wuxi Pork Ribs, Dry-Fried Green Beans with Minced Pork. The Xiaolongbao -- both Pan Fried and steamed -- taste delicious but different than your typical soup dumpling. It has a sweeter taste but it is really delicious. My friend and I loved the steamed one so much we got a second order. The pork ribs and greens were delicious as well but the Xiaolongbao was the clear rockstar for me. Make sure to order that whenever you visit!","The food is three stars, mediocre. The reason that I only give 1 star is that they recommend the tip calculated by 15% of (price plus tax), which is not the way that it is supposed to be. I am NOT GONNA PAY YOUR TIP ON TAX! The tip should be only 15% of just price, not including tax.New comments to response message from management: I won't remove review since I calculated myself when I had the check. And the recommended tip is after tax, I have pretty strong memory. I wonder whether it is controllable by the staff. I was there on this Wednesday night, and I ordered zha jiang mian and Wuxi pork rib. I really wish I have taken the picture of receipt.","Food is moderate at best- I came with a group of 8 so we were able to order a variety of dishes. The best dish was definitely the pan fried baos. I was pleasantly surprised and could've had 3 orders of just that myself. They were crunchy on the bottom, filled with delicious hot soup inside and completed with flavorful filling. I assumed the soup dumplings would be as equally good, but they weren't- they were very sweet and not as delicate as the ones you'd get at places like Din Tai Feng.One of the people in my party is a lover of fried glutinous in sauce so we ordered that but the taste was off that the rest of people barely touched it. The beef noodle soup was just ok but nothing I would crave eating again.With so many new Chinese places popping up all over Manhattan, nothing here is tugging at my heart strings to come back.",Tipsy Shanghai
396,"This is the spicy Thai food, not the typical pad Thai or drunken noodle type of Thai food. The restaurant focuses on Northern Thai food. We ordered:- Mushroom pineapple curry - Mixed seafood We were both crying while eating but it was so tasty!","We don't know if it was the freezing situation at the tables near the door or the spiciness of the dishes but we were quite disappointed with our dinner here.After reading so many positive reviews, we've decided it's about time to trek to 4th street on a cold winter night to try Ugly Baby. Compared to our first attempt, this time it didn't take us long to be seated, but near the door.We found the tables so close to each other that private/intimate conversation is not expected here. Our waiter however was genuinely helpful and she discussed with us the spicy levels of each of the dishes.We started with a bottle of IPA beer and ordered the fried sea bream, pigs tongue and pork belly with shrimp paste, it was served in timely fashion although it gotten really cold as soon as they put it on our table. In fact it was so cold we could not even remove our jackets and beanies because of the temperature, my lower body was freezing, it was that bad! I hope that the management would read this and do something with the door situation specially in winter time, as I said we didn't enjoy our dinner this time but will keep an open mind to come back in warmer weather.","All Hype! Bon Appetite wrote an article about this place and got a ton of hype on this little hole in the wall Thai place. As a true foodie, I will speak from experience. The food is SO spicy that you will not even taste a thing. At the point of extreme, your mouth is numbed and food is not enjoyable. At all. I don't even want to mention any food items separately as I usually do in a Yelp review because I lost all interest in the food after my second dish came out and was UNBEARABLY spicy. I asked kindly the waiter if the spiciness can be toned down, he said without hesitation, a firm ""No"". I hated my experience so much that I will not be wasting my time explaining each dish. I will not be returning, ever. Food was not that good, and the spiciness was way too overpowering.","Ugly Baby is, without a doubt, the best Thai restaurant I've yet experienced in this city--or really, anywhere. I'm no expert, but to the best degree I can tell, it's got ""real"" authentic Thai food. No pad thais or standard green/red curries here; instead, you'll find an incredible array of new and exciting dishes, ALL of which look equally appealing.We went with the Khao Sui Nuer and Shrimp, Squid, and Egg Yolk, which was plenty for the two of us. The Khao Sui Nuer comes with a fiery curry sauce on the side that you can titrate in to your liking, but be careful--it's really, really good *and* really, really potent. The shrimp and squid dish is a little milder, but equally fantastic. It's not as spicy, but very flavorful with coconut- and tamarind-ish notes. I'd highly recommend both.If anything, our only regret here was not having a larger group to share (and try) more dishes. That being said, it's a small-ish space, so I wouldn't plan for more than 4, maybe max. 6.A few other notes. First, the staff here are excellent. There's a lot to work with on the menu, and they were great with helping us find something well suited to our preferences. Second, the place is simple and has a sort of hole-in-the-wall charm, but the quirky, rainbow decor adds to the fun of the whole experience. And finally, this is one of the best ""value-for-quality"" deals in the city. Most entrees are in the $15-20 range, with generous, very much splittable portions.In short: Ugly Baby is freaking great. Go ASAP.","I've seen a lot of ugly babies in my time (some on Yelp), but this Ugly Baby bites back. If you're into authentic Thai food with a giant spicy kick, then you've come to the right place.The Khao Soi Nuer (northern egg noodle soup) WILL make you sweat. But that's good. Get all those toxins out. Don't worry, the staff will keep your ice water cup filled. And provide you with more cutesy napkins to dab your forehead.Portion sizes are also pretty big, so just when you think you can make it through without burning a hole in your stomach, you find a whole 'nother hunk of beef and even more noodles. Yowza.Their beer list is also surprisingly good. A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one!",My favorite Thai place in all of New York! Any time I'm in the area I stop by. I'm seriously hooked! They have some things on the menu that are SPICY which is always a fun challenge and some dishes that are mild to give your stomach a break.My go tos:Kao Tod Nam KlookKang HohMood Pad KapiKhao Soi NuerBut honestly everything is good!!

397,"Food is excellent, but service is awful! I made a reservation ahead, and when I got in, they told me table was not ready yet. I reserved the seat just for myself! And they set me wait and the waitress left and left me alone. After 20 min of wait, waitress said no table available, and threw me onto a bar! WTH? What is the point with reservation? And after I ordered the food, it took soooooo long to come, even the people came to the bar later than I, they got food right away! even you are busy, stop being sour and salty to a diner with himself!","Came here for MealPal and got an order of the kale salad with chicken.This place has a lot of good ratings on Yelp so I had somewhat high expectations. The kale salad was a very uninspired and plain meal--one that I don't think they would actually serve in their restaurant. The one positive was the dressing which was a citrus dressing that had great flavor, but it barely was sufficient to eat with the kale that they seemingly just cut up and served raw.","Had higher expectations based on yelp reviews.  Started with the beet appetizer.  The spreads were good but the bread that came with it was terrible - not soft bread, and not crisp chips - something in between - like bread that was too hard.   Just terrible.  I never have leftovers but I couldn't eat this dish.  Also had the double burger and fries - it was a solid burger, and I'd get it again if I were in the neighborhood and wanted a burger, but I wouldn't make this place a destination.  It was also too loud for my taste.","Saw this place on Instagram and decided to drop by for a try due to the highly rated reviews. I'm glad I did! Ambience and decor: 7/10. Nothing special to see here. The entrance is quite pretty if the ladies want to take a photo outside. Inside it's a bit dark. Has a bit of a pubby bar feel to it even though it's contemporary outside. Don't know why.. just how I felt. Service: Phenomenal. Everyone from the hostess stand to our server were so courteous and upbeat. Love that. 10/10 Food: Impressive! The octopus was seared beautifully, and the pulled mozzarella literally made us say wow. It was chewy and warmed to room temperature for optimal flavor and texture. The meatballs were crispy on the outside but hot and soft on the inside. Mixed with the fragrant cheese, it was so good we'd ordered seconds.As for the mains we'll keep it simple. Save the ravioli for somewhere else. The pork chop and steaks were cooked perfectly. Steak came out true medium rare and paired very well with that green butter they put there. (I don't know what it is but it isn't avocado in case you're wondering). Pork chop was juicy and not over cooked like every other restaurant. 9/10 on the food. *As for dessert, they were average, but the coffee was awful. Tasted like stale watered down coffee. I'd kindly asked them to remake the pot and it was fine afterwards. I place Trademark at a 8.5/10 because there's nothing I ate that I'm craving to go back for- which means that although the food was solid, it's not that special of a place. Perfect if your ex girlfriend wants to meet up","Great brunch in NYC. Friends in town for the weekend and I am very happy that I have chose TM for brunch. We didn't try their brunch drinks, but coffee was good, at least beyond my expectations, since no one on yelp have ever mentioned their coffee.I ordered burrata and garlic knots, amazing! A little bit heavy for brunch I know, but worth every calories:pGarlic knots was crispy and warm, and burrata was just the right level of texture, a bit chewy, I like it so much!Will come back to try other dishes on the menu.","I can only speak to breakfast and coffee via Ritual pickup in the front coffee area .  The restaurant is in the back. Perfectly prepared cappuccino with milk foam art, it wasn't busy so the barista actually waited until I arrived to prepare it to ensure my coffee wasn't cold by the time I got it- Much appreciated ( I also arrive a bit early). The avocado toast has a generous amount of avocado on it and is flavored well- for the price it's a decent NYC breakfast. Cute spots with good service so check it out for at least your breakfast and coffee needs.",Trademark Taste + Grind
398,"solid place for a burger and a beer. Nothing mind-blowing, but an adequate enough menu, multiple ""meat"" options and plenty of options to customize.","Solid burger spot! The burgers we got were delicious, with unique flavors and toppings, really adding a bit of flair a lot of burger joints are missing. Prices are fair, somewhere between Shake Shack and Ainsworth, so no complaints. Ok beer menu, but they're missing out on not having any specialty cocktails and a craft beer menu, that doesn't have simple cheaper beers (starting at $8 per). Would go back for a burger, not just for a beer though.","My friend came in from Philly to meet up and he and I wanted to eat and have a beer or two to catch up. Black Iron was close by Penn Station and we didn't feel like going too far.We met up a little before lunch so the place seemed pretty empty and we sat along the wall in front of the mirror. Our server was nice and attentive and after looking at the menu I ended up getting The Little Italy burger and the cajun fries based on the recommendation of our server, got that with some beers as well.The burger was okay, honestly nothing super special and but it was a decent price, it felt like a fast casual type burger with table service. I will say that you might want to avoid the place during lunch because it gets packed with a lot of people very quickly.",This is one of those places  I 100% must go to when i visit Manhattan.  Without fail they are always serving up perfect burgers and their staff is a charming crew of characters that not only deliver on great service but are just good people that im glad I met.  The management has a great eye for talent and running a smooth ship.Everytine I leave Black Iron Burger I feel like I've experienced some of the very best of exactly why I love this city so much.,"Amazing food, amazing service. I reserved a table with my husband an hour before we arrived and once we arrived, we were seated immediately. The server was excellent in recommending beers and took our orders correctly.Food was delicious and tasted fresh not frozen, we were checked on multiple times and had various items replenished (I.e water). When an issue occurred, the server jumped on it quickly and made sure we were taken care of (even after much protest).As a first timer here, I will definitely recommend and will be back next time we are in NYC.","I gave this 5 stars on purpose. The food was Fantastic! I got the masterful burger and it was beyond amazing, great use of spices. The service was exceptional. Made a reservation using yelp, and received a notification ahead of time that i was confirmed and then was greated immediately as i Entered, was seated right away with ZERO wait time because they had reserved a table for us ahead of time. The Beer was fantastic! If you are a fan of craft brews please enjoy their menu, very well crafted and masterful ;) Will come again!My girlfriend was very thirsty as we arrived, originally giving us small waters to start but as the staff realized....she was VERY thirsy, so they brought over a large water right away.

399,"Tiny pieces, fresh fish, and then a quick trip to Ichiran for ramen.My fellow diners and I started with a drink. None of them impressed and all of them were weak. Seating was delayed due to the previous group being slow so the 30 minute dinner is not enforced. My group still finished under 30 minutes despite starting much later than everyone else.The pieces were small and tasty. Yellowtail, lean tuna, spotted prawn, salmon roe, albacore, scallop, sea urchin, fatty tuna, salmon, surf and turf, unagi. You can tell the chefs if you don't prefer any of the pieces. I'm not a fan of salmon roe, so my salmon roe was given to a fellow diner, and I received a white fish piece (don't recall what it was exactly).Sushi by Bou is a great idea if you've never had an omakase and the price point is great but I don't recommend if you're a seasoned sushi eater and if you know what you want.","This place is a casual omakase the entire experience was light hearted, fun and quick. The sushi quality was good but not so much that I wanted to order any extra. It is a little tricky to find- located in the basement of hotel. We tried to walk in first time we were in New York and learned reservation was necessary. The experience was memorable but with that said I am not sure if I will return.","Made a reservation for their 30 min Omakase on Monday 2/11/19 at 1:30 pm about a week in advance via text.  AVOID.NEGATIVES:-They first offer you hot tea, sake, cocktail and it sounds complimentary but it's not.  I had hot water basically for $2, no tea flavor to be found in my cup.-30 min isn't truly 30 min if the previous guests are running behind so I was seated at 1:45 pm not 1:30 pm, this is a big deal if you have to be somewhere and you're squeezing in a 30 min meal that is now 45 min-The restaurant overbooked and basically forced 9 people instead of 8 to sit at the counter so that was tight and uncomfortable for no reason - are you kidding me??-2 chefs working the counter, 1 chef was significantly faster than the other so half the guests were served behind by 1 piece and this should really be synchronized, it just looks amateur and careless-At the end the chefs asked each person if they wanted to add any additional pieces and I got left out of the equation altogether...so EIGHT out of the NINE people seated got an extra piece...I was that lucky ONE left out...wooooooPOSITIVES:-Fatty tuna was solid-After complaining to management when paying for my check that I was never asked if I wanted to order any additional pieces (I only wanted fatty tuna) and I tried several times to get the attention of the slow chef I had to rush to my appointment but he was nice enough to discount my check but it still left me very frustrated and disappointedSkip this place!  Too many amazing sushi places in NYC to rush to eat in 30 min or in my case 45 min for this crappy experience!","I heard of this place because of my cousin. He's been following their instagram page for a while. I'm glad we stopped by and tried this place! The best bang for your buck. This place charges about $54 dollar for an omakase. You get about 12 pieces. What makes this spot a different (versus other omakase places (comparing this to California) is that you only have 30minutes and for the price of 54 dollars. You're getting uni, wagyu, and toro! The sushi was very high quality.(melts in your mouth) Also, on top of that they have great customer service. Shout out to the Manager Kevin, for making us feel very welcomed and made sure we had an awesome time. I will definetly stop by whenever I visit NYC. I highly recommend stopping by this place! Another note, you need to make a reservation before coming! (They only have about 9 seats)","The food was absolutely delicious! I had a 30min omakase course (which went over 30mins) and a big mac, and left the restaurant still hungry. I love sushi. Every piece was my favorite piece. The Botan (Sweet Shrimp) definitely stood out, and the Wagyu Uni handroll; so generous of them to include Wagyu Uni in a $50 omakase course. The Big Mac was to die for. You need to try that at least once! $50 for 11 pieces of sushi and a handroll? That's a bargain! The service here was attentive, just a little too chattery. If you like having the staffs engage with you while you're eating and taking pictures, Sushi by Bou is the place for you. If you just want to do your own thang and enjoy a good meal at peace, without feeling like people are looking over your shoulder the whole time, this may not be your spot.","I'm a HUGE fan of Omakase so during my trip to NYC I yelped for one of the best and found Sushi by Bou! This bougie restaurant was one of the highlights of my NYC trip. *You NEED a reservation* which you can easily do on yelp. I say this because the restaurant is small, I mean 9 seats small, and it's timed (30 min) which means you have to get there ON TIME or you'll forfeit your reservation. *Location - I was so lost lol. The restaurant is actually in a basement and located underground. It's the door with the small gate and lots of graffiti. I walked back and forth because google maps was telling me I was at the right spot but there was no sign! I ended up walking down to the basement and the workers were laughing at me - apparently they have a camera and were watching me go back and forth lol. IMAX - Such an awesome dude! He's the host, bartender, friend, manager, all of the above - and truly made my experience here that much more. I came alone and he sat me down next to this couple who were also watching Hamilton after dinner. We ended up bonding, drinking, laughing so hard. IMAX, thanks for introducing me to new friends! He made us delicious (and strong drinks) and also poured us complimentary sake shots! *FOOD - TOOOO DIE FOR. Everything I had was AMAZING. 12 fresh, high quality sushi pieces for $50 is a steal. In LA, that's easily $100! There was not one thing I didn't enjoy. This place isn't just about the food (though it was delicious) but the incredible, stellar experience.",Sushi by Bou Times Square
400,Brunch time:  My friend and I did Brunch celebrating our birthday. We both ordered from the Brunch menu.  I was not impressed with the food. Everyone seems miserable.  The atmosphere was boring.

CP Pro tip: grab a bloody at the Lobster Joint and then walk down to smorgasburg for a nice afternoon.","Be prepared to wait an hour for food that needs minimal cooking with no explanation or apology. The sliders are tiny and soggy because they spilled my soup on them. No pickle with your sliders. Food was okay. $50 for two lunch specials, two beers and a bad feeling about this places :(","I came here this past weekend after me and my boyfriend went on a sailboat ride along the East River (thanks AirBnb experiences)! A little fun factoid we heard along our boat ride is that a person can safely eat one fish a month from the East River. So we had our one fish and then left for an actual dinner (just kidding). But we did decided to make it an all around nautical night. My seafood-loving-heart can almost not handle the deliciousness of Lobster Joint. It's a very cool place, with plenty of tables and a covered backyard complete with a giant swordfish, projection screen and plenty of picnic tables. You order at the register inside and then grab your number and head to a table. I went for the crab cake sandwich. As delicious as it sounds. It was warm and fresh and was a perfect size so I was definitely full. It also came with a side so I went with the mac and cheese. It was good but not the best, I thought it was just the tiniest bit bland. Next time I'll go for the corn or fries. Next time I go for a boat ride in the neighborhood or simply am craving good seafood and a backyard, I'll be back. Definitely recommend!","We came here on a Friday before Labor Day weekend. The place was empty which was perfect because we had a stroller. We ordered the New England lobster roll, corn on the cob, lobster grilled cheese, a beer (some kind of ale, said the husband) and a margarita. Everything was delicious except for the corn and the margarita. There was so much lobster in my lobster roll (def more than Luke's lobster!) The corn didn't have corn taste and the margarita was just kind of plain. Should have gone for the Bloody Mary since there were signs that they won some sort of award... but it's hard for me to say no to tequila. We sat in the backyard and the inside was super well AC'd. We'll be coming back!","This place has amazing customer service and is managed very well in all aspects that I can think of. They're clean, both, inside the establishment and outside. Their staff is friendly, efficient and purposeful even on a really busy/chaotic day. The food is arguably as tasty as any other restaurant specializing in lobster/shellfish, if not the tastiest. Lastly, they're reasonably priced as well as conveniently located.Nothing makes me want to support a restaurant more than being treated with the Platinum Rule: Treat Your Customers As They Would Want To Be Treated. And, that comes from excellent management doing their due diligence and making the happiness of their top priority. Great work all around. Keep it up and you'll be seeing a lot more of me. Cheers.",Lobster Joint
401,Come here frequently and my orders are consistently wrong. I also once found a fly in my side salad here.,"Pricey for a tartinery. I got the roast beef tartinery which ended up being about 18 bucks after tax. The ingredients are not bad and it comes with a good amount of arugula and roast beef over sour dough but for the price and what you are exactly getting, overpriced.",Goods:Top location.Awesome seating area.Complimentary jenga for the duration of your stay.Next to the hudson!Clean.Bads:Closes early,THE best flavors EVER! Christian was a great server! Would definitely recommend this place and would return!,"*Tartinery is one of the food vendors at Hudson Eats, but this Yelp page appears to be for every vendor there*Love love Tartinery, especially their now shuttered NoLita restaurant. This location is in the Hudson Eats food hall of the sparkling Brookfield Plaza, shelling out great French open-faced sandwiches. I got a variety of them, including some old favorites, but 4 tartines for $70 is a bit much. Maybe one or two next time and definitely the Roast Beef!Roast Beef tartine comes topped with thinly sliced beef that's smooth and delicious. The perfect melding of thin roast beef, creamy truffle mayo and a nice bite from the arugula. It's surprisingly rich, but subtle too. Chicken Salad tartine comes with shaved celery & toasted pistachio, which I like because of all the crunch from the toppings, but expect a lot of celery.Croque Madame with ham, gruyère & bechamel, comes with an organic sunny-side up egg. You can also go the Monsieur route, with no egg on top. Definitely their richest tartine from the bechamel sauce, but another winner. Smoked Salmon tartine with crème fraiche, capers, radish etc is very similar to bagel & lox, subtle and fresh in flavors and great over the sourdough bread. I love Tartinery and even as a food hall option, they're still A++. Just don't forget the Roast Beef tartine!",Love this place. So convenient and friendly. This is towards the back of Hudson Eats with a wrap around bar seating area. There's also a general seating area on the sides. The burrata was great and so was the salad.,Tartinery Hudson Eats
402,"I ordered a beer with ribs and fries. I have never had such a magical experience eating ribs. They were tender enough to eat, but had texture to make sure they do not fall off the bone and make a mess. 10/10",17 Syllables about White Oak TavernGet the brussels sproutsEleven dollar beer flightAverage entrees,"The small plates burrata and the entree bacon cheese burger was DELICIOUS! The service was great. The apple crumble was OK, could've used another scoop of ice cream. It was super hot in there but who knows with this humidity we're having. Not sure if their AC was broken.","Great space, great service, and great food = perfect trifecta! Haven't been in this area since my college days I think, and back then it was just about heavy cheap drinking and eating something cheap and easy like burritos, falafels or other unmentionable street meats ;) The area has cleaned up nicely and the restaurant offerings down here are much more sophisticated and diverse! White oak offers some really beautifully concocted cocktails but with it, a great menu of food selections that go really well with said cocktails or a dram of their selection of harder stuff from their hard stuff bible. Portions to prices are very well balanced and truly there was nothing that we ordered, and our party of seven ordered a few things from practically all categories of their menu listings, that we would not hesitate to order again multiple times over. Service was warm and really attentive and I liked that the entire wait staff and bus staff worked so well to bring out and then clear our table efficiently and unobtrusively. It's a great place to bring your visiting friends and family to brag about the great food in NYC or a first date sitch or even just a gathering spot with friends for the evening. So looking forward to my next visit!!","This is such a cozy little spot near NYU, and a slight departure from the dive bars near campus. It's dark and has an old feel, but is definitely more casual than you'd expect. This is a whiskey bar for sure, but they do have an ample selection of beer and wine, and both me and my SO were thoroughly satisfied with our Pinot noir and house beer respectively. As for food, we were able to still capitalize on their happy hour deals, and went with small plates. We went the extra cheesy route: cheese and mac, and a burrata plate with grilled tomatoes. Both were excellent, with the burrata being creamy and pairing well with the perfectly grilled tomatoes.Meanwhile, the cheese and mac was incredibly rich with a bechamel sauce filled with all of the best cheeses for homemade mac and cheese (gruyere and fontina anyone?). It is definitely food coma inducing, so come with as empty a stomach as possible if you plan on having it.Overall, a solid near-campus joint if you're looking for good eats at a nice sit down place.","This place is very cute, it reminded me of being in a spooky old English pub or a haunted house. The food was really good, I had the octopus and a salad. My husband had a burger and fries and it was delicious. Everything came out very fast. The service was good too, I will go back.The only cons were the octopus was way too small portion for the price. It was an entree price but only a few tiny pieces of octopus, also It would be great if this place served bread on arrival.",White Oak Tavern
403,"Bozu is a decent spot for their so-called sushi bombs.  I came here many years ago and remembered it being so amazing.  On my most recent visit, it was just okay.  I sat at the bar and it took some time before being acknowledged.  Service in general isn't their strong suite.  I ordered two sushi bombs, which really are just oversized nigiri balls.  The flavors were good but the rice sort of fell apart when I'd pick the pieces up.  Not a big deal, just not the special treat I remembered from so many years ago.",Veggie sushi bomb. Yes. That good.There is something thatabout the shape of these delicious little mounds of rice topped with roasted Brussels sprouts that keeps me coming back.,"We came here for the sushi bomb as they look nice. We tried the pink bomb (salmon), Mexican bomb (salmon), shiro bomb (white tuna), hotate bomb (scallop) and una bomb (eel). Una bomb is my favorite, followed by hotate bomb. Their spicy seafood miso soup has 3 shrimps, 3 mussels, 3 baby scallops, cabbage, corn, snow peas and enoki mushrooms. The taste is ok.","TLDR: Dim lighting, Good sushi.I got the party bomb which comes in 12 pieces. The unique thing I liked about this place is that they gave pre made soy sauce with 3 different levels of wasabi spice in it. 1 was regular soy sauce, 1 had a little bit of wasabi, and 1 had a lot of wasabi in it.The fish was soft and I would come eat at this place if I was in the area. The dim lighting makes it hard to take IG pictures!","I'm only knocking off one star because of the awful, awful lighting in here. Half of our table was lit and half wasn't. They tried to go all out with the decor and while a lot of the decorations were very tastefully done, lighting of the tables weren't. The food itself was splendid. We got the pork belly and fried chicken as appetizers. The pork belly was very soft and served with a steaming hot broth underneath which I felt like had so much flavor and depth in itself. The fried chicken was dressed with a red vinegar. I've never had fried chicken and red vinegar but oh my God. I didnt even realize how much I absolutely love sour flavors! They have sets with variations of fish and rice. It reminds me of a rice ball with fish on top. Each one had it's own pairings and flavors and they have this premixed sauces for you which include regular soy, medium spicy soy, and very spicy soy. I enjoyed this because I would spoon just enough sauce per piece and I wouldn't be breaking my rice by dipping it into soy sauce. I also got a roll called the YYG stinky bomb. I thought it was funny to call it that just because there was garlic in it but I definitely understood afterwards. The smell and taste remained in my mouth well after the meal had ended and as a garlic lover....I loved it! Be careful though if people around you don't love garlic and you have to get up close and personal with them!",Delicious!! The bombs are the must try at this spot.. shared the party special and was impressed by the tasty and bold flavors. My favorite and most unique bombs include the Spicy McBomb and Mexican Bomb. Also tried the ika which was fantastic and served with a vegan spicy mayo as well as the miso soup. Cocktails are on the sweet side. Service is attentive and food is prepared quickly.. we were in and out in 45min-1hr. You can place yourself on a waitlist on Yelp during peak hours. Prices are also very reasonable. Would definitely come back!,Bozu
404,"So I just came from Samurai Mama and the food wasn't too bad, however service was not good. The waitress spilled some oil on my friends dress and also accidentally dropped a dirty spoon on my arm. I know it was clearly an accident, however it's ridiculous that they require a 20% tip for a party for a party of 5. With the accident we would have tipped way below 20% because they didn't even try to offer anything for consolation. Their service definitely does not deserve the 20%. I was considering to fight against the bill, however it may be a losing battle and just not worth my time.","We were a party of 8 - 4 adults and 4 children (kids 6 and under) - the place was decently busy, but we didn't have to wait. The host seated us within a few minutes, but then returned to say that there was a $30 minimum per person, including the kids. Confused, we asked him to clarify a few times. For a place that sells $10-$16 udon/ramen mains, I don't get how they expected the adults to eat/drink that much to ""make up"" for the childrenI'd get it if they had a line out the door and were worried we would take up too much space and not spend enough, but wow, talk about not family friendly. Too many options in the neighborhood to deal with this kind of nonsense.",This restaurant was so unfriendly. Ramen and Katsudon were all tasteless. So I gave the tip 15%. The restaurant took a 35% tip from my card unilaterally. This restaurant was the worst restaurant among the restaurants I have ever visited.,"This place is beautiful. It's a nice spot to go with family and friends, or even by yourself. However on a date I'm not so sure. You would have to grab a booth for privacy. It's a traditional family styled setting which leaves your conversation open to everyone to hear. And although we weren't talking about anything crazy, it's a little annoying to see people staring at you from a cross the room. I didn't like the edamame because it's cold, although I was informed it's a supposed to be served that way. But it's a beautiful , little hole in the wall that I would definitely try again once.","Came in for lunch and realized this place has a similar ambiance to bozu, then I found out they have the same owner. The lunch specials come with salad and homemade miso soup. I had the kakiage donburi, which is bits and pieces of veggies like carrots & burdock fried in tempura batter. Reminded me of my childhood and came stacked high on a bed of rice. My husband got the dry curry donburi, which is ground pork in curry sauce on top of a bed of rice. The pork comes about fist size, with a huge potato croquette + poached egg. Great service, they never let our water glasses go empty and made sure we enjoyed our food :) would come back!","Super tasty! We got pork udon soup, pork udon dipping style and the sushi tacos. All were very tasty. I felt that the soup udon broth was a bit bland but they provide spicy chili powder on the side that you can add in to kick it up a notch. The sushi tacos are a must get and as far as we could tell, you can't go wrong with the udons",Samurai Mama
405,It's as if they took a meatpacking restaurant and gave it Williamsburg chill flare. Will skip next time!,"Starting off by saying I've got some credibility in experiencing great food and even better service - I've got no problems with most of the hyped up restaurants in NYC that live up to their reputations- Olmstead, Four Horsemen, Roberta's, Metta, Lilia, Maison Premier, every Andrew Tarlow restaurant on the planet - love them all. I'm also not a complainer at restaurants at all unless it's bad. That said, I do not understand the hype here and I just have to air my grievances and we went months ago... to warn my fellow good citizens not to waste your money...Soooo - My friend and I were SHOCKED at how rude the service was (we sat at the bar). We're not too precious at all we don't mind non smiley people but this was .. different. We were ignored for so very long every step of the way. It was excruciating waiting at those dreadful barstools to order a drink, to ask for food menus, to ask for drink menus, to ask for anything at all. I had wondered if there was something I did to this man in a past life. Seriously what the actual .... was going on. Fine we'll put up with it I guess if the food was as good as the hype. But sadly it wasn't.  Overly salted and I LOVE salt. We ordered clams that came in a thick creamy sauce with no shells you had to fish them out of the sauce. Everything was so small and I LOVE small portions. Too smalll Girl bye never coming back.","Don't get me wrong, the food here is incredible. The complexity of the chef's palette is what I must applaud. However, the service did not justify the quality of the food.First impressions, we were seated 30minutes after our reservation time (given that we came 5 minutes earlier), it was unacceptable. Yes I wouldn't mind waiting by the bar for 10minutes, but 30? Also did I mention our dinner reservation was at 10:15pm? I just really hope that the restaurant will get more organized with their reservations and take into account the time it takes to set the tables as well.Another bad impression was that we didn't know the portions and wanted to order more food after our first set of orders, but was unaware that the kitchen closes at 11. Our waitress said that our hostess shouldn't informed us, its not a good look to take blame on others like that. We were in a bad mood, but eventually they realize that we were dissatisfied and take our second order and also gave us the beef tenderloin on the house. It was a good ending to the night actually, because we were very full and satisfied. I'm giving this a 3 stars because I was very unhappy with the service.","Don't come here looking for a llama hotel and/or llama. And definitely don't come here without a reservation. Located in Williamsburg-North in Brooklyn, Llama Inn serves up some of the finest Peruvian cuisine I've ever tried. It's a little pricier here than your typical Peruvian fare, but definitely worth every bite and sip.From their drink menu, I chose one of their Llama Classics called the Llamarita. Made with tequila and mezcal, it tasted of almond, avocado, and lime together and topped with a rim of cinnamon salt. At a price of $16, it was worth every penny and more.From their food menu, the skewers are found within the second group of items from the top. We ordered three skewers (Scallop, Pork Belly, Purple Potato) and they were all so tasty.One of my favorite dishes was the Rock Shrimp, Mussels, Clams, Calamari, Aji Panca, English Peas, Rice. Yup.. that's the name of one dish from Llama Inn's menu. They really spell it out for you. Anyhow, this dish was amazing and I highly recommend it. We also tried the Charred Octopus Ceviche, Togarashi, Avocado, Crispy Squid and loved it as well. Ordering on the first visit might be a little difficult, but our server took the time to explain the whole menu beforehand and she gave very detailed answers for any questions that we had.As mentioned earlier, reservations are a must. Without one, you might be turned away. Go to their website at llamainnnyc.com and book an available time slot and seating arrangement. We were able to find one or two open slots for the next day. Would definitely come back here again!",I love this place so much my friends and I try to replicate the dishes. The restaurant is really beautiful with the big open windows. The locations is very unassuming. Good is always extremely depictions and amazing cocktails as well. Highlights:Pork shoulderCevicheBeet SaladQuinoa SaladBeef tenderloinHeaven for your tastebuds. Don't waste another second.,"Just left the restaurant and well I was underwhelmed. I guess, I was expecting something else?? I wouldn't go back as there's other places that aren't as pricey and more tastier. I did like the service and our server was super nice. She went above and beyond as I asked her about sitting on the rooftop. There was seating, but only the bar area. We declined.Anyways, we decided to order the llama del Rey  and llamarita for drinks. The del Rey drink tasted like sangria but with a slightly different kick. My friend has the other drink. For the food we ordered the locro, fluke ceviche, mariscos, chicken thigh skewer, pork belly skewer, and scallop skewers. The skewers were great, but the locro which tasted like mashed squash soup was interesting. The fluke ceviche was good as I liked how everything was seasoned and the fish was good too. Otherwise, everything else was subpar. Yea, I wouldn't go back especially for the over priced entrees.",Llama Inn
406,"The police need to respond to this location ASAP for drug trafficking because this food is CRACK.

A delicious "" if I die now, this is worth it"" heart attack This is a death row meal I would die happy if this was my last meal. I would come here every single day if I could.","Originally made famous in Chicago, Au Cheval has finally brought their world famous burger to New York City. The menu consists of typical diner dishes but of course elevated to fit the location and clientele. Fitting with the overall atmosphere everything is made to be over the top with it's burger being a prime example. The ""single"" has two patties and the ""double"" has three, go figure but who's complaining since its more food, right? The patties are seared well on the outside but remain juicy inside; they're topped with the right amounts of melted cheese, mayo and pickles all between a brioche bun. The addition of the egg isn't mandatory but the thick cut slabs of peppery bacon are an absolute must.","Giving 5 stars because everything was on point. The bar downstairs when we were waiting, oozed classic dive bar vibes. The burger with egg was phenomenal. We also ordered the Mille dessert with the cream and waffers topped with chocolate syrup. I'd come to this gem again.","So there was a lot of hype about this place, being how famous it was coming from Chicago and what not.The whole place had a bit of an upscale lounge/club vibe to it, dimly lit, nicely furnished, with very similar chandelier light fixtures as Le Coucou. We weren't able to get a reservation until 10pm (party of 6), and they had us wait downstairs at there bar while we waited. The bar seemed like a good intimate cocktail lounge, but the music was slightly too loud.We ended not sitting down until 10:30pm, well past our original reservation, but the hostess was extremely nice and comped us a round of drinks and an appetizer. We ordered a burger each, which has the options to add bacon and/or an egg. The burger was definitely pretty tender and I would say above average, and the egg I thought was a super nice touch. I didn't order the bacon but my friends did, and they said it was a thick slab and very delicious.We also ordered fries for the table, which I also have to say were pretty tasty, along with the aioli sauce.Overall I would say above average taste, but you are paying for a bit of a pretentious atmosphere and a lot of hype. I would return however with an earlier seating. Burger spots usually aren't date spots but this could be one.","Popular in Chicago, Au Cheval NYC is much easier to snag a table. It's located in an unsuspecting alley but decorated like a trendy coffee shop/diner. I tried one of the espresso mocha drinks which had a zesty flavor and was delicious. The single burgers here actually come with two 4 oz patties. The meat is extremely tender and filling but you won't want to skip out on adding the bacon to your burger - trust me on this one. (You can also get the burgers with lettuce buns, or there's a whole gluten free menu listed online.) I got a single with bacon, avocado, a fried egg and a lettuce bun. The burgers are extremely filling but you'll want to try the fries also. The regular fries have a bit of sugar sprinkled on them and come with a garlic aioli. We also tried one of the fries with an egg on it which had a cheese sauce. We were way too full to try dessert.","Thank god Au Cheval opened in New York. I've been to the Au Cheval in West Loop, Chicago several times to share the experience of the best burger ever with my friends + family. BUT the Chicago one often requires a 3 hour wait b/c it's super small and they don't take reservations or even pick up their phone.This one is MUCH more spacious (feels 2-3x larger) AND they take reservations on Resy!!!The burgers taste the same (yay). Keep in mind that the single cheeseburger is 2 patties! Also to get the full experience you gotta get the egg and thick-cut bacon. The bacon is the best part - it's smoky and sweet. I wouldn't come here for anything else really (for ex, I tried the yellowfin tuna salad and thought it was unmemorable). I'd instead suggest getting the fries to go along with your burger.",Au Cheval Diner
407,"Not sure why rating so high, the food is ok but not outstanding. I ordered falafel with naya bowl. The shell of the falafel was too hard, the texture was wrong, taste was ok though but not even close to the best falafel I had in Israel or canada.",Food came late. Super dry. Schwarma plate was described with salad and sauces. It arrived just old dry meat and rice. Nothing more. The falafel sandwich was dried up falafel in dry bread and soggy tomato. Extremely disappointed.,Food is decent but I do not shop at cash-less places. They are classist and hostile to people without a lot of funds.,"It was one of my best experiences in nyc!! The food was not only great, but it was super healthy! The price was amazing. It is not easy to meet this price with this quality, especially in new york. I would definitely visit again!","I ate here today for lunch since I was in the area for work. The line was absurdly long. This was the only restaurant that had a line out the door so I figured that it MUST give this place a try. The line actually moved really fast, it wasn't really a wait at all. All the staff had very positive energy while they served the food. I ordered the chicken shawarma bowl with the  fete. They have many different types of toppings and sauces which is a great thing however, I usually like to try everything so, guess what I did, I added a little bit of every single topping. I felt that with the side of hummus, eggplant, tahini sauce, and some other white sauces, and the pickles the food tasted very sour and citrusy. All the sauces overpowered the chicken and the rice. I would think that it'd taste better with fewer toppings. Unless you really like the sour, pickled, citrusy taste...don't do what I did. I must say all the ingredients tasted really fresh, but I was having a hard time enjoying the Lebanese taste of the food in the sense thst I couldn't taste the Mediterranean/ Lebanese flavors. It almost tasted like chopotle with hummus and eggplanton the side .... (if that makes any sense...ahhh I didn't want to say this). This place wouldn't be my first choice for lunch or for any other times of the day, but it was good nevertheless.","We order from Naya all the time for lunch. It gets absurdly busy around lunch time, to the point where sometimes they have to shutdown their delivery service to meet demands.  Imagine that, ""we are getting so much business that we cannot accept your business"".   The hardest thing about Naya is all of the options you can get in your bowl.  I always go for the lamb or the chicken, I feel like the chicken is more moist and savory than the lamb since the lamb I get sometimes is double cooked and dried.  They will definitely entertain you if you just tell them to add everything into the Naya bowl.  I have pretty much have always done this and left so satisfied.",NAYA
408,Mushroom appetizer and salmon are must order!Salmon has a smoked flavor to it!Cacio e Pepe is not as good as before..,This place is so overrated. The interior and decorations were gorgeous but the food was just meh. My friend and I came here for dinner and started with the whole crispy mushroom and ordered the duck and cod as our main entrees and were not impressed. It was just ok. Nothing special to talk about. Kind of disappointing considering all the positive reviews on yelp.,The waiter I had ruined this experience. He was rude dismissive and no consideration. Had no interest in even explaining anything on the menu. He put dirty plates on top of the food I wanted to take home and never had the decency to apologize for his mistake. Instead his arrogance was on full display with his dismissive unapologetic attitude. The manager did ultimately do the right thing but wondering how a restaurant of this caliber allows for such rotten staff? A business is represented by those who work there and this kid needs a lesson in customer service or he should not be working in the service industry. Will not spend a dime of my money in this place again as a result of his behavior. He might do better working at Taco Bell.,"Gramercy, New YorkThis area of manhattan is known for many swank, offbeat / Popular lounges & contemporary eateries. Upland is an amalgamate of an exclusive atmosphere, leading-edge interior design, and avant-garde detailing.

I highly recommend this chic and modern adventure in a progressive and stylish manhattan neighborhood.","I can totally see why this place is a hit: preserved lemons in jars and a menu that includes a crispy fried whole hen mushroom. I also love the cozy two-person booth seating so, even though it gets loud at times, you can still hear each other. Besides eating at super early hours and feeling sleepy halfway through a meal, my inner granny also finds a low decibel to be absolutely essential. My fiancé and I started with the Oaxacan on Sunshine (amazing pun) and the Pisco Kid - I liked the latter a great deal more, if only because I could never hate the combination of pisco, grapefruit cordial, and raspberry preserves. I think others might find it a touch too sweet but I love fruity drinks. You cannot leave here without ordering the whole mushroom. It's like a much, much better version of Outback's bloomin' onion. Freakin' delicious umami bomb that's almost meaty in texture and taste. The little gem salad was actually quite large for an appetizer (and a salad at that) with generous chunks of avocado, though I couldn't get behind the dressing, which had a little too much acidity and tartness to it. In fact, I think that's the one thing, taste-wise, that I felt was a miss. Almost every dish we got had an overly sour component. The salmon came with pickled artichokes, which the plate could definitely have gone without. However, the fish was cooked perfectly. This is also a presentation nit (yes, I know how lame this makes me sound) but I have yet to see a restaurant that actually manages to pull off the giant white plate + food artistically pushed to the side aesthetic. It just never looks cool to me. I tried some of the skirt steak and, perhaps it's the pescatarian in me, I thought it had quite a bit of gristle and fat. Ordered the sundae for dessert. It was my fiancé's birthday and I really, really appreciate that the waiter brought it out with one very discrete little candle and no singing. I don't think I'd get the dessert again - it was pretty expensive for a small amount of ice cream, nuts, and fruit that melted into soup as soon as it hit our table. The cookie basket looked more up my alley. Want to come back and try the pizzas and pastas.","Great brunch spot for a group! Overall some big hits and a couple misses. Comfortable, open and airy ambiance which is perfect for a leisurely brunch.I came on Sunday in a group of four, which was the perfect number of people to share a bunch of things. We started with the donuts which were delish (3 regular sized donuts). For mains, we split the Cacio e Pepe, the burger, the quiche, and the sausage + kale pizza. The Cacio e Pepe and the burger were amazing - I would definitely come back for both. The quiche was nothing special however, and the pizza's crust was too thick and a little dry because of the dried kale. The pancakes looked amazing but massive. We were stuffed - could've done with one less dish. Waiters were very nice but seemed a little frantic / it was hard to get their attention at times; perhaps they were short-staffed that morning, but don't let that deter you!",Upland
409,"Worst ""fine dining"" experience. Everything is bland and inconsistent. I don't even know how they have a Michelin Star. On top of that the head chef is a narcissist and not a people person.

Squid ink fettuccine, chorizo & rock shrimp5. tajarin & truffle","Came here for brunch over the weekend with some friends. We had noon reservations and our party of 5 was seated promptly. Chorizo HashTwo eggs with some chorizo and potatoes with green sauce. It was tasty bc the chorizo had a bit of a kick to it. But the assembly wasn't anything impressive. It's basically chopped chorizo and potatoes with an egg over green sauce on top. I was expecting more chorizo and hash in one. Its prob less effort to just throw chorizo and potatoes together with an egg on top than if u were to truly make a chorizo hash. Wasn't impressed. Chicken SandoHubster had the chicken Sando and he thought it was average. It was a little too heavily breaded for him. He had better. Donuts We shared the donuts which are chocolate and cinnamon flavored donut holes with a sauce. That was decent. Again nothing special. Service When we walked in it was confusing to figure out who to tell we had reservations. There were a bunch of staff behind the counter all conversing so we thought we had to walk further in to tell somebody but as we did, someone finally approached us to ask if we had reservations. When we told them we had ressies, she wouldn't seat us til the entire party arrived. This is something that bothers me bc if the restaurant isn't super busy, why can't I be seated comfortably so that I can order something to drink. I HATE being forced to sit at the bar when I don't want to order an alcoholic drink. Food took quite some time to arrive as well. Would I come back? Probably not.",soooooo good. best place to eat in brooklyn for brunch or for a night out,"The Sun - Thurs Price Fixe is amazing and belt loosin'A great experience, from food to service.","Had an absolutely fantastic bachelors weekend brunch here.

410,"Been here thrice now and the third time I had a bad experience. Booked a table for 8PM and the waitress showed us to a table and then nobody comes for fifteen minutes. We were just sitting there trying to call someone but everyone ignored us. Fifteen minutes later, a waitress comes to take our order. We order ribs, sweet potato fries and some drinks. Food takes forever to come but our drinks didn't. The ribs came in a small appetizer plate and it was literally impossible to eat out of those. We tried to find a waiter to get a bigger plate but they seemed really busy. Finally, we just asked for the check and left. The whole experience of trying to hail waiting staff, their indifference and incompetence made me really angry. The food isn't even cheap. If you wanna visit this place for dinner, make it early or you might have a hard time like us.","Thank you for the response; upon returning and requesting a ""non-traffic"" table it was a much less stressful experience.",A very unique Korean experience. Highly recommend if you're looking for a more elevated version of Ktown.,"Osamil is one of my favorite gastropubs near ktown-- a friend recently took me for my birthday and the food was really, really good! We started with the oyster mushroom skewers which were packed full of flavor and ever so slightly charred (Maillard reaction pulling THROUGH); the bacon and scallion skewers were also food (fatty but... it's bacon). But the whole fried chicken was one of the best I've had in New York; the skin was so crispy and flavorful and the dipping sauces were sticky, sweet, garlicky, and spicy. Would highly recommend if you're looking for a great place for drinks!","My friends and I came here at around 8:30 pm on a Friday night and surprisingly, we were seated immediately. Although service was a bit slow since we did come on a busy Friday night, food made up for it. We came in a party of 5 and shared sweet potato fries, pork shank, and spicy rice cake. Portions were definitely large enough to make 5 of us full. Because it has a gastropub vibe, it got really loud so we had to literally yell just so other person can hear us. Sweet Potato Fries: (5/5) Highly recommend. If you love sweet potato and fries, definitely get this! It comes with a dip that is amazingly delicious. Pork Shank: (5/5) This was definitely my favorite dish. I was pleasantly surprised with the massive portion of this dish; plenty of meat that comes with salad, lettuce wrap, picked radish. Meat was very flavorful and just melts in your mouth. Spicy Rice Cake: (3.5/5) They have two options--spicy or very spicy. We got the regular spicy and it was indeed spicy. It comes with seafood ingredients--shrimp, squid, mussel, clam, scallop. It was just okay--nothing to write home about. I wished it had more rice cakes. It was my first time at Osamil and I'm glad I stumbled upon this place. Next time, I'll try their Fried Chicken and Uni Bibimbap.","Great food! Highly recommend this place for the pork shank and the kimchi fried rice. Price-wise, really fair considering what you would be paying for a 'finer' Korean gastropub on 32nd Street.",Osamil
411,This is an immediate go to spot. Very good omakase at a reasonable price. The $50 option is good but leaves you wanting a little more but you can add on a few pieces to supplement,"Nothing spectacular..... too rushed for meIn and out in 60 minutes, was not even 50%Full!! Seating was tight and service was so soFood was ok.","Few things I disliked about this place.  I did the 12 pieces omakase and left hungry.  The pieces were way to small little bigger than half the size of other sushi places. One of the pieces came with a spicy Chinese pepper and oil that just didn't belong in an omakase course.  Opt it out if you do come here.  We made the reservation and was seated towards to the end and I don't think it was meant to be a serving seat but as a counter, my knees were always pressed against the counter wall and the top was too far for comfort.  I think because they were getting more reservations than expected they added 4 spots by using the counter, so they can make more money at expense of customers discomfort.  Some of the sushi were ok taste and freshness, but nothing to come back for.","Very delicious number 1. Number 2, amazing service! Very fun and inviting. I had the Big Mac and I was like yooooo!Chef Tim and the rest of the crew engage with guests and it's hard not to have a good time. They love what they do and they know how to joke around and make sure their guests are comfortable. This is great because I've been to other omakase places and sometimes it's just not very interactive. Great experience, and tasty tasty food!","I am an absolute sucker for raw fish sushi - so much so that I forgot to take photos of two of the twelve items in this $50 omakase, because I was in a rush to put them in my mouth. So, how does Sushi by M compare to Sushi by Bou (in Hotel 3232)? The ambience at M is definitely more comfortable - no weird, flashy hip hop-themed decor in blue light; just a traditional sushi bar top with regular fluorescent lighting. The staff at M is more casual and it feels like a home meal, whereas Bou feels more upmarket professional. The seating at M is an hour, double the time at Bou. Also, M serves complimentary magic water. But most importantly, the food? Personally, I think Bou's food is fresher, and the sushi pieces are slightly bigger. M uses the torch to sear fish quite a lot, which detracts from tasting the freshness of fish. They also use a lot of strong flavors (yuzu paste, chili) that sometimes masks the flavor of the fish. Even the wasabi was sometimes a little too heavy-handed. But for ~$4 a piece, this is still amazingly good value.1. Hamachi (Yellowtail)2. Hirame (Fluke)3. Akamizuke (Lean Tuna)4.

Unagi (BBQ Eel)","Sushi by M is one of those rare experiential delicacies that unfortunately seem to disappear too quickly as they grow in notoriety in NYC. It is worthy of much more recognition for not only the Michelin-grade omakase, but perhaps even more so the the entire restaurant crew -- most notably, of course the Chef M who is a whimsical young man, omnipresent at each sitting and a budding master of the craft. The ambience is informal -- it feels a bit more like an East Village apartment than a restaurant -- and the crowd is generally young and talkative. It's hard not to find yourself in conversation with your neighbor, who more often than not is a regular and swears by the place as their favorite sushi restaurant.At any price this would be well worth it -- but at $50 for 12 pieces or $90 for 17, it is an utter no-brainer.",Sushi By M
412,"Came here with a friend for dinner and wasn't impressed.To start off with the waitress we had was rude. She talked to us like we were 5 years old and thought we didn't know anything about ramen. She asked us if we had been there before, we said no as we had just stumbled upon the place. We had asked her a few questions about the menu and sake selection and she proceeded to act like we should have known everything we were asking when we said we had not been there before. Flash forward to the food, I got Tonkotsu Ramen with extra veggies. They forgot to bring me the veggies and I wasn't going to ask about them cus at that point I didn't care but they brought them out on a side dish when I was done and didn't even say anything, just placed them there and left. The ramen itself was okay. The broth is super thick and heavy, tasted fine not to salty. Best part is the fried lotus chips that came as a garnish.The place hasn't been open long, only since December and if this is how they continue to go I don't see that bright of a future for them. Way too many amazing ramen places to go to a mediocre one with bad service all the way out in Alphabet City.","NYC19. Dinner review. Tsukemen.3 - KaraageTsukemen4 - Broth5 - Noodles5 - Chashu3 - Tamago焼石++Overall, ""as good as it gets.""","Came with 2 girlfriends and we sat at the bar. It's a cool vibe but nothing super exciting. The ramen is gigantic and none of us could even finish half of the bowl. We did order appetizers. I'd say if you are hungry, definitely visit TabeTomo as you will leave satisfied, but remember there's always a wait!","We came here at 6:30pm and got seated immediately. I got the tsukemen, ramen and a Karage. Karage was excellent! Very juicy and crunchy. The tsukemen is a little tart and lacked the classic fishy, umami taste I'm used to - almost overpowered by vinegar. The ramen, however, was just wow! If you're choosing between the two, I would highly recommend the ramen w/ chasu. Most importantly, don't forget to ask for the hot stone to heat up your broth. This is game changer for slow eaters out there and makes the broth taste like new. This is a novelty for most ramen restaurants in NYC, but it was a pleasant addition to the experience.","Service was absolutely disgusting. The asian manager/hostess lady needs a MAJOR attitude adjustment. Not only did she give our seats away after claiming that another set of better seats were going to be ready right away, she rolled her eyes at us multiple times and purposely walked past us because we asked when our seats would be ready. Our seats were not ready in 5 mins as promised and ended up waiting an additional 30 mins. Also, our karrage appetizer had some kind of hair in it. As the night goes on, the rude lady continued to serve us with attitude the entire time while the other waitresses are super nice and treat us with respect like normal customers should be treated. While cleaning our table, she purposely held the spoon with soup in it in a certain way that it splashed on my friend's clothes! She was looking for ways to show her attitude to us. Lastly, this lady tried to shoo us out by rudely slapping the check on our table without us asking. Since I could not leave this place without voicing my dissatisfaction, I spoke to her directly and told her how disrespectful she was to us during the whole experience and she denied it and did not apologize at all. She decided to waive our bill (not like we ordered a lot, we only ordered large ramen challenge bowl to share so its not like we got a benefit out of this) and still did not apologize to us for the experience we went through. She thinks that by waiving our bill, that solves all the issues. I could care less about the free bill but rather be served as a respected customer. We were looking for a good experience with a group of friends on a Friday night and went through this hell instead.","At first glance TabeTomo is charming. The all wood aesthetics has the mind drifting to images of a Japan of old. A view of an open table sure looks alluring to hungry travelers, unwilling to endure the unjustified wait of the nearby Momofuku Ramen Bar. But just like the literal and verbal mouthful, Tonkotsu Chashu Tsukemen Ramen, that I ordered, the gleaming first impressions did not hold up. An AC unit running full blast on a fall evening, and a table so wobbly, that it was rendered unusable are all forgettable inconveniences, but a ramen joint serving just mediocre ramen is unfortunate. Like everything else, the first sip of the Tonkotsu Chashu Tsukemen Ramen has you smiling. The pork broth is rich and fully flavored. The pork is tender and nearly melts on the tongue. The ramen is thick, springy, and absorbs the soup flavors. Unfortunately, the elation doesn't hold up half way through. You begin by wondering about the out of place lump of wilted spinach at the corner of the bowl. Then you wonder if all that bean sprout do anything for the taste of the soup. Finally, once the toppings and ramen begin to disappear, you'll wonder what all those bits are that are teaming in your bowl. It's garlic, and lots of it. I'd estimate a number of cloves best counted by the dozens made their way into my bowl. What tasted so good at first, unfortunately turns overbearing.",TabeTomo
413,"THEY MESS UP YOUR ORDER & DENYI used to come here a lot because I loved how the menu is never the same each week. However, when I went today I ordered the SHIO bbq ribs, and my boyfriend ordered the SHOYU bbq ribs. The host confirmed with the chef (Justin) that one was shoyu and the other shio and we were brought out our ramen. The broth was exactly The same... because he used the same broth...What makes it worse was he lied about it when the server asked initially, and again upon check out  when I told the server they messed up our order. He checked with the chef again, and again he said they were different.  Having grown up in japan for 15 years I think I know what shio and shoyu tastes like.","Hello. I recently went to Ramen Lab about a week ago when it was very empty. Once seated, we checkout the menu and I noticed they only had pork ramen. I am a vegetarian, and I understand that ramen is historically pork based, so I told my husband, ""I will just eat apps, so you are able to still get the ramen."" I was then told by the waitress that I had to leave the restaurant if I do not get a bowl because it is restaurant policy. Not only did they not provide any options for anyone with dietary restrictions (despite proclaiming they are a lab with culinary experimentations), but I was not even allowed to sit in the restaurant. I understand that the whole world does not need to bend to my diet. But I cannot believe I was made to leave the restaurant.",Went there for some ramen -and the soup is key- and i got pasta.  There is room for improvement.,"I'm a #ramenlab enthusiast. It's a small space in #nolita that hosts ramen chefs from all over the world. Currently, this ramen-only pop-up restaurant concept is hosting the Korean chefs from #menyaramenhouse of Metuchen, NJ who concocted these two bowls of ramen that perfectly fused every flavor I love from both Japan and Korea. _The first picture stars my empty bowl with the chefs. I rarely finish an entire bowl of ramen, but not tonight . I slurped up to the last drop! The other two photos show heaven and hell reduced to edible bowls: the hellfire spicy kaisen ramen and the heavenly, cloudy tori paitan. They aren't just beautiful bowls, they are also uniquely delicious!_It's their last day in NYC tomorrow. Next soup will be in New Jersey!

I ordered the Shoyu Ramen. The Shoyu Ramen ingredients as written from the menu: double fermented soy sauce, chintan chicken broth, German style pork neck, chashu, spring onion and menma. This bowl was honestly quite interesting, it had the cooks own imagination of the overall dish and had slight German touch to it which was pretty cool. It tasted A1 and their brothe was quite interesting, it was light yet quite rich, light feel to the tongue unlike your more traditionally dense broth but tasted so amazing...I wouldn't say I was at a lost for words but the ramen made me pause in between bites to truly savor the taste of it; not many bowls ramen have done to me so it's a priceless experience for me.To conclude this review...I say definitely try this joint out and I know I for one, will try to come by each month to try their new menus.","It's was an interesting concept where they invite different ramen chefs from all over the world and have them take over ramen lab for a period of time (ofc one chef at a time). Place is small and clean. It's like those traditional bar where you stand, eat and peace out. The chef today is from Germany!! My boyfriend and I ordered shoyu ramen and tonight's special, tsukemen (dipping ramen). We both think it's bit too salty but we did enjoy the flavor. The tsukemen have a thicker ramen, thicker sauce/soup on the side where we dip the ramen in. I believe it's fish base cus I could smell the fishy-ness. As for the shoyu, I like how many ramen is not over cook!!! I like it where it's still a bit hard. Also the egg!!The most important part (to me) is the egg!! They give me one whole egg (normally they only give you half) and it's cook perfectly!! Cooking ramen egg is a challenge...not sure how to explain it  but I will post up a picture. Also, the guy who stand next to us ordered a spicy miso ramen and it smell so good!!Sadly a fly was found in my shoyu ramen. We did notify the chef and he offer to make me a new one but I rejected it. Not because I think their place isn't clean...it's because I ate a good amount of the toppings and found the fly, it would be a waste if he give me a new one because I wouldn't be able to finish. He explained to me that it might fly from outside. To me I'm pretty okay with it just because I totally understand no one can stop fly/bugs coming in and out. I wasn't mad about it either. My boyfriend would like to eat half of my ramen since he's a big eater but didn't want it after seeing the fly. We would come back again tho. It just that fly decided to try out my ramen, just bit unlucky. They didn't charge me for it either. Thank you for great customer service! I would like to thank the very nice host/cashier/waitress. She is very friendly, patient and speak in a very gentle tone. I like to wipe my utensils before using it because it's not that clean sometimes and it's a habit of mine. But she took the clean spoons and wipe it one more time before giving it to us. I really appreciate that!!!",Ramen Lab
414,"The market is cool but my experience at the ample hills creamery was. . .err weird.I asked for a single scoop on a sugar cone and the clerk proceeded to give me a double. When I said, ""oh, I don't need a double"" he said ""oh it's ok"" and then charged me for the double scoop. I think he thought I was being like, ""hey I'm fat, I shouldn't be eating a double"" and he was attempting to console me by saying 'it's ok'?Then when I paid he hit the ""20% tip"" botton on the ipad. Ummm. I don't want to tip you 20% for scooping my ice cream cone and then on top of that, you didn't give me what I asked for. I was so tired of being there that I just paid it.","Ate here before seeing a show on Broadway. Decided to order some ramen. I did not like how a worker was eating food in the area where they were cooking food too. Did not seem very safe or cleanly to me. On the good side of things, the ramen was good. It was spicy but not super spicy though.",This place was fine. Pretty empty around 7PM on a weeknight. Honestly there aren't that many good options here to choose from and it's really overpriced.

I honestly wanted more chinese, but I settled for a pasta moment at the Gotham Market. The people were nice and all, but I was very underwhelmed with the Cacio e pepe I had.

415,"Love this place as far as atmosphere and location, and even food.Have come in twice and both times i was sat down quickly. I've ordered the heirloom and haloumi dish and also the ceviche.Both were delicious. The ceviche, although small, was honestly mind blowing as far as flavors.I've also gotten their blood orange mimosa which to me tasted just ok. I think it was pretty more than it was tasty. My biggest minus is the fact that they have few options for people with limiting diets (that's a lot of people in nyc!) such as gluten free or dairy free. Sure you can get a dish that has dairy or gluten and just ask for it without but then you lose a lot of the flavoring so it kinda defeats the purpose of going out to eat :(","I actually wanted to go to one place but, the wait was too long. So, I came here, and there wasn't any wait. My husband ordered the bacon egg cheeseburger and I ordered the lamb neck hash. The lamb neck hash=MOSTLY potatoes, SOME eggs, and SMALL pieces of lamb. It, also tasted bland. It's safe to say, I wasn't satisfied. And while my husband was more satisfied with his meal, he also felt his dish wasn't worth the price at the same time.","Food was OK. Service was terrible. Atmosphere felt like assholes. Smell was like assholes as well. Unless you know someone who knows the owner, I would never recommend going.","My friends and I were actually trying to go to another brunch place, and we happened to stumble upon this restaurant while we were in the hour long wait. I am so glad we did too, because we had the perfect experience here. The food was delicious and the location is super cool and close to the Delancey-Essex subway station. The store itself is pretty cramped - I actually knocked over a glass of coffee on my way to my table because there was so little space to move around! Also, the service was pretty slow overall. Neither of those things mattered too much though, especially when you take into account the fact that there wasn't a wait time and the fact that the food was delicious.FOOD:Huevos Rancheros Tostadas (5/5) - I adored this dish. It is just enough to fill you up happily, and the avocado is delicious. The eggs were also made perfectly sunny side up. This is one of the cheaper things on the menu, and I definitely recommend it!!Lamb neck hash (5/5) - I absolutely loved this dish. The hashed potatoes were perfectly salted and tender, and so was the lamb neck meat. This was a super unique twist on roast beef hash and I loved the flavor of the lamb mixed with the potatoes and egg.","The first time you stumbled upon Minnie's you might have just exited Clinton Street Bakery after the hostess told you the wait is going to be 2.5 hours. You're hungry, hungover and at this point down to eat anything. You see Minnie's like a beacon of hope and think ""alright, this'll do"". Little do you know, you are actually sitting down for a great meal. I think Minnie's has this underrated reputation because its close vicinity to famous restaurants like Clinton Street Bakery and Ivan Ramon, however, I think Minnie's deserves the same recognition. I have never had an issue getting seated here, the longest I have ever had to wait is about 15 minutes. The hostess is always well informed, nice and helpful. The food: The most important thing to know about Minnie's is that their pancakes are f**king delicious. They are fluffy and flavorful but they still have a light crisp to them on the outside. Hands down some of the best pancakes in NYC. Some other menu favorites include the Croque Madame and the Huevos Rancheros Tostadas. Overall,10/10 love this restaurant and think it is a great option for a quick weekend brunch.","Really cute brunch spot. Food was very good, nice atmosphere. Service was a little slow but overall had a great brunch experience. It's a small place so make a reservation if you can, but they have a self seating bar area. Definitely recommend & would come back.",Minnie's
416,"5 star service, 2 star food. I had seen and heard raving reviews of this place so I was excited to come here for dinner with a few of my girlfriends yesterday night. From the beginning, the service was impeccable. They were extremely understanding about moving our reservation a half hour later and were always there when when had a question or needed something. They even went to the cellar to get a bottle of white wine that my party wanted to drink unchilled.Unfortunately the food was not on par with the service. We started with the raw scallops which I found to be extremely fishy and flavorless. Next was the shrimp, which was flavorless and fishy as well. I found both to be unpleasant to eat. The crispy potatoes were the best dish of the night but.. how hard is it to mess up potatoes? We got a pasta dish as well which was fine but nothing to write home about. My biggest disappointment however was the frangipane tart. It was tough and the outer crust was burnt. You know that a dessert isn't good when 4 girls end up leaving some behind after a light dinner. The ambiance, service and wine was good but I doubt I would be back as I don't live in Brooklyn. My recommendation is to skip the food and stick to wine if you do go.","Probably a place just for a glass of wine or two, with a snack. We made a mistake of ordering food and it almost bankrupted me! Three tiny plates with the cheapest beer and 1 glass of the cheapest red wine left me with an empty stomach and $150 out of my pocket.",Razor clams small flavorless. My sister in law cooks them better. Raw scallops not good either.,"I tell no lies when I say this is my actual favorite restaurant. One time I had a pea dish here so good that it made me cry. Twice.The menu is rotating, but you can't go wrong with the staples: bread and butter, raw scallops, steak tartare.The servers here are the most knowledgeable and friendly wine-os I've ever encountered.Their weekend lunch coursed meal is the crown on the very obviously king that is this restaurant. I've been here about 15 times and each time the flavors remain delicious and consistent. Keep doing what you're doing, Four Horsemen, and I will forever be your longing admirer.","Went to The Four Horsemen for dinner on Saturday night. A lively wine bar with good wine, solid food, and excellent music.Quality: Decided to share some wine and small plates for dinner. As we waited for a seat we ordered a nice red off the last call area of the menu. The wine list is long, but we felt confident in something that clearly caught the interest of others. Once we sat we focused in on the appetizers and raw dishes. We started with the flavorful Chicken Liver Mousse. Served with light crackers, it was a solid dish. Next came the Warm House Bread, which was tremendous. I am usually skeptical of bread that does not come complimentary, but it was so good we got a second order. Last was the Beef Tartare, which I was not crazy about. The texture was strange with the addition of seeds and I also did not like the sesame seed crackers it came with. However, it seemed like a hit as it sat in front of nearly everyone at the bar.Quantity: We stuck with starters and raw dishes, which are understandably smaller, but they also have full plates.Value: $12 for the Chicken Liver Mousse. $7 for the Warm House Bread. $16 for the Beef Tartare. Wines start at around $40.Ambiance: The Four Horsemen is located in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg. The wine bar is a small and simple space. A few stools along the front window, a tiny square bar towards the center of the space, and then a collection of tables in the back. Throughout the space are additional pockets where guests waiting for a table can lean and put down their drinks. The music is great, which should not be too surprising considering James Murphy's involvement with the bar, but it will be played loud. This is not a wine bar for quiet conversation.Crowd: It is not a large space and it fills up quick. When we arrived we were told a twenty minute wait, which was pretty accurate. Be warned, as it is a wine bar, people tend to linger and the wait may be underestimated.Service: Appreciated that the staff took care of those waiting for a seat. We were offered drinks and food while still standing.Parking: Limited street parking throughout the area.","went for a friend's birthday. said friend frequents the place so they let him bring 2 bottles to start. made room for 12-person reservation.menu printed with friend's name and date so it felt really special.  accommodated last-minute dietary restrictions (gluten, fennel, hazelnuts) and made special prix fixe menu with other restrictions (pescatarian, shellfish allergy). waitresses accommodated and spread the word to other waitresses when I requested that they redistribute food to our end of the table instead of clearing and discarding food from other side. food too delicious to throw out! see pictured menu. everything DELICIOUS (except no review for crackers and wild nettle malfatti pasta, because gluten but others said it was also delectable)",The Four Horsemen
417,"Place was overpriced for the food but I guess that's the par in this area. At the time we went, there was only one person working there so she had to handle the register and the drinks. She said she had never made drinks before so it wasn't exactly the best tasting drink. All in all, it was an ok experience but I probably won't seek this place out for tacos.","Overpriced, not that delicious and they only had one server having to do everything so it made service very slow (not her fault). I've noticed several places really relying on the whole vegan and gluten free thing to charge higher prices for ingredients that are cheap to buy. That would be one thing if at least they used those ingredients in a good way and made delicious creations out of them, but it was not the case for this place.I tried the tuna nori taco and the beef short rib taco. Neither was impressive. The tuna nori didn't really work well as a taco. The beef short rib taco was meh. Not much sauce and not very flavorful. At the end we ended up going to a restaurant after this restaurant because we were left hungry and unsatisfied. I would recommend for them to have more than one person to do everything, its too overwhelming for one person to be taking orders, bringing the food and making drinks and then for the drink machines to be breaking down on top of that.",I was not impressed with this place.  I have had some good Mexican in my life and this does not make the cut.  I ordered loaded nachos just to later find out as I ate it that it was made with cashew queso. Never again!!  The best thing about this place was the $5 frozen margaritas. Won't ever be coming back here again.,"I ended up meeting some friends here on a Friday after work came in & went straight to ordering some food & drinks. Drinks I went with the margarita since it was $5 special all day .. good margarita nice taste & decent amount of alcohol. Food I had the Truffle Shrooms taco this was interesting? Taste wise ok for me I wasn't completely sold taste wise.. I also had the Impossible taco , this was great good flavor & taste. Also had an order of the Nachos w guacamole very good as well small enough for one but good to share as well. Another vegan friendly place that surprised me. Small location , funky fun decor , service was good u order first then they bring the food to your table not bad. Decent  music playing nice laid back atmosphere we enjoyed our time here.","my second time eating here. good food, vegan options. service is ehhh.i stood at the pick up counter waiting for my food without being acknowledged for a good 5 minutes. kind of disappointing. i dont mind waiting but at least let me know hat you need a few minutes to hand me the bag on the counter with my food.",Underwhelmed! Loved all the vegan options available here so ordered a mushroom taco and the impossible meat taco. They were pricy- the impossible meat one was $6 for a TINY taco when I expected so much more. What's worse is that there was BARELY ANYTHING IN IT! I got it in a corn tortilla instead of the hard shell that it comes with but I did not expect it to be empty! The mushroom one was okay- lacked flavor. Got sticky rice and beans on the side for a whopping $5 for just plain rice- where were the beans?!I went during lunch and was wondering why it was so empty considering it's so cute and aesthetic inside. Now I know why- it's completely overpriced for what you get (or don't get in my case.) Maybe I'll come back for happy hour if my co workers really want to but it's really a shame that I can't get the tacos- can't justify $5-6 for an empty taco.,Taco Dumbo
418,"I loved the vibe of the place, and the Eduardo pizza I ordered was decent, but their customer service was just TERRIBLE. We were welcomed by the hostess upon walking in, and asked if we could sit upstairs instead of at the bar. The lady told us they would not open that area until 7 minutes later, and got defensive when we said we'd wait to sit in an actual table (First red flag). The pizza came to us, and my husband asked me what the sauce that they offered us was. The manager (a kid no older than 25) interfered in our conversation and said it was garlic oil. I do not understand why a manager would be listening to conversations but okay. Then the bartender kept staring at me during my meal and listening to my conversations in a very awkward way.Let's talk about the pizza! As someone of italian descent, I can recognize good authentic pizza from pizza hut's pizza. PizzArte's pizza was closer to the italian version of pizza but still very americanized. The toppings were the most average thing in the world, the dough was VERY freaking soggy and I found no more than 8 basil leaves in my whole pizza. The only decent thing was the crust, which was thin and crispy.I do not give them one star because the pizza saved them. I would've had a better time if it wasn't for the rude hostess, the manager and the awkward bartender. They need a seminar on customer service skills because only offering average pizza will not help them make profit forever.",While the food was good I will never understand the logic of telling a customer they can't modify their order. Even if it means costing more. In this case I simply wanted them to remove pruscetta from our pizza and I was told this was not possible as they don't allow modifications?!?! Seriously who does this? It's not like we were ordering a pre-made Digorno from Publix.,"This review is strictly for their pizza, because that is what I came for.  I was sooooo disappointed when my pizza came out and instantly regretted choosing to come here instead of my original plans to go to Sofia's pizza.  I ordered the mozzarella, basil, and sausage.  I picked up a slice and everything literally slid off of the dough, I was left with a soggy, watered down, flimsy piece of bread.  I was pissed!!!!! Every slice I picked up did not hold any of the ingredients. I honestly didn't even bother eating this crap!! How do you have a full page of just pizza and this is what you serve?  Maybe that's the style of pizza they're going for, but excuse me if I prefer to have the toppings I ordered STAY on top of my pizza.  It was so bad. Worst pizza I've ever had!I just started reading the reviews and every one star rating hit my experience spot on.  Server was rude, pushy, and not very helpful when I asked for menu suggestions.  They dropped the dishes without offering cheese, peppers, etc.  never came back to check up on us (i wanted crushed peppers).  To add on to this horrible experience, when the bill was dropped, the fool had the audacity to point to the 18% and say ""this is the tip.""  I'm extremely annoyed with myself for spending my money here.Also, first thing they ask you is what kind of water you want.  Make sure you specify you're ok with tap water because they will take out a bottle of water and charge you $7 for it. Just saying.  One more thing, believe all of these one star reviews. #truth.",Came to NY on a business trip and was craving Izzy but the crust always makes me feel bloated. I found this cute spot that plays relaxing music and serves delicious cocktails. The decor is soothing along with the music playing. The food is delicious! The pizza was enough for myself only and was very thin - which is not a negative thing just an FYI. I'd definitely recommend this place!!,"So first I read through the reviews. They seemed very mixed so I paid attention to the likes and concerns of former reviewers. First...what an adorable and cozy restaurant. Lovely and well lit. Felt welcomed by the hosted and the people behind the amazing bar that occupies most of the first floor. We were seated at a table upstairs....perhaps an issue for some. The art was nice but I wish that there had been more variety to the pieces. Our waiter was kind and sweet. He shared the specials, which all sounded delicious. We opted for wine and pizza ( gluten free), and a calzone. I had heard concerns about the crust being soggy....and unfortunately they were very wet....see my picture. The taste however.....incredible. It is truly a shame that they seem to have developed this issue....perhaps the ovens need a good cleaning?","Love this spot!! The staff especially was some of the friendliest / most welcoming group I've encountered in awhile. We showed up not knowing they were 25 minutes to close, but they still had us come on in.I ordered the Tartufa pizza and it did not disappoint.",PizzArte
419,Pretty restaurant with cozy atmosphere.The food is OK. Not great. I think it's overpriced. Especially the wine/drinks.Good service though.Doesn't deserve more than 3 stars at that price.,"Horrible place. The decor is outdated and unsanitary. There were two giant flies hovering above our table and we had to request that we were moved.I ordered a beer and the ""bartender/waitress"" poured it as though she had never poured a beer in her life.Food was not great. We had the dumpling and the mussels. They're were nothing special. When we were done the waiter took my drink without asking if I was finished. All in all, this place sucks. Don't go here.",Don't quite understand what the hype is about. Came in for a late lunch on a Saturday. We waited 30 minutes for our food. The bibimbap and the burger with kimchi were mediocre and totally overpriced for the portion and taste.,"One of my favorite itineraries for showing out-of-towners ""off the beaten path"" NY is a free ride on the IKEA ferry followed by a visit to Red Hook's attractions. When it comes time for brunch, I'll usually propose the Good Fork.During the summer months, especially, the backyard garden makes it an easy call, but the food also brings me back in the winter. I quite enjoy their ""light"" Korean fusion - primarily an American restaurant, but with the option to order a side of kimchi along with your eggs.On my last visit, they custom made tofu tempura-like fritters for me in lieu of meat to accompany the eggs. They should really add these to the official menu, as it was one of the best fried tofu dishes I've had.","The line for Hometown BBQ dragged back to its hometown. Brooklyn Crab was filled to the gills with day drinkers and crustacean lovers. The Good Fork was opening momentarily so we figured it would be easy to walk in for dinner. Easy, it was. It was a solid meal though somewhat forgettable. The restaurant itself is cute with a backyard area covered with string lights. There are two rooms within the restaurant, one that overlooks the backyard, and the one where you walk in, which is somewhat dark because it doesn't receive natural lighting. Yelp describes The Good Fork as eclectic. I would call it Korean fusion, which doesn't always necessarily work. I think The Good Fork skirts the line pretty well between crazy concoctions and respectable food. I only wish it was executed better. Four of us shared a variety of dishes.My boyfriend and I shared the vegetable scallion pancake  [$14] which, if you're looking for a traditional Asian pancake, it is not this. The pancake was drizzled in various sauces and was fried. It was not overly wet nor greasy. Perhaps, it could have used a little more seasoning. It was a good size to share between two people and it satiated us. I had the Korean Steak and Eggs [$30] which I thought was passable. The steak, cooked medium, was delicious but the kimchi fried rice on the side was lukewarm and was not particularly sour. I think the waitress waited until all the entrees were ready before serving them to our group. The sunny side up egg was just runny enough to spill over the rice, but only just. My friends got the burger, I probably should have gotten that too and for half the price. I also ordered the rhubarb and strawberry cobbler [$9] for dessert (spring!) but my excitement was quickly dashed. It looked like it was thrown onto the plate from the baking pan. Let's call it rustic. It was tasty but it was hard to cut through the rhubarb, while the rest of the pastry was kind of soggy. My friends had Steve's Key Lime Pie (which is also located in Red Hook). I thought the lime flavor was muted, versus what you get at the actual shop, which I've been to. I had the Carpe Diem [$12] which is a margarita with jalapeño and other fruit flavors. It was quite good! All in all, the check came to close to $200 for four people before tip. Yikes.",The patio out back is awesome.  Good vibes.  The dumplings were great.  The sweet and sour pork ribs were amazing.  But the Chinese sausage corn bread was dry and frankly.... very disappointing.  But.... we had a great night nonetheless.,The Good Fork
420,"Good food and the drinks are great too but there is a really douchey hipster(ish)bartender he has  dirty blonde hair above the shoulder length  probably wearing some pattern button up the day you walk in...just avoid him and you're good. Our friends ordered drinks and they sent the wrong ones and the bartender left them and when she left to go get new ones and this guy came in and only said ""vodka tonics?"" Pointing at the wrong drinks she had brought before and we answered yes and he proceeded to just take them and walk away. It was so rude and just uncalled for. They were the wrong drinks but that wasn't the issue it was the way he inserted himself into our space just to take drinks back and then he literally looked at us as he poured them down the drain. We really didn't care about the drinks but his whole attitude was unnecessary and petty and ridiculous but anyway we generally love this place we haven't been in weeks this guy is new so don't let him stray you away. Still leaving 2 stars though because this experience was not ideal at all.",Have to go back to this spot! The food was amazinggggg. I have a video of the corn on a cob but no pics-- delishhhhh lol.. the bales were so small but that was fine by me. Def going back!,"We were told to put our Haribo gummy bears away and I was really enjoying eating them because the intensity of the five fruit flavors, lemon, orange, pineapple, raspberry and strawberry paired well with the robust tannins of my glass of vintage dated Malbec.Apparently gummy bears are forbidden in low lit cocktail lounges with brick walls but what else can you expect in this day and age of The Lord of the Hipsters: The Fellowship of the Artisanal Mac & Cheese Gentrifiers?","Haven't had Moloko's breakfast options enough, so my girlfriend and I visited this past Saturday for brunch. We started with a couple cocktails and their deviled eggs. Their deviled eggs are unique and delightful. For the entree my girlfriend had the breakfast burrito which is delicious but it's portion was too much for me. Maybe ordering this dish depends on what kind of day you're having. She couldn't finish it so I had to help out with the second half. I should mention, there was a regular-sized man at the other end of the bar that ordered this same meal and finished it, to my astonishment, in its entirety. Then he ordered a bloody mary. I wonder what kind of day he was having?I myself had the classic eggs benedict, with the sautéed kale instead of meat. The dish was served with a salad in a vinaigrette, radishes and onion that seemed pickled, and potatoes. I think this might be the best eggs benedict I have ever had. All of the parts of this dish were perfectly seasoned, and made sense together. The potatoes had a wonderful crisp/crunch on the outside and cozy softness on the inside. I love vinaigrettes so the salad really hit the spot for me. The sautéed kale, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce all completed a sound and splendid meal that I now long for next time I go.Thank you again Moloko for being amazing.I hope to see you again, and I hope to see you soon.","Moloko has been my favorite New York City bar/restaurant since I found out about it soon after they opened. Over time I've seen the menu grow, and hours expand. Their product and service has always been excellent. Always consistent. I love their cheeseburger, and I love their lobster roll. Yet, their mac n cheese, their fish and chips, their french onion soup, and deviled eggs are oh so savory as well. I wish good things for this business, and I hope I'm around to see them come.","This place actually is cozy, eclectic and tasty. I would have not guessed that the food would have been as good as it was. I have to tell you to try the deviled eggs. OMG  Yummy! They are not your normal deviled eggs. I had the fish and chips, extra crunchy My daughter had the pulled pork sandwich my son and husband shared the double cheeseburger and it was big enough to fill up both of those big men. We enjoyed chatting with the staff, they were very friendly and made us feel very welcomed, and we are tourists, and we felt right at home. Oh the only reason why only a 4 star rating is because the menu was somewhat limited. Which I'm guessing is only because of lack of space to keep all of the extra ingredients that it would take to fulfill a more extensive menu. It was all very good.",Moloko
421,"This place has fallen from gastronomic grace! Empanadas are 50% smaller, mixed grill for 2 ($55), is mostly sausage and chicken with approximately 5-6oz of malnourished skirt steak and skinny yet fatty short ribs that were inedible. The coup de gras was having to taste the putrid chorizo all night...most of which was discarded into my napkin.",It started with the wine being pretty bad. I don't understand why it's so difficult to serve decent wine.Next came the empanadas that were pretty much scorching on the outside and frozen on the inside.The only saving grace was the skirt steak and the mashed yuca. The meats is where they shine.,"We came here on a Sunday evening. The place is cozy and it wasn't packed. We both ordered the steak and sides (yucca, sautéed spinach and mash potato)and dessert. I would definitely come back for more delish food! 9/10","Good food, great people, great atmosphere. I went here after discovering that next-door restaurant Aperture had closed down. Was not disappointed! The fried calamari was delicious, and the Pollo al Limon was staggeringly fresh and juicy. Seasoning was on point, and all the sauces were very flavorful.I highly recommend this place.","I'm always impressed by house made hot sauces. This place offers several in various degrees of burn. Outstanding empanadas, chopped Caesar salad, fried yucca and no bad choice with any steak selection. Surprisingly, the burger was dry and they could improve upon the vibe by lowering the lights and Feng Shui-ing the seating. It's a steakhouse with cafe sensibility.","We found out about this restaurant exploring the neighborhood.Pretty tempting to see several traditional Argentinian dishes.We arrived around 5:30pm and set in their nice patio.Waiter greeted us promptly with menus and literally 3 seconds after placing them on the table asked us if we were ready or needed another minute to order...Came back few minutes later and I asked if they had happy hour. His face changed and even his attitude.We ordered two glasses of happy hour wine. He came back fast with them. Pours were good and wine pretty nice for a $7 HH pour.We orderer gnocchi bolognese and chicken napolitanas.Meanwhile bread and chimichurri sauce was served. The chimichurri was tasty, very tradicional flavor.We wanted to order another glass of wine before HH was over but the server didn't show up until 6:02pm. Happy hours was over and for my past in the industry didn't ask.The food arrived. Gnocchi has a perfect texture and the sauce was very nicely balanced.The chicken milanesa lacked chicken flavor. Ot was OK.More guest arrived to the patio, even heard a table was asked if that was their first time there, another table was told the specials and we didn't get any of that. Maybe they assumed I was a tourist for carrying camera equipment and thought they didn't have to work for their tip?I was trying to be friendly and didn't get the same in exchange. 10 minutes after finish eating feel to call a server like a cab since were being ignored.Finally a waitress saw me waiving and brought a wrong checked, which was 60 bucks over our expense price.Called the waiter. Unapologetically started walking away saying I'll bring your check.We left a tip that represented the service. You need to conquer your money!",El Mate
422,"UPDATE: their ceviche gave me food poisoning and it took me three days to recover!!----It is with a heavy and broken heart that I leave this review. This used to be THE best place ever- the food was amazing and the mojitos were to die for. So my friends and I would come here all the time and if you read my previous review it was a 5 star review but lord I don't know what went wrong. Something in their mojito recipe changed and now it's simply too sweet, the coconut one is like sugar with ice and you don't even feel the liquor. As for the food- they had a ""special"" menu today and k decided to venture out of my normal grilled chicken and shrimp order and try it and what a mistake that was. Their crab filled sweet plantains wasn't even made on sweet plantain. Their tostones were cold, dry and undercooked. Their ceviche was quite possible the WORST ceviche I've ever had in my life- the server recommended it bc it was ""sweet"" with mangoes and pineapples but all I got was two pieces of scallops and a TON of jalapeños (see pics attachedh- which had the server told me it had that I would've never ordered bc I can't eat spicy foods. Furthermore their calamari were super greasy and just not good. I'm not sure if it's because it was Valentines and they were rushing through the orders but I'm very unhappy with the change in mojitos and how terrible the food was. I guess now I have to start the process of finding a good mojito in NYC again. So sad.","It is with a heavy and broken heart that I leave this review.

I came here on a Tuesday night around 8:15, the restaurant was closing early so they told us to order asap. We had the garlic chicken and shrimp. It was cold and old. It was something that was made hours ago then was reheated. The flavors were bland, brink were bad. Don't waste your money here!!! There are too many great restaurants in NYC to eat bad food like this.","It's a step into another place. The experiences is almost full immersion at the door. The cocktails were spectacular, simple yet full of flavor. The Tropicana and Havana Mule are memorable, but the tropicana is dangerously sweet and smooth. There were nice specials, we got the plantain cups with three different meat variations. It is just enough to want more. The meat in each one is tender, with layers of flavor.Then for entrees we had the pork shank and ropa vieja (was also in one of the plantain cups), and both are memorable. The pork shank was tender and juicy, a savory brandy sauce. Highly recommend if a special. The ropa vieja was equally as delicious, but always on the menu. A perfectly cooked saffron rice and beans.Easy to find and walked right in after 5 on a week day. There were happy hour specials at the bar. We sat downstairs, with nice music that made us feel like we were in Cuba. The atmosphere was comfortable all around.",The venue has a warm cozy feel and the staff are pretty friendly.  The drinks and food are really good.  Sometimes the seafood is a hit or miss... flavorful one week and bland the next but overall I enjoy the food.,"I'm going to give it to you straight fellow helpers. Atmosphere - Phenomenal. Beautiful decor. Lovely and thought-provoking paintings. Staff - Very very pleasant, knowledgeable, accommodating, and seemed like they were actually happy to be there. My friends and I came in for happy hour and dinner. The bartender and servers allowed us to have our happy hour at a table (given that unbeknownst to us, happy hour was only at the bar). We were very appreciative, as we were about to have to split up our party between the people who just wanted drinks, and the people who wanted drinks and dinner. Drinks - Very pretty and fruity. Just extremely watered down because the drinks are shaken with ice, then poured on top of a glass full of ice. A littttle weird. Food - SOOOOO underseasoned... I mean.. bland.. seemingly not even any salt and pepper. I had to send back my steak because it wasn't cooked to my preferred temperature. Once I got it back, I took a few bites and immediately asked for a to-go box. The beans were literally the best tasting item on our table. My friends chicharrones were dark meat, which is pretty uncommon, so it was quite chewy. Overall...... I really really wanted to like this restaurant, but I was so let down by the flavors of the food and the watery drinks.  I will not return or recommend this location.",Havana NY
423,"What to order: Oiji bowl - sea urchin, sweet shrimp, seaweed rice ($34) and honey butter chips with vanilla ice cream ($16)Expectations: You'll need multiple small plates to be full for dinner. Tip: Make a reservation.","Oiji is one of my favorite spots in the city. It's an intimate restaurant in the East Village that serves small plate Korean inspired dishes. The prices are a little bit on the expensive side but the food is worth it. I've been a few times and have never been less than extremely pleased with everything that I ordered. (No matter what you order, do save room for dessert. The honey butter potato chips with ice cream is to die for.) The vibe at the restaurant is trendy and hip. My only complaint about the restaurant is the long picnic table that they seat multiple parties at. The table is just wide enough that it makes it difficult to have an intimate conversation and can be a little bit of a mood killer for dates.","The service at this restaurant was absolutely terrible. Two nights ago, my mom and I sat at the bar table and halfway through my meal, the bartender knocked over my full glass of water and the whole thing spilled over my lap. My jeans as well as my bag and jacket that were on my lap got all wet. Though I understood it was a complete accident, the bartender continued to make awkward jokes and comments throughout the night at me. For example, as I was trying to soak up the water with the paper napkins and having to make multiple trips to the bathroom to clean up (I wasn't even finished with my food at this point), he said, ""Should we pour more water so it blends in and it'll be a darker denim?"". I just don't think it was the right time or place to be making comments like this. Further, after this incident happened, none of the waiters came to my aid or even offered me napkins to clean up. I felt extremely uncomfortable the whole night trying to finish my meal while sitting in my damp jeans, with the bartender continuously making jokes at me. I got barely an apology and nothing compensated. Ultimately, this is definitely not how you run a restaurant or treat your customers. Even after I paid the bill and stood up to leave, the bartender kept trying to make jokes and remarks at me and even laughed as he said, ""I hope this won't be your last time here."" I fully regret having given a service tip and given how absolutely horrific the service is, I will not be coming back. Even worse is that my mom flew in from Asia for a few days for my graduation and I was so excited to take her to this restaurant, yet after what happened that night, I'm embarrassed to have done so.",Fun spot with a laid back vibe but seriously good food. Great for date night or fun group dinners.Everything tasted good but honestly I don't even remember what we ordered because it all paled in comparison to the bone marrow. I'd give Oiji five stars just for the bone marrow. It's incredible!,"I've been meaning to try this place for quite some time after several of my friends have raved about it so I finally went there with a girlfriend. Take note that it's a VERY small space so definitely make reservations regardless of what day/time it is. We made reservations right when they open and saw that several parties were waiting as well. The service is great and though the menu is limited, vast majority of items we ordered hit the mark. Take note that ordering four (absolute max five) dishes are suffice. In order of most to least favorite, here's what we ordered- Lobster- 4.5/5- get this! It is so, so good. I can't even tell if I enjoyed the lobster or the noodles more. Take note that the lobster does have a little kick to it but that made it all the better. Just wish there was more of it in the dish.Long Island Duckling- 4.5/5- equally as good as the lobster, but with a much more reasonable portion. The kimchi rice was a very nice touch.Baby Octopus- 4.0/5- personally, I absolutely loved this dish BUT I can easily see how some people would think that the garlic and the butter was very overpowering. Luckily for me, I am obsessed with garlic and butter but if you're not, this dish isn't for you. Fried Chicken- 3.5/5- I hate to say it but I didn't see how this dish gets so much hype. Yes fried chicken is delicious, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary for me (albeit it wasn't bad either)! I can't say I didn't like it but I can't say I liked it either.On a side note, we had also ordered the Honey Butter Chips with vanilla ice cream (which is there only dessert item) and, it's suffice to say, I get why it's their signature dessert. I would definitely come back when their menu changes to try more great shared plates that Oiji has to offer.","This place is seriously SO good. It strikes the perfect balance between casual and fine dining, with a vibe that is more young, hip and laid-back, but with food that is on par with some of the best fine dining places in the city! The attention to detail and love they put into each dish is clearly evident and the flavors of each dish are just amazing. If you've ever been to Estella, it's kind of like a Korean version of that--So basically perfectly executed shared small plates that you really just can't get enough of!On my last visit, there were two of us, and we ordered 5 dishes: Scallops ""Hwe,"" Fried Chicken, Oiji Bowl, Lobster, and Truffle Seafood Broth. While everything was delicious, the lobster ramen was definitely our favorite. It was a perfect summer ramen with just such intense flavor and succulent bits of lobster--It really blew us away, and we've been dreaming about it since. The fried chicken was wonderfully crispy and the sauce really made the dish light and refreshing. The scallops were raw and fresh with really yummy jelly fish bits underneath. The truffle seafood broth we'd had before and is excellent as always. The one thing I wouldn't order again is the Oiji bowl--Market price was $33 that day, and while it was very good, it wasn't as special or interesting as the other dishes.",Oiji
424,"Honest review: food was gross extremely overrated packaged ramen tastes better honestly n yes ive had a lot of ramen in my life. its just not good food wise n service wise. Ambiance: really tiny theres more seats in the back. Service was really slow non existent n they would ignore u n have an attitude with u, didnt give suggestions just was really rude. One of the waiters was yelling at someone for giving a bad tip infront of people? Just really unprofessional. Food wasn't flavorful n theres no hot sauce? Just spicy sesame oil thats like burnt n really bitter best things: nothingMega paitan: the broth was not flavorful at all had no depth needed seasoning badly. The meat were in these huge chunks n the meat was really tuff n dry n cold was gross honestly. Tebya gyoza: the chicken wings werent crispy n they were really greasy n it has no seasoning the dumpling inside was just a normal one wasn't anything special Creamy mentaiko paitain ramen: ive had a lot of renditions of these had really fancy kind n normal kind this was decent nothing special. The sauce was good tasted like a seafood mac n cheese just wasnt as good as ive had it at other Asian places",Great Ramen. Would recommend. The spicy sauce that you add to the ramen is really strange. I've never had anything like it before. I love spicy food but this ramen tasted really weird. I like it.,"Man, I don't know why this place is so hyped but it certainly didn't live up to the glowing reviews. I've heard nothing but great things about Totto and it was my girlfriend's favorite ramen place, so we decided to come for dinner. I ordered the mega and my girlfriend ordered an extra spicy one. There was a lot of meat in mine but it was so dry it was basically inedible. The ramen itself was cooked okay, but the broth was bland. I took a couple bites and gave up. My girlfriend wasn't too happy with hers either and was disappointed that the quality went downhill. With the amount of ramen spots in the city, this is a hard pass for me.","Came here on a Thursday night, waited about 10 minutes for a table for 3 -- not bad at all. There's a a good amount of space beyond the bar for groups of 4 to sit comfortably. Our server was quick and on top of our order. I had the Chicken Paitan with Pork and the Takoyaki. Chicken Paitan with Pork: Solid broth with an abundance of noodles, onions, and scallions. The pork was tender and flavorful, with a good 30:70 fat-to-meat ratio. Not much else to say -- it was a good bowl of ramen. Takoyaki: This dish was pretty good, but I probably wouldn't get it again. It's probably just not my kind of dish. The inside was creamy and savory and the outside was pretty chewy. This dish was kind of forgettable in my opinion. Price: 4/5Quality: 4/5Quantity: 5/5Service: 5/5Atmosphere: 3/5","This is my second Totto ramen location I've been to, after the hell's kitchen location. It was less packed than the other location, likely just because I was there during lunchtime rather than dinner. I'm not sure how full this location gets during the nighttime, but the hell's kitchen location had a bit of a wait every time I went. If this location is half has popular, I'd keep that in mind when showing up late and super hungry. This location should be just as popular because it was a great experience. I got the spicy paitan ramen and added a boiled egg with corn. I got that with a chicken bun. The chicken bun wasn't what I was expecting. The chicken was shredded like chicken salad. There was a black sauce on top that I want to say was eel sauce, but I'm not entirely sure. I enjoyed it. It was very good. I've had chicken buns before but this was my first time having one like this. I would definitely order again. The best thing is always the ramen here. It's great that they have so many chicken broth options for people who don't eat pork or just prefer chicken broth. The spicy paitan wasn't too spicy. It could have been hotter, but that's just me. If you're sensitive to spicy things, of course, you'll definitely feel the heat. But for anyone of cultures that are used to spicy things, you may find yourself reaching for some hot sauce. I'd go with the extra spicy paitan. The noodles weren't overcomes at all, which is always my concern going into new ramen places. The broth made me want to chef kiss my fingers. My chicken however was over cooked. Not inedible. Just a bit dry and tough. Wasn't inedible or over cooked enough to send back, but it was just something I noted. The boiled egg was cooked to perfection. My sister got the dumplings. I didn't taste one, but she really enjoyed them. One thing very great was the staff service. Every...Single.... Staff member acknowledged us on the way out. I felt like Meghan Markle leaving an event. One by one they thank you for coming on tour walk down the long skinny restaurant hall. It was incredibly sweet. Waiters were constantly passing by as we were eating. They don't hide in the back somewhere and wait to be called on. They're always in standby. Great customer service. Very personal. Totto Ramen remains one of my faves.","Fantastic meal, prices aren't bad.Really enjoyed this place. Stumbled upon it when going for a walk and was not disappointed. Very flavorful ramen dishes. I would return if in the area.4.2/5 stars",Totto Ramen - Midtown East
425,"Very solid meal that hits all lot of notes for NYC opulence and solid if not creative French food.  I enjoyed Per Se more than the French Laundry but this isn't a place I can recommend or would go back because while the food was really good, as was the impeccable service, its absurdly expensive for the food and ingredients which weren't rare or over the top (ie not a5 waygu huge pieces or foie or whatever to justify the price tag), and not at all creative in the plating.  Stuffy boring atmosphere with patrons which you can tell aren't really foodies but people with big bank/expense accounts.  Had to tick it off the list, but wouldn't come back.Food wise I did enjoy the lobster quite a bit, but the lamb was a total dud with black olives that in no way went with the meal.","weeks later, my wife and i are still talking about how disappointing our dinner was here.Service is exceptionally slow; waiting 30+ minutes plus for ordered drinks. There were also huge waits between courses; expect to wait 30-45 minutes between very small courses. We were getting really hungry and tired towards the end, given the entire experience was 3-4 hours long.The food was not that great; it is beyond belief to me that they have 3x Michelin stars and charge so much.","this is my first time at a Thomas Keller restaurant and I was looking forward to it a lot. Unfortunately it was a very disappointing experience. Service is exceptionally slow; waiting 30+ minutes plus for ordered drinks. There were also huge waits between courses; expect to wait 30-45 minutes between very small courses. We were getting really hungry and tired towards the end, given the entire experience was 3-4 hours long.I can much more highly recommend Arpège in Paris, which is also a 3 michelin star restaurant.","Just exquisite in every sense. I do have one issue having to walk through a smelly garage hallway (garbage deposit) before crossing the mall and the winding escalator to finally arrive at the Gourmand Food Court, a series of high end eateries on the 4th floor. T. Keller is a Relais Chateaux listed Michelin star establishment and lives up to that status to the delight of all.The chef menu we have experienced on our two private dinners in a private room (understated, elegant and quietly welcoming for conversations) is always a feast for all senses. They beautifully accommodate vegan or dietary restrictions and do not serve your optional menu with any less aplomb.I just love the white glove service and the army of waiters who file out to reveal your personal plated meal and voila you are served.We love all Keller's establishments, even his Seabourne The Grill, and enjoy the exquisite service and haute gourmand menu all throughout his restaurants!","We had the chef's 9 course tasting menu.  Overall it was satisfactory but the courses were underwhelming.  If we had to give it a letter grade, it will be a B-/C+Ambiance:  the restaurant is at the top of the Time Warner Building in what is basically a mall (will need to climb several escalators).  When you reach there you will need to walk all the way to the right passing a bar not associated with Per Se.  Then when you finally arrive, the guests basically have to just hang outside with a bunch of strangers until you are let in.  It just feels like a ""tourist trap.""  If you are dining in the main part of the restaurant, you have to walk pass the salon area that looks like a cafeteria with tables without linens (very sad so spend a bit more to be in the main dining area).  We were seated in a round table for two, one row from the windows facing Central Park with a view of the Christopher Columbus Statue.  There were several rows behind us so if you come to dine, make sure you are not placed all the way in the back.  We had the 5:30pm seating on a gorgeous Autumn day so we were able to experience the daytime and evening sunset ambiance (the meal lasted 2 hrs for us and was enough time to get to Broadway to catch a show at 8pm).  The tables were appropriately spaced so there was overall sense of space though my friend can pick up conversations with the table next to us.  That said, the acoustic was good for dining.Service:  excellent, attentive, professional, appropriately friendly and obviously well trained staff.Now to the food:  The best course was the oyster & pearls- unique approach to eating oyster using an oyster glazed spoon.  Next came the Asian pear which was fine.  My friend got the supplemental foie gras and she liked it, except it didn't need the peanuts to confuse how delicious foie gras was with the Turkish brioche.  Next came the Montauk fluke which is fine but not spectacular.  From there, it really was down hill for us.  Why?  The Maine lobster course was tasty but the lobster meat was very rubbery and chewy.  If you ever have Maine or New England lobster, this was definitely not it.  It did not feel that the lobsters served here were from live lobsters that were cooked and shelled onsite.  If you can not do that, then don't put it on the menu.  Then there was bread & butter and that was actually a course in of itself.  We overheard the table next to us made a snarky comment about the cheese crackers tasting like Veelveta!  We couldn't help but agree.  Then came the meat courses.  The pigeon course was just ok and honestly not memorable, except that it was a course that was utterly confused and need clear directions (the sweet galette did not compliment pigeon meat).  The lamb dish was liked by my friend and I tend not to like game tasting meat, particularly when it was done rare (very pink).  The Maplebrook farms figs were good.  Finally came the assortment of desserts.  The ice cream (salted caramel), fruit and candies were adequate but not out of this world effort.  Per Se can do away with the bowl of like 7 balls of sugar coated donuts (very 90s).  Sheepishly we ate 2 each.  Bottom line:  the service was impeccable, the ambiance could be improved and the menu was underwhelming and need a major overhaul.  It may be worth checking out Per Se competition- Le Bernadin and Eleven Madison.  Unless the menu changes dramatically, we won't be coming back.","Thank you to our friend who generously treated us to this extraordinary experience at Per Se. The service was impeccable and the food was phenomenal. I was full by the time we reached our seventh course. I'll let the photos be the story. Every morsel of our 3 hour meal was delicious. We were able to bring home the desserts we weren't able to finish. And a we also received a folder with our night's menu. We also got to visit the kitchen.  And were introduced to each chef. A tv screen was on one wall. It was showing what was happening at French Laundry, the west coast version of Per Se. Amazing!  The chefs could watch what each restaurant was preparing!",Per Se
426,Just as good as the Bed-Stuy original only with more tables and space.  Less chicken centric at this location but still as flavorful with the seafood offerings.,"It is so unfortunate that I have to write this review, considering that I have been a loyal customer of this restaurant for a while now. There was a fly in my cranberry juice, and when we asked for the manager, he was completely unapologetic. The fly was bad enough, but the total disregard for an unacceptable mistake added insult to injury.",Food is pretty good  especially the fish sandwich however they need to pay more attention to customers and details. For example after my 8th visit  the service has been consistently bad.  Staff does not pay attention or understand how to earn that 20%. They know nothing about choreography. Its simply a case of disorganized confusion!!!! Staff need a refresher course on how to wait tables period!!!!!,"Listen... get ready for a party in your mouth!!!One Friday I was craving seafood.  Wanting to try something new and not go to my go to spot, I came to my favorite app (Yelp!!!) and searched for seafood in Brooklyn.  As I sat and looked through all of the menus and pics, there was something about Peaches that stood out to me... probably the price. lol. Significantly cheaper than all of the other places I was looking at.From the photos, I already had my mind set on the Jim Cade boil.  As soon as I walked in, I noticed some folks at a different table had it.  And they were sharing it!  The pictures don't do it justice. It's large enough to share with one other person.  So my meal was even cheaper than I had anticipated.  3 large crab clusters, about 10-12 shrimp, an abundance of mussels, corn and potatoes (which we didn't even finish).Happy hour until 7, I believe.Can't wait to return.","Whiting sandwich was delicious ! Definitely brought back memories of Long Island Summers. Crispy and flakey white fish with enough pieces to take one off and save for later (if you can control yourself lol). The blue crab pasta was another star of the night. Crab cake sandwich fell a bit short, not much lump crab meat. We has called about 20 min prior to showing up on Saturday night around 10pm. Our table was waiting for us and we ended up closing the place! A great seafood option in  Bed-stuy.","My coworkers and I took our supervisor here for her birthday celebration on a Friday evening. We made reservations and I have to say the young lady who placed them was kind and full of information ! When we arrived the restaurant was fairly empty, we had to wait a while for a few late comers in our party so we did have a bit of a wait but we were seated while waiting. I was thirsty and decided to pour some water from the reused bottle placed on our table. As I'm pouring what looked like a black/gray dust particle came out the bottle. Now this wasn't a small piece of dust but a good size which led me to believe they don't wash their bottles and that the water was sitting out in the open. We let the waitress know and she apologized and removed the bottle. Most of the bottles on our table weren't clear and after the dust incident I refused to drink their water. I ordered the pineapple juice but wasn't impressed it tasted like regular can Dole. Also the water was room temperature slightly annoying but moving on. Most of our party arrives and we order our food I had the lobster roll with bacon, I believe avocado and tomato. It was good but the bread could not hold the sandwich and the bottom part of the bun was soggy. The French fries were also lukewarm which led be to believe they may have been sitting there a bit. Overall it was cool though.  My supervisor ordered a shrimp boil and as she was eating she realized they didn't devein the shrimp now I am aware everyone prepares their food differently but this was a surprise. When we questioned the waitress about it she seemed confused and nonchalantly stated that this was normal and that's how they prepared their shrimp. Gross if you ask me but I wasn't the one eating it. It was also in the fried shrimp. Overall I am definitely not coming back here the dust in the water and unclean shrimp makes me question them as a whole. On a positive note if you are celebrating a birthday you are allowed to bring a cake or cupcakes and they provide all the plates and cutlery.",Peaches Shrimp and Crab
427,Fries were hard and very small portions for the price. I was expecting a lot more. Also thought they served tacos everyday but I believe it's only on tuesdays,"There was only 1 problem here... I ran of room in my stomach to order and eat more.We spent $500 for dinner at A Michelin Star rated restaurant the next night... The food at that place; which will remain unmentioned (although if you search my recent reviews should be easy to determine); left me wishing we'd come back S.E.T. for dinner instead.I'm don't know there is anything else to say.Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because though it wasn't super busy, I was never asked if I wanted another beer and had to ask for our check and to-go boxes after sitting for 10 minutes at the table, clearly finished with dinner (even stacked the finished plates, to make it extra evident after sitting for a while).","The decor is cute, but not really worth the hype. Portions were very small and this is one of the locations that try to auto-charge a larger than averge tip (for a party of 2?!). Watch out for that and I spoke up.  Pay attention to the price of the menu and the price on the bill is my recommendation.  Food is decent and we were still hungry after.","Came for happy hour (M-F, 5pm - 8pm) and was not disappointed. There was only one bartender and yet he made our drinks very quickly and checked in on us regularly. Mind you this one guy was both bartender and waiter. I'm not a fan of vodka so I didn't order the lychee martini, but it looked great. I tried the rum punch, red sangria, and coco shot. Of those, the rum punch came out on top.In case you're curious, the coco shot is made of coconut rum and Red Bull. It's very sweet, but rest assured, it's more rum than Red Bull.And the bathrooms are clean, which is always a plus.","Here's another IG find seeing pics of delicious looking tacos was haunting me, we finally stopped by to give it a try. We came in & were seated right away , happy hour was still going we had the Lychee Martini this was good nice taste & good amount of alcohol. Tacos we had Shrimp taco was good taste wise, the Chicken was good as well nice taste with the aioli & sriracha Mayo , the Bulgogi Taco was the clear winner great flavor & taste to the meat. We also had an order of the Tempura shrimp it was very good a little deceiving since u think u have this full bowl w shrimp but nah way too much lettuce at the bottom. Small location, fun & funky decor, good music playing... happy hour runs till 7pm with some decent specials. Service was good & prices were reasonable, we enjoyed our drinks & food.",This place is like a mix bar/restaurant place. The sliders are great but be careful because they try to charge a TABLE FOR 2-20% TIP. The reason they gave me was people do not tip or run out before tipping so they autocharge a 20% tip. Legally they have to display or mention that they are going to pre charge the tip. On the menu it just says for parties of 6 or more they charge 18% which wasn't the case for us.The sliders arent dry. I had the surf and turf sliders which they dont let you mix and match. I also ordered the popcorn shrimp from the appetizers but realized the surf and turf is basically a regular slider with the popcorn shrimp in it... So you might as well buy regular sliders and order the appetizer and stuff it in yourself.,Set L.E.S
428,This place was lined out the door. Portions here are good sizes. Get the Taylor ham and egg on everything bagel.,Food: 3/5  price: 3/5   Service: 4/5   Ambience: 4/5Bagel with ham and cheese ($5.25) - 3/5. Really not that amazing like Yelp has claimed. Just a mediocre bagel joint. Eggs weren't as hot as I've hoped.,"This place is packed but they have an efficient system and the line moves quick. The biggest challenge is finding a seat or finding space to wait for your order.I got an everything bagel with lox spread. The bagel was decent but not as good as I was expecting and the spread lacked the flavor of the lox even though it had a few pieces of salmon.The plus is that it is close to Penn Stations, but next time I will go to Ess-a-Bagel","First off, I don't care for bagels but wow!We had a plain toasted bagel with blueberry spread. That tasted very good and they give you and abundance of spread. If you don't think you get enough then just buy a tub of it because that's the only way you could think you need more. I had the Taylor ham and egg sandwich on plain bagel. The bagel was perfectly what I've though a bagel should be.Soft, yet chewy, and light. Yes it seems like these don't fit together, however, where I'm from I avoid bagels because they are the complete opposite of what I experienced. If bagels everywhere where like these, I would eat them more often! P.s the fresh squeezed orange juice was great as well. It wasn't too acidic like most brand name oj. Great breakfast for the low cost! Everything  was well worth it!!!","So I am not from the east coast, not from New York, but this place... literally served me the BEST bagel lox I have EVER HAD!!! I travel quite often but since I tried this place I always make it an effort to go here every time I'm in New York!! Service is fast!! Some people see the line and leave honestly they are pretty fast!! FOOD: This place has the best bagel lox I have ever tried!! Literally crave it!! I feel like sometimes taking a 6hr plane ride is worth it just so I can have that bagel again. It's in my dreams!! Yeah so I can't say it enough.. get the bagel lox!Please open one up in the west coast PLEASEEE!!!!","Best Bagel & Coffee is definitely a must visit place for all the New Yorkers. They serve the best bagel I have ever had in Manhattan so there is always a line but it's worth the wait. We ordered the smoked salmon sandwich and we choose onion bagel, scallion cream cheese and + extra onion and tomato ($12). The bagel itself was chewy, tasty and smell super good after toasted; the scallion cream cheese was creamy with well-flavored; the smoked salmon was soft and fresh. We were satisfied with their amazingly delicious combination. The portion of sandwich was enough to share with 2 people and I felt super full after finishing half. Overall, we will plan to visit again to try other options.",Best Bagel & Coffee
429,Back again for a revival.  The experience as exquisite as always. The octopus and bisque were terrific as was the service and ambiance.,"Had dinner with friends a few days ago and was NOT impressed. I ordered one of the specials for the night - grilled shrimp with quinoa and avocado paste. Sounds gross right? Well it was! The shrimp were too salty, the quinoa had a weird after taste ( I think too many red peppers were used) and she avocado paste was clearly not from a fresh avocado. It was just terrible combination. My 2 friends ordered the Branzino which was good. Edible at least. The lobster mac and cheese was really just mac and cheese with 2 or 3 gummy pieces of lobster.",,"We celebrated my hubby's birthday here. Had dinner reservations but came in early as we wanted to do happy hour. They let us stay in one of the high tops so our two underaged kids could sit with us. Drinks were half-off until 7 pm (wine and beer)! We moved to our table when my older son arrived. Service was impeccable! I had the swordfish which was a good size (actually too big for me so I shared it with my hubby), my vegetarian daughter had a vegetable pasta (she loved it!) and the boys had the porterhouse for two, with lobster Mac and creamed spinach on the side.

430,Looked like a great place but we arrived an hour late. My 8 month pregnant wife and I were told we only have an hour left on our reservation if we still want the table otherwise nothing.I get that we were late. It was a rainy night and traffic was terrible. I find it hard to believe they couldn't make it work. We waited 30 minutes for another cancellation which didn't happen. Doesn't make sense that they would have given us the cancellation if they didn't show 1 minute after their time.Just an overall bad experience.,"DISCLAIMER: the only reason I'm giving this place one star is due to the rudeness of one of the waitresses. I had walked in with my cousin because she needed her phone to be charged. My cousin had asked the waitress if she can charge her phone behind the bar. The waitress then proceeded to give a horrible attitude, and started to talk very badly about my cousin to another employee right in front of our faces. She was VERY rude and dismissive. The bar tender that took her phone to charge it was nice and so was the hostess. But this one waitress was SO out of line that it led me to Yelp about it. Due to this, me and my cousin did not eat nor drink at this establishment. The waitress was a white female with straight black hair. Absolute disgrace. I'm sure this place would have been nice to eat at but because of ONE rude employee we we so disgusted and walked right out.","This place is definitely overrated and overpriced. I don't even know why it has a Michelin star. I ordered the seafood pasta, it came with one shrimp and two pieces of calamari.  The pasta was over-cooked too. The spreads didn't taste special no more than any other Greek restaurant.","This is a very well-decorated establishment in TriBeCa. They had some great cocktail and wine options. We split the spreads, which came in two different size options for 18 dollars and 30. There were about four spreads in one order that came with fresh hot pita bread. We chose the 18 one, which was more than enough for our party of three! I would definitely get this again as all the spreads were delicious and left me wanting more. For my entree, I got the branzino which was topped with sautéed spinach and some carrots. The dish also came with half a lemon, which provided a great citrus-y addition to the fish. The branzino was very expertly cooked and had enough flavor on its own without needing any additional sauce.Given all the above, I would definitely come back again to try the other options! This seems like a great place to go to celebrate any occasion where splurging just a little will be rewarded with a satisfied appetite.","Book for romantic date night. Quality food. Excellent service. High prices. Lovely decor. Tip! Early dinner around 5-6p is less busy and more intimate (empty tables, low noise volume). As the night goes on, expect it to get pretty busy, bigger groups and louder noise levels.","A romantic atmosphere with its dim lights and rustic feel. It's a long and narrow restaurant. We ordered lots of food. We started off with cold appetizers which were a mix of baba ganoush, feta cheese mixed with a labneh sauce and garlic paste. Of course it came with bread. These were not nassef just not my favorite as they seemed to have an after taste. We also had Greek salad weighing was delicious and fresh. The was lots of olive oil but with the cheese and tomatoes in the salad was fine. The meatballs were good, nothing special but a good appetizer to order as opposed to the grilled squid which was really over cooked and not fresh at all. The spinach pie was different than most places because it was actually made in a pie crust instead of with filo sheets; a unique take but an unfavorable one. The lemon potatoes were delicious. They were thick and you could really taste the lemon flavor. We were also served spinach rice which was strange because it was gooey slimy and thick. I really couldn't even taste the rice. The mains were good with the steak being cooked well and the lamb chops bursting with flavor. The best though was dessert. There was cheesecake, sweet baklava with nuts and chocolate on the platter. The golash and the chocolate were delicious.Mera's Tip: have some baklava",The Greek
431,"I wanted to come here for a long time and finally I made a reservation. It was a nice day out and we were seated outside. We ordered hummus and fries for appetizer and chicken kebab salad and lamb with rice for the entree. Food was not very good at all. Hummus was not very tasty, seemed more like a package hummus you buy at Whole Foods. Fries was good, but how can you mess it up? Salad was very bad, super salty soaking in dressing, full of lemon seeds inside. Chicken in the salad was good. Lamb was below average as well. The worst part is that we started feeling very sick after eating and definitely did not want a dessert. When we came home both of us were feeling pretty bad and now, the next day horrible stomach pain. Breakfast and lunch we ate different, so it must be the dinner we had at the restaurant. Very disappointed.","It's all the hype but everything about this place is worthless.The service is the worst, our server took our order like she was doing us a huge favor, had a weird attitude and tried to rush us, which I'll understand if it was the weekend or if there was a long line of people waiting but there were multiple empty tables and no one waiting so I didn't really understand her rushing us. She brings the plates but no utensils which I could understand she forgot, but when I asked for it she rolls her eyes! If the food was good I would have given this place more stars, but the amount you're paying for the appetizers and platters is a lot and definitely not worth it. We got the hummus and tabouleh for appetizers. Hummus was decent but the tabouleh was probably the worst one I've had so far (I've tried a lot of places and tabouleh is my fave) there were uncut pieces of cilantro, it was not seasoned at all. We then got the supreme platter for a group of 5 which was ok, the best things were fries but all the meat dishes (kabobs and lamb chops) were VERY salty, so if you wana limit the sodium intake, avoid this place. It took them forever to get our entrees, which again I understand if it was busy but it was a weeknight and we didn't see a lot of people in the restaurant.We ended up paying $160 before the tips which is an insane amount for the amount of food we got! We went to another close by Afghan place to compensate for that. If you want salty, flavorless, overpriced food served by rude waiters, you can try this place otherwise avoid it at ALL costs.","I had this restaurant booked for a very long time and to be honest it didn't really WOW me. It is nearly impossible to get in without a reservation like we did the first night. We booked reservations for lunch the next day and were happily accommodated by the hostess. Ambiance- lovely Middle Eastern music and decor, tight spaces between tables, small tables. Food- We ordered a variety of the vegetarian sides which were actually tasty (yogurt, hummus, eggplant). The real bummer was their famous table side chicken shawerma which attracted me to the restaurant in the first place. The apparatus took up half of our table and you had to wait for a worker to come by to slice off the meat for you. Some of it inevitably falls onto the table or onto the floor because it's overloaded with a bed of fries. They advertised it as coming with fries and vegetables, but if you consider onions and parsley (?) vegetables then you're in luck. In the interim you're stuck eating an endless amount of fries whose seasonings become mundane and after eating so many of them (this obligated me to break my no fried foods rule while waiting for someone to trim the meat). It definitely felt like we were eating more fries than meat, which is most of what I ended up packing to go anyways. As a middle easterner, I appreciated having this cuisine available in NYC. The idea of the tableside shawerma is genius and it was actually cool, but the execution was not as pretty as expected. I suggest larger tables and nutritious vegetables mixed in with the fries for those who are more health-conscious. And maybe don't pile it up so much with fries to avoid having them fall and make a mess.",Had such a great experience tonight with my family. Our waitress (Elona) was sooo sweet and really understanding. she spoke clearly and just knew what we wanted to eat tonight. She asked us multiple times how we were which was nice The inside of the place can get a little loud with the music and the noise and they get super busy BUT the outdoor seating is super cute. Tables are first come first serve if you don't have a reservation so make sure your whole party is there. We got the table shawarma which was AMAZING. Came with french fries and sauces and was enough to fill all four of us. Definitely will be back!!,"Au Za'atarOVERALL: 6.4/10Place is one of those where you go for the picture and experience once and don't go back... LOLLL ‍‍ FOOD: 6.1/10Like I said above... It was really for the picture. Food isn't that good, the shwarma fries were banging tho. We got the Lebanese sausages, shwarma ""special"" that isn't on the menu cuz it's a ""special"", falafels, and the Lebanese fruit cocktail that is more of dessert... It really shouldn't be even called a drink, you can't drink it  The shwarma special is approximately 90 bucks for basically two chicken over fries... The sausage and falafels have NO taste just texture... ‍ SERVICE: 7.3/10Service wasn't bad, it seems to me that Asian restaurants have the best service. They get it that when you're looking around it means you need help. NOT HERE THO. CLEANLINESS 10/10Clean, their bathroom is clean af. I like.

We were like 14 people and we got 2 lamb and 1 chicken and everything was soooo good. Even fries were amazing! (1 shawarma for 4 people is good enough.)

432,"TLDR: Food was bad or inedible or scammy. FYI there were no Asians eating here. I had high hopes coming here to end a date. There was a 40m wait and high rating. But I was wrong. There was so many things wrong...how could yelp be wrong (hint people have bad tastes)? The place was clean and service was polite and accommodating. OrderedHot and sour soup - I had a piece of plastic in my soup. Good taste a little thick. Would not get again because of the plastic. Pork soup dumpling - 3/6 had no soup. It was a little sweet. Overall decent. Would not get again. Shrimp steamed dumpling - overall the skin was very off. Too thick and almost grainy. Would not get again. Fried shrimp dumpling - way too much ""bread crumb"" fried stuff, didn't taste like shrimp. Tasted like some weird wine reduction Chicken dumpling - complimentary for yelp checkin. Taste like a frozen one from Costco. Not worth paying for. Bean curd and pork - 16$ was burnt and inedible. They took it off our bill at leastThree (tri) pepper chicken - not at all Szechuan. Big pieces of chicken, way too salty. Would not get again. Lobster e-fu noodles - the lobster meat was removed from the dish. The noodles weren't e-fu noodles, were undercooked, and tasteless. What a scam!",I came to this place 2 years ago with a family friend and we had Shanghai crabmeat xiao long bao and Mongolian beef . The food tasted fine and close to authentic but lower than our expectations.,"Food was great but pricey (typical for UES) and small portions. We got 3 dim sum plates and 1 entree for 2 and we were still hungry. And I'm usually full off of anything.Yolk buns were the star of the show.A few recommendations--If you're going to use the chicken dumpling promo from yelp, SHOW your screen to the server while ordering. The server brought the check and said I told him about the promo too late (I told him when I ordered), but ended up comping bc his manager walked by. It was very awkward.Listen to people on here that it's expensive for what it is.","Xiao long bao were as delicious as Din Tai Fung, which had been my standard for steamed pork dumplings. Depending on what you like, you might even prefer these to Din Tai Fung! (Blasphemy, I know.) Thicker skin + plenty of soup inside = yum!Xia jiao and cha shao bao were also solid. Other dishes we ordered (eggplant, string beans, noodles) were not as noteworthy, but I'd definitely go for the dim sum!Restaurant was elegant, and service was nice and friendly. Recommended!","The dumplings are excellent and staff is super nice. However some dishes come with mushrooms which look and taste as if they were canned. Also, the brown sauce was a bit too thick for my liking. Good spot - and I would 100% come for the dim sum / dumplings again but I am not sure if I would get any dishes that have mushrooms.","Came here for lunch on a Sunday and the food was incredible! We ordered four dishes and all of them were really yummy and delicious. The decor was lovely as well. I enjoy their whole 1920 Shanghai theme with a modern twist and the seating were spacious so it made dining relaxing and fun. As for the dishes, we ordered their Dan Dan Noodles, Gu-Lu Pork with Pineapple, Szechuan Prawns and Mapo Tofu. The pork was so tender and flavorful. It almost has the burnt wok flavor which only a quality chef that knows what he's doing, can achieve. As for the pawns, there were a mouthful. So much so that I felt like I was eating lobsters. Soooo good and a dish I highly recommend to order. As for their Dan Dan Noodles and Mapo Tofu it was good but nothing where I went whoaaaa. Regardless still very delightful. Overall, I enjoy myself here at their restaurant. The only thing I didn't like was how the waiters kept on coming at us to see if we're ready to order. If it wasn't him, it was another. We almost felt rushed. Eventually I had to tell the waiter that I will call them when we are ready. With that said, I don't think there were any ill intention on the waiters end to rush but just more eager to take our order. Regardless of this minor hiccups, I still like this restaurant.  It's nice to see a decent Chinese restaurant in the UES and I recommend dining here if you choose to.",Tri Dim Shanghai
433,First time I come this restaurant. I'm Californian. I grew up with Chinese food. The noodles was tasty and the waitress here were very nice.,"been here twice since it is in my neighborhood. Here is my honest opinion. If they can improve, I will consider revisit otherwise bye.1. overpriced menu. I am okay with 13-15 dollar of noodle but not that little portion.2. In china we never use dry shrimp with out letting it sits in the water for 20min to soften it. Putting dry shrimp directly into a dry noodle dish is lame and how can you eat dry shrimp as hard as beef jerky?3. air condition is not enough especially for hot noodle soup in hot summer.","The worst. Rude people, uncomfortable seating, chipped plates, metal glasses that make the water taste like metal, greasy, tasteless food. Go there with someone you want to insult.","My visit here has been nothing but a treat! First the interior and attention to detail in every design is incredible. You are instantly transported to a classy yet hip dining experience that you will take someone you really want to impress on a first date. The stools, water glass, chili oil cans are all so well designed. The drinks were fairly reasonably priced for nyc ($8 for a bottle of soju!) and I really enjoyable the soy milk drink too, again in an adorable bottle. Now onto the food. Almost everything we ordered was SO GOOD. The beef noodles were so flavorful (tip is that it's really not that spicy so you should feel comfortable to get that and just add more chili oil!) and there are so many enticing appetizers. I would strongly recommended the 3 food items below and I can't wait to come back and try more.","Came here on a Tuesday night and the place was pretty packed throughout the night. The Favs--Fried Tiger Prawn with Salted Egg Yolk Plate:  maybe I have a personal thing for egg yolk flavor dishes, very tasty in my opinion and the shrimp was fat and juicy. Mouth Watering Boneless Chicken Thigh Plate: flavorful and tender chicken thigh, expected to be a little spicier but pretty satisfying. Stir-fried Shredded Cabbage Plate: cooked with right timing and great flavor, slightly heavier on the sauce.The okayed--Dan Dan Noodle: not bad try and noodle texture was great but it was very dry. I ended up eat it with the sauce from Mouth Watering Chicken. Minced Pork over Rice: in general very good and very generous on the toppings, it would be perfect if less water in the minced pork sauce so it's more flavorful. The meh... Fried Peppercorn Pork Belly Plate: our least favorite, too fried food couldn't taste the pork.... Service was friendly and attentive, but maybe something wrong with their system that we were getting each dish like twice, and I saw our food was sent to other table several times as well. Nice addition in the neighborhood though!","I really enjoyed my meal here at The Tang. Some items can be slightly pricey, but overall, decent portion sizes and you can definitely get extremely filled up with just a few dishes. Service was great-- everyone was pleasant and kept my water cup filled! I ordered the oxtail beef noodle soup. Their broth was delicious. I've noticed a lot of other people ordering their noodle soups too. I'm assuming that those are some of their best seller here.I ordered their pork dumplings in chili oil. There were 2 chili peppers next to that option (indicating spicy levels), so I was expecting it to be a tad spicy. Unfortunately, it wasn't spicy for me at all. It was a mediocre item for me, but other items on their menu were still incredibly delicious.My favorite item from them was the pineapple shrimp fried rice. They served it in a pineapple and it was absolutely delicious. I definitely feel like this item is a must try.I've also had their Chongqing spicy popcorn chicken. It was EXTREMELY crispy. I loved it and it was served with a lot of chili peppers. Their seared beef short ribs were delicious as well. So flavorful. The roasted egg plant also really surprised me-- they topped it with bonito flakes, giving it extra flavors and textures. There are still a bunch of items I really wanted to try. I wanted to try their scallion pancake w/beef tartare, but unfortunately, they told me they were sold out for the day (I'm not sure if this happens frequently for them). Will definitely make another visit back!",The Tang - Upper West Side
434,"Went for their pasta night special, and I got the taglionini ai funghi. It was very good! But it was soured a bit by their policies - be warned, their half price pasta dishes on Thursday nights are also half portions. (Our server told us this - I wouldn't have known otherwise.) Also we made a reservation, but they were busy and seated us at the bar anyway and then had us pay a surcharge for counter service. It was a small fee, but still weird seeing as we didn't choose to sit there.","We came here after work to try the tasting menu. In our opinion, the food wasn't worth the cost. We started with The broccoli rabe Caesar salad which was overdressed. Then we had a pasta and chicken dish to share. For the portion size, it just was not worth it. Then the dessert was a surprise and we both didn't enjoy it. The cost per person is 55. Go somewhere else. If you really want to try this place, def do for your own opinions. For us, it was just ok.","The food was great but because it's ""tapas""style, they rushed all the food out at once. We ordered 8 dishes - a few from each menu section. They brought out 5 of them within seconds of each other. They brought 2 dishes 5 minute later. The last one came out 45 minutes after, with no apology and no offw cancel it.Many dishes were cold before we could eat it and it made our meal much less pleasant. They also delivered one of the ""small plates"" (mussels!) at the end our meal. Very strange.","How, oh how, can you go wrong with $10 pasta Thursdays? I cannot find an answer.This place is always solid and the service is friendly and helpful. I honestly believe their cavatelli with pork and pecorino rivals any of Lilia's pasta. The polenta with sausage is a must as well. So creamy, so meaty, so delicious. And happy hour $5 muscles are a steal.","The Saint Austere is a pizza and wine bar that serves up delicious pasta dishes and entrees. I came here on a weeknight without a reservation and was able to sit pretty quickly. The environment here is dimly lit and good for a date night or just catching up with a friend. To start off, my friend and I got the creamy polenta and broccoli rabe. I love polenta and think this place executed this dish pretty well. The broccoli rabe was delicious as well; the dish was topped with Parmesan cheese, breadcrumbs and an egg. For entrees we got two of their most popular pasta dishes (per our server) which was the tagliolini ai funghi and the cavatelli. While I enjoyed both, the cavatelli definitely stole the ribbon for me. The pork sauce that the cavatelli came with was just divine. We also got the tagliata, which was a hanger steak with truffled mushrooms and parmesan. I liked the truffle flavor and that they cooked this to a perfect medium rare. For dessert we got the tiramisu which actually is not your standard version you'd expect. The one they serve here is a uniquely executed frozen dessert with toffee pieces on top. A bit sweet for me but it was a nice ending to our meal regardless.","had a really wonderful date here last night. all food was delicious, (polenta, octopus, lasagna, tagliolini**, tagliata*) service was friendly and welcoming, and playlist was on point (gangstarr, hi-tek, atcq, the roots, etc.). standouts: tagliolini -- perfectly creamy, fresh & homemade pasta, tagliata -- combo of horseradish cream + arugula + parm made for an amazing compliment to hanger steak. most certainly looking forward to returning.",The Saint Austere
435,Just letting all the dog lovers out there know that they do allow dogs on the outside patio. It's a small patio - even our 15 lb companion was slightly in the way of the servers but they didn't seem to mind at all. Cash only.,"3.5 Pros: Cozy environment, good service, authentic? the owner/employees are French (or very convincingly so to a non-French), unexpectedly large portions, reasonable pricing.Con: Lacking flavor complexity, contrary to the menu descriptions with interesting ingredients- they didn't shine through. For example, I was really looking forward to the mint element in La Sultan, but all I got was a little sprig with no actual mint flavor incorporated with the dish. A garnish shouldn't be included with a menu description imo- just a bit misleading with expectations.","Discovered this place by accident as we got lost finding our way back to Manhattan.. Have been back on numerous occasions.. The first time... a dessert crepe and coffee.. My next 3 times: a savory crepe.. Suffice it to say, I am trying every crepe first then on to the salads. So far.. not disappointed as of yet..","Wow blown away the ambiance is so cool, very European. I had the hanger steak and my wife tried the shrimp curry dishes both dishes were excellent. The shrimp curry is a must try in my opinion. I ate half my wife's plate. If you're in the Williamsburg area and want to try something French... The crepes are so delicious  The cappuccino is excellent!! Def a must try !!","What a cute French crepe place to go on a date! The interior is adorable we sat near the window for lunch and ordered a mocchacino and ice latte for our drinks. For crepe I got the La Normande. Very delicious and creamy but not overwhelming, mushrooms are tasty. Only thing is the chicken was a bit dry wish it was more tender.Waitress was very nice and would checkup every now and then. Bathroom is big and clean! Overall was a good experience!","What a cute French crepe place to go on a date!

436,"The most appalling service from Ximena. I used to work in the NYC restaurant industry as a server so I'm usually very sympathetic to wait staff. But.... woooooow. Just wow. Our server Ximena reasserted my decision to never come back here again. Not only was she rude, she was extremely unaccommodating. I have not experienced service like that before. The bussers were far more attentive to our table than she was. Ridiculous.Highlight: the fish tacos were tasty.",Called to make a reservation for a birthday dinner and staff was very rude.  On top of that the reservation was for a large group so it only made sense.  They then told me come by leave your name and probably an hour wait.  I have eaten here before and this was just rude.  You are not a five star restaurant nor are you a Michelin Star either. Choose somewhere else to go,"**Update. I recently discovered that I am allergic to something in the carnitas platter.. a couple hours after eating here I broke out in hives and my whole body was itchy and red. Didn't figure this out until I ate the leftovers and had the exact same reaction. Not sure what's in the platter because I've never had an allergic reaction to food like this before. I don't think I'll be going here again in fear of getting another reaction. Don't get me wrong it's not the restaurants fault, the food just didn't like me ‍","I love love love love loved it!The team was great, they gave us a table outside for brunch and sent us sangrias (because of the heat lol).. Food was amazing, had some beef arepas, tacos and yuca fries!After a few drinks me and the group went for a walk around and by the time we came back we passed by Yuca bar again.. and we just had to join them for drinks again, the place was crowded and the manager so nice to us again!I highly recommend it if you are looking to enjoy some traditional latino food :)","I'll open with the food was great , this is not about the quality or taste.This one star review is being written because my wife and i went out to eat last night to eat here( we've been in the area over 30+ years and have frequented it).We were seated and served and waited a decent amount of time for our food to come , with parts of our order missing, again no big deal. But the bill came and we paid and we gave what we thought was an adequate up ( gratuity is optional , contrary to popular belief ).The waitress came up to up and approached up and basically forced us to give her a better tip , i wish i could recall her name. But it was not only insulting , but absolutely humiliating. She stood over us and just stared and waited for us to give her a better tip. It was later in the evening , i was with my wife and daughter and didn't have time to ask for a manager. But after this experience not only will never go back , i will absolutely recommend none of my friends or family go back. I still can't get over how she just stood there and watched and wouldn't leave until we gave her a tip she felt she deserved.","*bar review only*Came here on a Friday night with 2 friends in search of a margarita and no line outside. These are 2 things that are hard to come by in EV, but we came here early enough in the evening (9:30pm) that the universe granted us our wish.It was super crowded inside so everyone was packed in there like sardines, but the margs were bomb and so was the music. A little Reggaeton and a marg in hand makes me a very happy girl.Haven't tried the food here but I heard the brunch was pretty good. I'd give Yuca a try one weekend!",Yuca Bar
437,"After a stroll through Long Island City Piers, we decided to find some dinner, settling on John Brown Smokehouse. You know a BBQ place is good when you can smell the smoke. Unfortunately I couldn't, but my friend really wanted some BBQ.We got the half pound brisket and rib tips with fries and mac and cheese for sides. The fries were hand cut from potatos, but a little underseasoned and soggy. The mac and cheese needed more cheese. The brisket was a bit dry, not much fat. I preferred the rib tips. I really liked their ghost pepper BBQ sauce though. It was very spicy.","Out of all the BBQ I've had in the US (Nashville, Portland, Vancouver, Austin, Boston, Orlando, Atlanta, Fairbanks- yes, Alaska! & Newark to name a few) food here is average.  BBQ is tricky. It can get dry fast.  My burnt ends were dry.  The rib tips were not - but didn't have much for meat compared to other places. Prices were high for this area.  No AC inside - so sit outside.  Good IPA was $7 for a ""not honest"" 14-oz. Not a Pint.  Anyway- the two item platter with two sides was $28 before tip.  I may give the other place nearby a shot. Even though they only have 3 stars- can't imagine the meat would be any drier.Out the door, with 1 beer, food and a tip was $41. For the layout, average food, location, and no table service- about 20% over the value.","I've visited this restaurant for the second time and this time I requested take out. I am aware of the size portions they give which had me to return. The website does not have anything but the hours but going in I also New the prices. Once I receive my food I was very angry They charged me for a full slab of ribs and for a pound of rib tips but did not give me the food requested. I called them back and the guy answering hung up on me and I called him again. He did not want to make things right, after I traveled over 30 minutes to get to their facility and I notified him I will be writing this review.When I learned from this place is to check your order because everyone is an honest and they're not honest people to rectify the issue.","We were in the area and a friend suggested we go here.    Place was packed around 5pm on a Friday.  Prices haven't gone up.  You can get a sandwich for around $9, which is plenty, but I highly suggest getting sides and sharing them.Food is good here and good value.  The meat plates get you 1/3 lb of meat and a side for $15.  It's a lot of food.  I also like that they serve white bread instead of rolls.    That's more te as style. The brisket was decent if a little dry.  BBQ sauces were thick and tasty and the hot one was super spicy.  I sampled lots of things on this visit - the chili, the pulled pork - both really good.   I'll come back for the chili.  For sides we tried Cole slaw - vinegratte and very fresh.  The cornbread was moist like pudding.  Baked beans were also god with pork inside.   I think I could eat Thanksgiving here. This small easy to miss BBQ spot gets packed for good reason.  Wood paneled walls, red white checkered table cloths provide a simple Texas decor.  Patio is big out back.  Happy hour was ridiculous with a really nice beer on draft for $4.  This place can accommodate a few large groups.  Inside or on the patio.","This tiny place with its red checkered plastic tableclothes and impromptu wood paneled bar top beer bar,  could almost be in Texas.Service is hands off in a Wild West New York style.  No forks maybe.  Ask for water.There were some late 20s people at the bar talking about either being vegetarian or cutting down on meat consumption.  The place was packed at 6:15 on a Sunday.A platter is 1/2 pound of meat with a side for around $15.  You could get that and share it.    I just ate the whole thing.As a Texan - the food is solid.  I got the brisket and fries.   I should have specified thin slice and not fatty,  but it was flavorful with very good house made sauces.   The fries also had a Texas feel - being crispy house cut not too thick. To eat such a filling quality meal for $15 in New York is a pretty good value.   The food is heavy so ask for lean cuts if you don't want to fall asleep immediately after eating. Food - better than average and good BBQ in NYC Atmosphere - small shack style place that is crowded but not too loud (no music).The counter service is hands off but fast.",I do apologize for the review.Overall it was good .I just think that the Mac and cheese needs some work .it is ALWAYS PACKED!!!!!!!

438,Always solid spot for some thing Frenchie all though it's a huge shame they don't sell their seared  chicken  anymore. Still it's a good spot for a date and escape the craziness of the rest of Williamsburg Been around for years and probably will be for a long time still.,"The strategy: go with another person, split the pancakes because they take an hour to bake, and get 2 entrees. Sorry loner people. Or, if you're a loner, you should shamelessly get the pancakes + an entree and have a little feast. Whatever you do, get the baked pancakes. They're some of the best I've had. Crispy edges and sooo fluffy. Tried the eggs benedict with bacon which is a no fail. Sort of regretting not trying the confit or the lamb sausage, but I'm coming back for those pancakes again.","Came twice. The first time (Sunday brunch) they forgot to put our order in a system so we simply waited for an hour to get our eggs. No apologies, hostess/manager just walked away.  I decided to come on Monday next week to see if it was just a busy Sunday. We ordered eggs Benedict and their famous pancakes. 10 minutes later they brought COLD eggs trying to tell me that they have to be room temperature but they were just COLD. after I told them that, they put them in a microwave to heat it up a bit. AGAIN. IN A MICROWAVE. Pancakes were just too overage. Nothing special. Just don't waste your time on this place.","Bro.. this is my new favorite brunch spot right now. We came here over the weekend and I fell in love. It has the broken down artisan feel to it, with wooded furniture, tables and the like. Right off the bat, the waitress gave us the scoop on those famous pancakes, so we decided to add it to our orders. I had the Eggs Norwegian and the wife had the Avocado Tartine, both amazingly delicious. The special surprise was the pancakes, the pictures are highly deceptive, because these are huge! They are densely packed with flavor, amazing and extremely filling. This is for sure a top tier brunch spot, that will have you wanting to come back. I'm definitely in Love with this place and I just came here once.","So I was really surprised with my experience here after getting recommendations from friends and seeing all these positive reviews. My friends and I came here around 11AM on a Saturday for brunch and the place was pretty full but we were able to get a seat right away. We were brought to a small circular table that had 2 extra chairs at it and a baby stool. Sort fo weird they didn't clear that all, but no big deal. We just moved it all out of the way so we could get around the table more comfortably. Our order was taken fairly quickly.  It took a while for our food to come out so when it arrived we were really hungry. It was all cold. My avocado toast with a poached egg had clearly been sitting for a while. The egg was cold and a little overcooked, the toast had that weird soggy sensation toasted bread gets when it has been sitting with something on it for a bit, and my friend's dishes were about the same. MY friend's french toast was burnt, not inedible, but clearly burnt. We had to ask for syrup because it was never brought out. My other friend's dish was cold and towards the end of eating it, she bit into an egg shell on her poached egg. It was a rather large piece and kind fo got stuck in her throat for the rest of the day. You know when you swallow something sort of sharp and you can feel it for a while? It was like that. We waited so long for our food to begin with, we didn't want to complain about everything being cold and burnt but once she bit into that egg shell, we knew we had to say something. She spoke with the manager who didn't seem to be very bothered but did take her entree off the bill. I was really surprised by this experience and I just felt like if they tried a little harder, this could really be good. Maybe they were having an off day but my friend described a similar experience here a few months ago with burnt french toast. She chalked it up to an off day but this maybe is a more regular thing....They are known for their enormous stack of giant pancakes, so maybe that's all they really can do well? Hard to say. Won't be back to find out.","I came here on Sunday around 3pm with my boyfriend and we were seated immediately! They don't take reservations so I'm not sure how the wait situation is during peak brunch hours. - Spinach & Goat Cheese Croissant: Simple and delicious. Didn't feel heavy at all. There was a perfect amount of goat cheese. The spinach was sauteed with garlic. No complaints on the warm toasted croissant and sunny side up eggs. - Pancakes: Put in the order before doing anything else! It took a whopping 45 mins to arrive but it was well worth it. The pancakes came fresh hot out of the oven with a nice crisp baked top. Unlike your standard pancakes, these were bouncy and pillow soft. The strawberry butter was shocklingy delicious we had to order extra. I ate until I almost passed out. I also had a mimosa which was pleasant. The pancakes were definitely the most memorable part of our meal. It can easily be shared between 4 people. I am glad we didn't order a 3rd entree. I highly recommend these place for brunch!",Le Barricou
439,"SUPER DISAPPOINTING!! Bought a live lobster ($16/lb), but it was full of water with very little meat! We also requested a male lobster but they gave us a female with lots of roe. Plus they were the ones who asked us which gender we wanted. Either they didn't care enough to pick out the right gender or they don't know how to differentiate between the two. Will definitely go to ACME or Morton Williams next time for lobster ($15/lb).","This is a casual counter-serve sea food and raw bar located in the center of Chelsea Market. They have a nice selection of oysters and langoustines. Usually crowded. Seating's often limited. If you prefer a different setting, Cull & Pistol (next door) is a full service restaurant that has many of the same raw items on their menu.",This is the worst place to come and eat. Not only is the food not all that but the customer service is even more horrible. The lobster was ridiculously cold! I ordered two small lobsters and my bill came out to be $80. Not only was there no room to sit you stand and eat these lobsters crowded by other people around you. I was led to believe that my lobster was going to be steamed and hot but instead it was cold from the claw to the tail everything was cold. You have to push and fight and look for a spot to put your tray of lobster to eat on. For $80 I could've went to a better restaurant where I can sit down and eat a meal without having someone elbowing me well I try to crack my cold lobster. This goddamn place is nothing special it's just fucking boiled lobster in cold water dipped in butter. You can do this yourself at home. When I asked for some foil to wrap my lobster because I couldn't eat it anymore I was passed around and ignored. I don't know about any of the other reviews on here but I think it's bullshit if you gave us five stars. If I could give it a -5 stars trust me I would. This is the worst place to come to. Unless you like being mistreated and over charged.,Just wow - simply wow! It's amazing that this place exist with the freshness of the oysters and dive scallops. I also had the uni. Everything was amazing and the staff was quick. The dive scallops with the olive oil and lemon - one of the best things I ever had. It was so fresh and the flavor profile was so unique to have the raw scallop like that. The uni stood out where you can taste the freshness as well. Hands down - I will be back when I'm in NYC!,"Love lobster and seafood. Ended up getting carry out lobster and shrimp tempura rolls, seaweed salad and a cole slaw since this place was so busy inside. We ate a small communal square table outside since there was nowhere to inside or at the outside counter either. I can see why this place is crazy and constantly buzzing. I saw loads of people getting a whole lobster for their lunch today. The lobster roll was yummy but no sriracha available and we would have had to buy an entire bottle, seriously? Not even a small ramekin worth for $0.50, how cheap and lazy can they be. The cole slaw, seaweed and the shrimp tempura were all good, nothing special really, just sustenance to get us through a few more hours of walking until our better meal tonight back at Barn Joo.","I thought to myself that since I'm in New York for the first time, why not treat myself to some lobster!PricingIt was 21.50 plus tax for a lobster roll picnic box. It came with the roll, a bag of chips, and a 2 pack of Oreos. Lobster in general is not very cheap. I think it was a little above average pricing for what you're getting, but it's also cause you're in New York City inside of Chelsea Market.FoodThe lobster roll was good. Nothing extraordinary, but it definitely was good. The roll was toasted perfectly with a nice light crunch on the outside with a soft center. The chips were Tim's plain potato chips.ServiceThe cashier was really cool, friendly, and was able to strike up a nice, easy conversation.OverallIf you have had a lobster roll before, I would say save your money and go to one of the other places to eat inside of Chelsea Market. It's good, but nothing super special compared to other places that serve lobster rolls. I couldn't find too many places within New York City that serve it, so if this is your only chance, I would go for it.",The Lobster Place

Not getting it done.","Eh it was solid, but not the best dumplings I ever had.  I ordered take out and they gave me the wrong veggie dim sum so that was disappointing.  Best part of the order was the BBQ pork buns.",Worst dim sum I have ever had. This place should not be allowed to serve food. And the double charged my card.,"My initial gut reaction was to give this place 4 stars. But then I thought about it more and logically, I can't reasonably give this restaurant lower than 5 stars. Here's why: SERVICE: We walked in around 1pm and the place was EMPTY. Not a good sign, but we gave it the benefit of the doubt. Good thing we did, because an empty restaurant meant we received speedy service from everyone. PRICES: All we ordered were 5 different dim sum options. However, everything was priced incredibly low for NYC. I've been to many dim sum places in Texas, and the prices are pretty much the same. FOOD QUALITY: I legit liked everything I ordered. Nothing tasted stale or old, and compared to the my hometown dim sum restaurants, I'd say the quality was on par. RESTAURANT AMBIANCE: Spacious, clean, all furniture looked fairly new, and the bathrooms were single person locked rooms and were cleanI think this restaurant probably opened not too long ago so word of mouth about it hasn't spread too much yet. I'd for sure suggest ordering dim sum here!","Came here with a group of 8 without a reservation and they were able to accommodate.

441,The food is absolutely ridic and service impeccable. One of my new favorite restaurants.,"Good, but not worth the price. The only dish I would maybe come back for is the uni. The staff are really friendly though... no complaints there. The scenery/atmosphere is cute.","Amazing dishes and service. We forgot to add the hangar steak to our Truffle Donabe when we ordered. After they brought the dish, we realized our mistake and asked if it would be possible to order it separately. The chef actually told us the hangar would take longer to cook and they would offer us the wagyu (which was pricier and would take less time) for the same price!!","Vibe is amazing and very romantic. The food is definitely phenomenal! We got the shrimp toast as an appetizer which was unexpectedly good. Crispy on the outside and the shrimp was delicious. The main dishes, the chicken and the pork dishes were AMAZING! The chicken had a nice mild spice on the outside and was perfectly cooked on the inside. It also came with steamed cabbage (I hate cabbage) but it was beyond delicious. The pork was cooked perfectly as well and had so much flavor. It also came with some bokchoy that was SO good! I would highly recommend coming here and tasting these for yourself. We will definitely be back!","First off, I loved the decor and ambience of this place. It's intimate, beautiful and classy. The first floor is the bar, second and third floor have tables to be seated at. I started off with their seasonal cocktail, ""Love a Pear"". Absolutely delicious. It tasted like juice honestly, expensive juice. HahaMy boyfriend and I went for the pre fixe dinner for 2 which really is an excellent choice. Without a question you'll definitely be full by the end of your meal. Scallop ceviche:Light and citrusy. Perfect plate to start your meal with. King crab:Got this as an a la carte. Very meaty and tender yet fresh. The wasabi is light and definitely enhances the flavors of this dish. *Both very different. I personally enjoyed them both, just depends on what you're in the mood for and texture. Mala crab:I was warned by the waiter, this was going to be really spicy. As the name suggested, I expected the numbing spice but there was really none. Super flavorful and delicious regardless! The only negative thing about it was the grease. It definitely after 2-3 pieces. Crispy tofu:Honestly felt like the curry had more of a kick than the mala crab! Loved the crispy tofu. Well executed.Braised Pork Belly:There were so many wonderful reviews about it and just had to get it! Unfortunately was overly hyped up. I'm picky about my meats. Also though the flavors were so delightful as expected, my protein was just overcooked and too dry for me. Yes dry, even though it was pork belly. Could've just been just the cut of meat that I got. :/Thai tea creme brûlée:Super rich and creamy. If you're a fan of Thai tea, surely you'll love this.Mango sticky rice:I love mango sticky rice, but this just didn't cut it for me. It was awfully sour. The purée on top was very tarts and the mango fruit was not fully ripe. Not only was the purée sour but the fruit itself was as well and crunchy. *wouldn't recommend this unless you like sour rice.There are so many other things on the menu that I'd love to try! I'll definitely come back for those and give this place another shot.","We had a very nice, enjoyable dinner here for our anniversary. Hidden gem for all types of customers. There are 3 floors: bar on the 1st (great for first dates), a few tables on 2nd and bigger space on 3rd. While there was a pretty big group on the 2nd floor celebrating something, we weren't too distracted by them as we were sat on the 3rd floor with other quieter couples and groups. We got the prefix menu for 2. First came the oysters. While my husband enjoyed them, I'm allergic to shellfish so I just sat and watched sipping on my Garden cocktail (which was nice, but not very helpful when I'm getting hangry). Then there was some time before the wagyu tartare and then more time before the truffle noodles. Both really amazing, highly recommend but I think I liked the tartare more than the noodles. The octopus added some texture to the tartare. There was a bit of a hard clump when I took a bite of the noodles but the flavor was definitely there. We then got the wagyu steak, medium rare, with cucumber salad and shishito peppers on the side. The steak came true medium rare and was AMAZING. Each bite was juicy and flavorful. Some of the shishito peppers were overcooked/burnt, not edible. Cucumber salad had a kick to it that we both enjoyed.The dessert. Omg the dessert. Mind you we're VERY full at this point and there was more wairing time which meant I'm feeling even fuller by the minute. We got the black sesame monaka and thai tea creme brulee. Our waitress told us the creme brulee was the most popular dessert. I personally LOVE monaka and icecream and really enjoyed the black sesame. They put real sesame seeds surrounding the icecream and a layer of red bean paste between the ice cream and monaka. SO. GOOD. I'd go back just for that. Thai tea was underwhelming for me just because the monaka was so good. The only reason for my 4 star is the wait time. We waited nearly 30min between the tartare and noodles; the time between each course was just too long. It seemed like our next course was being ordered after our previous dish was taken away. Otherwise, loved it.",Hortus NYC
442,"The atmosphere is great, the food wasn't that much, the service is fine but they seem a bit angry. In general I would not come again unless I wanna drink coffee or something and enjoy the place.","I walked in here on my way to class to grab a drink. It was my first time here & I ordered the Matcha bubble tea. I love me some bubble tea so I was really looking forward to it. However this was the worst I've ever had. The reasons this was so bad is because it was powdery & not properly mixed or chilled...every sip drew up little clumps of unmixed powder, which was super nasty, and Made it chalky and bitter tasting. Super gross, and cost over $6. I tried to mix it up, stirred it multiple times throughout the duration of my class, and I still never fully got rid of these powdery clumps. Plus, it was warm! I ordered it iced, but what I got was room temperature at best with a few pieces of melty ice. This was my first time at The Market, and Maybe this was just an off day...but it was so unpleasant that I had to leave this feedback.","Ordered the Sichuan sesame noodles to stay, they packaged the meal to go which I was hoping to avoid because I disliked the thought of hot liquids in plastic To-go containers. Soup was rather oily but flavorful.","I'm a little late in posting but here it goes. So after having a few tacos around the corner with friends, I was in the mood for some dessert and the closest option was a donut shop around the corner. Unfortunately, the shop was closed and donuts were no longer an option. Well, all was not lost because my friend suggested the market which was right down the street. The market is such a cool spot. It's small in size but it only gives you a feel of a french Cafe. The safe is very friendly and the options are plentiful. The pastries are so fresh and the food items are delectable. You won't find anything like it in the area. I honestly walked out of there with several treats. I really had sensory overload, everything looked so good. I'm an instant fan and I plan to return very soon.","Wow... from the appearance of this place you would think they would invest some time and effort on the quality and taste of their food but what a mistake I made. I order the Lou Rou fan which is nothing like the real deal Taiwanese which should have pork belly yet all they have is ground pork with mushroom. Even the radishes were bland for that dish. Then I ordered the sesame noodles but received some hybrid dish because it was supposed to be cold yet it was piping hot. Last dish item was the chili-oil wonton which was just some cheap wonton with literal chili oil. I must say their presentation is nice but taste wise they might be able to fool the hipsters around here but not Asians who grew up eating this stuff. As for the bubble tea, the bubbles were so hard and sweet they shouldn't even be sold... I was hoping for a gem in Brooklyn but unfortunately this was a great disappointment. Also, the music they played while eating sounded as if they were about to sacrifice something...","Public Service Announcement: Do not waste your money on bubble tea here!  It is a sad, lazy shadow of what bubble tea is supposed to be.  This is just an iced tea with boba and a splash of milk on top!  For the good stuff, you're better off going to Inital. The rest of the food is decent, if a little overpriced.",The Market
443,We came here for lunch and we all think it was a little pricey with its portion. The food was good and fresh but I didn't feel full at all even I added additional chicken.,"I've been head over heels for Galli for yeaaars now and visit almost every time I'm back on the east coast. Service is consistently good. The food is appropriately priced for the quality and location without being too over the top. Menu recommendations (in no specific order): Baby rice balls, Meatballs, Vodka, Salsiccia, Gnocchi, and the Panna Cotta. Literally everything I've tried has been good but those are the items I always come back to (specifically the Vodka pasta and the rice balls - they're my absolute favorite).",When I walked in the hostess appeared busy on her phone. Only reason I came in was the happy hour sign out front and said that but the hostess sat me at a table where there is no happy hour so I had to move to the bar that was not set up and not nice. Figured I'd rinse up but their sink was broken set to scolding. Looped me in but I escaped,"A modern, trendy take on an Italian restaurant in the heart of Soho.  There is a cute bar and the atmosphere is dark and trendy with a great modern music selection, not your average Italian restaurant.Drinks:  They have a large drink selection from cocktails, beer, and wine.Appetizers:  They bring out complimentary bread and oil which is delicious.  We split the Greek salad which was very good.  Light and crisp, really refreshing.Dinner:  They had a lot of options to choose from and I had a hard time making up my mind but went with the Bolognese from the waiters recommendation.  I am not a Bolognese person but I will say it was fabulous and not too heavy, it didn't sink me.  It was light and I barely tasted the meat.  The pasta was done so perfectly and the portions were absolutely perfect.  Everyone ate their whole dinner.Dessert:  I got the tiramisu to go and it was meh, not the greatest, but maybe something you need to order in the restaurant at the time.  I would rate this dessert a 4/10, but it looked like they did have some delicious options and I would totally give them a second chance.",Fantastically fresh food for the value! Very cute spot we stumbled upon in SoHo - was in love with the wine selection they had for their Napa Valley Cab (as a San Franciscan I can be a bit critical along this vertical). The Greek salad I had was extremely flavorful and fresh and my boyfriend was raving about the steak sandwich. He even compared it to a few others of his recent past and said it was far superior. Wasn't completely in love with the volume the music was played at nor the selection but was so happy to have such a quality glass of red and fresh salad I quickly forgot about the above. Service was great. Would recommend!,"Amazing customer service, not overpriced, delicious authentic Italian with a SoHo flair. I worked around the corner from Galli and would order for take out often and is one of my favorite happy hour spots in NY. They don't skip out on the portions for a pretty swanky spot. I usually order the chicken or steak caesar. My boyfriend loves the chicken parm and my favorite for dinner is the funghi pasta. Hands down my favorite Italian spot in NY.",Galli
444,Leaving Daly City and moving to NYC made me regret all the access I used to have with Filipino Food. I've been to quite a few filipino restaurants in Manhattan but everything is more like filipino fusion rather than traditional filipino cuisine.If you are looking for REAL filipino come here!,My favorite spot to eat when we come to NYLimited seating but the food and service is always A+,"My husband and I went here on a Friday night because we were craving for Filipino food. Worst experience ever.Atmosphere - Cramped. The whole place could probably sit less than 30 people. Interiors don't really reflect the Filipino culture. Service - VERY LOUSY. Took a while before our orders were taken. Food arrived after a while and we couldn't decide whether the it was worse than the service. Our water glasses were never refilled. Asked for soy sauce and hot sauce and it never came. Not once did the waiter approach us to ask about our food or if we needed anything else. Food - Decent but forgettable. My husband got sisig but it wasn't the best we've ever had. It was chewy more than crunchy, and it could use more seasoning. Ordered the platter with lumpiang shanghai (the saving grace of the entire meal) and pork belly, and more than half of the pork was FAT. I understand that it was a busy night and there was only one server present (What's up with that?!) but they should work out a more efficient system to get things running smoothly. After we asked for the check, the server got caught in the middle of serving dishes to another party, taking phone orders, and handing out takeout orders. Had to wait at least 20 minutes to pay for our food. The overall experience was a complete disaster. Avoid this place at all costs. This is going to be our first and last time visiting this place. Not worth the wait and the money.","Every few months my besties and I get cravings for filipino food so we are on a mission to find as many good filipino restaurants in this city. Grill 21 was on our list so we organized a meet up with the 3 of us on a Friday evening. Grill 21 opens up at 5pm sharp. The staff seats you right away. This restaurant is small. I saw this mentioned on various reviews but when you get in there you realize OH this really is small. I think there are a total of about 4 tables so if you do not want to wait for a table, be sure to get there at exactly 5pm. Though this place is small, my friends and I were comfortable. I didn't feel smushed and I had plenty of room to enjoy my meal. Our server was super sweet and helpful. My friends ordered combo dishes and I ordered the Pancit Palabok. I've been on a palabok kick recently. I did enjoy it here but I wish it had a bit more sauce. The portion was huge but that's appropriate for the $17 price. The show stopper for me were the Lumpia Shanghai Appetizer. I could have honestly eaten the whole lumpia dish by myself as a meal. I really wish I ordered the garlic rice. It was cooked to perfection here. I had to stop myself from eating all of the rice from my friends. I'll be back for more lumpia, the garlic rice and the delicious San Miguel beer.","My friend and I came here for Filipino Restaurant week. The food was good, service was very quick and reservations were strict. The specials was definitely a great deal there a lot of leftovers for the next day.  It was $35 for 2 people which included a shared appetizer, 2 entrees and a dessert.  In addition mt friend ordered pork sinigang. The pork sinigang was standard and cooked/prepared properly.  The meat fell of the bone easily and tasted very tender plus the broth had a right amount of sour flavor.  For the appetizer the lumpia Shanghai was standard, done appropriately.  The entrees we ordered were BBQ chicken with garlic rice, the chicken was good. The kare kare was also good, but I have had better.  The oxtail was very tender but the sauce was on the liquidity saide. The buko pandan was the best thing out of the dishes we had. It capped off any flaws detected from the entrees and appetizer. Would I return? Yes I would return it is pretty solid Filipino food when friends come to visit to NYC, but personally I am just so used to home cooked food so my standards for Filipino food is set very high.","I went here for a simple lunch to try something new for myself, Philippine cuisine as a solo diner around 1 pm on a Thursday.Despite being a weekday, the tables were majorly filled in this small restaurant with people of varying ages. The restaurant is very small in the first place so definitely not good for big groups, but it didn't feel that cramp when I'm sitting down or maybe because my table was not between two other tables. I ordered the Longsilog from the brunch special which has two short pieces of sweet ground pork sausage, two eggs (I asked for sunny side-up), garlic rice and a side sauce of soy-sauce mixed with vinegar. The sausages were sweet indeed but not like a candy-sweet and had quite a bit of oil. I enjoyed them more when I dipped them into the vinegar soy sauce because it mixed the flavors of sour and sweet together. The garlic rice was okay to me; the taste of the garlic wasn't that strong. It may not look like much, but it filled me up in the end which is pretty sweet for the price it costed.Service was nice but only one server for all the tables so service is on the slower side. It's nice if you want to chill in there for awhile but just go to a cafe if that's your intention. Overall : decent place for a taste of Philippine.",Grill 21
445,"Like it's name, the place is eclectic and a trip down memory lane.  The place is a tribute to the 90's and your eyes will swish back and forth to take in the details of the quirky place.  I almost felt as if I was transported back to Haight Street in San Francisco or a hipster's den.  I just needed a place to hang while waiting to catch my train.  They have cool drinks and happy hour, but the drinks are still on the pricy side.  The decor and stickers in the bathroom and at the bar area make for good distraction, but in the end the follow through just wasn't there for me.  The wine was a disappointment and the service wasn't that great.  The girl who took my order wasn't that friendly and I don't know if if she was having a bad day, but she seemed jaded and then I thought maybe another hipster sick of her job?  Honestly, it was cool for a one time stop-over, but this place isn't my cup of tea.","Fancy Nancy has a small menu, the food is boujee and expensive, and they no longer sell the tater tots in the yelp photos!",Fancy Nancy... it's more than just a name it's a food experience. Now that I got that out of the way if I had to put a rating on the food it would be a 5 star. Ratings on the service would be close to a 5 (I haven't really put them to a good test). This is a place that if I lived closer I would probably live there.. sadly I'm in the sticks(maybe a good thing cause I don't want to be an addict or do I?!) Either way check them out except for Monday's cause they currently are only closed that day. Sadly I don't have a photo to show of their food because it disappears in my stomach when it arrives,"So I was looking for a late night bite that wasn't terribly unhealthy and stumbled into here. I was planning to do a take out order and head home, but upon entering this establishment I was greeted with smiling warm faces. Usually when a business is close to closing they have that evil eye for anyone that comes in and places a order, but this staff was kind and inviting. I enjoyed the fun conversations about where is Waldo books, lol and goose berries. The entire staff was professional and attentive. The veggie burger was delicious, and accompanied by amazing garlic fries. I had a Kale salad to start and that tasted extremely fresh/tasty. All in all I was happy to be there and will definitely come back again. Seating is limited, but comfortable. Small, but very nice decorum.","Fancy Nancy was just alright. I'd go back for a drink, or the amazing garlic fries! However, the combo of the food, the service, and the hefty price tag left a bad taste in my mouth.I got the famous veggie burger, but I really didn't care for it. I don't fault them much for that (I guess I have different taste preferences than others) but it definitely wasn't worth $17!The service was also pretty bad - the waitstaff was inattentive and seemed like they'd rather be anywhere else. Overall, the vibe was cute and probably a nice place for a glass of wine, but I left pretty disappointed and it wasn't worth the cost.","Came here for brunch and it was PACKED. Once I stepped inside, I understood why. The space is small (cozy) with an awesome design. We sat at the bar while we waited for the rest of the party. The bartender was attentive and poured us the delicious seasonal mimosa. Since the restaurant was packed, some of the staff was very frantic about the waiting time. We were told multiple times that we would have to leave the bar and wait outside, then told to keep sitting, and then the cycle would repeat. The reason why it was especially frustrating was that we had cocktails that we had to keep finishing only to find out we could stay where we were - resulting in us drinking more than we would. It felt pretty silly, but hey, they were swamped so I didn't think too much into it. Also, once we sat for the meal, everything fell into place. The meal was tasty and I can't wait to come back when it's a bit more quiet.",Fancy Nancy
446,I really can't recommend the pork bone ramen as the broth wasn't as thick as I prefer and the flavor was much too salty and plain for my taste. This is the ramen that made me not like ramen until I went to Japan.So if you are going here I recommend ordering the uni mushroom dry ramen if you can handle some spice. I tried a tiny bit of my friend's and wished I had ordered that instead... Great service!,"I guess I'm getting older, as the sensation of blasting pop disco, leaves me usually quit disturbed After a ramen at jun-me, walking down 9th avenue I found myself saying out loud, ""thank God I'm out of there."" and ""I want to kill myself.""You can get away with stuff like that in New York.The 30 odd patrons that joined me in the small cramped space were all smiles, mainly in their 20s, and unphased by the blindingly white stark walls, and blaring club music. I, on the other hand, could have used a tranquilizer.I was sat at a communal table, with hardly any elbow room, damned to endure conversations about Sarah's destination wedding in the Bahamas, the fact that someone assuages Instagram as a means to be productive to the danger of less self promotion.  I could have gouged my eyes out with my chopsticks, as the music never seemed to break, having tried to enjoy my lovely bowl of ramen, with its silky soup, and fatty pork.  Noodles seemed fresh, but as I waited to go, 15 minutes for my check standing up in fight or flight mode, the use of a spray butane can by the line cooks to ""smoke"" the pork belly, seemed a little less than wonderful. I had to eventually flag one of the impossibly busy servers to pay.With 30 chairs, I know it's hard to make a profit with Chelsea rent, but the painfully loud nightclub soundtrack begs for me to run away. Atmosphere - uncomfortably crammed, unpleasantly loud, stark white modern fast food chic.Food - decent ramen at about $15 bucks a bowl, $20 after tax and tip, isn't the best value in the city.Wish - turn the music down and chill out.","Their broths are winners. The location may be small and crowded and often requires a wait, but the quality is spot on. This is a ramen broth standard that is hard to achieve in NYC.","I'm always on the lookout for good ramen in the city and this place definitely didn't disappoint. Small space, got seated right away on a Friday night luckily, it does get fairly busy. Started with the crispy chicken wings and kale greens. Both were really good. The chicken wings were fried really well, super juicy, the sauce tasted like a sweet soy glaze, hint of spicy. The kale greens were so good! One of the better kale salads I've had. The kale was shredded very fine, and the dressing paired so well with it, it was a sweet miso ginger dressing I believe. I watched them shave the cheddar on top, perfect way to top it off. I had the spicy miso ramen and my boyfriend had the spicy pork bone. Broths for both ramens were very rich. They use thin noodles here, the ramen they used for the miso ramen was slightly bigger. Both were definitely spicy as advertised, but not over bearing my spicy where you couldn't taste the flavor. My egg was was a bit over cooked, but the egg in my boyfriends ramen was soft boiled perfectly. Portions were filling enough, my boyfriend ordered his with extra noodles and it was a lot of noodles.This place is definitely on the pricier side- wings $11 for 4, kale was $12, and ramen around $17, but I would say it's definitely worth trying. Their service was also very attentive!","Small place that seats probably about 20 that serves pretty good ramen. I had the Spicy Pork Ramen and it was surprisingly delicious.Pros: On the positives, I found the soup and the pork to be absolutely delicious. The broth had all the traditional tonkotsu flavor and taste, but did not feel too fatty. The meat was tender and pretty much melted in your mouth. It was so good that I couldn't stop from drinking some of my companions soup.Cons: On the negative side, though it's a preference more than anything, the noodles were a bit too thin for me. While they were hard, I like the noodles to retain more of the flavor, which this one just didn't do. Not necessarily a bad thing, just didn't meet what I hoped for this to be a 5 star.Overall, it's a great neighborhood ramen shop and you definitely can't go wrong here.",Tiny ramen place with delicious noodles!! The prices are a bit high but you get what you pay for! The pork bone is my favorite!,Jun-Men Ramen Bar
447,das beste... can't get any closer to Germany without leaving the US.  The pretzel are directly from Germany.  Can't go wrong here.,"I came on a late Saturday afternoon just to grab a drink and snack at the bar before meeting a friend for dinner @ Shinka. I had a Wood Nymph which was a decent whiskey cocktail and a grilled eggplant appetizer. Though nicely charred, it was only seasoned with salt and I guess I was expecting more flavor-wise...I'll be back but I'll skip the grilled eggplant next time.","Katja used to be one of my favorite restaurants in New York. I'm extremely sad to say that it's just not the same as it was a couple of years ago. The spaetzle used to be melt-in-your-mouth irresistible; last time I was here a few months ago it tasted like it came out of a box. The quality of the food overall has declined. I'm not sure if it's because of the expansion or the restaurant becoming more popular, but I miss the old Katja...","This place is amazing! I visited on Wednesday evening and wasn't too busy, love the ambiance and lights, very cozy feeling. Menu is short but with good options. Food was delicious and very filling, good options and wine and beer and the staff very friendly.Overall 100% recommend to visit this place, great service, nice deco and tasty food!","Loved the good food, awesome service, and warm atmosphere here! Had a reservation for weekend dinner and were seated immediately; the space is bigger than it looks from the outside. Rundown:- Cheese board: I think only one of the cheeses turned out to be actually Austrian/German, which is a shame, but they were all extremely good. The one Eastern European cheese was liptauer, made of sheep's milk and flavoured with plenty of paprika. It was my first time trying it (it's actually a cheese spread and goes extremely well with the bread provided) and it was delicious. Other cheeses were Purple Haze, which was a goat cheese, and manchego. Again, all very good, but it would've been even more memorable had they used the opportunity to showcase cheeses from the region.- Austrian meatballs: so tender you almost think you're eating a terrine. Really enjoyed these with the very light cream sauce they come sitting in. The potatoes on the side didn't impress though - tasted more like boxed than anything (they weren't actually, just tasted bland enough to be)- Wiener schnitzel: not tough or overly greasy/heavy like poorly done schnitzels are. Won't make you feel terrible afterwards, plus the potato wedges it comes with are also great.The cocktails weren't particularly notable, but still fine. Service was really lovely though, everyone was incredibly warm and helpful without being sycophantic.","While wandering around east village looking for our next eating/drinking haunt, we spotted the most perfect table for 4 on the cutest little patio.  Without a reservation we had low expectations but were pleasantly surprised when we asked about it they said we could have it as long as we'd be eating and drinking.  It all worked out pretty perfectly.  We started with beers and a charcuterie board, which was packed with a bunch of delicious meats.  The cabbage was incredible, as was the spetzle.  Shnitzel was ok, I may have preferred another dish but was going with the flow as our group opted to share everything  we ordered.  Our server was a character and a person who appeared to be experiencing homelessness also added some color to the evening.  Would definitely return for German food!",Cafe Katja
448,"Hot happy hour with $1 clams and oysters and $4 bites. The place gets packed, but the vibe among staff at the front and bar is down, except the server.The clams served with mystery red sauces- one ketchup and the other a yucky cocktail sauce.The oysters were particularly good, but didn't care for the frosty 'tude which was rude.","We had come in a few weeks ago in a huge time pinch where I feel I gave a very harsh review. As the evening had it we had popped back into Sagaponak to give it another go. OMG, I'm so glad we had!!We started off with a dozen oysters. Very nice flavor and very fresh. Also, a couple of fried oysters made it our way and they were fantastic!Then we changed things up a bit by ordering shrimp dumplings and lobster fried ravioli. The dumplings were very unique as they had spring peas inside them! That was a first! They were delicious!Now the lobster fried ravioli. First of all, they are adorable. Now the flavors were very intense. The crust was light and airy and the filling had a nice texture.I ordered the 1 pound lobster for my entree and he ordered the half pound wagyu burger.(what I also liked a lot was that Fernando gave us time between our dishes instead of having everything thrown at us at once!) The lobster was very juicy, meaty and fresh. His burger looked amazing. But I could only steal a piece of bacon or two before he tried stabbing my hand!!Finally, I had to have Fernando take my plate away or I was going to burst. Of course, I couldn't say no to dessert though!A frozen salted caramel soufflé. I could seriously die right now! It was incredible. Absolutely incredible.Final thoughts: make a reservation and ask for Fernando. The food, nor the service will dissapoint!!",They charged more on my credit/debit card by taking max gratuity ($8+) and tips without authorization.,"This has to be my favorite happy hour spot with great tasting oysters. Their happy hour specials run daily from 4pm to 7pm which include $1 raw oysters and clams (minimum of 6), $5 select wines/beers, $9 select cocktails, and shareables ranging from $4 to $9. The Connecticut raw oysters are fresh and delicious (sweet and not sandy). I love that they come with the cocktail sauce, horseradish ice, and mignonette. The fries are amazingly crispy and hot - pesto is my favorite but they're all good and come with ketchup and a tartar sauce. The lobster ravioli is a must get every time and comes with a salsa and queso sauce. From the regular menu, I've tried the grilled oysters and fried oysters ($3.50 each and minimum 6) which were both wonderful. The paella was nothing special so I'd probably pass on that next time but it was overflowing with seafood. As for drinks, I don't think you can't go wrong with any of their options. I've had the flatiron mule, sagarita, and summer breeze sangria which were all very good.The restaurant gets packed around 6pm but I can see why with their HH menu. The only downside is that the service could be more attentive especially if you're seated upstairs with one staff member running back and forth and our water glasses could be filled more regularly. It can get extremely loud and even though there's a full house, we never felt rushed at any point. Definitely loved the atmosphere and nautical feel of the whole place.","I've wanted to try this place since it opened. It's a decent casual dinning place in the neighborhood but nothing to write home about.The Grilled Oysters were the highlight of our meal. My burger was overcooked and my friend was underwhelmed by the tacos. Maybe we didn't order the signature items, but I wouldn't come here to try it out again.","I've been here a few times before for lunch, and I decided to make a dinner reservation here for my little sister's birthday. Boy were we disappointed!Walking in to meet my sisters who already were seated, I was shocked to see that they seated them in the corner by the door. Thankfully, they were able to reseat further away from the door and bar so we could actually hear each other! With our food: oysters are always delicious, but the grilled octopus tasted so acidic-- we had to force each other to finish it! They've already changed the grilled octopus in the past to include that purple rice, but they keep on making changes I guess? There's apparently no more pesto fries with taco orders either, which isn't the worst of changes. Food aside, our server, Valeriya or Madeline (she didn't introduce herself), never checked up on us after taking our orders, until it was obvious that we were finished eating. While we were eating, we saw another table receive a birthday dessert, but we never had an opportunity to ask for my little sister to receive one as well. We tried getting the attention of other staff during that time other than our server, but to no avail. No one stopped for us before my little sister came back to the table after heading to the restroom. That sucked, especially considering we only went out for dinner because it was her birthday and I wanted to surprise her.I don't think it's worth coming here aside from a quick lunch, or a few oysters and drinks at the bar. Especially don't come here if you're trying to celebrate something! (Not sure what the upstairs seating is for still, if it's not for reservations...)",Sagaponack Bar & Grill
449,"Terrible experience.The burger tasted like the frozen kind, all watery plus it was over cooked.The waitress seemed like she was avoiding our table and it was impossible to call her attention.I don't recommend this place at all.","I should have known this place was going to be bad when I walked up and 4 men were literally carrying a guy out because he was incoherent. I decided to take a chance because I was hungry and wanted to wet my whistle with a good beer. Upon arriving we were not greeted by anyone and made our own way to a table. We sat for about 7 minutes before the waitress/bar tender came over. She was soft spoken and hard to understand because it was so loud in the bar. I ordered a Brooklyn Pilsner to try the beers of NYC and at first I thought she got it wrong because she was mumbling. She did get the right order but it took another 7 minutes just to bring it over. As for food, we ordered the sampler platter and the white horse burger. I have to admit the fried Mac and cheese is AMAZING!!!! These are a must have if you decide to step into this place after reading my review. Burger was average, chicken fingers were sauce-less, and everything else was average. The wings were the worst thing I ever ate, and I'm not just saying that because I'm from Buffalo. They didn't even look like wings and they were soooo undercooked! My husband was actually afraid he was going to get sick! We weren't able to tell our waitress because she NEVER came to check on us!!!! Terrible terrible service! Once the waitress came over, when we were ready to leave, we showed her the raw, bloody wings and she seemed disinterested and unconcerned about it. She did not offer to replace or comp any portion of our check. When we went to pay, we took our own check up to the bar because we couldn't stand to wait anymore. I would never come back.","Not what I would call ""Real Chicken Wings"". I'm from the south and ""WE""don't take breaded chicken fry them and then dip it in BBQ sauce or any other type of sauce.Thats a NO NO!!!!!!If I wanted regular fried chicken I would've went to KFC.It must be the New York way of doing wings.The wings should've been fried with out a breading and THEN drenched in a sauce.I guess if you're drunk you'll eat anything.","I went to White Horse Tavern for lunch and got the Bridge Street Burger Deluxe with Sweet Potato Fries. The burger had bacon, Swiss, mushrooms, lettuce, and tomatoes on it. Although it had standard ingredients, it was a very tasty burger. A couple minor points for improvement would be that they cooked the patty a bit more than I would have liked, the bacon was a little too crunchy, and there could have been more cheese. Also, the ketchup in the bottle was super liquidy, which was slightly concerning.When we arrived at the restaurant, we were confused because there was no one to greet us or guide us to a table. After waiting for a minute, we were told to just sit down at a table and wait for a waiter to come (he came after a few minutes). He was not the friendliest, but that was understandable given that he was the only waiter working at the restaurant. The service speed was pretty good. The interior of the restaurant has a classic dark tavern kind of ambiance.Overall, the White Horse Tavern is a solid place to come for an affordable burger (mine was $11 + $1 for the sweet potato fries). I would recommend it to anyone interested in a tavern kind of vibe in the Financial District.","The drinks were priced well, beer was cold and the food was delicious! What else can you want? The atmosphere feels like an old Irish pub, the mixture of the work crowd, a few tourists, etc on a Monday evening was great while in route to the ferry. The pastrami Ruben was delicious, the whiskey chicken sandwich was great according to my dinner mates, so good I never even got a bite.","I came here with my coworkers to say farewell to a leaving coworker! Definitely not a place to come for a quiet talk over drinks. It was super, super packed and loud! They have great deals on drinks, and their food is pretty standard. Classic bar food -- we got the sampler platter and fries! The fries were not as crisp as I would have liked -- but they came out hot!",White Horse Tavern - Financial District
450,"High quality, authentic Greek. Made reservations for my mom's birthday. Seated promptly. Everything was delish. Reminded me very much of my trip to Greece. Started off with a salad and grilled octopus. All the ingredients were high quality you could taste it, see it and feel it. I had the lamb with roasted veggies husband had a steak and my sister and mom the pastichio. All and all not just a dinner but experience. Service staff were very attentive refilling our beverages and making sure we had everything we needed.","Good service and nice interior design. I'm not an expert for Greek cuisine; food didn't wow me I can get in most of the Greek food restaurant in NYC, but the interior design do set them apart.","Food was overrated, but not bad. There were other issues, like the host trying to charge us $100 to change a reservation. What? That's ridiculous. The place isn't good enough to get away with offensive stuff like that. Only wine. Not even beer or cider and no liquor. And not even a great selection at that. Add to that mediocre service and you end up with 3 stars.","Oh. my. goodness. This place is spectacular. From the service to the food to the decor (which I did not photograph ..*face palm*)..just amazing. AmbianceIt has such a warm, cozy but intimate feel to it. I'd say perfect for dates, business meetings or just catching up with a girlfriend.ServiceI was met my the hostess outside which brought me in and seat me immediately. Unfortunately I had to wait a very long time for one of my girlfriends to come but they were really accommodating. Our waiter Anastasio (I believe his name was) was so personable. FoodEverything was so flavorful and fresh. We ordered the Afrata Keftedakia (greek meatballs) and the saganaki tou merakli (three amazing cheese melted on a small iron plater). Firstly our waiter kept recommending it and we listened to him and just wow. That was literally what we kept saying the entire time we ate it. Its THAT good. For our main course I ordered the salmon and my girlfriend ordered the lamb shank. Both were very good. The lamb shank was so tender and fell off the boneI would definitely come back!","I've been coming to Pylos for a few years now and I can confidently say they offer the best Greek food in NYC. Not only is the interior beautiful and charming, the food is ALWAYS solid.  Great for date nights, group dinners, and business meetings. I have compiled a list of recommended dished down below along with prices. Recommendations:-Greek salad $19 (Fresh feta, tomatoes, cucumbers, and capers)-Octopus $22 (Grilled to perfection served with balsamic reduction sauce)-Pork Shank $30 (Braised with lemon and herbs)-Beet Salad $14 (Simple but glorious)KEEP IN MIND*No beer or hard liqour. (Red, white, and sparkling wine available)*Street parking available right across the street.","After reading some of the reviews I promptly hopped on Opentable and snagged a last minute reservation. This little strip of 4th ave has some really excellent restaurants. Pylos was my first endeavor in elevated greek food and based on my experience here it definitely won't be my last. I struggled to choose between the Saganaki Tou Merakli  and Haloumi. The description for the saganaki won me over. How can you say no to three greek cheeses melted in a clay pot? So simple, tangy, and rich. Definitely save the fresh pita served on the house to pair with this. Although the complimentary hummus is great as well. We split the moussaka and baby lamb chops as mains which was the go to move because man, moussaka is filling. The star of the show was by far the lamb chops. The chops were so tender and meaty without that gamey after taste. While the moussaka is a comforting, filling dish, it felt like something we could make at home.For dessert, you can't go wrong with the galaktoboureko. It's crunchy, flaky, creamy, and topped with Greek mountain honey. SO good!This review is way overdue since we visited back in February. One main downside is being seated in the front during the winter. The front of the house kept swinging open the curtain which let in bitter NYC air. Aside from that, I highly recommend Pylos if you're looking for a cute new spot in the East Village.",Pylos
451,"Midtown west is the fucking pits. The people, the congestion, the people, Hudson Yards, Port Authority, all the people who chose to live in Hudson Yards, Time Scare, the people... This joint isn't the saving grace of Midtown, I am. It comes in a close 2nd, however. Why? Excellent, professional service. Arctic blast like conditions emanating from their AC unites. Great cocktails. Toilets that flush. Tasty tap water. They'll split a bill 4x, minus the look of disgust. Rodent free. Sure the good of it is the food, but everything else is a bonus, gringo. Tapas. They're all good. For real, zees. All of it, but especially anything that came from the ocean. They do it right and yes, it's gonna cost you. Unless you want to cab it or hop on a train, your ass ain't getting tapas in this hell hole of a district, Ringo. Yes, it's a district, not a neighborhood, because who the fuck would choose to live in an area where tourists outnumber the locals?","Well, I was looking forward to eating here, but, unfortunately, that didn't happen.  I walked up to the host desk, and asked how long would it be for a table for four.  It was a simple question.  Yet, from the lack of response I got, one would think that I had asked this girl to translate the Dead Sea Scrolls.  She looked down at her computer, and just stared at it for several minutes.  She didn't type a key, or touch the screen; just stared at it for several minutes.  During that time, she didn't look up, make any eye contact, or let me know what she was doing.  I stood there wondering what this girl was doing or if she was under some type of sorcerer spell. Here's free advice:  communicate to your customers and make eye contact.  It's the little things in customer service that make a big difference.","The food makes this one of my favorite restaurants! I I love it so much I bought the cookbook. I went here last April and still talk about the pulpos (octopus) served here as the best octopus we've had. This April, I went twice in the two weeks I was in NYC. The food is quality! I give it one less star because of service. The service isn't offensive but it is not attentive even while sitting at the bar. During dinner at the bar at about 9pm to 10:15pm, we struggled to grab someone's attention for minutes at a time at least 8 times to put more food order in or ask for water refills. I also had breakfast here at about 9:30am. The host saw me waiting so she came over three times to help me - get water, get a box, and get the check from the server. By no means does this make me not want to go back here. It is just a bit frustrating.","Came here before our show which was scheduled at 7:30pm. Made a reservation at 5pm. It is in the middle of tourist spots, that is Times Square and it is inside the AC Hotel. We were seated right away and that time there was a lot of empty tables but we were seated right besides two young ladies which spoke so loud in-spite  they were just across each other. We thought it's kind of odd to squeeze us close to each other knowing there were tons of empty tables. But then again we don't work in restaurant business, we just concluded , it might because of waiter availability.Food: 5/5.. We ordered total of 6 . Tapas style is a great way to explore different dishes. We must say that the 6 were all excellent! We were in awe.Pan con tomate, love the simple ness of it. Maiz Rustido, this is a must dish. The spicy ness was perfect complimenting the corn and the manchego cheese. Ensalada de Pepino.cucumbers were so fresh and it just blends with the sheep's milk cheese. Calamares, not your typical fried calamari. It is steamed or roasted and out copies with white beans and artichokes which was marinated in squid ink, yummy in my tummy! Gambas di Ajillo, just a little oily for us but the garlic was delicious and the shrimp was cooked in perfection. Pintxos Marunos-seared lamb in skewers with pickled shallots, delicious! We came out very happy and content. We can't believe that 6 dishes are all excellent!. They have a variety of Spanish wine list plus of course sangrias.Service: 5/5 ..As the night goes, it got busier but our waitress was on top of everything. She was very attentive with each table. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes good tapas. And this is perfect before going to a show.We will definitely go back when we visit this beautiful city of New York.","Great atmosphere and a fun place for a quirkier Saturday group brunch. We had 5 people and opted for the breakfast feast which comes with bottomless mimosas and sangria, 4 tapas, either 2 brunch entrees or a brunch paella, and dessert. The total before tip was about $45/person which is definitely a pretty penny, especially for people like me for whom bottomless is still just the equivalent of 1-2 drinks. That being said there was definitely a lot of food to go around. We had the patatas bravas, albondigas, escalavida, and croquetas for tapas, all of which were delicious; we were honestly stuffed after just that. The brunch paella was an interesting concept, but I honestly would've preferred the regular seafood over it. The churro sundae was a sweet cherry on top, and overall I'd definitely come back once in a while for special occasions!","Great food! Probably deserves somewhere between 4 and 5 stars, esp given it is in Times Square (most places in this area generally tend to be pretty bad given it is such a tourist trap).It's super loud inside - will have to shout to each other - but fortunately we got seated outside, where it was much quieter. They recommend 4-6 dishes for 2 people, so we got the croquettes, the corn, the fried tempura green beans, the hake, and a cheese plate. Could've done without the cheese plate (it was fine), but everything else was great, esp the croquettes and fried tempura green beans. The hake was super tender - just wish there was more of it. Also got the churros with nutella for dessert, which was pretty good.It was super easy to make reservations on opentable - they had plenty of openings even though we made reservations for same-day (got a table for 2 on a Sunday at 8 when we only made the reservation around 5).Will definitely be back!",Boqueria West 40th St
452,Ramen was good. Also I like this place and been here a couple of times. Understood why they only take cash. But this Japanese place really needs to take care of theirs roaches. I saw small roaches while eating. Called the staff and he killed the roach with his finger.... one roach means there are hundreds. Nothing to say. :(,Food was very tasty and service was great. They don't accept credit/debit cards and there are some people (like me!) who never carry a penny in our pockets but there is an ATM machine at a convenience store nearby.,CASH ONLY! Sis had to count her coins before coming into this place. The wait was only 15 minutes which wasn't bad... however we had to wait outside in the rain. They took our order outside. We were a group of 5 and planned on sharing. But because we were sharing they had a rule of having to order 5 items from the menu... which was odd. A lot of ramen places one person cannot finish a full bowl. That's why we planned on sharing our food. We were sat down in the very small dining area. Our food came out quickly and we were beyond disappointed. Our portion was so so small compared to other tables and when we asked about it they said your veg ramen comes in this size. ( we honestly think it's because we only ordered 2 ramen for 5 people ) last time we came here it was a much bigger portion to where 2 people sharing one would have lots of left overs . This time it wasn't enough food.  We asked for spice sauce she said extra charge of $2. We quickly ate and finished. Paid in cash $39.50 for 2 ramen and 3 drinks. We tipped 10% since our experience was so bad. The waitress had the audacity to run after us out of the restaurant asking for more tip. WILL NEVER COME BACK.  Portion too small Service terrible Cash only Tip thirsty waitresses.,"My girlfriend and I visited New York for the first time ever. We were overwhelmed by the massiveness of the concrete jungle, vibrant NY hustle and bustle, and multi-faceted culture. But the food was one among many things we appreciated about New York. Ramen was on the top of our list because I heard the ramen here was lit.We yelped for the closest top ramen around and found Totto Ramen. It was a few blocks from our hotel so we thought we'd give it a try. Upon arrival, we were confused by the location of the storefront. We didn't realize it was nestled below the sidewalk. The restaurant was extremely tiny, but they had someone outside to facilitate the line. He took our order ahead of time since there was a long queue of folks outside. We waited for about 45 minutes. While we waited, we observed the bowls of ramen being served to the tables. It smelled and looked so good that I couldn't wait to try it. They also had hip hop music playing, so that was enjoyable. Nevertheless, it looked crowded due to the small space, but I think that's part of the experience.When we finally got seated, we shared our table with another couple. The service was very fast and efficient. Our estimated time from sit down to leaving was about 30 min. I got the Mega Ramen for about $16. It came with char siu pork and chicken broth. The ramen was amazing - it was tasty and delicious and definitely lots of umami love ; portions are just sufficient. The prices, however, were expensive but definitely worth every penny. Keep in mind, the are CASH ONLY.I would definitely come back when I get the chance to.","The perfect spot to grab a quick ramen dish while prancing the streets of New York. Often times a line, this spot is quaint, simple and small but once you enter, you'll find out why this spot is a true gem. Cash-only with a one page menu, this place serves authentic ramen dishes. With the standard staple appetizers of edamame and tofu, each ramen dish (a total of 8-10) will range from $13-18 with plenty of delicious broth and spices. Not many vegetarian options but certainly enough to get you full if you don't eat meat. The ingredients are delicious and you'll be tempted to order seconds..Like most other ramen spots, getting a refill on your broth will only cost you a few extra bucks. The ramen chefs are super friendly and you can easily get in-and-out.","Although it was 85 degrees outside in bright summer time, I was still craving ramen so I decided to check this place out. With so many reviews on Yelp, I had higher standards, in which they failed to meet the bar. However, it was still a solid ramen place with fair prices given how full you can get from the Mega Paitan. My friend and I shared a pulled char siu pork mayo don and the Mega Paitan, which was overall very filling.The char siu don is really good, with the smoky flavor coming from the flames that they torched over the bowl. The Mega Paitan had generous amounts of char siu, pulled char siu, and pork belly. The overall bowl is a little bit on the saltier side, and the noodles are a bit softer than I expected. They say that the noodles are made al dente, but this texture is not really that al dente. Overall, this is a decent ramen place to check out, though I have had better in a lot of other places.",Totto Ramen
453,"Reasons Why This Is My Favorite Spot From Which To Get Thai Food Delivered:1. More often than not, I get pad kee mao (drunken noodles, here and at a lot of places). Thaiholic's is tops. Consistently. Beware though, I rock a medium spicy and sometimes it's too hot for my wife to eat.2. My wife rolls with pad thai, and I hate pad thai...but I hate it less here. It's actually got flavor (even the mild), and the tofu (I know, she's the worst) is plentiful and delicious.3. Every once in a while you might want a pineapple fried rice with some shrimp. The shrimp are huge, well-cooked, and there's more of them than you expect.4. The Thai dumplings (that mix of shrimp and chicken that seems ill-advised but tastes delicious) are money. Since nobody is perfect, here are the downsides as I see them:1. It's a little bit pricier than a lot of their competitors. However, I'll pay an extra dollar or two to be happier with my meal every time.2. They charge $2 for a side of peanut sauce. This is a travesty, but since I've been unable to recreate Thai delivery peanut sauce in my own kitchen (holler if you've got the recipe), I'll suffer through it.3. The papaya salad leaves a lot to be desired. Squeeze some lime over it to make it passable, or just don't order it.","Came here a few hours ago for take out. Ordered the shrimp drunken noodles and the veggie dumplings.  I won't be back here.  I told the person over the phone not spicy. My food was the spiciest dish I've ever tasted.  Overall, I would say typical for Thai food.  The veggie dumplings were good but I think it's a bit over priced","Got my food late, and its cold and I had to pay full price on food that's cold. Why is it cold?due to the delivery guy not understanding English ,had delivered to the wrong address and even when I tried to make it easier to find me, I told him to meet me on the corner. FF, the calamari was not season well and it was cold and my calamari pad thai, the calamari in my pad thai taste like rubber. Not a good look and it all tastes awful. I cannot believe I paid the full price of this.","There are actually quite a few Thai places in the neighborhood. I have tried them all, and I have to say that Thai Holic is the best, hands down. I've never actually been to the restaurant, so this review is on the delivery experience. I've ordered from here for a couple years now. The food is on point and consistently good. I've never had an incorrect up order and the quality is always very very good. Prices are great for the quantity of food you get.My personal faves are: drunken noodles, green curry, spicy basil with rice, Tom yum fried rice, chicken wings, and calamari. In fact, I've never had anything from here that was actually bad.",not sure what the fuss is about although happy to report finally properly hot thaitiny spot with some attempt at cute decor service ok did not go to bathroom area but heard from dinner-mates  area to get there very dirty big portions but preparation and seasoning lackingshared shrimp and pork dumplings tasty but super thick dough and a bit undercooked mains whitefish curry and initially salmon currysalmon bone dry and tastelessseemed like cooked from frozenwhen I tell waitress salmon not properly cooked she says that's how they make it only option is get something else ??what they can't even try and cook the salmon better so i get pad thai initially way too much sauce with strong acidic element next day flavors blended better a bit pricier than most thai drinks were weak but tasty overall would not come backnothing special even if you are in neighborhood much better Brooklyn  thai options,"I've been to this spot a few times and I have to say each time has been quite delicious. The two noodle dishes I've had here have been exceptional (Sesame noodles and Drunken noodles). I also got a glowing lychee mojito last time, glowing mainly because the base they bring it on has LED lights inside. Very attractive presentation and a delicious drink.  As I've come in later in the evening several times, service has always been fast, however I have a feeling it gets pretty packed for the usual dinner and lunch hours. Kitchen seems to have no less than 10 cooks at all times. TLDR: Best Thai spot I've been to in Brooklyn.",Thai Holic
454,"Cecconis used to be my favorite restaurant. The food is to die for but the customer service I experienced was HORRIBLE & quite frankly rude. You can also expect to be in here for 3+ hours because the servers just don't come up to your table. I've talked about this with other customers & they say the same. I called to change a reservation & was hung up on, then when I came in and had to wait 45 mins even though I had a reservation & the hostess was rude about it. We finally sat down and we waited 35 minutes for someone to approach the table. After got our food it was like the waiter became a ghost again. Expect to be in this place for 3+ hours. Make sure you say everything you need bc you will not see your server again until the check. Although we hardly saw our server he was very hasty when trying to receive our cards for payment? Confusing. I would recommend going to sugarcane next door for a better dining experience in beautiful dumbo.","Outdoor seating and the views are a plus.Some dishes are well prepared.So that sones up the good.As for the bad, Cecconi""s will try repeatedly to suck the life out of you.  To begin, you should not expect to be welcomed with anything more than subtle contempt.  Are you the first of a party of two looking to sit at your table?  It does not matter that there are over 50 tables empty and nowhere near enough reservations to fill them.  You will be dressed down and told to sit in the waiting area until everyone in your party is present and accounted for.This place is the epitome of the opposite of everything that DUMBO once was.  It survives off of the vestige of a long lost memory and it crushes and belittles that memory in the process.Despite that suffocating culture you may find yourself surrounded by posers and pretentious wannabes.  It is a mockery of a sham.  A travesty.Enjoy!",Second visit was mehHost was not friendly to everyone lining up to ask for a seat. If you don't like your job just don't do it.Be aware the happy hour was from 3-6 not 4-7 (on their website) bartender was fine at the beginning and later turned unfriendly when we continue ordered the same HH drink and didn't know it's no longer HH.Then we moved to the patio to have dinner.Steak Tartar was okay.Branzino was not as amazing as I remembered when I came the first time.Tiramisu was good.I didn't feel like the service was snobby the first time but second time totally felt it.,"I had a perfect experience at Cecconi's. Myself and 2 friends slipped in around 6:30pm and we were able to snag a table on the patio outside. I have to start by staying that Cecconi's has possibly the best view of any restaurant in NYC. You are 50 feet from the water and have sprawling views of Manhattan and the Manhattan bridge. If you sit at 7, it's the perfect timing to catch the sunset around 8:15. It was stunning. Cecconi's interior is also beautiful, and they did an amazing job with the layout and taking advantage of the space. The service was wonderful. The host was helpful and was able to accommodate our request to be outside. Our server, Adriael, was a total doll and did a great job getting us excited about the menu. He offered much appreciated suggestions and was super engaging. The timing of the food was perfect. They must really have their processes down because it's an enormous restaurant with a full house and no one missed a beat. Everything we ordered was delicious, but my favorites were the honey ricotta and bresaola and burrata pizza. The pizza was perfect, and possibly one of the best Neapolitan pizzas I've ever had. The texture of the dough was super delicious, and I loved the flavors and toppings. The hamachi crudo was great and we enjoyed the summer chop salad.Definitely put Cecconi's on your NYC restaurant hit list!","You know when you're in a situation where things are so bad that all you can do is laugh or cry... that's how it was dining here. Came here with a group of 7 for a birthday. Had reservations but still waited about 20 minutes to get seated, and this was the least worst part of the night. When we finally got seated the waiter came over to take our drinks. We wanted to put in some appetizers but he told us we had to put in our appetizers and meals at the same time so he left. It took 25 minutes for him to come back with our drinks. We finally ordered our appetizers and meals. I'm not going to lie, some of the apps were pretty good, but since my experience during this visit was horrifying I don't even remember what we ordered. The appetizers came out within 20 minutes. We wanted to order more drinks but the waiter was no where to be found. Our main entrees came out about 30 minutes after the appetizers but they came out at different times, so 2 people would get their food and then after 5-10 minutes another 2 would get their food and so on. We then finally found our waiter and ordered another round of drinks. One of the seven guests did not receive their entree at all but of course the waiter was no where to be found so we couldn't even tell him. One person from our group had their food taken away by a bus boy while he was mid-chew. They don't ask you if you are finished they just decide for you! We finally found our waiter and asked about the missing entree which was a pizza by the way, something that probably takes 10 minutes to cook and he told us it should be here any minute. After everyone was finished with their main courses and the table was cleared is when we finally received that pizza. Is this a joke? That wasn't even my favorite part of the night... When the waiter finally brought us the second round of drinks he handed my friend her drink and the glass broke from underneath and the drink went all over her. Is this real life? He didn't even know what to say, just said he would take the drink off the bill, which he didn't even do!!! I really thought we were on some weird prank show. I think what bothered me the most was that there were men dressed in suits who worked there, probably managers or some sort of important people, and they never came over to us to apologize or anything. By the way the food came out cold and it wasn't even good... but is that the most important part after an experience like this? DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!","I appreciate a place with a ambiance that this establishment has. Very low key and chill. Upscale for sure. Some of the most likable art I have seen in a restaurant! Everything was delicious! The salmon, lobster spaghetti , prime rib all delicious! Service as phenomenal! Outdoor view of the Brooklyn bridge is awesome too. Can't wait to return!",Cecconi's Dumbo
455,"While visiting NYC 28 June - 7 July 19, we came in and had dinner at The Greek Kitchen.   The Greek Kitchen was a 5 minute walk from our hotel (Fairfield Inn Central Park).   I am not a professional in Greek food but I found the food here to very good.   The day we ate here was probably the hottest day in NYC during our week vacation.  Unfortunately, the day we ate there the air conditioner was broken and it was miserably hot in the restaurant.  The work staff acted like true professionals even having to work in the unbearably hot restaurant.  I will not let a broken air conditioner stop me from coming back.  I will return to The Greek Kitchen on my next trip backto NYC.",Service was good.For the first in my 1 year stay in new york I eat such terrible tasting food. I ordered mixed grills and they were all bad.I had terrible cramps the night of the visit.Will not go back again,"The hospital staff suggested I get food here. My wife got the shrimp Greek salad and she said it was good, but on the basic Hummus appetizer - it was so lackluster I was very disappointed that it came from a fancy restaurant. It was the quality of a low-grade supermarket hummus from a can. I got lentil soup and the chicken kabob, both of which were average at best. I normally wouldn't go thru the trouble of posting a 2-star review but that hummus plate was probably the worst hummus plate I've had ever. And from a pretty fancy restaurant given the immediate options on the block.","Came here with a friend for a late lunch around 1:30pm on a Saturday, and it was pretty empty. The venue is pretty big so there is plenty of seating. Be aware how loud your voice is in this restaurant though. We ended up having to whisper during our conversation bc everyone just looked at us when we were having a normal conversation as if we were disturbing people in the restaurant. You could have heard a pin drop. Onto the food, we both got the gyro platter and an order of the zucchini chips. The zucchini chips wasn't what I expected. They were very thinly cut and fried. Really good, but a tad too much oil as you could see it on the your hand when you were eating it. The gyro platter was huge, we weren't able to finish it. The fries were a bit too salty though. Overall, the food was good, and reasonably priced for what you get.","Service and the food both were nice although the waiter tried to convince me that my undercooked (almost raw) bifteki (meatballs) were the way they were supposed to be and that it is the ""type"" of the meat when the meatball was completely pink inside. When they brought it back, it was the bomb. Side fries are perfectly seasoned. Couldn't have enough.I would only go back for the meatballs if I passed by the restaurant and hungry.","Everything--repeat *everything*--I've ever had here has been knock-your-socks-off delicious. Every friend or out of town guest I've ever taken here has thanked me for suggesting we go here. Aside from the amazing food, it's also got a cool layout... if dining alone, the people-watching from the glass-enclosed outer dining area is first-rate.Pro tip: get the roasted potatoes as your side. You won't be sorry.If I have one small critique--well-overridden by every other aspect of the experience--it does take a bit too long to get the check, sitting over empty plates and empty glasses. But if you can spare that extra thirty minutes or so... it remains utterly, deliciously worth it!",The Greek Kitchen
456,"So .... the food was good, service wasmediocre, acoustics was horrible ...  if you are looking to avoid a difficult conversation with yourdinner companions, this is the place for you !!!","I'm slightly confused on how this place has so many stars. We came in slightly early and were seated right away which was nice. The place is very loud, my ears definitely hurt afterwards and to talk you have to yell. We were recommended to get the steak on the specials menu for 30$. We got it and were very disappointed. We asked for medium rare and it came medium. The sauce was not good and the tequila flavor was not cooked in. The meet was a large price but still not good when cooked poorly. We also got the pork belly appetizer and it was straight fat, not a piece of meat on it. The rice underneath with chorizo was good but that was the only thing. I got the seafood paella and it was not good. The rice was watery and it only came with two shrimps for 25$. Overall a huge hit. They did honor the complementary soda with the yelp checkin though.",The service is horrible. I waited 45 for a sandwich. It wasnt authentic food. I asked for a soda to get the taste out of my mouth and it was flat.,"Went here on a Saturday date night. Cuban Live music is played from 7:30-11ish. Nice ambiance. Tables are close to each other. My date and I had appetizers and drinks. Mango martini is yummy and they garnish it with a sugar cane slice. Date has covassie or however that's spelled. We ate the shrimp, which has a nice garlic taste. Also had the empanadas which comes in 2. You decide toMix and match which I did. Chicken and spinach/cheese. The spinach was by far the best. We skipped dessert however the coconut flan at another table looked very yummy.","This place was pretty good honestly  what you can expect from any restrusrent on this part of the city. The server was pretty nice, always asking us if we were okay and filling out waters lol I ordered the Cuban steak sandwich. It was pretty good, the steak wasn't cooked to order so that's something to keep in mind if you want yours prepared a certain way. It wasn't oh my gosh amazing but it wasn't bad. I'm not sure if they have any drink specials because we weren't shown or offered any. It is a small and quaint spot. Definitely a cute little get away in that section of Manhattan.","Went there with my best friend for brunch. I had a mimosa, two potato balls, and a chicken wrap with a side of plantain chips. One thing that is VERY important from a customer point of view is presentation. The presentation of dishes were outstanding, you can tell they really take pride in their cooking and not just throw things on a plate and serve it. I HIGHLY recommend this place if you are into spanish cuisine!",Cuba Restaurant and Rum Bar
457,Decent but not great. Mashed potatoes were good. Mac and cheese wasn't my favorite. Ribs were disappointing. Not enough meat and overdone. My little boy likes his chicken fingers. My wife got the pork sandwich and was not impressed with it.Lots of space those and good air conditioner.,"Got take out from this place for the first time, got the sampler app and a bbq sandwich. See the attached picture to see what it looked like when i took it out. First of all why would u put the hard boiled eggs with the shrimp and throw it in so carelessly. Eggs and shrimp DONT GO, Trust me I've tried it.... and the shrimp still had the shell on so i had to peel the eggy ass shell off and then bite into a flavorless shrimp because all the seasoning was on the shell which i peeled off? Makes no sense. I would have brought my whole order back if i wasn't so STARVING. Sandwich was good tho.","First impression: can I sit in the booth? NoSubsequently seated at a table that held more guests... hostess was a pale dark haired girl with a bad attitude.Food was drier than your grandma and the cornbread should require a license, as it could've choked someone.PASS ON THIS PLACE!","Was happy to finally try this place out.Very extensive menu and combo options. We got the Sweetheart for 2 with a rack of ribs and 4 sides. Ribs were very tender, minus the charred ends. Fried rice was surprisingly good, as was the salad. Beans and potato salad were tasty-- personally would not recommend the mac & cheese which was a bit disappointing.Service was polite, restaurant is large and spacious. Wouldn't mind checking out again sometime.","My boyfriend and I ordered the Sweetheart Meal for 2 and it was just the right amount of food for two people. We came hungry and left stuffed.The meal comes with ribs and 4 sides. We chose the mashed potato, fried rice, corn and Mac & cheese.  The mashed potato was creamy and not too salty, fried rice was good and flavorful and the corn had the right amount of spice and wasn't too dry. The Mac and cheese was kind of odd though- it had a gooey texture and wasn't that cheesy. Wish we ordered a different side. The corn bread that came with the meal was alright, I've had better! It didn't really taste like anything.The star of the meal ...the ribs were.... AMAZING. So tender and flavorful - the meat came clean off the bones. The rub/sauce on the ribs was sweet and savory. I haven't had ribs that good in a long time! I highly recommend the ribs!!","I heard about Dinosaur BBQ from a friend and when I realized it was a few blocks from our hotel I had to check it out. The pictures online were mouthwatering.I had the 3 Combo 1/4 White Meat Chicken was flavorful but dry, 1/4 Rack of Ribs tender and was good with dry rub, Brisket good with original bbq sauce I prefer moist, but still good, Potato Salad was close to home, but was diced finely and heavy on pepper, wouldn't be so bad but also it had onion and they finished it with cajun seasoning as well so it packed a punch. It was good, just ask for no cajun seasoning  and add salt. The Mac and Cheese was creamy, noodles aldente and had a little kick to it as well. The corn bread was hard and dry, not worth the carbs.Honey had The Ribs, bbq wings, Collard Greens and Mac and Cheese. The greens were good, heavy on vinegar they have chopped carrots in them as well. Overall nice environment. Spacious, has a private room and outside seating. It's pricey, but the portions are good. Spent $42 on 2 meals.",Dinosaur Bar-B-Que
458,"For all of its hype, I thought Hanoi House was just ""decent."" The food is tasty, albeit nowhere near the best pho I've ever had and the portions are kind of small (the plate of crispy spring rolls were gone in a few bites). The bone marrow add-on barely comes with any marrow - so I would skip on that. The worst part was the vibe though - it was SO loud for a Saturday dinner. You had to shout in order to talk to your dining companion, so given the food itself was just a 3.5-4 out of 5, I probably wouldn't return/recommend it to friends.","Was very disturbed that they do not serve pho with a side of lime or basil, claiming this is the ""northern vietnamese"" way of having pho. I'm vietnamese and have never heard of this. It's like having a hamburger and saying, oh, no we don't serve it with ketchup or mustard. It's unheard of and I think it's because they are really scrimping on the Thai basil, which can be pricey and hard to offer consistently in restaurants. Anyways, this one complete disregard for something so basic made me question the entire menu. The food was not the worst but not the best either","Shaking beef:- decent portion and tasty. Everything Pho:- it's okay for ""Hanoi"" style. Just a beefy broth pho. I like the condiments for it. - the fried cruller is a nice touch but I'm Chinese so that comes with congee too. Nothing new. Hanoi pho:- same as above minus cruller. Meh.Spicy Octopus:- umm overpriced for the small portion. Nothing special. Wouldn't pay $19 again. ‍Spring rolls:- standard. Meh.Pig ear and papaya salad:- good crunch. A must order. Most ludicrously priced item goes to a soda order for $3.50 each. Unless it's spiked with a sprinkle of cocaine, ya lost your mind on this one. ‍Worth a repeat trip? Simply no. Overpriced for the okay food. At the end of the day, it's the broth that makes a pho and not the frills ie bone marrow. Suckers paying for their rent space rather than better quality.","Hostess was amazing as with the servers. Food was great.Papaya Salad with Pig's Ear was close to perfection. I added chili Thai pepper for extra oomph.My house special Pho is amazing. The broth taste exactly what they're advertised at 16 hours. I can say the richness, authentic and aroma of the broth is far superior than normal one I had. My wife's Bun Rieu(Crabmeat Soup). This bowl of noodle is beyond I can imagine. I have had so many bun rieu and this surpass anything I've had. It's as authentic crabmeat soup as you can get beside my own cooking. Banh Mi baguette is good as well. The pickled daikon and carrot was good. You add in pickle garlic for a strong aroma and punch as they're spicy. House made shrimp paste is lovey and pungent as well as their smoked sambal oelek is, honestly, better than Huy Fong. The smokiness made that sauce. Overall I would come back.","Okay, let's be real. There are just some types of food that can't be ""elevated"" This holds true to a lot of Asian Cuisine. Throw a bone marrow in the soup or add uni to anything and boom, ""fine-dining"" asian cuisine. Lucky for them, bone marrow and uni are the key to my heart.The restaurant is pretty lit and was super packed on a weekday night. It's a tad to dim for my liking but the vibes are there with a super esthetic indoor ambiance. We started with the papaya and pig ear salad. I usually don't eat super azn things, but I love love love crispy pig ears for some reason. I would highly recommend this as a starter. The sweet soy sauce dressing was perfect on the and the pig ears fried perfectly. Our first main was the shaking beef - Charred filet mignon, roasted bone marrow, watercress salad, steamed rice. I read the menu too quickly and didn't notice that the shaking beef included a bone marrow, so I was pleasantly surprised. The rich bone marrow with each bite of the filet mignon was heavenly. It was a huge bone too so it was enough to eat with each bite. We ordered one order of the pho and waiter was nice enough to split it into two bowls with a mini bone marrow in each one. The broth was extremely flavorful and you could really taste the quality. I would recommend adding the crispy breadstick to eat with your pho. It's kind of like azn donut. I get really skeptical about bougie azn food, but Hanoi House really delivers. Don't be scared if the restaurant is mostly white people.","Just ok. Went there with several friends after craving Vietnamese food food a while.Had better pho, the fish dish wasn't very fresh. Will not come back again",Hanoi House
459,"Highly rated on yelp so I wanted to try. Came on a Sunday night and it wasn't packed at all. First thing off the bat is the aesthetics. The sign to wallpaper to lighting. Definitely an Ig worthy restaurant. Food doesn't live up to the hype. We were told they ran out of their fish which was disappointing. We started with devil eggs. It was the saltiest devil eggs I've ever had. You can taste the copious amount of fish sauce they put into the filling. The chicken wings were actually quite tasty. Might be top 10 in my books. The dipping sauce paired with it had a nice kick. We got the curry laksa and beef rendang. The laksa came with 2 prawns, half a soft boil egg, cucumbers and rice noodle in curry broth. It was close to $20. Disappointing! Lacked flavor and nothing in the bowl. The beef rendang looks and taste like something that came out of an Instapot. Yes the beef was super tender but it's something I make at home and charge myself $20 for. I left hungry and wallet wanting a refund. Been looking for authentic Indonesian food here and have yet to find one.","Went here for double date dinner and ordered a round of drinks to start which were fun and tasty, but the food was disappointing. We had the wings to start, followed by the pumpkin curry, beef, and fish dishes. Each plate came out extremely delayed; we waited ~ 20-min between each dish, which made it difficult to eat or share. The portions are very small so that doesn't help for group sharing either. The bathroom was also awkwardly situated in the middle of dining tables. Overall, the interior design was vibey but food was not worth the $","This place does not represent the real Indo taste. I tried the otak otak, nasi goreng, and fried chicken. The otak otak did not come with the right sauce. The nasi goreng taste is decent but the additional tempes were really bad. It was bitter af. And the fried chicken is a knock off of Popeyes. If you want some Indo food, this is not the place to go. I also let my 2 dogs eat some leftovers earlier today. It just so happened I have a leftover of Popeyes. I held them side by side to each dog two times. They both chose the Popeyes. Idk what else to say...","Food is okay. But it's so stinkin' cute in there!Neon lights, leafy walls, cute plates- I mean, it's so perfect for friendly dinners.We had the pumpkin curry and laksa. I must say, the laksa was far from authentic (I'm used to the laksa's from the hole-in-the-wall Indonesian places in Queens) but the presentation was great and was still quite flavorful.y favorite appetizer was the shrimp and corn fritter- juicy with a slightly crispy exterior.Service was wonderful too.","This place has cute ambiance, trendy aesthetic and a wine/beer bar. The food doesn't really taste authentically Indonesian but fits the asian fusion bill, in terms of flavor. I was the only asian person in the whole place (customer / server) --  just an interesting observation. My friend and I split the nasi goreng & the coconut greens. We got hot sauce on the side (tomato sambal) to add a bit extra flavor to the rice. Which wasn't that distinguished flavor wise as other nasi gorengs I have had. Not bad taste wise just different. Also the coconut greens were sauteed kale, my best friend from Jakarta who still lives there always says she can't eat healthy like the American food bloggers bc there is no kale in Indo lol.This is a cute neighborhood spot if you're around seeking curries, rice and other asian food. But for the authentic stuff Elmhurst is your best bet!!!",It's really a cute place and the food is quite tasty! My favorite dishes of the night are the sautéed greens and fried chicken wings!Grilled fish wrapped in banana leaves was good too but the portion is kinda small.I'm not sure if this is an authentic Indonesian restaurant but the flavor was definitely good! Glad I came even it was a rainy day,Selamat Pagi
460,Came here with my bf cause he recommended this place. Tried the sandwich he liked and at first it doesn't look like much but it was filling. At the end I couldn't finish it. The price was decent for the area.,"2nd time here in a long time.  Falafel sandwich is good, but restaurant needs cleaning.  Menu is sticky, tables are sticky.  Need deep cleaning.","I've eaten at both the Tribeca and Financial District (John St) locations, and I can unequivocally say that Nish Nush has mastered falafel. Their Reade Street address in particular sees the most traffic, and frequently generates long lines during busier times.One of the reasons Nish Nush garners so much praise - and this is rare in Manhattan - is that for $7/$8, customers receive a generous portion of food. To clarify, I'm only considering their standard falafel sandwiches; many of the other items, like salads and platters, are at a higher price point, albeit still a great value.I prefer my falafel spicy, so the red hot chili sandwich is a no-brainer. The same sandwich without heat is available as well, featuring classic falafel. The red hot chili (roasted red pepper) variety isn't unbearably spicy, but it does have a kick to it. In addition to the falafel, the sandwiches include hummus, lettuce, Israeli salad, and pickles. In fact, they're so stuffed that it can be a challenge to eat the entire pita as intended. Personally, this isn't of much importance to me, since it doesn't affect the taste. But just as a heads-up for those looking to avoid a mess at all costs: a platter might be more suitable.I don't find myself in Tribeca or the Financial District very often, but when I am, stopping at Nish Nush is a must.","This place is great- I came in on a slow weekend and the space is great if for grabbing something solo or with one or two friends. Not fancy, but not purely fast casual. The falafel is also AMAZING. Israeli salad had great taste and was very fresh. Tahini was pleasant and not too bitter (which is often my complaint). Really reasonable place for a quick lunch- especially in the neighborhood which isn't exactly the best for lunch options. Thanks Nish Nush!!!",Seriously one of the best falafels I've ever had! I work in the neighborhood and come here often for lunch and never had a bad experience yet. The food is very flavorful and delicious. The falafel comes in 3 flavors and are some of the best I've ever had. The portion size is quite big and the platter can definitely be shared between two people.

461,Here again for a birthday dinner. The views are still killer and watching the city light up over a good meal is stunning.  The place gets 3 stars just for the view.  The food this time was not spectacular but good.Started with Whiskey and lime cocktail - yumRose- greatPork belly- ok.  The flavors worked well together but the pork belly alone was just ok.  Also this is served room temperature.Octopus - yummy and filling!  A winnerHalibut - pairing with beans wasn't great but the fish is deliciousLobster- this dish did not look beautiful or inviting in any way.  I was disappointed with that. In terms of taste it was good.Cake-delicious ( the one at the top of the menu)Cheesecake- deconstructed yum!They also give you chocolates with the bill which are tasty and you can ask for them to go.,"Other than the view I'll happily pass. I've been here twice now. The faux pretense is annoying as hell!  The food is nothing to rave about or even write home about.  Major, major disappointment. Other patron suggested that perhaps a new chef was in order. However, I'd say the whole entire experience is fake as hell!$30 for a bloody burger and nothing else - go play in traffic Manhatta - well shit you forgot the truffles. Not worth it!  Nothing like Gramercy Tarven!",,"I visited Manhatta on a Thursday night for drinks and dinner with three of my girlfriends. I made the reservation only a couple of days before and was lucky to have a slot open at 8pm. The same day I even called to add another person to the reservation and they were very nice and accommodating. Three of us showed up earlier to have drinks and watch the sunset in the lounge. The drinks were great and so was the service. Their view from 60th floor is also to die for!In terms of food they only seemed to only offer a 3-course prix fix menu which I thought was optional. The food was, however, very well made and tasty. A sommelier helped us pick our wine and we were overall very satisfied with the entire night.One change I would like to see is to be offered a 2-course meal. By the time we got to desserts we were all stuffed but ate them because they were paid for already. It left us with a very heavy and unpleasant feeling afterwards that I wish I could have avoided.",If stopped at Reuben would have given 5 stars as enjoyed food at special event here and Reuben at bar.  Place is borderline between 4 and 5. The raved about date cake is no longer on the menu which also loses stars as why get rid of popular dessert.  The fried chicken sauce was good but chicken itself was a bit small and dry. The draft list is limited as only a few options.  Do have larger by bottle and can including Budweiser.  Place is not cheap as other then bud cheapest option is 8.  Cocktails are 18 or 19.  Prices include tip so subtract 2 dollars. Manhattan popular enough that they make it bulk.  Got the governors smith which is a cross between a mule and mint julep. They are environmental as have metal straws.Views are amazing and place pulls in the finance types so if come in jeans and T-shirt you will feel underdressed .  Prices include tip as not an option to add once get bills. Service from Jess deserved a good tip.  Will be back if in area and actually recommended space to someone else for a corporate special event.,"Omg! This restaurant was Everything!!!!

462,"I wish I could give a zero star. Went with boyfriend for anniversary and he felt violently ill after we got home. Vomiting throughout the night. I saw some other comments mentioning the food poisoning. Don't take it the wrong way-we are not fragile by any means, we survived different kinds of street food. I'm calling the NYC inspection to report them first thing tomorrow. Worst $500 spent!",Loved it. The tasting menu is worth trying. It is a lot of food but you do understand why it is a Michelin starred restaurant after trying it. The banana desert is unearthly,"We just left the restaurant and we were the last customer when we left because my boyfriend went to the restroom three times after had the chicken which probably didn't cook through or fresh. He started vomiting after we get home.Avoid this place or at least the chicken at all cost. Attached is the dish which made my boyfriend vomited... stay away from it!!!It is 5:17 in the morning, my boyfriend just vomited again, if the restaurant manager ever seen this review, you should found out what went wrong.","TLDR: Modern Korean cuisine in a beautiful TriBeCa space. Look past the price tag, you will be dazzled, wowed and remembering this meal for days. Probably one of the best high-end meals I've ever eaten.We decided to give Jungsik a try instead of the omakase that we usually do on birthdays, etc. I wasn't sure what to expect but looking back now - this is one of the greatest meals I've ever had.The tables are very generous and they don't seem to be too uptight in terms of a dress code which is refreshing. We opted for the full tasting menu at $235 pp which comes with a lot of food.I won't dive into each course but I'll run through the favs.Foie Gras Mandoo - This was bone broth with the foie gras dumpling and slices of raw beef. The broth was so satisfying and how can you go wrong with a dumpling stuffed with foie gras.Octopus - I'm not sure how they do this. The way it's fried it almost tastes like it's dusted with something, it's perfectly crispy on the outside and so moist inside. The aioli it's paired with reminds me of a spicy mayo but with real heat. I was slicing this up in super thin slices because I didn't want this to end.Tuna Kimbap - If you're familiar with kimbap, this will not resemble anything you've ever had before. The roasted seaweed retains the perfect crispiness, the tuna is deliciously fatty.. it's one of those things that make your face glow after each bite. They've taken such a common snack food and have elevated it to this level that's just amazing.Also, because it was my birthday; I was also served a traditional Korean birthday soup. This is usually a seaweed soup creation but they modernized it for my meal. It was served in an almost risotto'd up version. Delicious.Other than the tasting menu itself, the desserts here are something else. You get a taste of their signature dessert with the menu, the Baby Banana. Step aside Edible Arrangements! This ""banana"" is made from a white chocolate shell that is hand painted. The entire ""fruit"" is edible and it's just incredible to see this yourself. It tastes so good though, especially along with that coffee ice cream.We did come back another time to try their other menu. Yes, the dessert is that good that they have an entire tasting dedicated to it. It's on the pricey side at $75 but I'll say it's some of the best desserts I've ever eaten.Every part of your experience will be great. From when you walk in, the extremely attentive staff and the nonstop carpet bombing of gastronomical delights. So to answer that common question - is it worth it? Abso-eff'n-lutely. Go!","I am glad that I can find this Michelin restaurant. The starter amazed me, especially the salty moose which has salty and slight sweet taste and the same time. In addition, I also loved the steamed truffle egg.The caviar came with raw fish dices and crispy crunches which compliment the soft feeling of caviar.The foie gras dumplings were creative. They were hidden under wagyu beef and soaked in beef broth. The beef broth made me feel really comfortable and the dumplings filled with foie gras tasted juicy.Normally Octopus dishes are chewy, but this place's octopus was extremely soft, but the skin was very crispy. The Korean spicy sauce provided a strong taste to the Octopus leg. Nice!Branzino came with traditional wild sesame oil which was very strong and oily. I loved the taste of it! Black cod dish came on Chive sauce. The chive sauce provided a special taste to the tender cod meat.The tuna roll was my favorite. The saltiness was proper. The crispy seaweed wrapped the red tuna which mixed with a truffle taste.Main course Galbi used wagyu beef. It had a traditional sweet flavor and the beef itself was decent.As for the desserts, summer cocktail was fair enough. The banana cake tricked me. It looked like a real banana, but it was actually a banana flavor ice-cream with crispy chocolate shell. As for the sorbet one, I loved the fermented tea smell and enjoyed the sweetness. Our server was confident, knowledgeable, humorous and explained everything very well. He was the best.This place really shocked me. It was completely more than my expectation.","The quality, the creativeness, the service, the ambience, the details - everything was just wow.  I had a chance to try the signature tasting menu at Jungsik, and I the experience was beyond spectacular. Jungsik offers Korean style with westernized twist to their cuisine. It appeared to me that Jungsik has the Korean traditional culture and ideology as their background but goes above and beyond in creating their signature dishes. The banchan, the dumpling soup, kim-bab, the galbi, - all the foods that were presented to me in Jungsik broke the frame of what I used to know. The banchan that jungsik offeres were pieces of arts and joy. The dumpling soup at Jungsik wasn't the dumpling that I used to eat at my grandmother's house; yet was the heartiest soup filled with creativity. Words cannot describe how amazing the foods tasted and even harder to describe how amazing the experience was. It",Jungsik
463,"If you like beer and are in the New York City area you need to stop into TORST.  I'd describe TORST as a minimilist bar.  They have 21 beers on tap and a seemingly endless bottle list (note: 20% off bottles to go). The beers are numbered and generally start lighter and end with mostly BBA (bourbon barrel aged) stouts. Highlights:Burger (dry aged) may look like a big mac but the taste, much better.Amazing staff, knowledgable, attentive and kind.Clean setting.","Talk about a bougie hot dog, yummmm. But seriously, there are always unique craft brews to try and I leave very pleased",I think someone accidentally dropped vinegar on my burger...or the whole kitchen sink! You know the burger patty was quality just masked by all those overly salty condiments.Overpriced beer in wine glasses.   Loud music.  I hate you.,"This is where good food lives now-a -days: in unassuming, middle of the road priced, craft establishments. Not fancy, not grungy, Torst is a blend of Scandinavian minimalism and Brooklyn craft beer culture. Phenomenal beer selection complemented by a small but well-designed menu that is perfectly executed on. Great burger and even better fried chicken sandwich. Forgo $25 burgers/entrees in Manhattan and check out the middle of the road in Brooklyn - where I'm finding the quality of food to be consistently higher and with more value.","Tørst has piqued my interest for months now, and I was finally able to remove it from my bookmarks last night. When we approached the entrance, we saw that it's been Michelin rated for the past 4 years (2013-2017). We were excited to see what the fuss was all about. Tørst makes you feel like you are sitting inside a cabin. The interior is decorated primarily with wood. They have some picnic-style benches on one side and some tiny cocktail tables as well. They have a limited food menu and what seems like an unlimited drink menu. Their beer selection spans across maybe 7 different pages, and they also have a small section dedicated to draft cocktails. They don't have a waitstaff so everything must be ordered at the bar. Their food selection is somewhat tapas style. The portions aren't huge. We ordered the sourdough starter and the sweet potato and chorizo fritters. The sourdough bread was mostly burned, but the butter spread that they give you is so amazing that we were willing to look past it. The fritters were 90% sweet potato and 10% chorizo. A little bland, but the sauce that they give you helps with some more flavor. The beer is served in wine glasses that have these cute minimalist tree drawings on the outside. They kind of have an Old Word vibe to them. I tried the Stands To Reason first which was good but I didn't care too much for the smokey flavor. The Scurry was much better! It had an aftertaste of honey and molasses which was perfect on a chilly evening. The service was good. I didn't have any trouble getting my orders in and the bartenders were nice. Overall, my experience wasn't on the Michelin level I was led to expect but I would return if I'm in the area. 4.5 rounded down to a 4.","Best food, service, food in Brooklyn. Boyfriend's favorite.Nice selection of beers. You will never be disappointed.Bartenders have good knowledge of the beers they carry.",TØRST
464,Absolutely disappointed the wife and I at our last visit. We were coming out from manhattan and really looking forward to an evening there after several good experiences.  I will say the place has excellent drinks and awesome oysters.We were seated behind the bar at the oyster station and after no one checked in on us we asked a server passing by for some help.  After some time passed I ultimately had to snag the hostess as she was bringing others to the rear.  Round two on the drinks I had to snag the hostess again.  We moved to the main bar but by that time the evening was ruined.  Never going back.,"Very good food, we have been here a lot of times. The past few we've had issues with the time it took servers to get our drinks and orders as well as the orders coming out. Last time we waited for 2 cocktails for 28 minutes. Their garden is infested with caterpillars so I don't recommend sitting outside if you have issues with them falling on you/your drink or food.","Came here yesterday for 4th of July. I think this place has a great atmosphere, cute decor, and the live jazz music was amazing. However, service was horrible. We wanted to get some oysters and seafood but our waitress ignored us every time we tried to call her. She paid attention to every other table except ours. The table next to us were constantly served and asked if everything's okay, and she never even asked us that. It took them 30 min to bring us 2 glasses of wine and 1 cocktail. I asked the hostess and our waitress why this was and they both said that it was the bar's fault. They switched out our waitress and our new waitress didn't pay any attention to us either. We ended up leaving after paying for drinks and no one in the restaurant seemed to care about our  experience.","My favorite place for great oysters. Great selection of oysters to choose from too.They make a good drink as well Love the old style ambiance. A little pricey for a group, great for two.","Great cocktails, pretty good food too if you really order right, and the place is gorgeously transporting -- that's what this team does best. Experiences vary wildly. Had a glorious dinner (with a reservation) in their verdant backyard garden. Succulent absinthe-based cocktails. Solid food. Oysters are your best best here. Like Sauvage, you are really coming here for the experience and the mixology -- not the cooking.Another afternoon, stumbled in off the street, last minute decision, and they were just lovely about giving us a table, and the drinks were good, and the service was attentive. We had a great time.Front of House continually seems confused in terms of several things: knowledge, training, and tone. Occasionally they are unfriendly, but competent. Other times, they are as sweet as can be, and yet have no idea how to seat a human being in their restaurant. It is honestly baffling.At a recent brunch, we were told there would be a 20 minute wait for a table. OK. We waited. It was more than 20 minutes. Eventually, we were seated -- but at the bar (which I don't like and didn't want). And without food menus. And we were famished. So I called over the hostess.""I'm not sure if we're still doing food?"" she looked around helplessly.*so why did we wait 20 minutes?* ""We are doing food,"" someone else who worked there said.""We aren't,"" another server said.Trying to be patient: ""Yes. Okay. But. We're hungry. And we want a table,"" I told them.""A table? Let me get that for you."" She searched in vain for a table.""We're still serving food,"" a host said to us, reassuringly.""We aren't actually,"" another hostess said.yeah, so we left.","Came here Monday for happy hourJust wait a couple minute for them to clean up the tables. We got garden seats. It's very cute but serious not too comfortable tho. 2 of us decide to get 2 fozen and that include everything for one from happy hour. Everything is amazing. I like discovery bay the most. It had stronger taste than others. So after a dozen oyster, we decide to go for another half dozen.Amazing place for fresh oyster!",Maison Premiere
465,"It pains me to write this as they used to have the best food in the world. Seriously. Now? Watered down cocktails. Terrible food (rubbery pasta). Sauce with no flavor and tasting like it comes out of a can. Disgusting olive oil cake. Who in their right mind wants cake with olive oil squirted all over it? It did not taste good at all. Also, the loud 60's and 70's rock that you can hear throughout the restaurant does not create a romantic environment. We both wanted to cry when we saw what Babbo has become. It sounds like Mario did some terrible things before but he did have a fantastic  restaurant at the time. Those days are gone.Please try elsewhere.","Babbo was my wife's choice for her birthday dinner.  We always sit at the bar when we dine at Babbo, but the bar was packed on May 25, 2019.  We had reservations mind you, but the young woman at the front assigning tables gave us the ""worst seat in the house,"" a forlorn two top next to the kitchen, under the stairs.I always have issues with the kewpie dolls Babbo hires to assign tables.  They must be the daughters of the managing partners, because they have no idea what they are doing, and everyone else seems so damn professional.  We are admittedly an older couple who would not look impressive to a 20 year old girl, whose values are based on listening to Maroon 5 and watching Zombie films.  Even our server felt compassion, knowing this table was meant for desperate walk ins.  After slipping some cash to a few people, they found us seating at the bar, but my wife's birthday was ruined.  The experience tarnished Babbo forever, and we will never return.  There are lots of great Italian restaurants in New York.  Babbo was just one of them.  C'est la vie.","This is a Mario Battalli (sp) restaurant, which made it an ""absolute no"" in light of the sexual assault revelations around him. Thankfully, he's been removed from the operation.And the food? Ehhhh. P2P (price to portions ratio) on appetizers is bad, and I had to order both a grilled octupus and a tripe to feel satisfied. Tripe was definitely transcendent, and octupus (sp) definitely a cut above your typical midtown Italian fare. For the entree, I went for something I couldn't cook at home, which was a mistake. I had the squab, which is a tiny bird that I ate in like 3 minutes and tasted like really rubbery and well-done chicken. If I'd ordered the pork chop, I think this would've been a 4 for me. Like Babbo, I think the squab is a hyped ""delicacy"" where you shouldn't believe the hype.Crowd here is people not familiar with the intimate conversational voice. We had to sit next to some FinanceBros with pointy collars who were loud and rude. Part of that is on Babbo itself, which crams too many tables into the space to maximize revenue. SMH.","Figured I couldn't punish an entire establishment for the misdeeds of one divested founder, and I'm glad to be able to say that the food and service were both top notch.  I still had to jump on to get reservations as soon as they were available (30 days ahead).Went with the wife to celebrate.  Cocktails were strong and well made.  I'd been eyeing the pasta tasting menu but we decided to order a la carte.  Ended up getting the octopus, the Bolognese and the ravioli and they were all fantastic, but the star of the meal was the branzino.  Cooked perfectly, hit with some lemon and olive oil.  Simple but amazing.  We sat near the stairs in the back and it was a little warm and maybe a little hectic because the staff had to pass us to get to the kitchen but those would be my only complaints.  I should also add that the pastas and the fish were portioned out on to separate plates which was a nice touch.","My 7-year old and I took a mommy/daughter trip to NYC and one of her bucket list items was to eat at a Masterchef's restaurant. Joe Bastianich's Babbo won our vote! We did make reservations and I chose a late lunch time of 1pm (about). The restaurant had people but was not crowded at that hour. Service was excellent and we were seated right away. Our food was delicious!! I would have expected no less and it was nice to be pleased with our selections. Plan to spend a nice price tag, but the flavors are well worth it. I chose the scallops (which she enjoyed too) and she chose spaghetti with shrimp (squid ink pasta) and ate it up. Save room for desert. I love Tiramisu and this is some of the BEST I've had! Would definitely visit again. PS She was disappointed that Joe wasn't there for her to meet, but a gal can't have everything!)","After being slammed with a three hour wait at nearby Via Carota, and not wanting to meander around the village on a rainy Thursday night, my best friend and I called here to see if they had any availability for two. The restaurant was full, but they had two seats at the bar and would hold them for us until we got there since we were so close by. We were seated immediately and cared for by waitress/bartender Amanda, who could not have been more lovely. She helped us decide on two wines (I believe we went with Nero d'avola and Vermentino Nero) and guided us through ordering. We ended up with the Fiore de Zucca, Warm Lamb's Tongue Vinaigrette, Mint Love Letters, Carne Cruda, and Pork Belly Pyramids, plus the Blackberry Sottosopra for dessert. Wow. Everything was SO good and well presented. I can see why they have a Michelin star! Speed of service was perfect, and Amanda seemed genuinely pleased that we were enjoying ourselves.  The music was also really good, with some classic rock playing when we arrived and gorillaz playing as we left.  I think the music helps the restaurant not feel stuffy at all. Overall, I was pleased with the serendipitous turn of events that led us here, and would love to return sometime!",Babbo
466,"We went to this restaurant based on the recommendation of Rachel Ray for the pasta. We had the casserecce with short rib meat sauce and papardelle with chantrelles. The pasta was tasty and cooked well. You could tell the pasta was fresh. The short rib meat was a little tough/dry which was disappointing as I'm used to short rib meat in a sauce falling apart. I had to cut the meat pieces with a knife. Overall the flavors were good but nothing stood out to bring value to the cost. This was the most costly meal we've had in NY but the food was not the best. Also, Lupa by far has to be the most over priced wine list in the country! They are selling $19 bottles of wine for $100!!! I get restaurants mark up alcohol greatly but I've never been ripped off like that.","3 stars are generous. This place has slipped. If you go, sit in the back room. The front is noisy and hot. The staff is okay.   Reasonably attentive but not 'happy to see you' or particularly attentive I'm Italian and I dont get the current menu. I can only describe the food as serviceable.  Not at all scrumptious or inventive.   My contorni - broccolini and eggplant:  dull and what seemed liked expired spices. The chili oil on my pollo diavolo was rancid. The dessert fussy and without delight. Really you could better for $150 for two people with wine. Basta cosi!","Fancy. Pricey. Romantic. Drafty. Crowded. Italian. If those are criteria you use in selecting your restaurant for the evening: go to. It's not that it was bad. It just wasn't very good. If you're a kid with your parents' credit card and a date you want to impress, this is your spot.","We walked into Lupa on a Saturday night after basically being laughed at after trying to get into Carbone down the street. The hostess only had a table at the bar, while we are not usually bar diners, we agreed- and it was the best decision! The bartender, Matt- what a gem! Our drinks (me: aperol spritz, him: old fashioned) we're balanced and refreshing. Matt guides us through the entire menu and made great suggestions. We started with the hearty focaccia bread and oil, followed by the beets with stracciatella and hazelnuts- very fresh! Tastes like a lighter peanut butter and jelly. We than saw a party further down the bar get the meat plate- we were literally drooling and had to order one. The tongue with onions on the meat plate is TO DIE FOR! We than tools Matt's advice and split three pasta dishes- Fettuccine ala Gringa- lighter version on carbonara (no egg), Cavatelli- with a pesto sauce and sausage (my least favorite of the three, but still delicious- pesto sauce was a little too overbearing- cavatelli is so delicate and does not need so much sauce) and the bucatini. By the time the bucatini arrived, I was on my second drink and struggling to not open my pants button. But, the bucatini was so good! I cleaned the plate. It was such a simple dish, but so well done. The red sauce had the perfect amount of spice and acid that it balanced the dish so well. We will be back, but a big shout out to Matt who made our experience at Lupa one to remember. Matt knew the majority of clientele at the bar. He even got a couple visiting from out of town to leave their table at sit at the bar, because they have dined at the bar with Matt before! He later informed us that after a few years with the Bastianich restaurants, it was his last night bartending. I have to say, what a loss for Lupa.","Their pastas are siren's calling. Call me weak hearted -I don't care- , as long as I can touch their perfectly made pasta (Buccatini, psst... call me) on my quivering lips, I'm happy. Lupa really does great dishes. + al dente pastas+ savory sauces+ charming and helpful somme+ amuse bouche + warm bread and olive oil+dictionary terms on the back of the menu- rushed busy server with an accent- squeezed in a bit much to be comfortable.- not a romantic bring your date place (loud) - portion may be less than I wish. (Bucket size would be perfect)","Loved it! Great food....the tuna appetizer was absolutely amazing. The somm suggested we try a rose which usually, i don't like, but he was right....it was so different than most. We sat at the bar and the bartender was so pleasant and passionate about the food . Offered suggestions and he was absolutely right about each.My only negative, and I hate to have one....I think the AC Was broken. It was so hot and stuffy I almost ran out of there by the end of my meal because I couldn't take it anymore. Hopefully that was just a bad night and will be fixed though.Ok I can't end on a negative....get the cacio di pepe....best i ever had.....don't tell my Italian boyfriend I said that though! :)",Lupa
467,Poached eggs with kale from brunch menu was fresh and plentiful. The challah French toast was sinful.Waitstaff was efficient and gracious.Spic and span environment.Great post swim race Sunday brunch Absolutely no reason to deduct any stars.,"Ordered a Salmon plate, specifically requested it to be cooked thoroughly (I've ordered from them in the past, and have had a problem with it not being cooked thoroughly) figured if I gave specific instructions on its cook temp, that would solve the problem. I was wrong. Salmon was delivered raw, it was packaged with my two sides - mashed potatoes and Brussels - therefore cross contaminating everything in it. I reached out to the restaurant. Their customer service was worse than their raw salmon. They were only able to refund me $9.80 on a $22 plate.","Ordered delivery twice for a group of people from Westville Hudson, once from Westville West. They got order wrong every time. Had to call and get missing order.Good quality food. It'd be much better experiences if they could get orders right.","Westville is one of my favorite places to grab a healthy, delicious and hearty meal in the city. I love that there are so many in different neighborhoods in NYC. Unfortunately, this location is my least favorite. I have ordered the turkey burger from here a few times for delivery, and every time I'm disappointed. The menu clearly states that the turkey burger comes with lettuce, tomato, onion. Each time the burger is delivered to me, it's delivered with just the patty and the bun - clearly none of the items it said it would have.The patty is delicious and flavorful, but by the time the burger reaches me (which is never that far), the bottom bun has already gotten soggy, so that's basically inedible. Also, to get mayo as a side for your burger, you have to pay another $1. I think that's ridiculous considering that if you actually go into the westville in Wall Street, they won't hesitate to give you some if you ask.I think this location definitely has a lot of fixing to do, because if you can't deliver a simple burger, we have an issue.","I came for lunch and this place was great for the big group (~12 people) I was in because there were a lot of menu options.I got the ""Grilled Marinated Chicken Breast"" plate with the ""Asian Bokchoy"" and ""Grilled Eggplants with Tahini"" sides. It was good and the portions were just right for the price, but I thought the grilled chicken and Asian bokchoy were pretty salty. The eggplants with tahini side was great though. My friend who got the ""Chicken marinated in wine w/ mashed potatoes"" special market plate for that day also said the flavor of her chicken was a bit too strong, and she could not finish the entire thing. Some people who got the veggie burger said that that was really good though. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if I was in the area and/or the people I'm making plans with want to eat here, I wouldn't mind coming back again.",Cocktails and vegetables!  We were in the area and decided to try Westville. The cocktails were interesting and tasty. Vegetables are the prime attraction. The Brussels Sprouts with Chorizo were delicious. The Skirt Steak Sandwich with horseradish mayo was also very good. The service was attentive. We will return.,Westville Hudson
468,"This place is really a victim its own success. The food and the staff were both great but the wait to be seated and the wait for your food was almost unbearably long. Also, there is no personal space here. I bumped elbows with the person from the table next to me several times throughout the meal. If they ever move to a larger location I would go back.","This place is really a victim its own success.

Other than that: I loved their brown butter pancakes, avocado toast was above average (as expected), my scrambled egg cheddar sandwich was a bit mediocre but everything else was memorable.","AMAZING brunch! I came here with 3 friends on a Sunday mid-day and the place was packed! They have both indoor and outdoor seating available; luckily we did not have to wait!We ordered the fruit salad and ricotta pancakes to share, along with the Moroccan scramble and steamed mussels. Everything was super fresh and delicious. I had the crop top cocktail which was amazing!The service was fantastic! Kevin was our waiter and he was able to give us recommendations on popular dishes. Our food came out super quickly and piping hot. Sometimes, with popular restaurants, I feel rushed through my meal, however this was not the case here. We were able to enjoy our meal and linger after our meal was over without being pushed out. Check this place out for a quality brunch! Make sure to get there early and beat the lines as they don't take reservation and it gets crowded.","I'm not too sure what the hype is about this place. My friend recommended it and since I've never been, I figured why not. We got seated at the bar and despite seeing a few empty seats inside and a slew of people (and I mean a slew) waiting outside, the restaurant did not rush to have them seated which I can't figure out why. I started it out by ordering their ice coffee only because the bartender highly recommended it. To my disappointment the coffee was so diluted that I could barely get my caffeine fix. Instead it tasted water downed and it was only confirmed when I actually saw the bartender doing the same thing to other ice coffee that was being ordered. I would see him adding the coffee half way, then ice and water to fill up the remaining cup (ewww) When he asked me how my food was, my friend tried to tell him I wasn't happy with the coffee and his remark was yeah it weak isn't it. You prolly think you ordered tea instead. Like wtffff?? First he said it's the best thing and highly recommended me to order and now he's being sarcastic (thumps down). As for the food, I ordered their eggs with hashbrown and two choice of side. It wasn't bad but it wasn't mind blowing either, just satisfying. As for my friend he ordered their pancake and it was under cook and tasted more like a cake then a pancake. Overall, I feel with all other brunch places around Williamsburg, this place is definitely not worth the wait.","Came here today on a Sunday around 2pm. While there isn't an official ""brunch"", they offer breakfast and lunch menus. No reservations allowed. We waited 30 minutes for our seat. We were seated by the window so it was absolutely TOO HOT!!! There are many seats outdoors/window-facing, so definitely ask for an indoor seat for a little longer wait. We first got hot chocolate and iced latte. The iced latte was a super steal because it was around $4 for a GIANT glass. We then got our orders which were the ricotta pancakes and Big Brekkie. Big Brekkie is standard around ~$16 with two free sides. I chose the sautéed mushrooms and bacon as my sides. YUM! The hash browns come in a croquette-looking shape. I absolutely loved my food and had a lot leftover so I took it to-go. The service was alright. The staff were friendly and smiling but were a bit busy so we had to call them a lot of times to order or to grab the bill.A really nice thing about this place is their Coffee To-Go window! You can literally walk by and grab coffee. I would've really liked to try the green tea noodle but I didn't see any photos of it on Yelp. :-(",Five Leaves
469,"Overall: Nothing special with bartenders that have huge egosAmbience: Young, Happy Hour and Touristy CrowdDrinks: You will get a better selection elsewhere - Oconnollys down the street is killing it and I haven't been there in two years. Cock and Bull 0.5 mile away has the coolest bartender. I can name 5 more bars. But the douches here don't get any recommendations.Service: Read above and I don't rate bad unless you're terrible.","Stopped by for drinks and snacks at an off time. The interior was nice, service adequate, and atmosphere perfect for catching up with some old colleagues. We were there right before 3:00, and unfortunately missed the window for good. You would think they offered a bar menu between lunch and dinner, but nope. Drinks and beers were good. Not even a peanut tho. Will be back if needing a place close to Penn but not in the mess of the nasty zone. It's about four blocks from penn/msg.","Look no further, this is the restaurant for you!! I am a bourbon girl and the fact that they had an old fashion on tap was a huge selling point (the old fashion was great). My husband and I had the hanger steak, mussels, and brussels sprouts -- everything was exceptional! I'm not sure what sauce was on the Brussels sprouts but if I could replicate them I would. The portions were on point with the pricing! We will be dining here again when we return to New York",Came in after a long day exploring NYC. What a pleasant staff greeting and taking care of us the whole night. Kaitlin was amazing and made us feel right at home. We will gladly recommend District Social and come back next time we visit!,"I bookmarked this place on yelp back in 2018, but never had the chance to visit. This year on my business trip, I need to make a reservation for a large party on the day of and I thought why not try this place that I had bookmarked. The manager was able to help me with a reservation last minute (I tried 3 other places and failed). I was glad I found a place for my team dinner at night. This place is huge, the first floor felt like it's more of a bar/ lounge environment. And our table was upstairs. After dinner, we event went down and grab a couple more drinks. Very versatile place. I was attracted by their menu. Their menu is decent and it has many things I wanted to try! Luckily, with a big team, I was able to try a lot of items on the menu. Short Rib: it was really good, it felt like the meat just (almost) melt in your mouth. Hanger Steak: I would say that this wasn't the best hanger steak I had, and compared to everything, it wasn't as good. But nonetheless, it was decent. Flatbread (Pork Belly): It was very good! I really like it! Croquette(Risotto): This was something I have never seen in any other restaurant, it really got my attention. I was glad that I got it! Charred Octopus: I'm normally not a huge octopus person, but someone on my team really wanted it and I was impressed. I think the Charred definitely made a huge difference. Overall I had a great experience here.","Wow, just wow to the service at this place. 1 star because I liked their cheese. First place in the NYC to get a low rating from me. As for the bread that came with it, had burnt areas on top, one of the cured hams tasted like nothing, and the flatboard had almost zero seasoning.This place is not cheap and they're also on the less classy side which we realized when they asked about gratuity. We were in a hurry and asked for the bill upfront before receiving our food and so much so we even forgot to sign the receipt before they took the bill. When the waitress came back with the bill she mentioned the missing signature and added in "".... was I clumsy and drop the cash in this booklet for gratuity when I walked away from the table?"" There were less than 10 people in the whole restaurant and we were seated in the area where it would've been very obvious if she dropped anything at all. After that I guess she thought she better do some good service to say she earned a tip and refilled our water glasses after we clearly finished our food and were getting ready to leave. Clearly not remembering that we mentioned we were in a rush, why would we need more water? Throughout our meal, she didnt come by to even ask how the food was or if it was enough sice we only had time for apps.Major turn-off, this brunette chick with a short haircut has lost my business for the restaurant entirely for this.",District Social
470,"We are very disappointed Location: I can't even consider being in a place this tiny for dinner. And as the day goes dark, customers continue to come in. It's nothing but waiting time for customers who consider dining here. For me, basically sitting next to stranger for food this close is unbearable. Food: they serve more food on the weekend than during weekday. That's being said. All I can order is noodles and lu rou fan and soft tofu. Price is way too high. For a noodle that size which costs me 14 dollars?! Nope. And the noodle is nothing special. To be honest, I have experienced and dined in much better noodle place in Manhattan. Don't know where the hype coming from. 3 stars is all I can get. Just disappointed","DO NOT SUPPORT HO FOODS.I hope you guys are JOKING with the pricing of these food. It is BEYOND ridiculous. The dishes Ho Foods serve are popular Taiwanese street food... and street food shouldn't be this overpriced. (OR at least make the portions bigger.)For $8.50, you can get a chinese food soup container sized serving of Lou Rou Fan. That is just absurd! The portion is TINY for the money you're charging. Our tofu w/ century old egg BARELY had any Bonito flakes on it. And yup, that was $8 as well. MY GOD...i cannot believe we spent $40 on these. Never ordering from you guys again and will NEVER visit this establishment. Fix your portions or lower your prices. I am DISGUSTED by y'all. P.s: Almost none of the employees featured on their instagram are actual Taiwanese people. This is Taiwanese food for white people.DO NOT SUPPORT HO FOODS.","Lu rou fan and beef noodle soup are solid for lunch/dinner, as well as soy milk / mi jiang beverages. The portions are good for the price. Authentic flavors. Can be a bit of a wait to be seated since it's a small restaurant. The breakfast was disappointing and overpriced though (fan tuan, egg bing). Fan tuan was not well balanced, with not enough pickled vegetables, and the portion size was tiny. For perspective, they only use half the you tiao for their fan tuan. I was excited to have a go to place for fan tuan, since Tao Roll in Flushing was closed down, but Ho Foods does a poor job. The egg bing was ""healthy"" with a side of spicy sauce. You can add shredded meat for an extra 2 dollars, ridiculous because the dish is extremely small.Definitely recommend the lunch/dinner but avoid the breakfast.","Ho foods""Fan Tuan"" sticky rice roll w/ crullers, pork floss, and picklesEgg Bing (v) with pork floss Soy Milk & Cruller (v)I love the fantuan most, thrown back to my childhood!","Amazing, delicious beef noodle soup! The East Village is blessed with an abundance of Taiwanese restaurants these days, but Ho Foods stands out in its execution of the classic beef noodle soup. Not cheap (a basic bowl runs $15.50), but you can taste the quality. The flavors of the soup are perfectly balanced, the noodles are perfectly chewy, and the beef is incredibly tender and high-quality. The restaurant only seats 10-12 people, so definitely not a good place for groups or private conversations, but perfect for a group of 2 or a quick solo dinner. My only complaint is that some of the extra items seem pricey for what they are ($5 for a cup of tea, $3 for bok choy/broccoli greens in the soup). Still, I keep coming here because the noodle soup is basically perfection.","Holy SH*T!! 5 stars for lu rou fan alone!!! It was so rich and delicious, can't stop thinking about it. Have had this place book marked for a while now but always seemed to be closed whenever I tried to come, finally made it here for dinner last night. Cozy, right packed little spot with seating for 10 people. There was a 15 minute wait when we got there (you can add your name to the waitlist and they'll text you) but ended up waiting no more than 10 minutes. I got the lu rou fan and my boyfriend had the red cooked beef noodles (wide), and we were given some mustard greens to share. Lu rou fan is a classic Taiwanese dish that's essentially chopped up pork belly in savory soy sauce over rice. It was literally insane and blew my mind. The pork belly was so juicy and tender, melted in my mouth and the sauce was awesome. Even the rice was cooked to perfection, sucking up all those delicious juices. My boyfriend really enjoyed the noodles but the broth was a little too rich for me. Noodles were al dente and beef was super tender. Waiter was super friendly and our food came out quick. Not the cheapest Chinese food but makes sense for the area. Come here ASAP if you're a fan of Taiwan food!!",Ho Foods
471,"I've been dining at Spicy Village since the restaurant opened! This place is one of my favorite Chinese places in the city, and it's no longer a hidden gem. If you don't like spicy food, then steer clear of this place. The dish to order here is the big plate of chicken (da panji) and their homemade steamed dumplings. I've been to western China, and the dapanji at Spicy Village is very authentic to what you'd eat in Xinjiang. The only dish that I'm not crazy about is the soup dumplings, they're not good.",This spot seems to be a staple on many yelp and foodie lists so decided I had to finally check it out! There was about a 25 minute wait at 8 pm on a Saturday.When it's almost your turn to sit someone will come out and ask for your order. We went with the big chicken with noddles. The chicken was a little questionable and very honey but the noddles and the broth were very tasty. Ordered a pork pancake but it didn't get delivered until the very end and they completely forgot we ordered soup dumplings. Confirm what you ordered when you sit down to avoid this!,"I was so excited about eating here, but sadly the food here did not meet the hype. My boyfriend and I shared the big try chicken with handmade noodles and the garlic baby bok choy. Chicken was dry and had a strange, almost rubbery texture. The flavors of the dish were good, though toned down in my opinion (have to disagree with the other reviews on how this is authentic.) Bok choy was standard but tasted heavily of MSG.","Great place for great Asian food. The store is right by the park but has very limited seating so prepare to take a number and wait. We went around 7:45 on a weekday and had to wait ~20 minutes. They did take our orders while we were outside so by the time we sat down we were immediately greeted with food. Also because of the limited seating we had to share a table with another group, which isn't an issue at all but just something to know. We ordered the soup dumplings (comes with ~12) and the spicy big tray chicken. The soup dumplings were fine. Smaller than normal and not as much soup inside as other places. Some of them also broke easily. The spicy big tray chicken was really good. We got it with noodles (2 portions for 3 people) but you can get it with rice too. The broth it's in is really tasty but could've been spicier I think. The chicken was cooked very well and is very tasty, beware that some of them have bone in them. The noodles are good but you have to be careful getting them out since they're all stuck together. The soup dumplings and chicken was enough to fill 3 of us. Overall great place with great food. The pricing is also amazingly cheap for the amount of food you're getting.",Interested little place in the village; the veggies were absolutely delish and greatly enjoyed the big tray chicken - it's pretty big so great to share with 3-4 people and spicy so be ready! Lastly it's BYOB! Service is nothing to boost about so don't expect anything fancy,"If you come before the dinner rush on a weekday, it's relatively empty. It has only 22 seats, with only 2 of them a 2 seater.Came to try the infamous big tray chicken. I spent the $2 and got the noodles too. This tray is definitely meant to be shared. It comes with potatoes and chicken in the dish. The chicken is sometimes still attached to the bone. Would have been nicer if it was all boneless. The spice could use some work too. Definitely some crunch on the peppercorns but there was extremely light mala flavor in this dish. The chili oil on the side was required for my tastebuds and gave me a sweaty head. I ended up using their soup spoon to drink broth with most of my bites to ensure I get all of the flavor of the broth with the meat, potatoes and noodles.Wait staff was nice to me. I read other reviews where they are pushy. I get it since it's a small joint but luckily I went when it was slow. The chef also smiled at me as she took a break to walk outside. Perhaps I looked terrible from my sweat storm. I downed the whole thing myself.If you're looking for what I gather is an authentic henan experience go here and get that A1 - big tray chicken. They also have a menu full of other goodies too. If you want pure mala, then one must look elsewhere like mala project or cafe China.",Spicy Village

A lot of great food options albeit a pretty pricey. It was also easy to find seating and I really appreciated the water stations.Spaghetti donut - dry on the outside and I think the baking process over cooked the noodles.Banana bread pudding - not a strong Ube flavor but sooooo good. Wasn't too sweet, super creamy. And the chew of the banana bread pieces was niceRamen burger - a little much. Super juicy and flavorful, but the ramen patties kind of get stuck in your throatJian bin - not the best. The wasn't much flavor, just herb overloadPineapple juice - mostly foamPortuguese egg tart - was expecting more of a crunch/flake from the crust, but the inside was super creamyFried pork wontons - super flavorful and juicy, but you don't get very manyPork bun - pork could have been more fatty/tenderDuck bun - loved the freshness of the cucumberOkanomiyaki - flavorful and a good portionBeef tacos - super juicy and flavorful Overall I would get the banana bread pudding again. Also look out for the Apple Pay deals!","This was my first Smorgasburg event and what better location than the one in Brooklyn?? The weather was perfect. We took a nice stroll down the long bridge, took scenic pictures like classic tourists, and made our way down to this foodie event. We tried a variety of food. MOZZARELLA STICKS W/ MARINARA SAUCETRUFFLE FRIES WITH LEMON GARLIC AIOLIREGULAR FRIES W/ JALAPEÑO CILANTRO SAUCEVEGETARIAN QUESADILLA WITH TACO INSIDES ON TOP MANGO & LIME LEMONADESMANGO FLOWER WITH CHAMOYPOTATO AND CHICKEN ROTISJAPANESE CURRY BEEF TACOSLong story short, we took a nice figurative ride around the world by trying a variety of ethnic foods from Mexican, to Indian, to Japanese/Mexican, to American cuisine. Everything was fantastic. It's also the reason I began attending the Smorgasburg events in Los Angeles.","The experience at Smorsgasburg comes from walking through all the diverse food vendors and trying to find something that catches your eye. There are some interesting choices like lobster nachos or ramen burgers, and more traditional choices like fried chicken and baos. Although the food here is a bit overpriced, the options are plentiful and you'll certainly find something you like.I tried the yakisoba Japanese pancake ($16), the lobster nachos ($15), and the baos ($9 each, pork belly is the best). As you can see, the prices are a bit high! These are restaurant level prices for not so restaurant worthy food. Fortunately, each vendor I tried was pretty good. I'd recommend the Japanese pancake if you want something that's more filling, and would recommend avoiding the baos as you can find these in tons of restaurants for much cheaper.Overall, Smorsgasburg is a nice experience that you should try at least once. There are a ton of different options that you're bound to try something new, which is the Smorsgasburg experience. Now the hard part is choosing what you want when everything looks so good...P.S. it's pretty crowded so be prepared to have a hard time finding a place to sit and eat.","One of my favorite food experiences of the year; Smorgasburg more than lives up to the hype. With dozens of vendors on site, theres literally something for everyone. While here, I was able to try the infamous mac and cheese doughnut, the fried dough balls from Petisco, the famous mozz sticks from Big Mozz, perfectly grilled skewer of Shrimp, a Japanese style pancake, an ice cream sandwich as well as a delicious egg sandwich from another newer vendor, Crack'd. Everything was outstanding, while the egg sandwich and fried dough balls were a personal highlight. Will return on my very next time in Brooklyn.",Williamsburg Smorgasburg - Saturday

I was told ""yes"" about each item.Thank goodness for my Eppi Pen!I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.If they don't know what's in their food - I wouldn't recommend eating it.",Food is not bad but they have no respect for NYC Emergency Medical Services so they lost my business.....,"I paid $10.89 for: Market Chicken Bowl +Veggie Fried Rice + Sichuan Eggplant + Garlic String Beans.I opened up the cover and they gave me free hairs and very dry food.I contacted the restaurant about voiding my transaction because it was unacceptable. Dead silence..just like when I opened up the cover to the food. What a waste of money and in addition, they aren't customer focus/service competent.","The Wei is amazing and more people need to go. Period. It's probably one of the best fast casual ""make your own bowl"" places out there and their portions are more than generous.I'm pretty picky about good Chinese food and everything that I've tried here is top quality. My favourite combo is the green fried rice, mapo tofu (super legit and delicious, although you can't go wrong with any of the proteins), bokchoy and string beans. Basically this is a no-stress, you get what you order (if not more) quality af place everyone needs in their lives","When I first ate here, I thought that it is the Chipotle of chinese food. Similar idea of ordering. I liked the Wei because it was conveniently located across the street from my University. They were fast paced so even when there was a lot of people, you didn't have to wait long. All their vegan food is clearly labeled. Portions are good too, so I usually could never finish the whole thing. For the base, I usually get their veggie fried rice. For protein, I get the ma-po tofu. And for veggies, I get the garlic string beans, and shanghai bok choy. Lastly, I put extra extra sesame seeds, fresh scallions, and fried crispy shallots. Try this combination or try something different. All I know is that it is gonna delicious.",I actually liked The Wei but idk Im not to hype of about this place anymore. Its good fast food  thats very flavorful. They do have a make your own bowl type of vibe going on which is cool. Its pretty self explanatory you pick the type of rice you would like between jasmine rice and green scallion infused rice which both taste pretty good. Then on to your meat and then veggies. You spend a pretty penny about 11-12$ for a very good portion of good food.,The Wei
474,"There are multiple Grey Dog's in the city and after my last experience this one is the worst. I decided to return for my favorite meal - Grilled Chicken Press with sweet potato fries ($1 extra). TIP: You walk up to the counter, place your order, pay and they bring the food out to you. Sometimes they will reserve a table before ordering with a bandana if they are busy.The service at this location was not as friendly or accommodating as others. My friend was a first timer and they were not helpful in helping her order. The food came out in a decent amount of time. However, the food was sub par to what it usually is. Not the same quality or service I am use to. Definitely will go back to other locations in the future.","I came here on a Saturday after reading the glowing reviews for the place. It was quite busy, and took about 20 minutes to get seated. However, the food was not anything beyond average. We ordered the avocado toast, seared tuna tacos, and brussel sprouts.","Good food, big portions, and great vibes for brunch. Unfortunately, I think they forgot to make my friends food. One meal came to the table, and after waiting 30 minutes, we had to ask where his was. It made for a very poor experience - and very inconvenient as we were on our way in to the office.","Got the Poached Egg Avocado salad. Friend got the Upstate Omelet. I looooved my meal from this place. The ambiance is absolutely lovely. The vibes were all around just so awesome and I REALLY loved and enjoyed the salad. The slight dressing with the fresh avocado, amazing salmon and perfect eggs....all so so good. Highly recommend this place.",The food is nice and well seasoned. The amount of food is very satisfying. The decoration in the store is excellent.But its's too loud!The dinning environment isn't suitable for friends to chat.Still recommend the food because it's really nice,"Great coffee, great brunch, and open seating. No reservations, but quick for take out or casually sitting at a table. Very unique kitchen situation where the kitchen is downstairs and the food is lifted up to you.Brunch was good. Omelette was very large in size and well cooked. Coffee was free refills and delicious. Will go again.",The Grey Dog - Union Square
475,"Food was outstanding!  The place was RIDICULOUSLY  LOUD?!?!  It was louder than a college singles bar at happy hour.  DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU WANT A NICE QUIET DINNER!  Seriously, I will never eat at this place again - unless it is take-out.  They do have tables outside and tables out back on the terrace - shoot for that, or go somewhere else.  Did I mention the food was great?  It is lost in the background noise of not being able to hear myself think. It is crazy tho think this could be a great great place but when you can't hear the waiters and have to Hell your order and yell to the person across the table. I seriously feel bad for the employees that have to work in those conditions.","I really like Uva, but the noise level gets painfully loud if you dine at a regular meal time. For brunch, lunch, and dinner, whether inside or on the patio, the noise is booming, and the patrons are yelling to be heard. Last time I left right after being seated--my friend and I could not hear each other while leaning in and sitting at the same table on the patio. (On another note, I am concerned for the people who work here--exposure to that level of noise causes hearing damage.)",This place is hella busy! The decorations are wonderful with a very rustic/romantic vibe. I had the Gnocchi which was tasty but not special. Not the best Italian place I've been to in the city but I get why this place is very popular.,"My husband and I came here last month after a search on Yelp for Italian restaurants. For an appetizer, we split the breaded and baked prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella, which felt like the sophisticated big sister of fried mozzarella sticks. We were stuck on the pasta options, and our server informed us that we could order half-portions in order to try more, so of course we did that and got ourselves a little tour of Uva. The half portions are truly half portions and half the charge. 4 half-entrees, one app, one dessert, and a bottle of wine cost us a little over $100 before tip, so the prices are extremely reasonable. We left full but not too stuffed to move. Service was fantastic. We will absolutely come back.",This was a nice night!! The calamari and the ricotta bruchette--SERIOUSLY so good. We ended up ordering two plates of the bruchette because it was that good. I got the squid ink pasta which wasnt the best...the ravioli was good! Just extremely cramped seating and still was a bit of a wait even after making a reservation. But I'd come back!,"Food was outstanding!  The place was R I D I C U L O U S L Y    L O U D !!!?!?!?!?!?!  It was louder than a college singles bar at happy hour on a 3 day weekend.  DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU WANT A NICE QUIET DINNER!  Seriously, I will never eat at this place again - unless it is take-out.  They do have tables outside and tables out back on the terrace - shoot for that, or go somewhere else.  Did I mention the food was great?  It is lost in the background noise of not being able to hear myself think.

GTFO-ta here!  The best shit to be in your mouth ever!Fuck, the place fucking ruins it for all the other restaurants!I can't wait to be back........ !!!!  *drool*","I will have to say that overall the food was decent, but I'm not sure it's worth the price. When I arrived, Alexandra (one of the hostesses) was exceptionally rude and if it wasn't for her colleague I would have walked out and never returned. I travel every week for work, and eat at great restaurants all over the country, and rarely do I find such poor customer service as she displayed. I think this is most likely one of those places that stays busy because of the popularity of the chef, not because of the food.","Pros:+ Mushroom Bans+ Mixed spicy noodles - so much flavor and an incredible meal+ Several vegetarian options and non beef/pork options too - I'm sure you'll be able to find something for most dietary restrictionsCons:- Overcrowded - the wait times can easily be hours- Seating Hostess- We mentioned we would like to move to a different corner of the bar. The hostess agreed once the bar was clear. However, as soon as we moved, they insisted we move again to make the arrangements easier for them to seat more customers. I understand their dilemma, but they should have just told us no in the first place.- FYI, they seat tables, bars, and chef's side all at the same. It's really sad that you can't just grab a table at the bar- Rushed service","The smoked pork and the spicy beef broths were excellently flavored and had great bite. The pork really just dissolved in your mouth and it complemented the barley noodles which were thin but chewy. We also ordered pork buns which were soft and perfectly sweet yet savory. Momofuku has always been my favorite ramen spot and nothing has yet beat the authenticity, flavor and presentation of the giant bowls of warm homey broth. Extra: ordered the white soju 14oz shot, it was worth the price. It could be shared between two, it was strong so be prepared.","I've been to Momofuku Noodle Bar once before but the cool East Village location. When my friend suggested Noodle Bar for dinner, in the Time Warner Center*, no less, I wanted to abandon ship. I was actually pleasantly surprised that the restaurant did not look like an Arby's or another type of mall restaurant, but rather a David Chang eatery that happened to be inside of a mall. My friend and I were seated right away at the bar, in front of the rotating board of daily specials. This rotating board. Really. Annoyed me. It's suppose to mimic the information board at train or bus station that rotates it's letters. The problem is that it rotates every 2-3 minutes and is kind of loud. I suppose I got use to it after awhile, but still really annoying. The bartender who served us was really knowledgeable about the menu and especially about the ingredients in all of the cocktails. He may have been a little too overbearing, interrupting us one too many times, but definitely not the end of the world.El Dragon [$16 x 2]: I'm usually skeptical of drinks that feature watermelon. For some reason they end up watery and dilute whatever it is that the drink was trying to highlight. El Dragon was actually really interesting and full of flavor. I've never had dragoncello before, but the tarragon flavor of it combined with the other ingredients made for a delicious and easy to drink cocktail. Though at $16 a piece, the price of a ramen dish, you might want to rethink how many you have.Shishito Peppers [$13]: The shishito peppers were cooked perfectly. I've had peppers that were mushy, without any snap, so I appreciate when something is executed well. Topped with romesco sauce, I found it to be a nice pairing, slightly tangy, although not exactly pleasant when you inhale and choke on a red pepper flake or two. Chilled Spicy Noodles [$15]: The chilled spicy noodles are a special dish to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the original Momofuku Noodle Bar in the East Village. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 needing a fire department to put out the blaze in your mouth, these noodles were a 20. You don't initially realize how spicy the noodles are because the heat lies within the sauce. The accompanying sausage and candied cashews, which by the by are outstanding, deceive you into thinking you're not about to set yourself ablaze. Ginger Scallion Noodles [$15]: I'm so glad we ordered the Ginger Scallion Noodles. This dish has taught me that ramen does not always need broth. It was also a great counter balance to the spicy noodles, with it's pickled shiitake mushrooms and cucumbers. I think the this may be my [and my friend's] favorite dish at Momofuku Noodle Bar.Passion Fruit Cheesecake [$6]: While I love passion fruit in any dessert, I was left underwhelmed by the cheesecake itself. It was tasty and baked well. All the flavors were satisfactory, but it just wasn't anything special. The cheesecake was also a little bit too small for two people to share. We pretty much got three or four bites each. I cannot have only three bites of a dessert.I would probably come back just for a bowl of the Ginger Scallion Noodles. $63, after tax and tip and split between two people._______________________*a mega mall that sells Forever 21 clothes next to a Sugarfina. AH.","After a nice run in Central Park I decided to treat myself to a nice meal since it's right across the street. I started with the Pork Belly Buns, 2 small sized (3 bites I'd say) which were very delicious. A large slab of pork nestled inside a pillowy bao bun. The Ssäm sauce was sweet and slightly spicy and a perfect condiment. For the meal I had the Ginger Scallion Noodles. This is a deceptive sized bowl as it looked to be mostly veg and a small amount of noodles but it was deep and there were oodles of noodles. They were perfectly chewy with a variety of bright pickled vegetables with the tastiest mushrooms I've probably ever eaten. Cute spot, nice service.",Momofuku Noodle Bar
477,The worst restaurant ever. My food has been disgusting and ice cold the three times I have tried to order from this place on Caviar.  Avoid this restaurant at all costs as your food will arrive ice cold and all mixed in together.  Third time I have had to completely trash the food from this place and then place a new order somewhere else. Customer beware. 0 stars.,"Let me tell you what happened yesterday around 5 PM at Sweetwater. I was sitting on the patio and the resturant was almost completely empty. I had two friends with me and my dogs and we were eating and drinking when I became over heated and excused myself to go sit inside in the air conditioning. I sat a table near the bar and started to get worse and the room was spinning and I started sweating profusely. I was fighting to keep my eyes open and stay in a seated position. I waved for my friends when the door was opened to the patio becuase I felt at that point that I couldn't walk but they didn't notice me. The waitstaff of the restaurant were rude and I guess they didn't recognize me from the patio and kept trying to get my order and offer me a menu. How crazy is that?! At one point I politely asked for a cold wet towel one girl made a face and went over to a sink and got a paper towel that she ran under the tap. She brought it over and it was room temperature. I was very quiet and polite through the whole event though the staff acted like I was this huge inconvenience. The bartender acted angry the entire time and when she finally realised I wasn't going to order anything she asked if I was feeling OK. I told her that I thought I might be having a heatstroke and she made a face and walked to the other end of the bar. I guess they thought I was a drunk or something. I was having margaritas (watered down, very weak margaritas) on the patio earlier. But not enough to make me intoxicated and I was eating and drinking a lot of water at the same time. My friends finally saw me and came to help. I haven't felt right since then, even after drinking glass after glass of ice water. So I have just called and told a very young sounding supervisor what happened to me at her restaurant. She reacted in glib manner and seemed not to take me seriously. The entire event was very odd to say the least and I'm still not sure what to think about it. Was the waitstaff just young and inexperienced and unfamiliar with what being overheated looked like? I think its probably more to do with the waitstaff looking at customers as how they make money and not as people. I was very respectful and polite through the whole event and I have been going to Sweetwater for years and always tip well and have been a great customer. But I feel that Sweetwater is just trying to make a buck and if a customer is having trouble then that customer becomes an annoyance. My advice is go spend your money at someplace that looks at its customers as human.","Food is decent enough but the service has been consistently bad every time I come here.  Tonight I was sitting at the bar and I got my burger at the same time as my beer, even though I ordered the beer when I first sat down. How does that even happen when you're sitting at the bar, 5 feet from the taps? I gave it two tries. Done.","Great atmosphere. Great service. I Would totally recommend this cosy little restaurant.

No cocktails for us.Lobster noodles and corn fritters are phenomenal. I could totally envision myself dropping in for a quick snack consisting of those two and a drink at the bar!

This is a must dish. So refreshing and light.Steamed Black Sea bass- came out wrapped in banana leaves, with pea shoots and it comes with spicy calamansi (lemon version of south East Asian culture) sauce. Fish is so delicious and cooked to perfection. Lobster noodle- Wow oh wow.. this is our favorite dish of the night. Chunks of lobster pieces embedded and mixed into the noodles. Yummy!!Nasi Goreng-fried rice with sunny side up and soy sauce.. this is a must dish also. Can compliment any of the main dishes or can be eaten just like that. To top it off, we ordered banana dessert with Uber ice cream (purple yam). To cut the long review short. This place deserved to be recognized as one of NYC's best restaurant. We will definitely go back when we visit this beautiful city again.","Can you imagine eating glazed bacon on Indonesian restaurant?! only in Wayan, this Indo-French restaurant tucked in the lovely neighborhood of NoHo has truly elevated Indonesian cuisine.We came here for brunch to entertain a visiting friend. The restaurant looks small but it was actually not as the layout is ""train car"" like long and narrow but if you prefer to be seated in front of restaurant, an advance reservation is recommended. Our group of 5 were seated at the front near the window that we enjoyed both the restaurant interior and the street view on a nice sunny day.The family style dining prompted us to order everything at onceThe dishes that we ordered are:1. Nasi Goreng with glazed bacon2. Avocado toast ""Gado Gado""3. Corn fritters4. Salad Nicoise ""Indonisiene""5. Lobster Noodles6. Mango and Cucumber salad7. Sate Chicken Bowl8. Extra glazed baconWe ordered extra salad as they ran out of chicken wings, a minus star for that (my mantra is; it better be available when it's on the menu). Special mentions to the Nasi Goreng with bacon and the Lobster noodles we felt that it stood out among the rest of the dishes. Over all it was a lovely experience and our server was super attentive and we are definitely considering coming to try out their dinner menu in the near future!","First time having Indonesian food.  I have no idea how authentic it is but most of the dishes were delicious.  The restaurant interior itself looked beautiful and all the food was plated equally so.  The serving staff had some great recommendations that did not fail to meet expectations.We went during lunch on a Saturday with a reservation for 4.  We had no idea what to expect so we all just picked a dish we each wanted to try and then 1 more we would all agree on! Yolo right haha.  We went with the recommended corn fritter which was amazing, a definite must in terms of both taste and texture needed to balance the meal.  The lobster noodles was also recommended and did not disappoint.  A great portion of lobster and amazing sauce with hints of pepper coating the noodles.  We also ordered the fried rice, I forget what it was called and the chicken satay each equally delicious in their own way.  The last dish we got was the wagyu steak and eggs.  This ended up being our least favorite.  Maybe it needed a little salt? Maybe our steak was too fatty? It wasn't awful but not quite up to par with the other dishes we ordered, atleast for our visit anyways. The one awesome thing about everything being shareable was that there ended up being alot of mixing of dishes ordered.  Steak and eggs not so flavorful? Add the fried rice or noodles to the mix and boom! It instantly tastes better lol.For dessert we had the banana sundae.  Pretty basic but delicious.  Would love to come back again but likely some time from now considering its pretty pricey for lunch/brunch.  5 dishes, 2 drinks, 1 dessert at around $200 after tip^^",Wayan

480,I was really looking forward to brunch and am pretty disappointed! My cocktail was fantastic but food was not great.  We ordered oysters but they came after our entrees which was unappetizing. No explanation was given.  I ordered a salad with grilled romesco (16$). Totally plain - I could have made it in 10 minutes.  I ordered it with chicken (extra $4) which was described as grilled. Not grilled- it was strips of chicken that looked like the shredded chicken in my friend's soup.  Lots of gristle- kind of like putting leftover chicken on a bed of lettuce. Icky. I'll stick to just oysters and cocktails if I go again.,"Absolutely horrible service, stopped in this place at 7:56 to grab a cup of coffee as I walked in no one at front counter music blasting so loud that employees sitting in the back had to shout at me to come back in five minutes, how lazy can they be if they did not feel like serving Before 8 AM they should keep the door locked I know this place has been in business for a long time just don't know how... Will never stop there again","Terrible service. Multiple orders (drinks, starters and mains) messed up multiple times. Asked to speak to the manager who was beyond rude and confrontational- blamed us for their mistakes on orders. I never write reviews but felt compelled to given the terrible experience. Won't ever be returning.","A darling spot in South Williamsburg that somehow I'd never heard of.  Marlow & Sons is part grocer, part bar, part restaurant, and I'm here for all of it.So, the location is a little difficult to get to if you don't live in the area.  It's about a  1/2 mile walk from the closest subway stop (Marcy Ave), which is not too pleasant if you visit on a hot summer day like we did.  There is also not too much going on in this area, so there is little to see on the way.  But on a day with nice weather, I still think it's worth the trek.We had a reservation for dinner on a Wednesday night.  It was surprisingly empty when we arrived, with only a couple tables occupied and a handful of patrons at the bar, but I appreciated the personalized attention and the relaxing ambiance.  I tried a couple of their cocktails, which were delicious and unique.  For food, we had the oysters ($18/6), smashed cucumbers ($9), peas & string beans ($16), brick chicken ($33), and grilled bluefish ($28).  Everything was really, really tasty, but what really took me by surprise was the peas & string beans, which was so, so flavorful.  I also really loved the broccolini in the brick chicken dish.  Full disclosure: Marlow & Sons is not cheap, despite its appearance that suggest a cozy neighborhood joint.  Dinner and drinks for two ran us $160 before tip.  The food here is of very high caliber, which partly justifies the price tag, but just be aware that a meal here will likely cost you a pretty penny.","If there was a restaurant that exemplifies Williamsburg Brooklyn, Marlow & Sons is it.Farm to table establishment with a very limited menu and higher than average prices, that being said the quality and preparation of the food is outstanding. It is not very often that I will pay $16....yes $16 for a Bacon, Egg and cheese sandwich on a poppy seed roll.....yet today I did and I feel good about it.Why? It was the best egg sandwich I have ever had.Perfectly scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, bacon with a aioli on a fresh poppy seed roll. No ketchup required. It was perfect, smoky bacon cooked to its best self. To add to the greatness of the plate they had sautéed kale with lemon and garlic, delicious.....guess what I will Be buying this weekend from the grocery store....I never knew Kale could be so damn good. My guests enjoyed their fried bluefish sandwiches on toast.it was served with a butter leaf lettuce salad. For starters we ordered a potato tortilla, which was like a slice of quiche and yes it was delicious....served with sour cream.....yum it was so good we ordered another plate of it. The least successful dish was the pickles, I was thinking homemade sour or spicy cucumber pickles..... we received 3 small dishes....one with picked mushrooms, one with pickled carrots and one with pickled radishes and greens. No Charge for NYC tap on the table. I am going to try and get to their restaurant ""diner"" on my next visit for dinner. It is not open for lunch during the week contrary to their signage. I would go back Marlow and sons coffee and some of their baked goods as they looked beautiful. Lunch for 3, no beverages $98 with tip.","I was all ready to not like this place because of the sorta cramped tables and the lack of lighting in the restaurant (all that wood makes things pretty dark). But, as always, food overcomes all...And they have some doozies on the menu starting with that really wonderful sour cabbage pancake. That thing is fantastic.We also really enjoyed the brick chicken and the pork cutlet. Not special like the pancake, but nice all the same. Throw in a couple of three cocktails and we forgot all about the closeness of our neighbors.I'm telling you Brooklyn is full of neighborhood restaurants like these that  make really surprisingly high-level food. Try it if you're in the 'hood...",Marlow & Sons
481,AskaAbbreviated Dining Room Menu:Favorite:1.HAKE2.LICHEN3.BEEF: 120-day dry aged rib eye4.VENDACE ROE5.MIGNARDISESA restaurant only serves approximately 10 tables per night.First time to see the bread comes with pork fat.,"We did the 12 course menu as we had a party of 6, and thus were in the private rolls in the backAs others have said, the food is incredibly inventive, delicious, and unique. It was a great culinary experience.My rating though is based on two things:-Our meal took FOREVER - literally four and a half hours. We weren't actually waiting that long between any particular course, it's just an incredibly long drawn out experience, so be prepared.-The presentation and overall style of the restaurant is the height of pretension - talking about choosing wine as if it's supposed to be a transcendental spiritual experience, or describing how you picked the kolrabhi off a tree in a Williamsburg neighborhood garden down the block. The opposite of unpretentious, good food presented simplyIt was a unique and worthwhile experience, but not one that left me wanting to come back, at least not unless I have another 5 hours to kill",This was my first tasting menu... Every dish was so carefully put together. I tasted flavors that I've never dreamed of! The staff and atmosphere really made it a memorable experience. Worth it.,"Loved almost every single bite I had here. Other than gravlax and IKEA meatballs, I'd never had Scandinavian cuisine before, so this was certainly an amazing introduction. Out of the tasting menu the courses that stick out most in my mind even a month later as I'm writing this are the bladderwrack (laugh at the name but it's a delicious seaweed chip) and the lobster brain/claw/tail combination. But I could just as easily rave over the potato pancake, or the beer bread (the ""correct"" description is Manitoba loaves leavened with IPA, but let's be real, it's just beer bread) accompanied by butter and whipped pork lard, or the savoury af quail and black truffle dish. I loved it all! Even the ones that weren't my personal favourites - razor clams, osetra caviar and peas, hake - were still beautiful in both taste and presentation. My table's least liked course by far was the blackberry tart that was the first dessert - there was something about it that straight up tasted rancid and bitter, and most of us couldn't finish our tarts, small as they already were. But the other two desserts were incredible - toasted hay ice cream with meadowsweet-filled aebleskiver, and a piece of bark with several candies on top. Probably the only time in my life I'll try something as interesting as their blood truffle. If you come, I HIGHLY recommend the juice pairing! It's definitely unique - how many high-end juice pairings have you come across in your life? - and I couldn't pass up the chance. Our selection came with ones like Douglas fir, rhubarb soda with rose vinaigrette, huckleberry spruce, bronze fennel blossom, etc. I didn't like all of them but absolutely don't regret such a one-of-a-kind experience like that. If you opt for alcohol instead, don't sleep on their many choices of aquavit. Service is impeccable, as to be expected. There's also a lovely garden in the back and a basement bar downstairs - the space is unexpectedly large. And don't worry if you don't catch or understand some of the waiters when they explain the courses - you'll get a take home menu at the end.I'll absolutely be back to try their winter menu!","KenScale: 9.0/10The last time I visited Aska with my wife Jun (who was still my girlfriend then) a couple of years ago in the winter, there was snow blizzard on our way to the restaurant. We were heading over to Williamsburg from downtown Manhattan so obvious the ride wasn't quite pleasant, but I was very glad we ended up making the trip anyway as the meal that we shared was one of the best we had had together. In the quest (starting this year) to find restaurants that we would plan to go more than just once, I thought of Aska as one of the strong candidates. Of course, the tasting menu price at $265 per person (to be secured by $95 non-refundable deposit on Tock website) doesn't make the restaurant a place to visit every day, but if the menu changes on a seasonal basis, I figured it could be one of those places that Jun and I can go three to four times a year (just like I recently designated Atomix as one such place on the KenScale All Star list). I'm happy to report that our second meal at Aska was just as memorable and I'm ready to give the KenScale All Star badge to the restaurant.The tasting menu at Aska has certainly gone up in price (last time I had the 10-course tasting at the restaurant, it was $145 per person), but it was clear that chef Fredrik Berselius's kitchen doesn't settle or play safe even after the restaurant has gained accolades left and right. The plating, starting from the opening bladderwrak with blue mussel emulsion, and ending with the petit fours of ""mignardises"", was just as thoughtful as last time, and the addition to flowers here and there greatly enhanced the visual appeal as well. If I wake up with a bite of potato cake with roe smoked in dried carrot tops and elderflower every morning, I will certainly start my day a much happier person. The razor clam with tiny slices of preserved black pine and cucumber was one fine piece of work, and the textural contrast between the caviar from Poland and the dried cabbage submerged in the sauce made from fermented asparagus juice was quite outstanding as well. You don't often see the tiny brain part of langoustine used in a restaurant, but that's what the kitchen sent out, alongside the tail and claw meat; Jun thought the brain was a little too buttery but I liked its rich flavor. Following another outstanding dish of grilled onion and scallop and the warm Manitoba bread accompanied by butter and whipped pork fat came my best dish of the night, a perfectly poached hake with sunchoke; I was astounded by the silky smooth texture of the fish that was melting in my mouth and contrasted very well with the sunchoke's texture. I don't usually get quail for a meat dish because it doesn't have the same satisfaction in texture that other types of poultry provide, but I had no compliant about the roasted bird (with a rather intimidating display of feet) with summer truffle. After the end of the savory dishes, the black currant tart with fresh cheese served as a nice palate cleanser before we moved to ice cream made from toasted hay and summer flowers that was quite a treat to end the meal.Because getting a reservation at Aska requires the non-refundable deposit mentioned above and the restaurant is still quite popular among fine dining aficionados in the city, I would highly recommend advance planning to secure your table. There is full bar with rather esoteric list of wines (we really enjoyed a pinot noir from Oregon outside of the famed Willamette Valley that developed quite nicely in the air over the course of our meal) from lesser-known regions of the world. It was almost two and a half years ago that Jun and I had visited Aska, so we were greatly surprised by the greeting from our server who noted our previous visit; even chef Fredrik who we had taken photos together last time came by to say hi. I couldn't be sure if anyone working at the restaurant remembered us (even though we were probably the only people that still made it to the restaurant despite the horrible weather outside last time), but the extra gesture of hospitality certainly helped with my impression of Aska even more. As we headed out of the restaurant, Jun and I promised our server that we will be back sometime in November. And we certainly will.","KenScale: 9.0/10When I visited the original Aska at an unassuming dining space inside Williamsburg's Kinfolk Studio several years ago, I instantly knew I would love this restaurant. At that time, I had yet to get enough exposure to the taste of Scandinavian cuisine that stresses freshness of ingredients, clean flavor and minimalistic aesthetics, so the dining experience at Aska was certainly an revelation. When chef Fredrick Berselius decided to close shop about a couple of years ago, I was therefore devastated. Thankfully, chef Berselius promised to come back in a new location, but the new opening of Aska 2.0 has been delayed for a long time until it finally happened last summer. I've been yearning to visit this new location in southern side of Williamsburg to see how it has evolved. On my recent Saturday visit, my girlfriend and I had to brave through the heavy snow, coming all the way from Manhattan. Was it worth all the trouble? Absolutely! I'm so glad that Aska has come back, even better than its original form.On my first visit, I was pleasantly surprised by the use of novel ingredients and techniques inspired by the nature of the Scandinavian region. Compared to the original location, I would say Aska 2.0 has matured tremendously and turned into an awesome dining destination in the city. Compared to the tasting menu that never passed $100 per person in the original location, the new Aska offers two pricier options (19-course option for $215 per person and 10-course option for $145 per person), but I wasn't complaining. If the first Aska was a nice introductory course to Scandinavian cuisine, the new location is an advanced graduate studies course, with so much more technical sophistication and boldness in experimentation. Every dish stands out on its own. Maine oyster was a nice start to the meal, and the next dish of grilled onion and Finnish caviar looked deceptive simple but so marvelous in the complexity of flavor that I was desperately scooping for the leftover caviar to make sure that I have it all. The ""lichen"" dish consisting of chanterelle mushroom and preserved pine shoots was another beauty, with rich, aromatic broth from mushroom seasoned with chanterelle vinegar that was simply wonderful. I've had outstanding beef dishes last year, but I don't know if any of them can top the 120-day dry aged ribeye accompanied by preserved black currant and salted plum. The ribeye was more or less perfect in its juicy, tender state, and the seasoning was toned down just to my liking so that I can savor every single bite of this astounding piece of meat. Desserts certainly didn't lag behind either in terms of creativity of the kitchen. Fermented blueberries and milk sorbet made for a nice combination to clean my palate, but I can't stop thinking about the one that came after, a bowl of birchwood ice cream accompanied by caramelized pine mushrooms. The clean, delightful flavor of the dish was such a joy to savor that I would love to get a taste of it at least once every week. We finished our meal with two delicious bites of chocolate ""truffles"" inside a little bowl that looks like a bird nest and finally woke up from this blissful meal.Aska requires advance reservations by purchasing tickets through Tock, so plan ahead and purchase these tickets. Unlike the casual vibe of Kinfolk Studio that is flowing with artists and local Brooklynite hipsters during daytime, the dining space at Aska 2.0 has seemed to matured as well, with minimalistic Scandinavian vibe with an air of tranquility and serenity that I found a lot to like, especially for a dinner date with my girlfriend. I didn't see any cocktail menus, but there are a lot of carefully sourced wine and beer selections (make sure to start your meal with a glass of aquavit, and Aska has a bunch of house aquavit selections too). I'm glad that Aska has made this glorious comeback. Chef Berselius (who graciously agreed to take post-dinner photos with me and my girlfriend) really knows how to push the boundaries in his culinary vision that is inspired by nature of Scandinavia. I would love to come back soon!",Aska
482,We went here for brunch. The food was ok. We thought the portions were on the smaller size.,1. Arrived 6:40 asked for happy hour menu and was told it was ending in a FEW MINUTES... did he mean 20 mins?? ‍2. Ordered 2 beers ... they were hot3. Happy hour menu posted outside said empanadas were $1.50 4pm-7pm.. but got charged $8 for 2. 4. Ordered fish empanadas and those were good5. Cash only ‍,"Beware price-gouging.I'd gone to PV several times and had good experiences before recommending it to a friend for his birthday party. Fourteen of us were scheduled for dinner on a Wednesday night. A few hours beforehand, Maritza, the manager and/or owner (not sure), told my friend that we would have to purchase a prix fixe. There is no prix fixe on the menu or website; no indication that large groups are subject to a different arrangement. My friend, who'd never been there and wasn't familiar with the menu, assumed that this was normal and that we could also order à la carte. The price Maritza quoted him was $38--a shocking sum, given that the most extravagant combo of appetizer, entrée, and dessert is $26 at most. We tried to order off the menu; no, we were told. When the bill came, it was astronomically high, given PV's prices. I asked the waiter and manager on site what happened; $38 per person, they said. I presented them with my common-sense calculation. They sheepishly admitted that the price was unethically inflated, but said they had no power to fix it. They offered glasses of ""free"" house wine as recompense. I later emailed Maritza. She would not address my allegation of price-gouging. I filed a complaint with the consumer-affairs department.","This is in my ""hidden gem"" category of Brooklyn restaurants. You can find a lot of great Dominican comfort food here with recipes that you can't find in other Caribbean restaurants. This makes the place great for a Dominican brunch.One thing to note about Puerto Viejo is it takes a lot of pride in their hot sauce. In fact occasionally they will setup stalls in food festivals promoting their sauce and selling it. It's actually through one of these stalls I found about this place. The sauce itself is fairly a fairly good scotch bonnet sauce and they give you it when your food comes out. Though its a Caribbean sauce its quite hot so be warned!Not only is their sauce good but Puerto Viejo also has great Dominican food. The first time I was here was for their brunch when I had one of their mangú dishes and their oatmeal drink. I never had either of these but I loved them. I love plantains in general so I like that it is staple to a lot of the food here. When I was here with friends I also had the Ox Tail Stew which was fantastic. I think everyone at our table enjoyed their food a lot.The interior of Puerto Viejo is quite interesting and gives off a rustic Caribbean beach shack vibe. You will see barrels holding up furniture, walls made of both wood and metal sheets, and wooden chairs/tables. They claim that the furniture is recycled from local industries or something. It is quite memorable and I would argue makes the restaurant feel more laid-back. Puerto Viejo is ""the bomb"" as one of my Caribbean friends said about the place. The only real complaint I have about this place is that they don't take credit card but cash only.","Amazing food! I ordered chicken mofongo which was great, but next time I'll definitely get the steak. Everyone else I was with got the churrasco and that was phenomenal! If I were judging this place by the mofongo alone, I'd probably give it four stars, but the steak took it to another level. We also had the empanadas (chicken and beef, I believe),  bacalaitos (fish cakes), and red sangria. All of which were great!","As a Dominican person, it pains me to write a review of a Dominican restaurant that is lukewarm, because our country's food is so delicious and flavorful and usually doesn't lend itself to a 2 star review (I actually want to give 2.5 stars, but that's not possible on Yelp).I've come here on three occasions and have tried different things, trying my hardest to like the restaurant more than I do, but alas some things just can't be forced. There are a few things that this restaurant does right, like the pastel en hoja, shrimp empanada (do not order the chicken empanada... it's not good), and the red beans, but that is not enough to carry a meal out of subpar status. There are just too many things that Puerto Viejo does wrong (and must be fixed) before I can feel comfortable giving a higher rating and recommending this place... I will elaborate below:For starters, PLEASE change up the recipe for your jugo natural (especially the chinola and Tamarindo ones). I love jugo de chinola and jugo de tamarindo, but the juice at Puerto Viejo tastes like chemicals.... there is NO WAY this juice can accurately be labeled as ""natural"" fruit juice- it's gross.Secondly, the rabo guisado (oxtail dish) needs some serious work. The way Dominicans usually make rabo is ""encendio,"" but the oxtail dish at this restaurant definitely lacks a lot of flavor. It tastes like the meat was boiled for a few hours and served. Not a hint or whisper of seasoning to be found.Lastly, if you're going to call something a ""chimi burger"" make sure it is actually a Dominican Chimi and not a regular hamburger. I was extremely disappointed when I ordered this dish the first time I came here and realized that it was not a chimi. Those are just a few suggestions on how this place can make amends. I really want to love Puerto Viejo, but until they switch things up I won't come back.",Puerto Viejo
483,"The food was not the best and I was not able to eat it. We told the waiter that I was allergic to tomatoes and he brought my food it was full of tomatoes, we informed him of the tomatoes and his reply was, ""what can I do, it comes with tomatoes, you can take medicine"" didn't offer to fix it or change it. It was a gyro platter. That's the first and last time I will go there.","I ordered take out from here. I walked by and took a menu last week. The kabob chicken is dry and lacks flavor and arrived cold and had barely any rice. I ordered what was described on the menu as sautéed spinach with garlic and it arrived looking like spinach artichoke dip from a bar. The Shepard salad is small and is terrible. How do you mess up a Sheppard salad? I never had Sheppard salad that tasted like it does from this place. Not at all worth the $38 plus tip for take out and when I called to ask why the spinach looks like this they were rude and said I didn't read the menu properly and told me to walk over and return it. I just had surgery which is why I ordered take out I'm not walking over there. I've ordered spinach before at Turkish restaurants and it never looks like this. I choose this place over two others in the area because this one looked like a small business and I thought to give them support. Never again. Look at my attached photos. Lastly,  the person taking orders barely speaks English to understand what you want or your address for that matter. Anyone that gives this place many stars has not had Turkish kabobs often or frequented enough Turkish places to know how awful this place is. I didn't eat the food. I basically just could have opened my window and threw $40 out the window.",Pros: Food was deliciousWe ordered the mixed appetizer platter and mixed grill kebab entree. The babaganush is amazing!!Cons: The service was so slow...we had originally ordered more food but had to cancel it bc it just took way too long to come out. The restaurant wasn't even that busy..,"Delicious food. We ate:lBabaghanoush ( awesom, smooth roasted eggplant, tahini dip)Sigara Borek ( loved) Grandma's Grape Leaves (best ever)Grandma's Ravioli ( very different, small lamb filled pasta, I m not into lamb but my partner loved this dish.Extra Turkish Pide Bread ( nice to have extra, one big piece comes w each dip )","Small, cozy Turkish restaurant with lots of wall decorations, mostly paintings. There are also outdoor seating. A small oil lamp adorns each table. The food is pretty good but a bit pricey. Their menu is a bit more varied than the typical Turkish restaurant, offering pasta and other traditional dishes besides the usual kebabs. The complimentary bread was delicious and fluffy. I had the hunkar begendi which is a meat dish in tomato sauce over pureed eggplant. I opted for the more traditional lamb, but it can also be cooked with chicken. The dish was delicious. The lamb was so tender and the pureed did not taste much like eggplant. It has the look and consistency of hummus. My friend had chicken saute in tomato sauce which was average.","Some dishes we loved, some we didn't.Ordered:Branzino- little dry or over cooked, plain.  I love branzino but wouldn't order it here again.  It was not horrible just not as good as I'm accustomed to.Lamb ravioli- way too rich.Some phyllo wrapped something- again way too richChicken sandwich-  good, very large, French fries good.Salad - cucumbers, tomatoes, red onion - OUTSTANDING, so fresh and delicious, everyone at our table loved this.Hummus - unbelievably perfect. Outstanding. Memorable, light and whipped and airy and tasty.Turkish rose wine - very good",AGORA TURKISH RESTAURANT
484,"I came here the other night for dinner with a few friends. I came in and sat at the bar, the service was fantastic! The bartender gave us enough time to figure out what we wanted before taking our orders.We ended up getting the fried chicken burger and the al chapo. The al chapo was good, I liked it but maybe a little closer to well done than medium. The chicken sandwich wasn't that great. I like my chicken sandwich to not be oily on the insideI hate when I get fried chicken and the chicken itself is oily.Would not go out of my way to come back, but if you're in the area then why not.","DON'T TRUST pictures they show in the delivery section.I received Frank Burger and last time it came with fries plus an extra box of fries, which that time I added.This time I decided not to add extra fries but the burger came with no side.I called the restaurant and a rude person said that this burger never comes with fries.Really? Am I the liar or you just forgot to put fries in the burger box?No apologies from them.14$ small burger with nothing on the side.Never more!","Was very excited to go here and the gentleman working there told us they were closed for an hour (not indicated on any website or outside). Waited an hour and come back, they tell us they're closed for repairs. Why not express that from the beginning? Poor customer service & a waste of time.",I came here on a Friday evening in a group and we were able to get seated still.The service was great. I ordered the Garfunkel and Tauster- and it was spectacular. The meat was juicy; the bacon was plentiful. There was something just right about the burger and I was really impressed. It was huge and I could only eat half of it. I ate the rest as leftovers the next day.The only minor complaint is I don't think the fries were on the same level as the burger at all.,"I had a craving for a burger and decided to check the best place around for recommendations- YELP of course!  For a last minute decision that happened to be close by, I just say this was one of the most delicious places I ate my entire vacation.To start off, the vibes at this place are amazing. It's small and inviting, has a nice little bar area, and cool art decorating the walls. The bar tender immediately greeted us when we walked in and made us feel comfortable.Their menu had several burgers to choose from. It was truly a hard decision considering every burger description I read was mouth watering. I decided to go with a burger that had maple bacon bourbon sauce, bacon, and Brie cheese. I also got fries on the side.This burger was phenomenal. Cooked perfectly medium as I requested. Tender. Juicy. Soft fresh buns. Absolutely bursting with flavor!!!! The unique combination of toppings was an amazing blend of salty and sweet. The fries? Bomb. Freshly cooked, crispy, and were a fantastic side. My friend ordered a salad which ended up being a boat of lettuce with ranch on it. That was the only menu item that I would steer clear of, but she seemed to enjoy it regardless.If you can't get a burger off your mind you gotta try this place!!","My rule for writing reviews is to only review good eateries, and when they are really good, I must share the location.This place is awesome. The wife and I were looking for a burger after bike riding around Battey Park and as always, I searched Yelp for a recommendation. This place comes up first with 4.5 stars. It deserves five stars. The burger is so delicious and tasty. Order the house salad and you won't regret it.",The Burgary
485,"I was excited to find this place.  It's sunny and pretty with a nice cheese, charcuterie and chocolate menu. I ordered a cheese slate: Gorgonzola, Brie and an herbed goat.  Was to come with fig, strawberry and guava paste.  Was one dried fig sliced, one strawberry sliced in half, two large capers and a basket of breads.  The breads looked nice: a French, a cranberry walnut, a raisin I think.  I stopped looking after I saw the bread crusted in DIRTY LINT.  I returned the bread and they replaced it with triangles of pita, the waitress said all the bread didn't look good so they wouldn't serve it!!!!!!!!  I lost my taste for this meal after that.  Epic fail.","Awful, but why I am I surprised it's a midtown restaurant in a tourist trap area? Came here with a colleague for drinks and some snacks. Everything was kind of terrible. The drinks were on the weak side and the truffle pizza resembled and tasted like a frozen pizza. Not worth your money or your time.","This is a fun restaurant; the drinks, deserts, and service were great, the savory food fine but not special.","We visited NYC for a week in late June.  We found out about Ayza due to a promotion from our hotel across the street for one free drink.  Well, we enjoyed it so much that we came back two other times during that same week.Ayza is a cute wine and chocolate bar on 31st street near 5th avenue (right near the heart of Herald Square).  It has limited indoor seating; however, it has a beautiful interior.  It has a little bit more outdoor seating.  Each time we went, we had excellent service.  The management was always visible and helping out. They definitely were present and added to the authenticity of the experience.  We tried a few small plates throughout the week; however, the star of the show was the chocolate martini.  This was a legit chocolate martini, that was worth every dollar spent.  Hint: They do have a happy hour, which features the chocolate martini.  However, even at regular price, it was a winner.I definitely cannot wait to come back to Ayza during my next visit.","This is one of those places you should go if you're one of those ""Eat Dessert First"" types. Food... drink... desserts... I don't think there's a wrong order to consume these.  Even though it's considered a wine bar, they also have cocktails, and I was quite satisfied to order a chocolate Manhattan using a chocolate-infused bourbon. For the chocolates here, keep in mind that just like some beverages are made for sipping, these are made for nibbling. Don't consume them at ""M&M speed.""In nice weather, you have several seating options, including outside, at the bar, and bistro tables. The chocolates taste equally good at any of these.","I had high hopes for this place after seeing a lot of great posts on Instagram and, of course, their great reviews on Yelp. Unfortunately my experience was not that great and I doubt I'll be going back. I made a reservation for outside seating and we had to wait a little after our designated time to be seated. When we were seated it was far off to the side so we didn't really even sit in the restaurant. Once we took a look at the menu, we noticed their menu online is a little misleading, as it makes it seem as though it's any 4 appetizers for a certain price. However, it is only 4 specific appetizers you can get for a certain price. We ordered some wine and a couple appetizers. We only got a couple sips of wine in before about 5 bugs landed in our glasses. Obviously this isn't the restaurants fault but it was pretty frustrating. We ended up sending them back and they graciously took them off our bill. The appetizers were okay, but pretty small and definitely only enough for 2 people. The servers seemed to be running around and didn't know where the food was supposed to go. We had to tell them a couple times it wasn't our food. One of the managers also came over and asked the couple sitting beside us (who were already in a very tight space) to stand up so they could grab more tables that were folded up against the wall next to them. Just a little unprofessional and unorganized. As excited as I was to finally go here, I very much doubt I'll be back. If you're planning to go for just a drink, it may be a better experience, but if you're going for a meal, I'd say skip it.",Ayza Wine & Chocolate Bar
486,"The mezze such as the labne, hummus and mahramahra were amazing along with the housemade pita. Unfortunately my grilled chicken wrap entree and the chocolate dessert were lackluster.","I went to ilili last week with a friend to take advantage of the restaurant week lunch menu($26 a person for an app and entree). We ordered the hummus with pine nuts which had an awful after taste, the house made French fries with garlic dipping sauce was by far the best thing!! I had the lamb burger as my entree, which the waitress had recommended which was perfectly cooked and very good. All in all, I think ilili is fine but not great especially for the normal menu prices.","There are lots of choices here for dips, cold & hot apps, mains and desserts. The decor was cozy and service was attentive. We sampled a few things (labne,  falafel, cauliflower, beef dumplings) and they were all good but not outstanding. Would recommend the knafeh (warm cheese tart with orange blossom syrup) for dessert. It's on the heavier side and they say it's a portion for two but really it's enough for 3-4 people. But it's so fun to eat! What's not to like about gooey, molten cheese under a crispy layer and then soaked in syrup?",One of the most amazing Mediterranean dining experiences I have had.  We came here for brunch... and I almost never like brunch but I loved it here! Started off with complimentary fresh scones (which I grew up my entire life thinking I didn't like) with apricot preserve... yum!Grapefruit juice.. freshly squeezed? Because it is one of the best. Pomegranate cava/mimosa was okay for me... it was medicinal to me but I am not much of a mimosa/bellini drinker. My brother and I got the lamb burger which was delicious. The buns were very fluffy and this may be one of the only burgers besides In-n-Out where I ate the entire burger including the buns. I chose lamb sausages as my side and loved it. It was very lemony... but that's what I loved about it whereas my two siblings did not. My brother got veal bacon which was very much like brisket... very delicious! My sister got truffled poached eggs. I do not like poached eggs but she ate it all so must be delicious if you like poached eggs and truffle!,"Had a delicious meal here on Saturday. My friend and I arrived slightly early for our reservation and were directed to wait in the lounge area. I thought this odd as the dining room wasn't remotely full. A very nice cocktail waitress checked on us to see if we were planning to stay in the lounge or if we were waiting for a reservation.  We were seated in the dining room upstairs which was perfect-not loud, we could talk and enjoy our meal. Our waiter, Isaac, was wonderful. He helped us choose several small plates to share and a wine. I liked the Brussels sprouts best. We were also brought fresh pita without asking for it when our first basket was empty.It is a more expensive, formal venue- but good for a special meal, not a casual dinner. I am not an expert in this type of cuisine but I enjoyed everything we ordered and would return for the good service.Just an FYI, the restroom is unisex- large room with several private stalls. Some people hate this set up so I figured I would mention it.","I really wanted to love ilili but there are several reasons why I couldn't:1. The ambiance is very formal. The setting is only fitting for a business meeting. It does not strike me as a place to hang out with friends, or bring a date. 2. It is very expensive. I know coming in it's not a budget friendly place but there are no options for the entrees with lower prices except the pasta.3. The knafeh was not good at all!I did love the fattoush, and the cheese rolls. Everything else was ok.",ilili
487,"The food is fine but there's some serious incompetence in the charging department. I ordered 2 sandwiches one night for pickup. Somehow wires got crossed and a delivery guy showed up at my door just as my husband got to the restaurant to pick up the order. We called each other and sorted it out. I would pay the delivery guy and take the food and he would come home. Easy right? All Saiguette has to do was cancel the charge they already put on his card. But they didn't. And when I called them about it they refused to, saying they had already canceled. But that's obviously false because I am looking at the charge on my credit card statement. And because they somehow charged 2 slightly different amounts, my credit card company is too dumb to cancel the charge. TDLR: the food is good but not at twice the price. This place is not big on customer service.","Be careful  The last 3 times that I was there my order was wrong.  I am allergic to fish, I never order fish.  My last 3 orders had fish in it.  When I showed the order to the people at the store and explained that it was wrong, they insisted that is what I ordered.  I would NEVER order fish.  Had I not seen it first and taken a bite I would have been terribly ill.  The person at the counter would not refund me or make a new order for me.  This happened for the last 3 times I went there.  NEVER again.  Please be cautious and check your food before eating it",Service 5/5Staff 5/5Food 4.5/5Price 3.5/5Good atmosphere and food. I Recommend noodles with grilled chicken,"I've been craving banh mi sandwiches and am so glad I found this place on Yelp! Literally a 7 minute walk, so decided to call in for pick up. The kind lady who took my order told me that it'd be ready in 10 minutes.I got their Grilled Lemongrass Pork Shoulder Banh Mi and my boyfriend got their Grilled Chicken Tenderloin. I tried both and BOTH were delicious! They give you so much meat and for $11/sandwich, it's definitely worth! Best banh mi I've ever had. Also, take advantage of their 15% off deal for pick up! Place is very small, so it's more convenient that way too.","I too love Saiguette. My go to is the grilled beef bun (vermicelli) My mom always eats hers w two sides of peanut sauce. Which they never charge us extra for. As previous reviews mentioned, my positives are the wonderful customer service, fast service, DELICIOUS food, and clean kitchen.  Very professional. Diverse menu, really cannot go wrong.They gladly got me a cup of ice water on a hot day when I asked if possible. I also will support ANY business that recycles, and Saiguette goes out of their way to have recycling options available. Two small cons, very limited seating, and sometimes food can be inconsistent, maybe 1 in 6 or 7 times I order, it isn't made as well as usual. Can't explain it more than that.","Come here for the banh mi!! There aren't very many Vietnamese options in UWS, and while this is still a trek from my place, it was worth it! They have a pretty big menu for being such a small take out place.With other options like pho, bun, salads, meat/seafood dishes, appetizers, you'll probably find something for anyone.I opted for the grilled boneless juicy chicken thigh banh mi. Each sandwich is FILLED with meat, pickled veggies, and big cucumbers! The bread is also really good. They definitely don't skimp out on the fillings. Half a sandwich was enough for me, and I ate the rest for lunch the next day (still yummy!)They also give you a 15% discount if you take out. We were lucky enough to snag seats at the window, but beware this is more of a take out/delivery place since it's so small.The sandwiches were reasonably priced, but I thought some of their other dishes like the noodles were a little pricey for being take out. BUT I haven't tried it yet, so can't really judge!",Saiguette
488,"I was excited to find a new Korean fried chicken place in the city and the food was good. But because of their half ass service and the attitude of one waitress I will not be returning. The waitress had a nasty attitude slamming things down on the table and giving me the wrong bill. Very bad first impression. Don't treat customers as if they're begging for something.Dear Kevin, Yes there was one particular waitress don't know her name that had attitude and acted like she didn't want to be there or serve me. The other waitress who actually took my order was nice and hospitable. I'm not delusional, I know how I felt and what I saw. I'm good. Take care.","I was looking forward to trying this new chicken place near me as the wings / drum looked sizeable and juicy. It was around 10pm when we arrived, and We ordered the small combo which is 4 wings, 2 drums. There was a note saying chicken is made fresh so it takes 20 mins - got it, this isn't unusual for Korean chicken shops. We were getting apologies from the waitresses on the wait as it was nearing 30 mins.. I was fine at first since I know big pieces take time to fry. But when the food arrived, it was 8 small wings... which threw me for a loop. Order was wrong, but Why would 8 wings take 30 mins? I was told that they don't have drums anymore, so they gave us 8 wings. They were def smaller than the pics on the site here, and we wondered if we got unlucky what was left of the wings.  The wings were bone dry - the meat was hard to tear off, and the bones actually shattered in my mouth when I tried to bite the meat. The bones on every single wing broke. We ordered other food too which was just ok but really disappointed in the chicken.  2 stars because the waitresses were friendly. But I think if the kitchen can't offer what I'm ordered, the customer should be informed first rather than after the food is made. Unfortunately we won't be back.",This place is hotter than Takashi in SLC.,"While searching for a place to have a bite, We decided to try The Jin.The Jin is mostly known for their KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), which goes really well with beer! Their other dishes are also delicious too! We had Kimchi Pancake, Steamed Tofu and Sautéed Kimchi, Kimchi Fried Rice with an Egg, Marinated Galbi with Corn Cheese, and others. The staff is super friendly, and we also got to meet Kevin (Owner), who's super humble and friendly. Besides the food, the restaurant is also super clean, with a good vibe to hang out and just talk with ur friends, since the place is not too loud, and u actually have enough space to do seat and enjoy, instead being all cramped up seating right next to strangers, like other restaurants around the city. Definitely recommend!","This was one of the new places I tried in NYC for the first time. We got here pretty late, close to closing and felt really bad. They didn't mind accommodating us and making us food even through we got there late. The food came out HOT, fresh and quickly. Everything was really good and tasted amazing. We ordered a lot of food and found ourselves satisfied with everything ordered. In addition - we had a long conversation with the employee/owner of the establishment and he was able to give us some recommendations of what to do in the city since my friend and I were from the West coast. Come check this place out :)","Came by for lunch, while we were museum hoping on our last day in NYC. Which also happens to be a rainy day.. Which is the perfect day for museums. Honestly if we discovered this place any earlier we probably wouldn't of had the chance to try any other places. The menu is delicious, there wasn't a plate ordered that wasn't devoured with the sounds of grunts && moaning at how good each bite was. They have great service && the owner ""Jin"" was very personal. He checked in on us && gave us great recommendations for the remainder of our vacation. If only we lived in NYC, we'd be the best of pals. I would definitely recommend, best Korean wings we've had in a long time.. The sauce was delicious && the crunch was SATISFYING!",The Jin
489,"Not worth the hype.  A lot of hipster bs and food was mediocre.  Waitress said steak was cooked medium and it came out rare.  When we asked about it she pushed the blame off onto the chef, saying the chef cooks it to their desires.  I would not have ordered the steak if I knew up front that it was cooked rare.  I was not able to finish the meal with how chewy it was.  Will not be returning.",Their wine selection is pricey. Paid $18 for a glass of pino Gris and they poured so little I was confused it was for tasting. Their food is good but again very expensive for what it is.,"One of the worst meals we've had in all of Brooklyn. Can't believe this place gets anything but trashed on yelp. First, don't come here if you want to actually have a conversation with the people you are with. The music is pointless, doesn't set any kind of mood, but it is LOUD LOUD LOUD. I'm not one to usually comment about the volume of a restaurant, but we could barely hear the people we were with and I am hoarse today from having to shout to just have a basic conversation with old friends. Not an auspicious entry.Started out with the slowest, most lackadaisical service I've ever encountered. 20 minutes before we could flag someone down to take a drink order, another 20 minutes before the drinks arrived...We had to leap at waitstaff throughout the meal to get any service whatsoever. The cocktails were icky - the rum quality was questionable, the options were limited. Oh, it's a wine bar, you say, so why are you ordering cocktails? Well, when we moved to wine, we were steered towards a particular bottle by the waitress. Holy crap, it was absolutely undrinkable! It tasted like a cough drop and a package of nails were melted down and served to us. Is there someone actually in charge of ordering at this place or are they just taking whatever is available on steep discount?And to the food. The short rib that CLEARLY wasn't actually a short rib and couldn't have looked less appealing upon arrival. The grainy, plain ricotta dish. The fish with teeny tiny bones throughout (though some had been removed, so it was a surprise when you got a mouthful), the poorly cooked brussels sprouts, the merguez and squid with the white beans that were undercooked, and last but not least, the only highlight, the chicken liver pate, which I doubt they even prepared.  I have never, ever been steered so wrong by a yelp review. This place is AWFUL in every respect.",Old van horn location. June is my perfect wine bar dash gastro pub. Service was so fantastic here.. from a few beautiful boys and girls Happy hour from 5-7 was on point Radish dish for happy hour looks like a million $ babeHighly highly recommend,"What a great find! Of all the places we could've chose from in the area, we are super glad we decided to walk in here. Without a reservation, our server was real nice and accommodated us quickly with a seat outside in their cute backyard area. The backyard is spacious and decorated nicely with a wood barn type feel and nice hanging wire lights above. If its nice out, I recommend getting an outdoor seat.They serve tapas here mostly, so small plates to share. I speak for all of us when I say the ricotta dip got us friggin hooked! so good that we ordered a second one before we even finished the first. I'm not sure how that ricotta was that garlicky and creamy but it was to die for. The toasted/buttered sourdough was perfect for scooping copious amounts of ricotta as well. The Heirloom potatoes were also a big hit for us. Nicely cooked fingerling potatoes tossed in a creamy sauce and chunks of sautéed crispy pork belly. The charcuterie board was simple and delicious. My only comment was the eggplant. The sauce was great but the sesame and flakes on top didn't do well for me, great flavor tho. The also have a nice assortment of cocktails and a huge variety of wines.  I got the Silk and Soul, really refreshing, and I highly recommend it!","CUTE! CUTE! CUUUTE! We were seated inside, but the happy hour crowd started trickling out and we moved to the garden and boy am I glad we did! Noticed other parties did the same. The patio deck and garden seating made the entire experience.When you order wine, they give you a swig first to make sure you're satisfied with your selection before pouring the entire glass. I chose a '17 rosé that wasn't too dry.Now the food is GREAT, suuuuper fresh. There were like 6 figs halved in the stracciatella. Ricotta dip was really refreshing, tomatoes were bomb, and sliced baguette was crusty the way I love. I can also confirm the succotash and chicken plate were decent at the least, only because the older couple next to us looked so impressed as they ate their meals. Yes, the seating is elbow to elbow unless you've got a larger party- just a warning.This isn't a 5 for me because desserts were confusing, plates are small (which I get, tapas = small, BUT for the price), and seating is tight.",June
490,These are by far too 2 fish tacos I've had this year! Of course mine would be the first(Sorry I'm competitive lol). This Mexican coke is to die for and the chips & Guac This is my first time here and I brought 5 tacos just for me lol,"Best tacos and margaritas I have ever had. I think Dios himself must be working in the kitchen. Great music, staff and of course food. If I go to prison again and I am on death row this will be my last meal.","This is literally my all-time favorite place for tacos in the city. Do get the aguachiles if you like spicy, don't go during happy hour/early dinner hours unless you're trying to wait because the space is limited. And DEFINITELY try everything at least once on the menu because everything is a hit. Service is fast, drinks are just right and the price is within reason for NYC. I understand your street tacos in Cali or Queens, shoot even in NJ, are $2 a pop but this isn't what we're talking about here. This is QUALITY and AUTHENTIC deliciousness. Don't do yourself the disservice of being a price snob.","You should Definitely enjoy some food here! If you're at Chelsea Market or in the area near 15th Street and 9th Ave, enjoy a fish taco.  Or order the shrimp cocktail, served in a tall glass like you'd see an ice cream soda served in.  Someone at my shared picnic table ordered it, and it looked amazing !! So, my next visit, I'll have to try it.  It is $12.  I can tell you that the fish taco is ALWAYS DELICIOUS , so definitely get a fish taco, and see whatever else appeals to you.  AND PLEASE PUT SOME MONEY IN THE TIP JAR.Drinks and beers are also served here and quite popular, too.There's also an after-work type crowd for drinks and guacamole or salsa.  Place your order, hold on to your paid receipt, and listen for your number shown on your receipt.  Service here is friendly, helpful, and just plain old NICE!!  The staff works hard here, they are really nice , so please remember to show your appreciation and put something in the TIP JAR please.  The food here is fresh and delicious and very reasonably priced.  Enjoy!  A nice place to get a bite between learning sessions at Apple OR Google.  See my photos!","WOWZA, this is los tacos números sister fish establishment!! How did I not get the memo!? I literally stumbled upon it thinking it was a knock off of los tacos and brushed it off thinking TRAITOR, we may never step foot within this establishment.Until I realized I really shouldn't have written it off and upon further inspection realized omg this is FISH TACOS!!!!!!The spicy shrimp tacos were my fave!!!Following by a close second was the fish!Regular shrimp didn't do it for me but still enjoyable.I still have a soft spot for al pastor at los tacos, but this lesser known sister taco spot is the place to be, great ambiance transports you to México! You don't really have to wait in line and there's seating! Olé!!!","This is the hidden gem of Chelsea Market.  While its sister restaurant Los Tacos No. Unos is more well-known, Los Mariscos is tucked away in a back corner of the marketplace.  Just follow the arrows from the Los Tacos stand to find it.  The restaurant is small with charming nautical bits-and-bobs decorating the walls.  It consists of the register, cooking station, bar, and a few tables to sit at.I ordered the ceviche especial and the fish taco.  The especial is mixed seafood ceviche and avocado served on a crunchy tostada.  I loved the textures of the shrimp, clams, scallops, and octopus.  It was super fresh and tasted delicious.  The fish taco was a soft tortilla wrapped around a battered fish fillet with pico de gallo and a creamy sauce drizzled on top.  I wasn't super hungry to begin with, but I DEVOURED that taco like I was starving, it was that good.  I have no idea how Los Mariscos does it, but I'm completely in love with what I ordered.I cannot recommend this restaurant enough, this is a must-try if you're ever in Chelsea Market!Update: Even better experience the second time around!  I discovered that Los Mariscos offers a lot of complimentary snacks to go along with your meal. The bags of tostadas on the tables are free to snack on when you're waiting. I also glanced at the signage above the bar, and they were offering free delicious shrimp broth in a cup.  Lastly, there are house-made hot sauces at the kitchen window.  There are bottled sauces but also special ones the Los Mariscos makes. I'd recommend trying the peanut hot sauce, it's super unique!",Los Mariscos
491,"Not a great experience.  Their ""roasted chicken"" was actually pan fried. It tasted ok but not what we ordered. The bbq chicken sandwich was really sad. Not much chicken and soooo dry. I could see how this place would be great for drinks, appetizers and live music but their dinner menu needs some work.","We sat outside in the back yard, enjoying a terrifically sunny day. It was one of those rare perfect New York Spring Summer afternoons, not too hot, not too cool. The mosquitos were all still in bed, saving energy for their 'reign of terror', due to start in a month or so's time.We supped on chilled rose whilst trying to secure the wobbly table and avoiding a persistent drip from above (it was some kind of drainage issue or a very localised rain shower). Feeling a might peckish our table of five ordered a selection of boards and a plethora of oysters.My consternation and surprise return to Yelp (aren't you happy I'm back?) was motivated by what lay beneath the cheese, olives and deviled eggs. The board on which the food was served was centrally coated in what appeared to be BLACK MOULD! We discussed this as a party but were too meek and shy to bring it up with the waiting staff (who forgot an order of drinks at some point in the afternoon). Was it mould? Could the wood be burnt? But why would it be burnt? There's no pizza on the menu or reason to place it on a stove or in an oven. Oh no, it must be mould?!I did the only reasonable thing to do to get to the bottom of this mystery, I posted it on my instagram stories. Let the people decide if it's mould or not! Of course no-one really knows for sure, but the general consensus leans somewhat to the mould side of things. I would like to point out that the boards were black on both sides, all the boards we encountered had the same ugly patches of suspected mould and that it's not a good sign for a restaurant that you're even having to  question dubious hygiene standards. Also the non-black bits of the boards were dirty. The boards had splits in too, which surely is a preferred hiding spot for bacteria, e-coli and associated gunk.If the black stuff was not mould I would give this place 3 stars - totally generic ye-olde-Brooklyn spot, that you will probably enjoy enough for an evening but never need to go back to. There was no live music whilst we were there it should be noted.If the black stuff was mould (what else might it be?!) then it's 1 star and an ill feeling in my stomach this morning.",Food was bad. Chicken sandwich had about 3 tbs chicken and massive bread. Should have sent back. Happy hour wine are light pours. Solid pass.,"Went there to hear live jazz on a Friday night and was not disappointed. The trio was excellent. Nice selection of small batch gins and single malt scotch.Had their signature burger which was great.The atmosphere was festive and loud. The space is setup well so if you really want to listen to the music you can sit close, or hang out in other areas where the music will be background and the vibe social.","If yelp had 4.5 stars, it would get that. Atmosphere was excellent! Why?! Well, the lighting was that of your therapists office but dimmer. The type of place you'd go to meet a stranger to tell them about your life and learn the secrets of life. The space has a surprising spaciousness. Skinny and long, really gets the job done ;)There's also a spacious outdoor space, with plenty of spaces for you. The food was delightful! I shared the mussels, creamy mushroom risotto, and grain bowl. All were tasty though the muscles were the best, particularly the coconut, lemongrass sauce those little crustaceans were soaking in. The risotto and grain bowl were good, but couldn't keep up. These two dishes are why this place didn't get 5 stars. They had a some good ol fashion string band gypsy folk jazz. Really added to the overall experience though was a bit loud for the indoor space, especially when there were vocals.Last but NOT LEAST, the pina colada, amazing (insert drooling emoticon). It was frozen, because it was so good, time stood still...and because of temperature and stuff. A MUST GET!!!Would definitely go again :)","St. Mazie is a dreamy, lovely spot for good cocktails and live music. Both times I've been I've loved the drinks that I've ordered. I've only done small plates for food but everything I've tried has been great! They have a super cute outdoor area in the back. It gets very busy though so I recommend making a reservation. The only reason I wouldn't give them 5 stars is because the service is pretty mediocre if not below average.",St. Mazie
492,"I'd been wanting to go to 19 Cleveland for awhile, and finally got the chance to, on a recent Sunday for brunch. The dining room features mostly wooden seats and tables, and is quite casual, would suit for a weekend brunch or casual dinner. I got in just before a crowd of people and was seated immediately. My friend had the bourekas Benedict, while I had the shakshuka. The bourekas Benedict consisted of eggs Benedict atop puff pastry- it was tasty, but not amazing. The shakshuka here was not great. I've had many shakshukas throughout my life, and this one was not quite right. It seemed like they had cooked the eggs separately and then put them into the bowl. The tomato sauce also tasted like it was from a can. Would not recommend at all.","Music is too loud, making sure we are out of restaurant right after we pay. Allowing other patron to smoke inside the restaurant. Ridiculous!",Very disappointed of the portion first time order To go jachnun I called they told me that's the way it is it's one piece cut to three  look like Half  cut to three for 16.33$,"I'd been here before and loved it but wasn't rushing to write a review. After my experience tonight, I immediately pulled out my computer when I got home to do so. First and foremost, vibe is impeccable - great music, friendly & energetic staff, pretty decor, good lighting, Israeli atmosphere, etc. Then, there's the food: Falafel, eggplant carpaccio (x2), crudité, hummus (x2), fish shawarma, Branzino (x2), pistachio ice cream, sesame dessert thing. Honestly a weak ordering from us but we were only 3 people and all gluten free :). Falafel superb (tahini is amazing), eggplant was out of this world (hence got 2), crudité was crudité, hummus fire, fish shawarma actually insane (if you mix the tahini in with it), and branzino can't lose. Pistachio ice cream great. Sesame dessert without the sesame crumble was amazing. Hmmm that's about all. I was just so overly satisfied it was wild. Especially on a Monday when you're not so inclined to indulge, but honestly didn't feel like I did. All healthy, not super high carb, great flavor. Yofi! Let's have a great week everybody !!!!!-MM","I had a lovely dinner here with friends. Cute decor and vibe, menu is nice but was curious why there were no meat options aside from the chicken schnitzel. They do have a lot of fish options (salmon, branzino, halibut and some fish based appetizers). I gave 4 starts instead of 5 because nothing blew me away taste wise. We also felt it was EXTREMELY hot in the restaurant even during dinner time. So wondering what was up with the ac, like uncomfortably hot. The fatoush salad is nice although it felt more like a Greek Salad. I've had fatoush salads at Lebanese restaurants and they're very different so perhaps this is their spin on a fatoush salad. Crispy garlic and tomato hummus was good, had a little kick to it and the pita was great. My friend got the shnitzel which was pretty good and my other friend got the pasta which felt a little overly sauced but nice flavoring. They are brand new so perhaps they're working on the menu and things will change. I am curious why there's no meat aside from chicken. Service was pretty good aside from having to ask 2 times for more water.","Food is really good, atmosphere is whatever. Ordered:FalafelLabnehEggplant carpaccio Fetush salad Crudités Hummus Hummus was really good paired with the crudités.

493,"Unfriedly akwardly 'attitudy' bartender and just unfriedly not caring bus boy. Strange system, no waiters- need to go to a different place to order food. The place has a potential, but not very busy on a Friday night, that's very telling.PS lots of garlic in a hummus platter dish, my boyfriend is refusing to kiss me for the next couple of days because my breath reminds him of a Turkish snake charmer.","I was not cool enough to be in this restaurant. It had total Euro-pub vibes with a gorgeous tile floor, but played some Caribbean music... it was a total melting pot of sensations. The food was OK - I had the grilled cheese pita and chips. I'm not sure what I was expecting from a grilled cheese pita, but I was hoping for a little more than just a straight up pita with melted cheese - maybe the pita could've been toasted with an infused butter/margarine, or they could've used a flavored pita? The chips, however, were great - crunchy and salty, and, when ordered as a side, is a big enough portion to share. My friends got the fish tacos and said they were spicy, but the kale salad that was ordered for another (with chicken schnitzel) seemed to be a big hit. I can picture having a few drinks here, especially something combined with their Mexican-imported, REAL glass-bottled Coke!",Food was good but beware they charge for refills on iced tea. Never heard of such a thing. They could at least tell you.,"Awesome staff, delicious affordable food. Scotch egg is out of this world. Cauliflower pita is amazing.","Cute place, not sure why it felt sort of unexpected in this area. Overall there was a good selection of both healthy and more indulgent menu items. I liked how much natural light there was. Comfortable seating options, both low top tables and bar area. There is a chess top table for those inclined to play chess! I enjoyed the Israeli scotch egg with tahini. This place didn't wow me enough to make the trek back for it, but it's a good option if you happen to be in the neighborhood.","Had brunch with Eastwood's version of huevos rancheros and a mimosa.

494,"""Chicken Bastilla,"" attractively described as ""layers of crispy filo pastry filled with chicken,"" etc., arrived as a heavy hockey-puck, flavorless, inedible.

Disappointing dining overall.","Maybe it was the day, the time of day or my order, i dunno but the food did not settle well w/ me. My stomach felt so weird hours after this meal. I ordered the Green Shashuka which came as a baked egg drowned in tomato/onion/garlic specialty sauce alongside hummus, pita and salad. Salad was werid...I think it was either stale or had some odd aftertaste. I didn't risk it and avoided it. I was looking forward to a yummy hummus considering all these positive reviews but that also fell flat to my expectations. I was even disappointed by the coffee!! It was so acidic and burnt coffee flavor. The service was friendly, the restaurant itself is lovely in term of it's space/decor. Maybe I set my expectations too high walking in thinking I'm about to have amazing food - not sure but I was not impressed by the food at all.",An ordinary middle eastern brunch restaurant. I ordered the spicy lamb kebab platter. The kebab tastes good. However the pita is not very soft and the hummus is not rich. Sorry.,"Overall an amazing restaurant. It's small and quaint, very hole in the wall feel, and delicious. The vegan platter is amazing and even better when dining in with the hot fresh pita (with free pita refills). The lamb kebab in the mixed bbq platter was good, not spectacular but still very good. I was much more impressed with the steak. Tender and very well seasoned. I really like this restaurant and is by far the best Moroccan food I've ever had. Also, all their dishes come with a side of beets which I love too. I never ever eat beets because of their taste but whatever La Shuk does to theirs, i was happily surprised and ate all of it.","As a first timer for Moroccan food, I was curious and adventurous. Everything on the menu is an experience that you'll want to come back for. I just love how it surprises me and makes me dare to try new things. Every dish was plated vibrantly that you can already know how good it will be. And let's talk about the Weekend Unlimited Mimosa Special for 2 hours WITH your choice of a breakfast platter!! And the price?--$30. It is absolutely worth it and amazing and let's not forget HEALTHY. The service is awesome, I couldn't ask for more.","this place is kind of far for me but I'd say it was worth the travel. came here to meet up with a friend and for the first time in forever I just know what I want right away (usually I'm the most indecisive person when it comes to choosing what to order). went for the vegan platter because it's exactly the kind of dish that I love.food takes time to come out but this place has a very nice ambience and atmosphere so it's perfect to just chill, talk, and catch up as we wait. service was amazing! the waitress was so polite, attentive, has great vibe, and make sure everything goes alright. and when the food comes, I'm so satisfied with how it turned out. decent portion, and plus it looks really pretty too. the vegan platter contains: tabouli, greens, beet salad, spicy eggplant salad, roasted eggplant salad, hummus, and pita bread.everything tasted great and fresh but the winner has got to be the spicy eggplant salad. it was eye-opening good! i really enjoyed the dish!also tried the lamb kofta and the sauce on the side is so good! the kofta was tender, flavorful, and fragrant! it was amazing.price is average. overall it was a great experience!",La Shuk

Long nights when no one is in your bar sucks. It could make anyone a little short tempered. But pouring shots like this and charging full price just makes you an ass. Would like to come back and try again, but probably won't bother.","Loved this place til they double-charged my credit card, said they'd fix it, then stopped responding to my emails.  Can't call to address this! Very disappointing after spending a lot of time and money here!",10 stars! My boyfriend and I frequent here a lot because it has such a unique and cool vibe. The food and the drinks are delicious so when we got engaged we messaged Alla to ask if we could have our party here. She was very acclimating and made the planning a breeze. Big thanks to her and the team! The party was a blast as expected! Please check it out.Richie and Jill,"Amazing food. Amazing cocktails and drink menu. I don't even live on the east coast anymore, but when I come back to visit NY, this is a must-go-to stop.I think I've had nearly everything on the menu - wings, grilled caesar salad, coconut curry mussels, pickles, oysters - but my fave is the chicken liver bacon sandwich. I literally miss and crave this sandwich all the time.","Came to OTB during happy hour on Taco Tuesday and it was great! When I walked in, I was able to grab a seat at the bar with my friend. Their happy hour is great and has something for everyone. I grabbed one of their $8 negroni and later $9 margarita. The bartender was great and hospitable! I did not get a chance to grab food but will definitely next time.",OTB
496,"I've been here twice for Saturday brunch. Didn't drink either time so I can't speak to the bottomless deal, but the food is subpar. It's hard to mess up a hamburger, but their's isn't all that good.Also it's too loud, there are a lot of groups.",First time having brunch at this place. They offer a lot of food for an affordable price. I got the Nutella French Toast which was garnished with fresh fruit. The toast was slightly burnt which was off putting due to the overwhelming chocolate hazelnut taste. The rosemary potatoes were crispy and flavorful. It was busy when we went so I can't decide if they didn't want to interrupt people talking or if service was lack luster because it took over 20 minutes to get our check to pay.,"Verde is my new spot in downtown Brooklyn.We were 5 guys here for dinner. The place was packed , the bar was full. It was surprising because most restaurant were empty on the street.Food was very tasty and well seasoned. The service was on point...the atmosphere was cozy and romantic.Great Italian restaurant..I wanna try their famous brunch","Love these guys. How in the world have I not written a review for Verde? The owners have changed in the time since I started coming (for the better, the new guys are so friggin nice), but the food is just as good as it always was. But why should you come here? Brunch. This is one of the last boozy brunches on Smith, and if they ever stop doing it, the soul of Brooklyn will die a little. My go-to is a burger (hold the mushrooms) at the bar with a raspberry bellini or just straight champaign. If you have a larger party (read: more than just you and your significant other), the backyard is a really really nice place to hang for 90 min. The backyard is also very baby-friendly, so if one of your best friends happens to have a kid (cough *Mike* cough), Verde affords you the opportunity to get drunk...er...hang out with your best friends kid and have brunch. Come here if you're looking for boozy brunch (any day of the week before 4PM), stay for the food and the yard.","Just celebrated our baby shower this past weekend, just simply put amazing! The whole family enjoyed the delicious family style brunch menu which included fresh baked chibata bread,virgin olive oil and gaeta olives. Along with classic steak and eggs, crispy bacon and house salad, rosemary potatoes, and pancakes with mixed berries. Topped off with Peach, Mango, and Raspberry Bellini.Will most definitely go back again once our daughter is born and have more of Verde on Smith again! I recommend everyone go and try their delicious food and drinks.","Friday breakfast; cool,enjoyable and lovely:)If you like to have breakfast at patio with your loved ones don't miss it.",Verde On Smith
497,"Wow, I'm so disappointed here. I paid $30 for two dishes. One dish has the equivalent of one meat strip chopped up while the other had about the same. Terrible value, my stingy pieces of meat are dry - maybe leftovers that no one finished? Also as I called to complain the person on the other line explained to me the dish of bimbimbap, however I disagree with her take that there should be no meat in this. My boyfriend ""bone broth"" tasted like plastic. Maybe this place is good when you dine in BUT DEFINITELY not when you order.","Ordered the spicy rice cakes, mandu and kimchi. I truly did not enjoy the rice cakes and mandu as they lacked in flavor! The kimchi was the only positive - it came in a cute little jar. I was so excited, but did not enjoy the food at all =\",Waited an hour and a half on Uber Eats. Food was never picked up and delivered. This isn't the first time this has happened with this restaurant so I had to write a review. Tell your k'ooks to get their shit together please.,"I was looking for korean food around east village on a Friday night and was pleased to see K'ook had good reviews and a reasonably priced menu. I actually called the restaurant at 7:30 and they let me make a reservation for 2 at 8pm which was great!I met my cousin here and we ordered a couple of things: the scotch crisp rice egg, two man du guk (mine with vegetable dumplings and his with beef dumplings), korean bbq bulgogi, lychee soju, and a beer. The banchan came out pretty quickly and included kim chi, bean sprouts, potato/pasta salad, and fish cake. These are actually a few of my favorite banchan and I was really happy they were flavorful (I hate when they are bland/disappointing). The scotch crisp rice egg came out next. We ordered this because I saw alot of pictures of it and figured it was a popular dish. In the past, I've had a scotch egg before and it was way too heavy, but this scotch egg (despite being deep fried and with meat) did not seem to heavy when we were eating it. It was definitely quite delicious and I'd recommend it to any first-timers! I've never had man du guk before. But it was a light soup with dumplings and clear/cellophone noodles. It was nothing to write home about, but it was nice because I had already had a heavy meal earlier in the day. My cousin, who visited Korea, thought that his man du guk was on point. In regards to the lychee soju, it was very tasty and you can barely even taste the alcohol--but it isn't the biggest bottle fyi.Overall, our meal came out to around $70 which is quite cheap considering all that we ordered. I definitely think it is worth the price and would come back here. My only complaint is that the service was a bit lacking. We had to wave down the servers both to order and to get the check. Other than bringing food over, no one checked in on us at any point and our waters never got refilled. It seemed like they definitely needed more hands to help out.","Went here for a Friday date night, and was pleasantly surprised! The place was small, and had low ceilings, so we didn't really expect much. So let, start with appetizers, we ordered the seafood pancake, and fried chicken. The pancake was loaded with seafood! There was chunks of octopus, and shrimp, and it was delicious. Usually restaurants just load their pancakes with a lot of filler scallions, but they didn't which I loved. So, we don't normally order chicken wings, but we did this day for some reason, and I am so glad we did. We got the soy garlic flavor. The fried chicken was amazing! The outside was crunchy and flavorful, and the inside was dipping with juice! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I would just come here for those two items.Our entrees were pretty good as well. We had the Budae Jjigae and A beef Dol Sot bibimbap. They were very flavorful and felt like home. They did not skimp out of the portion which was great, so you get what you pay for. We also ordered the Lychee soju which came in a little cute glass jug. The service was great, the sweet lady kept checking up on us, and she even refilled out banchan! We got there around 6:30 and it wasn't quiet busy yet. After that, it started filling up. I highly recommend this place for some delicious Korean food!",Food here is pretty good i just came to get a pic of the scotch egg which is beautiful and glorious. The bibimbap was lacking flavor. The staff is nice but the whole restaurant smelled like cat piss which was a little turn off for mt tastebuds. Would I come back? ProbablySide note: this egg is massive. I thought I could do it myself but I was defeated,K'OOK
498,"Joey Bats is a little Portuguese party shop that's nestled on Allen Street. After seeing that they offer Portuguese egg tarts (natas), I decided to trek out here to give them a try. The egg tarts are $3 for 1 (they also offer a discount if you order half a dozen). $3 for 1 is on the pricey side if you asked me, as I am accustomed to paying a lot less for basically the same thing at a Chinese bakery. The egg tart was warm and fresh out of the oven and the crust was flaky. The sprinkle of cinnamon on top added a nice little touch.Overall, I did enjoy my nata during my first visit here, but the price was unattractive to me. Head on over to Xin Fa Bakery in Sunset Park to grab your Portuguese egg tarts for way less.",My daughter just came back from Portugal and wanted the pastry they're famous for. Did not disappoint!,Joey's snack foods are amazing..The Pastéis de Nata are to die for and double that with a cup of coffee.. you are good to go.. And try their shrimp croquettes You won't be disappointed,"The best Portuguese egg tarts! Smooth, custardy, a hint of cinnamon, perfect in every bite with flakey crust! Definitely eat them fresh and hot, but they're good the next day too if you heat them properly.The guy was really friendly too. The place is quite small though and doesn't really fit many people. The walk to the bathroom is hilarious. If you've been, you'll know what I'm talking about. :)","I remember Joey was selling his pastel de natas at the San Gennaro festival in Little Italy, and he has his own brick & mortar! I am very happy to see that. His pastel de Natas were so memorable! They're exactly as how he describes it and nothing less. Creme brûlée in a buttery, flakey croissant! Sooooo delicious.",We enjoyed the custard cups outside of nbc studio in NYC. Delicious. Best custard cups on this side of the big pond.    As close to Lisbon Portugal custard cups as you can get with out the           time zone change or jet lag.       Enjoy.             Joey's mom waited on us. Very nice place.,Joey Bats Café
499,"Food went wayyyy downhill. Sacrificed the quality of everything here. I used to be a big advocate of fette sau but I will not be returning, nor recommending this to anyone else.","Have been to this place few times before. It was ok and the meat  was delicious. But this visit was horrible. Meat was completely nothing special taste and have many fat inside (brrrrr) , and I have bad after taste for many hours. The old cashier lady at counter have very mean and not friendly attitude. Like she even almost push me to give a tips(I never saw that before nowhere) and buy their boring sides. Really when you have like this overpriced self service place, at list you can provide friendly and nice workers, like I don't want to pay my money to mean people. So sad that this place is like this now. Never will come back and it's many opportunities in Williamsburg and LES.","This place was quite the disappointment. I was expecting much better, especially for the $75 we paid for the to-go order we picked up ourselves. The brisket alone was $30 for one lb. and it was mainly fat. The brisket itself was plain, no flavor at all. The baked beans were decent. The potato salad nothing to write home about. I was shocked that the dinner rolls aren't even made from scratch. They give you pre-made rolls you might as well buy at the grocery store yourself.  Good for them for managing to stay open despite the subpar food.","I was planning on eating dinner later in the day, but my plans suddenly changed at 5:00 pm and I was near Fette Sau and decided to see if I could get in without too much of a wait.  I pulled up and found a legal parking space directly across the street and then walked in to find a few empty tables and absolutely no line (first time I've ever seen that!). I took a look and ordered a nice mix of Burnt Bacon Ends, Pork shoulder and Beef Brisket. I was reasonable and only ordered a 1/4 of each and then sat down with a chatty and friendly couple from Korea (all those empty tables had filled up while I was on line ;-)As always, the BBQ was superb and definitely worthy of the best of NYC title!","Love the atmosphere, very chilled out barbecue joint where on a nice day you can grab a table outside as well. I was worried about this being very crowded having come on Saturday at 6:30pm but was able to easily get a spot for 4. It is self serve for drinks and food (separate counters), the line for food moved fairly quickly. We tried:Black angus beef brisket: texture was not bad- there were some pieces that were less than tenderBerkshire St Louis Pork RibsBerkshire spicy pork sausage: not enough of a punchBerkshire pork belly: this was the best item, melt in your mouth tenderEverything was not bad, I think everything I had could be a little bit more flavorful. It's a really nice place to hang out with friends.","THE BAKED BEANS SIDE DISH IS SO GOOD. I would even just order this as my main. It's got meat in it and the sauce is nice and tangy (better than the other sauces out on the tables).We got the beef brisket, pork shoulder, and pork ribs. I wish the ribs had more meat on them & the brisket was juicier. I appreciated how the server proportioned our meal for us based on the number of people in our party & the number of mains we wanted. On a Saturday around 6:30pm we waited in line for a good 30 min before we got to order.If you've ever been to Green Street Smoked Meats in Chicago, this place is basically that!",Fette Sau
500,"The food was alright; however, it wasn't memorable. You are mainly paying for the environment. Out of everything, I could say the scallops were fresh, but they soaked the onions in balsamic vinegar which gave an acidic punch, no one in the table cared for it. We spent $461, and I've been to seafood places in Astoria cheaper and were better than Marea. It was a huge okay, I'm never going there again. I expressed to the waiter Jose Louis I was allergic to nuts. He assured me multiple times nothing will have nuts (no pun intended) They served me nuts and told me it wasn't nuts it was crumbles. So as I made someone next to me taste the dessert, guess what it was? Peanuts. Instead of him apologizing or bringing the manager to see if I was okay, he switched the dessert. Anyone with anaphylaxis knows how scary it is when you eat have a reaction. My tongue started to get heavy, and my sister insisted on taking my medication immediately. I was so frustrated because I had an alcoholic beverage and now I have to take medicine (not recommended but I'll go to shock) to make sure I don't pass out. I didn't want to make a scene, but I was agitated for I am this high-end establishment, and this one mistake could kill me. One would assume they would remove it off the receipt because I could very well die from just one nut I chewed? Nope, they kept it in. I have a habit of taking pictures of food and in the picture, I posted one could see the alleged crumbles were actually peanuts. This was a huge no for me because instead of communicating with the chef and asking him did he put peanuts, he assumed. I've been to hole in the wall restaurants where chefs would come out after the waiter spoke to them and would recommend me dishes or desserts he/she can adjust.Since it was my sibling's birthday, I didn't want to make a scene and be the ""angry black woman.""","Food here was good, but severely poor service.  Just over 3 hours for 4 courses.  Dirty plates sat on the table for 20 minutes before being bussed.  20 minutes before we were asked for a drink order.  Food was good, but getting the food or even even trying to order the food or drinks was an issue.  After being very annoyed I finally had to ask for the plates to be bussed and that I could actually get the dessert menus because it took so long.  There were stretches of 20 to 30 minutes that we did not see the server and no one stopped by to check on anything.This was by far the most disappointing place I've been to in a long time.I would say a bit overpriced as well after going to jean George, ko, atera, junoon, in the same few days.I would never return.","We have been here several times when in NYC.  The food is usually consistently good, but this time not quite up to their usual standards.  This was the first time for lunch and it was very crowded even though it was at the end of the lunch period so maybe the staff was tired out","I come here all the time and it's likely my favorite Italian restaurant in NYC. The place is very affordable given the quality and reputation.The appetizers are okay, my favorite is still the lobster bisque. But the pasta dishes are must tries. Bone marrow is a must, so is the fusilli and the octopus. The quality of the ingredients is top notch. The only thing I would recommend is to ask for half salt as some of the dishes can be too salty.","We're both gluten and dairy-free, and always looking for the best places who will accommodate us. Marea lived up to our expectations. We started with the Bug Rock oysters, which were incredibly fresh and a great way to start off the meal. We followed that with their famous grilled octopus, which they split for us and offered generous portions (see picture of one split plate). We finished with the 50-day-aged sirloin and could not get enough. I absolutely considered licking my plate clean. There were a few bumps in the road, like our steak came out rare when we requested medium rare, but they made up for it by putting it back on the grill for us, and buying us a dessert. Two made-in-house scoops of sorbet which were unique and delicious. Considering that this is a 2 Michelin Star restaurant and we got 4 things to share for under $150, (not including alcohol) that's a huge win. We loved our food, and had awesome service. We'll be back!",Special place Great cocktails and can eat at the bar Call ahead for a seat busy and interesting people and John is a fine bartender and all out nice conversationistNeed more privacy Reserve a table and feel very special attentive staff Food top of the line Very special not just a working business spot,Marea
501,"Worst falafel I've ever had. The pita was rock hard and only 4 falafels in the sandwich. Very little flavor and with fries and a drink cost over $20. A rare yelp fail. On top of that, service was distracted, didn't acknowledge me and left me waiting for a while to order in a near empty shop.","Inaccurate and sloppy delivery order + terrible customer service. Order was delivered with a crucial item missing (at the restaurant's error). It happens and could've been an easy fix but the incompetence of the ""supervisor"" Aaron has really left a bad taste in our mouth.Aaron had the chance to do the right thing and correct the issue either through delivering the item (that his staff neglected to include) OR refunding the item -- but appeared to be content with his stance that neither were possible. Instead, we could ""visit the next day"" to receive the item. It's a really great experience to receive 80% of your order and pay 100% of the price. Congrats Aaron, you're killing it! We'll save you the hassle of future orders from us so hopefully your can focus on sharpening the quality checks of your orders and customer service skills.","Awful customer service.. they made me wait without telling me why.. when the order was finally ready I had to find it on my one because none will care to let me know. I then asked for the fries sauce and was denied, the girl said it's not included even tho I paid for the fires.. food was good but the experience was not.",This place came HIGHLY recommended by a friend of mines and although I've seen it in passing i was never really into falafels to give it a chance. Plus it's pretty small and ALWAYS busy and crowded (which is a good sign right?) Have to say... I was VERY impressed with my food. I came by for lunch and ordered the green falafel with the works in a pita bread along with some fries with both sauces. In a nutshell I will be back!! Falafels were DELICIOUS!!! So good!! The both sauces that came with the fries are amazing. Was definitely glad that I got them both! Liked the saffron aioli best!! My stomach was full and I was a happy person full of energy afterwards. I will definitely be returning!,"I came here for dinner with a friend as we wanted somewhere quick and delicious. We came here on a weekday evening and since the seating area was limited, we took our food to Union Square and ate in the park.I ordered the red spicy falafel salad. My friend ordered the cauliflower pita. There are a plethora of vegetarian dishes so come hungry vegan friends! The food kept well during our rather long walk out, much to our delight. My salad was delicious, well dressed, and had a good amount of falafel in it. The falafel itself was delicious, crispy, and light with a great amount of spice level. My friend really enjoyed her cauliflower pita as well.Overall, really great Mediterranean fare that is very reasonably priced. The prices are under 10$ which is an absolute steal in a city full of overpriced food.","Tiny place serving a taste of heaven!! Must visit if you love Mediterranean food- falafel and cauliflower in particular. You can choose to have any combination on a salad, pita, or platter. They also have different colored falafel you can pick. My favorite part is that they offer so many different toppings you can add for free. The seating area is limited in the shop and they provide a cute bench outside you can use to enjoy your meal. Inside, they provide water and great music. The service was super friendly - when I was picking up my pita from the counter, a cauliflower fell out and they quickly replaced it without me saying anything. Thank you!!I am such a huge fan of Taim and will definitely be visiting this and other locations anytime I want a quick casual bite that is filling.",Taim West Village
502,"No, no, no, what happened to this place?  Why did they move?  Bigger doesn't always mean better, guys.  They should have remained put in their original location, it was perfect as it was, and now its lost it's appeal in more ways than one.  I don't get the tacky decor, it's no where near as dope as the small shack where they first started out, and sadly, that goes for the food as well.  I was surprised how the quality has suffered and I could tell the same level of attention was not being paid to the food, what with a busier kitchen servicing the larger volume of diners at this new, and bigger -- yet not necessarily better -- location.  It wreaks a bit of pretension.  And, nothing we ate was as memorable or delicious as we both recalled from previous experiences at their first, now de-bunked (sad) location.  Their food is no longer the ambrosia of the gods.  I hate to say it, but, I can't say I'll jump at the chance to return again.  They are also pretty overpriced now!","Sub par and overhyped Vietnamese cuisine- service is average. Ambience is quintessential Bushwick. The banh xeo we had was passable, but I felt the mains were lacking in flavor. Food also took a bot longer than average wait times to come out. Would not recommend.","Management is unreasonable and oblivious. Our friend has nut and shellfish allergies so he brought his own food to the restaurant for our group outing. Despite all of us being paying customers (including him) he was not allowed to eat his food inside. This was after the host told him it wouldn't be a problem. Instead, he was asked to take t outside as our food arrived--so we couldn't even leave anymore. He was instead forced to eat outside in the rain.","Came here for dinner with the bf and 2 of my friends a few weeks ago. The restaurant is in a rather industrial part of East Williamsburg/Bushwick, and the building it's in is a warehouse. The restaurant's interior is full of kitschy Vietnamese/South East Asian decorations, and it kind of reflects the menu, which is full of modernized and Westernized versions of traditional Vietnamese dishes. I got their vegan pho and would have loved a cruller with it, but they happened to be out that night.My pho was decent: not the absolute best that I've ever had, and certainly not the worst. I wish it had a little more body to it, but it was tasty enough. The rest of my party seemed to enjoy their respective dishes, so all in all, it was a pretty good dinner experience for us all. Also, we were told by our server that they grow their own mushrooms in house, which we thought was pretty cool. Would try out again, if I happened to be in this part of Brooklyn again.","Bunker! So good! Very skateboardy vibe and good music.Food: fresh, delicious. Very fresh, varied (good for vegetarians), and great portion sizes.Drinks: good happy hour deals. Even on weekends.Music: hip hop and chill soul (think Anderson.Paak) Family friendly as hell! Lots of kiddos running around but the place is so spacious, you don't get annoyed!","Don't be deterred by the area this is in, a desolate block of run down warehouses and such, this place is a gem. Came on a Sunday afternoon about 2:30pm and it was really packed. There was no seating in the main restaurant where they had a cool jazz band playing so we were taken ""outside"" to the covered area which is like a greenhouse and felt every bit like one. It was so hot and uncomfortable that the fan next to us didn't help. For drinks I got Kaffir the Reaper, a lovely, smooth Bourbon drink and my friend had a glass of Prosecco. We were starving so we ordered the crab spring rolls to hold us over but 25 minutes later our main meals came but not the appetizer. We let the waiter know and he apologized and brought them a few minutes later, on the house. My friend had the Chicken Sausage Bánh Mì, a large sandwich filled with lemongrass sausage and all the trimmings. I was disappointed they ran out of the Bún Thang but had been eyeing the Oxtail Hash the guy next to me at the communal had so I went with that and was not upset for long. The flavor of meat was outrageous and the portion was really good. We were very full but they also offered us the Tapioca Rice Pudding on the house for our inconvenience that also was very good. Even with the blunder and the uncomfortable heat of the room, this place was outstanding and would definitely visit again.",Bunker
503,"The first time I came here, I was ecstatic because I didn't have to trek too far for some decent ramen (there is a close by L station!). I've been back twice since, and each time, it was just A-OK. Broth didn't seem as good, add-ins sub par (especially the pork), and it was getting annoying cracking my own egg. Each bowl was about $25 plus...I have moved on and will explore other options.",It was okay quality but very expensive. The place was located in a not very good part of Brooklyn. Ummm perhaps the newly opened midtown one is better,"Showed up at 9:58 and there was a ""sorry were closed"" sign. According to the web, they close at 1030. Lady at the front said ""sorry we closed early because there was a big line and we weren't sure if we'd get out on time"".Hungry and disappointed that we wasted a 20 minute drive for this.","This is expensive ramen but its definitely delicious. I can't say if it's worth it just yet because of all the other amazing offers NYC has to offer but it's worth a try.It's definitely authentic and extremely customization giving you options for all compartments of the ramen bowl (firmness of noodles, spiciness of broth, etc.) They do have the famous single booth dining which is quite an odd but satisfying experience.","A really famous place in Japan for Tonkutsu.  Its ramen taste like no other place could do it.  The broth is spectacular.  I love the idea of secluded seat from your friends to enjoy the the savory taste. The place has a unique arrangement for seats and it tells you the empty seats.  There are hooks under the tabje for your purses which I adore. Cold or hot water are available and very accessible for you.Back then, Ichiran was only located in Williamsburg which I visited during winter time.  I believe that you should only go and have tonkotsu on winter time.  My last visit was spring which I thought was a very bad idea.  Since the place in Midtown did not have a/c and just had their door open for cool breeze, the place really smells fishy and distinct of that broth.  I did not  enjoy it since it bothers me a lot in a bad bad way.  It smells like a plate that has not been washed properly.If you want an authentic Tonkotsu ramen visit this place.","I have been coming to ICHIRAN since they first opened in New York . I used to be a fan of Ippudo but started to like the broth of ICHIRAN more .It's a cool experience to dine in a single person booth and you don't need to interact much while ordering . All you need to do is filling out the order form and pressing the button. The ramen is customizable based on the saltiness, thickness of soup, spicy level , firm level of noodles etc. Make sure you order the recommended set ($24) which includes soft-booked egg, scallions,kikurage mushroom and dried seaweed. If you can take a little spicy, try pick the spicy red sauce ,medium level .We love the broth so much so we always end up ordering refill (Kae-Dama). They used to give out noodles refill vouchers in the past but now it's free either full or half order ! We tried the green tea beer ($8.90)and it's different and refreshing . Other than that the drinks there are on the pricier side. Will try their matcha pudding next time since there are many good reviews about it. The service is good and they are no tips restaurant.",ICHIRAN - Brooklyn
504,"Terrible service, had to get up and flag staff for anything and everything. (They were not busy)Food was in small portions and again staff never checked table for more bread.Was hoping food would make up for indifferent and slow service. Lamb chops were over cooked, under seasoned and served with breakfast potatoes? TLDR; Bad service and mediocre food, will not return","I'd give this place 2 stars for the food and because its a BYO, 0 stars for the service. We came here on a Saturday night for a birthday dinner. We called ahead for a table of 7 people for 9pm..We then proceeded to get the worst service possible. If it wasn't a special occasion and we had a smaller group I would have left immediately. We were constantly trying to get the waiter's attention for anything..to ask for water refills or for them to take our order and we were constantly met with dismissive and rude attitudes. There was no one else in the restaurant so we really couldn't understand why the service was so terrible!!That all being said, I had a lamb dish which was really delicious but after my experience I would never recommend anyone I know to patronize this restaurant.",I was very disappointed. I ordered scallops and did not realize it was an appetizer for $19.00!!! It would've been kind of them to call to confirm that's all I wanted. When I called to ask about the small portion it seemed to have been funny to them. The delivery person also called to complain about how they treated him..as if I could do something for him. Scallops were flavorless. Really not worth $19.00,"For a reason I can't fathom, they don't advertise that they have a BEAUTIFUL backyard terrace. Imagine sipping a watermelon mimosa in the sun in your own backyard, now add delicious food and you're at Seed. Wonderful food, speedy service, and a quintessential park slope ambience.","I came here for my birthday and I really wanted to like this place as I love  Mediterranean food. I chose this place as it has high ratings.I order the lamb skewers platter ($22) and it came with rice, yogurt sauce and lamb. The lamb was dry and some pieces were a bit too raw and was not very flavorful.Mezes -Platter with a variety of dips and 2 grape leaves. The grape leaves stuffed with jasmine rice taste the best. Most of the dips were rather bland. Hummus- Not as good as the one from Agora. Chicken skewers ($21) platter- This was the saving grace. The chicken was juicy and very well done. The bread did not match with the food serve. They were dinner rolls and did not go with the meze dips. The dinner rolls were more appropriate for a steak dinner. I was expecting more of a flat fluffy bread like the ones they have at Agora (Turkish Restaurant in the upper east side).Service was very dry. The waitress was not welcoming and was mostly in the back and the restaurant only had two other tables filled. The service was lacking and the flavors were also lacking. Will not be back.","I've been to Seed several times in recent years and always leave satisfied. It is a quiet restaurant, with the friendliest if staff. They may not rotate their menu as much as other nearby restaurants BUT what makes Seed great is that they do a mid-size menu exceptionally well. Portions are appropriate and flavors bold. Don't miss out on this Park Slope gem!",Seed
505,"Cute wine bar with nice ambiance, but the tables are located way too close to each other - terrible if you're on a date or trying to have a private conversation as the people sitting next to you can hear you and you can hearing the annoying and loud people sitting next to you.The cheese and charcuterie board we ordered was ok. The wine flight I ordered was terribly disappointing. Only one of the glasses of wine was drinkable, the others were so bad I couldn't drink them. I expected better from a wine bar. Service was friendly and attentive.",Ravioles and escargots.And cheese :)Sidewalk brunch.Will be back for wine & baked camembert for sure!,Very overpriced with average quality food. Lamb rack was nothing special. Drink was not good either.,"This west village gem has made it to UWS. Wines out of the world. Service was amazing Food strictly ok, roasted nuts seemed too stale.","This place was recommended to me by multiple people so I thought I would give it a try. The ambience, the service, and the food were all top notch! We ordered the duck, the Cornish chicken, the ratatouille, and the apple dessert. All of the dishes were amazing, and paired wonderfully with the wine suggestion our server Jeremiah provided. We came to this restaurant during happy hour and truly enjoyed the best food for a very decent price. I will definitely come back!","I got to know this place when I was in San Francisco, where I was a ""regular customer"" if we can say so....So when I was in NYC, I had to go there.The staff is perfect, very pleasant and the wine list is pretty good too.

The drinks were quite weak and on the sweet side. But happy hr until 7pm had $8 cocktails, $7wine and sake and $5 beers. The lychee martini was too sweet for me, so I'd probably skip drinks next time. Service was good and we didn't feel rushed even though there were only about 6 tables on the 1st floor. Total was $25/person which is really reasonable.","We were in the area to look at something and happened to come by this place. The wifey wanted some pork buns.We got seated and looking through the menu, but the waitress came up to us and said, do you mind moving somewhere else, we have a large party (5). So, we were moved from a sit down table to a barstool. It wasn't so bad, but the chairs were higher.We got the pork buns, they were ok, but not memorable.The shrimp dish was not so good. It wasn't bad.  They also only gave out 5-6 shrimps in the dish.  I was like... that's it?!?!The highlight of the meal was the hello kitty dessert that we got for free.  They gave us 3, which was nice.Overall, to me, based on the yelp review, the place was a-ok. It's not exactly a 3 star, that's 60%, but it's not exactly a 4 star place to me. I'd give it a 3.5 star.I probably won't come back, but nothing was wrong with the place.

507,"**UPDATE**The owner called me today to explain the situation, and I completely understand now what happened. Given the conversation took place through a third party (Seamless), they had incorrectly informed the restaurant that there was a problem with receiving the wrong salad rather than an issue with the chicken, to which they responded, ""the order is fine, because the right salad went out.""  The owner offered a refund and explained had Seamless told them the real issue, they would have fixed it quickly. Which is a lot more in line with their high standards of food I've experienced in the past. Thanks again for taking the time to fix this silly miscommunication  ----------------------------------------------I ordered the chicken souvlaki platter alongside the Greek salad for pick-up through Seamless. I arrived 20 minutes later to pick up my order and went home. When I arrived home and opened up the package, the salad was great. However, the chicken was undercooked (pink in most parts), rubbery and barely warm. I got in touch with the restaurant through Seamless to tell them about the issue. After a few minutes I was informed that the restaurant has denied refund or to replace the chicken platter because, and I quote, ""for us, the order was fine.""I'm not even sure what that means. As the customer, I'm informing you the chicken is raw. I'm even willing to take a picture to send to you, but apparently that's not enough given that the ""order was fine.""The undercooked food is one thing, but to refuse the opportunity to amicably fix this is a whole different issue. Completely unprofessional and quite sad that a place of business would rather blame the customer than try and fix the situation.","Let me start with the positive. Came in for brunch on a beautiful spring day. The space is great for that because it has indoor and outdoor seating. The server was super nice and professional. He did the best he could under the circumstances. 2 stars for these positive notes.We ordered 2 brunch entrees with brunch drinks. Simple enough. So we thought....The drinks take a while to make and when the server returned; he stated they did not have the brunch cocktail on the menu. ok....we ordered a different drink in substitution of the one they did not have on the menu. time passes. more time passes. However, we are doing ""ok"" because here we are with cocktails on a beautiful day. right? :/  but more time passes. and then some more.....And now we are getting a hungry. Finally the food arrives...and man--- it pains me to say this...but this was not good.My partner frittatta/omelette was really over cooked and the salad on the side looked like something a kid could do. And I ordered their version of a BLT and it looked thrown together with the same sad salad on the side. Then I see no bacon in the BLT. Huh? Also the menu states the sandwiches come with fries and not salad. I am confused. The server apologizes and takes my sandwich back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, I start eating my partner's overcooked frittata because so much time has passed and we are starving. He looks at it and we are so hungry, we get pass the poor presentation of the food. The server returns and the kitchen does not have bacon. Huh? What? No one knew this as we sat here for all this time? He asked if we wanted anything else. I mean......soooo much time has passed now. Now this is just ridiculous--couldn't make this up if I tried. I order the meatballs and side of fries.  My food finally comes out...and this dish is underwhelming. The meatballs looked they were reheated in a microwave and the fries were the leftovers from the fryer. At this point, we drink our cocktails and we are so sad. We live in the area and wanted to try this place out. But this was a bad brunch and bad food. At this price point, I would recommend other Mediterranean restaurants in the area and another one in SoHo. Our server was aware of the everything and may have been a bit embarrassed. He was sweet. Unfortunately though, this place is a no-go. well..at least for brunch.","I honestly feel robbed. I should have listened to my gut instinct which told me to turn around as soon as I approached the door. Went here with my boyfriend for his birthday and we were both so disappointed. My entree came out a full 15-20 minutes before his meal which made for an awkward choice. I opted to be polite and wait for his to arrive which meant I would be eating a cold, overpriced meal. To make it worse, the waitress never came over to apologize for the delay and let us know that it would be out soon. Instead, she completely avoided our table and took a longer path through the dining room to approach the tables that were beside us. Things do happen, I get it, but please don't make matters worse by blatantly ignoring your table when there is clearly a delay or issue. Aside from that, the food was overpriced and not good at all. I feel like I wasted money and calorie allotment. Definitely won't be returning.","Wow. And I mean WOW. This place seriously is the closest to actual Greek food in the USA that I've ever tasted. Some friends and I recently ate at Ela and we were infatuated with the quality and service of this restaurant. We all ordered some sort of chicken dish with Ela fries. The chicken was sooo tender and sooo well seasoned, seriously brought my taste buds right back to Greece. We also ordered a bottle of Santorini wine and it was delicious. Cannot wait to return! Excellent place!","I used to be a fan of this restaurant when it first opened.  I think they have recently made a lot of changes.  I am grossed out by their Greek Salad price.  $18?!?!?!  That's double the price what I pay in Greece, having just come back from a visit recently.  It is $6 more than what you can order from Cafe Mogador which is just around the corner and has FANTASTIC Mediterranean food.  Go there instead of Ela.In addition to the outrageous price, they have also implemented a processing fee if you were to pay with credit card.  I have not heard of any restaurants doing that.  Overall, I am not a fan of Ela and will not be going back there again.","Ela Taverna makes authentic homestyle Greek food.The portions are huge and extremely filling. I can see this becoming a go to spot in the winter months. I was only able to eat half of my dessert which never happens but I was just so full.We ordered zucchini croquettes, Vegetarian moussaka, halloumi, baklava and another dessert which was a chocolate cookie, almond situation.Everything was good, nothing amazing and nothing bad just good.There was a group celebrating a birthday - they turned off all the lights in the back room when they brought out the candle in the dessert which was really nice. At first I thought that the power had gone out but realized what was happening after hearing singing/chanting.There is a fee if you pay by credit card so it might be easier to pay by cash. There are ATMs in the area including and on the same street as the restaurant. All and all 3.5 Stars, will definitely go again or at the very least order for delivery.",Ela Taverna
508,The food here really is delicious. The only thing I'd complain about is the price. A tad bit expensive for my blood. But everything was flavorful and hearty. I think that was the first time I finished my bowl of pho. Usually it's so big that I can't finish. I'll be back to try more dishes.,"This is my first time going to a Vietnamese Restaurant. The waiter was really nice and the restaurant was very mellow and I felt very relaxed. For my starter I had Bañh mi sliders which was really good!. I enjoyed it more than my entree. For my entree I had slow cooked beef short ribs that was served with a papaya salad. The ribs was really good, but I didn't enjoy my papaya salad. I wish it came with something different because I ended up eating just the ribs by itself ""which I got tired of eating after a while. I would def go back and try something else.","2 stars and only for service - staff was prompt and friendly however I cannot justify paying $20 for a bowl of pho and still leave unsatisfied. Fiancé and I drove all the way from Brooklyn bc we heard good things about their noodle soups and we were craving Vietnamese food at the time. We ordered the District pho that everyone was raving about online however it was extremely mediocre; broth was not flavorful enough. Doesn't even taste like they used any real beef bones to cook the pho broth which is standard for any authentic bowl of beef pho.. The cherry on top is that any additional toppings cost extra - we ordered tendon and tripe and that was $2-3 extra...in summary, overpriced mediocre Asian food. My Fiancé is Vietnamese so we have had abundant experience eating out at Vietnamese places around the country and also making it at home and everything has honestly been much better than what this restaurant has to offer. Sadly The Vietnamese food scene in nyc remains a disappointment","The district pho was amazing!! Huge portion! And so so so so so delicious! So my friend and I have been here a few times and always had great service. This is a loud restaurant so it can be hard to hear people.The octopus appetizer is delicious but the pieces are a little big and awkward to bite/eat. Also the sauce it comes with is a little spicy but delicious. Love the tomato fried rice. I need to remember to ask for it to not have pepper for my toddler, but it is delicious the way it's meant to be.","I came to visit my friend in Astoria and i havent been here in a very long time!!! He tols me about it and it we all ordered pho and of course the chicken wings and taro fries to share.The taro fries were the highlight of the meal. It was tooo SLAMMIN and  crispy and the inside was almost sort of soft with the honey glaze on there was like YIKES! The wings were really good, crispy skin with juicy insides!","i came to dinner before movie with a group of friends one weekend. everyone either got pho or the steak and eggs. we got the chicken wings and taro fries to share. the taro fries were honestly the highlight of the meal for me. tooo perfectly crispy and the inside was almost sort of gooey. i think there was also some sort of soy honey glaze on therethe wings were also good. really crispy skin with juicy insides- probably cause there was a good layer of fat that melted during the fry the steak and eggs were good but i wouldn't say it was remarkable i think this place is slightly over priced for viet cuisine- but based on the interier, it is probably meant to give a more upscale vibe than your average chinatown pho place so it's acceptable once in awhile for group outing, date, or celebration i suppose.",District Saigon
509,"Incredible dishes! We stopped here for a late lunch (around 1:30 pm) and received our food within 20 min. We shared the lamb cumin noodles, spicy lamb dumplings, and seared noodles. Our favorite dish was the seared noodles but all left us wanting more!","Beware of the spicy food, it's delicious but it packs a TON of heat! Stay away from it if you can't handle extremely spicy food.","OMG, it is just not tasty at all. Don't even bother the name Xi'an cus it's not classical, not even close ok? The classical Xi'an noodle is very chewy and it's pulled as noodle with regular WIDTH.Please respect the traditional, please. Yeah, Xi'an has this very famous dish, but it's not you, ok? I wish I could give 0 star on this!","Did not realize at the time that I would be craving their lamb cumin noodles for days after dining here.I was staying at Hotel 50 Bowery in Chinatown and was just looking for restaurants nearby. This place came up and I noticed it was an Anthony Bourdain restaurant so we decided to check it out. Nice to have a cheap lunch after all the money we blew in NYC! My husband and I actually never eat Chinese food back home in SF and I'm generally not a fan of noodles and dumplings but I love this place! We ordered the noodles, cucumber, spinach dumplings, and an iced tea for around $30. It ended up being quite a bit of food. We got everything at the regular spicy level which was spicy but not unbearable by any means. I spent a large part of my time eating here reading the one star reviews from people who ordered the food with no spice. There are reviews complaining of zero flavor and reviews complaining they were dying from the spice of their no spice meal. Pretty entertaining! The cashier was beyond friendly and gave us lots of suggestions. Restaurant is roomy and clean. I didn't realize at the time of ordering my tea that all three of the teas are actually self serve so I think you could try all the flavors if you wanted to but I just stuck with my chrysanthemum tea that tasted like my childhood. Fun meal for our last day in NYC!","Must try: Everything! I loved the Spicy & Tingly Beef, Stewed Oxtail, Spicy Cumin Lamb, and Mt. Qi Pork - soups. I loved their Spicy & Sour Lamb and Spinach Dumplings. I loved their Chang'An Spicy Tofu and Spicy Asian Cucumber Salad. Why: Bold flavors! If you like spicy, they use sautéed spicy cumin, Sichuan peppercorns, and chili oil. And yes, your mouth does tingle (because of Sichuan peppercorns) if you eat the Spicy & Tingly Beef! If you like strong flavors, they use ingredients like cilantro, celery, and scallions. If you like meat, they offer beef, chicken, lamb, and pork. Notes: The soups are always super hot so be careful on first bite or slurp! Know what your taste buds can take in terms of spiciness - you can try mild and work your way up.","I love love all of their noodle dishes but especially the liangpi (cold noodles) and the lamb or pork sandwiches! The cumin in the lamb is superb. The pork in the sandwich is fatty and melts in your mouth. I usually add black vinegar to the cold noodle dish, it adds acidity and makes the dish 10x better. The hawberry tea works well with the food. The tartness from drink helps cut the slight heaviness from the meal. I've been a regular for a while now and will keep coming back. Highly recommend.",Xi'an Famous Foods
510,"Have came to the brazen tavern several times, the veggie burger is bomb. But i went to the bar with a few friends and the bartender completely ruined the vibe. A friend made a really nice compliment to the bartender and he took it the wrong way and just gave us serious attitude all night so we just left cause he was not fun to order from and did not deserve our tips. He also was whispering about us to his co worker. My friend even apologized realizing that he took his comment the wrong way and didn't mean to be a jerk and the bartender said ""yes you did"" so we paid our bill and left cause the bartender is not friendly at all. Don't become a bartender if you aren't people friendly.","Our sole intention was to come here for post dinner dessert and drinks.  Specifically, their fondue dessert which drew me in for a first visit.  Drinks, service on a Friday night after dinner around 11 pm seated at the bar were more than sufficient.However, my qualm is with the shameful dish they tried to pass as chocolate fondue.  Simply disgraceful.  It was nothing but melted chocolate in a small bowl with minimal accompanying sides.  It was stale, lacked basic flavor, amongst other things.  Nothing tasted fresh about that dessert, sad to say.  And I dislike, with a passion, bringing my best friend to a place for dessert to only be impeccably dissatisfied.    The pouring of alcohol while being seated at the bar was more than sufficient (facetiously expressed).Peace.",They need to update yelp.  I came to meet a friend and the door was closed.  A lady with an attitude came out and said they opened at 12 and not 11 like their yelp page states.,"Great service!  Made a reservation through Yelp and they were ready for us, no wait.  Loved the brussell sprouts and bacon.  Excellent strawberry mojitos too.Tip: if it's not taken, there's a great little lounge area in the back with couches.  It's quieter than the main areas.","Above average pub located in the vicinity of the theater district but a bit more quiet since it's on a side block between 8th and 9th Avenues. We randomly dropped in after seeing a matinee Broadway show and were quite content with our choice.Warm atmosphere made lovelier by our adorable waitress (straight from Ireland with brogue), who was attentive to not only our table but everyone in her station.We both started things off with a Rose. At some other pubs, ordering wine can be hit or miss. For instance, a few months ago at another business, the Rose was as sweet as a wine cooler. No worries here because our waitress brought a taste prior to ordering and it was delicious.For main, I selected the Tavern Salad (not many inclusions) at $10 but for an additional $7, I included grilled chicken and it served as a satisfying meal. Other salads looked quite good, but if adding chicken or salmon, some climbed up to $25. In fact, their mains averaged around $23, typical of most pubs. I was pleased with my salad as it was very filling and a  generous portion loaded with lots of delicious, grilled chicken.My friend chose the veggie burger served on a Kaiser bun but substituted a side salad including avocado instead of fries.She really enjoyed her meal and was stuffed.Overall, Brazen Tavern was a welcoming,  fun (good subtle music playing) spot to grab a bite pre or post theater or just in general.  I'd definitely return!","Had dinner last night with some folks. This place is huge and our party sat upstairs in a cozy corner. There was no wait and service was attentive and friendly, despite the packed house.I'm trying to eat healthier (let's not talk about it... k? thanks) so I skimmed the menu for meat-free options. Brazen Tavern has meat-free options a'plenty (salads, eggs, flatbreads, and more) . Our waiter Lucas was cool. I ordered the veggie burger. Lucas didn't know what kind of vegetables were used. I was just praying it wasn't a standard frozen patty. Luckily, they seem to use a mix of fresh vegetables. The burger was delicious. The addition of grilled onions helped me forget it was meatless. The french fries were also good.Now...I trusted Lucas for his opinions on the mojito. But, the mojito was pretty terrible. It tasted like some sorta sour mix and nothing else. Just a weird flat sour flavor. No effervescence. No muddled lime/mint. Just sour. Bleh.I'll definitely return for dinner (and brunch!) at The Brazen Tavern.",The Brazen Tavern
511,"Modest sized restaurant with seating around the bar and a humble outdoor patio.  Easy finding street parking around dinner time during the week.  Was surprised to have difficulty making a reservation on a Thursday - so book ahead - they fill up fast.  Our waiter Daniel (I told you I was going to yelp about you!) was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu.  Like - could tell you the history of ingredients ""knowledgeable.""They'll recommend 4-6 plates to share, but really you should order more.  Not to satisfy your hunger, but to satisfy your curiosity.  You can pretend you're a pro and plan out your meal ahead of time, but you'll just be left bewildered when the waiter begins to list off the many delicious daily specials.  Even though the sardines were disappointing, the spreadable sausage, croquets, and fried artichokes made up for it.  I hate to comment on specials because it'll just break your heart when you go and it's not available, but the foie gras and the scallop special were quite memorable.",Was hoping for so much more. Highly disappointing. Flavors wereBland and prices were high for what you get. First and last for us. F us one timeAnd that's enough. Service and atmosphere is nice enough.,"I'm sad to give this place a 2 because we had high expectations going in for our reservation. We were a reservation of five people at 8:15. Our experience went from good to pretty bad by the end of the night.Our first waitress was really good and was knowledgeable about the menu and experience. But we definitely over ordered even though it's tapas style dining. Dishes like the artichoke (alcachofas) and garbanzo fritos can definitely be shared by 5 people. We got two of each and it was too much.Here were the highlights:Garbanzo Fritos (one is enough though)Migas Aragonesas (this was delicious)Fideua (noodle paella - also delicious)Escalivada (market vegetables - probably the best) Berenjena con meil (eggplant - very good)Foie gras (special on the menu)Good wine list and sangria was good.Here were the average:Stewed beef in stuffed peppers was ok Octopus with mushrooms was ok Here were the terrible:Pollo Asada (super dry and tasted of raw spices) Artichokes (really bland)Gurullos (this had to be the worst, it was sooooo flavorless and had all the wrong textures but it was highly recommended by our waitress and so we got two)Bread pudding (it was just terrible I can't even begin to describe it) We told our second waitress that the Gurullos (homemade pasta) was bland and really not good. She didn't comp it for us.The bread pudding was so bad that we didn't even get through half of it. 5 people taking one bite of a small dessert. We noticed a cockroach crawling right behind us on the wall. Other customers noticed it too. The waitress tired to pass it off as a ""New York thing"" which was very inappropriate. In all our years of living here and paying 70+ dollars per person for a meal, we've never been joined by cockroaches. It was not pleasant or reassuring.We reluctantly paid our bill and left so we didn't have to be there anymore. You can't see the roach clearly but it's there.","Wow. Just wow. I think this is the best tapas restaurant I've ever been. Everything was just so authentic, fresh, yet creative. If I had to, my only gripe would be the ambiance. A bit bland, but that's super petty. This is the best meal I've had in a while.Berenjena con Miel: Weakest meal for sure. I could hardly tell they were eggplant. And I know it's eggplant, but it just felt so soft. Didn't get much of the seed really, either.Alcachofas: Delicious, salty aioli. And the anchovies were cooked super well, very crispy.Salmorejo: I had no idea what to expect, and loved this. Plenty of fish, one of the larger dishes. All the ingredients came together so well and just made sense somehow. Loved the egg.Migas Aragonesas: The chorizo was cooked so well - tiny, little crisby bits. Delicious.Albondigas: Pretty standard, but you can tell the meat was such high quality. And cooked so well. And loved the mint yogurt.","I went to La Vara because of all the good reviews and was sorely disappointed, so I thought I'd leave one for those with high standards out there. On the surface, La Vara looks cute. Waiters seem nice. The menu doesn't look half bad. But then, you discover that it's far from an authentic Spanish restaurant-- the wines they offer are reallyyy sub-par for what they charge, and the waitresses don't know much about them at all. The food is not good (I had the octopus, which was chewy, the lobster risotto, which I swear was microwaved before we received it, and the duck which was flavored well but entirely too fatty). While we were in the middle of eating (!), the waitress began pushing us to order more food. Maybe we Americans are desensitized to this, but I still think that's tacky. Waiters are not meant to be salesmen who intrude upon your dinner. I gave it two stars for the cute patio but will not go there again. Too many good restaurants in New York.","Great seafood options -- paella was decadent.Torn bread stuff was a little salty. They tried to balance it with grapes but the ratio was still off.We went on a rainy Sunday night and there was not need for a reservation, exec though we had one. Reservations available via Open Table but you probably need to reserve a couple days in advance (unless it is rainy like previously mentioned). It has easy subway access via the Bergen St station and the G or F. Very quiet neighborhood and there's a park across the street where you can wait if there's a line.Olive oil ice cream is the best.

512,"I suggested Pearl's for dinner to my family since I enjoyed it the first time I went.From the time we walked in, the young lady (on this Thursday night with a yellow shirt on) had a unpleasant face.After being seated it took a while for our waitress to greet us and then a while to even recieve one drink. After another 15 mins for our appetizers, I tried getting the waitress in the yellow shirt's attention. I said ""excuse me"" and all I got back was a stare and then she straight walked away. We were like wow.When the food came out, everything was warm but not hot. My bake and shrimp however was tasty. My sister enjoyed her Jerk Salmon and Macaroni pie. My mother couldn't finish her Bake and jerk chicken (after it was recommended to her) because the chicken was too dry and my brother said he had way better oxtail.So unfortunately, Pearl's did not live up to the expectations this time. I was really looking forward to it and as it's a Trini owned business. Maybe it was a bad day...",Amazing!!!! The service and food were impeccable! Some will say it's not authentic enough and things should be on the menu and they aren't and the food is too expensive. Go see for yourself!

A bit Expensive for Caribbean food in Brooklyn but worth every dollar, quality ingredients unlike most of those other Caribbean spots.I recommend the curry goat! Very succulent and tender.","I had my birthday dinner at Pearl's tonight after having this place bookmarked and on my bucket list for quite a while. Pearl's is an extremely unique addition to this area of Williamsburg but so perfectly essential. Pearl's captures the true essence of Caribbean culture with their quaint tropical backyard that features bright colored picnic tables and chairs as well as vibrant Caribbean flags from different islands and greenery. The cuisine, tropical vibe and relaxed ambiance is an experience to remember. We arrived at 9:00 and were lucky to get a picnic table in the yard to seat 6. We ended up having 2 additional guests and the staff was kind enough to rearrange seating to accommodate our large party. They even had several bug repellent candles on our table to avoid the mosquitoes on this muggy September night. Our waitress was very kind and competent. We decided on the pitcher of the Traditional Trini Rum Punch to be most cost effective which served 2 drinks each person for a group of 5. The punch was nice and strong !!!! Loved the cute flags and sugar cane garnish. Everyone loved it. I was buzzed in no time. We ordered the Bake and Shark, Bake and Shrimp, Bake and Short Rib, Corn Elote, Oxtails and curry Salmon. The Bake here is perfect. Bake is a fried Flatbread. Bake and Shark is my favorite and I've had it at another local restaurant ""Streets"" and it was not as good. Shark was moist and tasty and the pineapple flavor gave it a sweet kick. Pickled cabbage was perfect and not filled with vinegar. The service here was phenomenal. Very happy with how my party was served. Everything was delicious. I especially loved the collection of sauces they provide !!!! I still don't know what a Shadowbeni is. Pepper and Tamarind sauce is my favorite. The combination of sweet and spicy ! Just like me ! The only down side is how small this place is and how packed and long the wait can be. Good food is not fast. Fast Food is not good. They played a lot of Caribbean hits inside the restaurant and Clyde's but unfortunately there were no speakers on the patio due to noise control I assume. This was a bummer. We decided to be our own DJ's. I will definitely come back to try some of the other dishes and the brunch menu. The vibe of this place definitely reminds me of Miss Lily's and I love to support my Caribbean people.",BEST CORN I HAVE EVER HAD.The service was good and the food's delicious.Will definitely come back for some more corn!,Pearl's
513,"Today I tried the Manousheh Restaurant. It's a Lebanese Restaurant straight from Beirut. I went with their most popular sandwich. It's called Cocktail. It has thyme sesame seeds  mint turnip and Lebanese salad with a yogurt sauce. This is real authentic food. I liked it , but next time I'm going with their Lebanese chicken sandwich in a flat pita. This place is a staple. It's been around a long time.","Having seen a clip about this place I decide to check it since they have labneh.  Instead of getting a whole bowl of labneh, I decided to try it with zaattar.  I was disappointed, The labneh didn't taste like the ones I had in the Middle East . Also it felt more like a paste than yogurt like.  Surprisingly the meal was filling.   I only wished the labneh lived  up to my expectations.","If I could eat here everyday, I would do it. The Manousheh here is even better than what you can find in Lebanon or Palestine. Try the Sujok, cheese and spinach Manousheh and finish with the Halawa for dessert!","Delicious! I am so glad to have found a good grab and go lunch spot near NYU. It is a bit of a wait (about 15 minutes), but that is because the food is made to order. It comes out hot! The Manousheh itself, which I had never had before, is well seasoned and filling. I definitely recommend.P.S. there's a student discount. What do you have to lose?",One of the best bang for your bucks in the city Great selectionGreat serviceNot a lot of seating Would go back in a heartbeat,"This place is ridiculously good. A friend of mine recently introduced me to this place and i cannot stop going now! I have tried the zaatar and the falafel variants of manousheh. The falafel tastes amazing, and minty tahini adds a delicious twist. The zaatar is perfectly executed, it is perfect for a snack or breakfast. The portions are sizeable, but if you're like me and desire an little extra, you can throw down an extra buck to make your manousheh a jumbo. Trust me, its an sizeable upgrade",Manousheh
514,"Used to say this was my go to Japanese curry place but I recently did a pick up order from here and got a  terrrrrible stomachache right after. Not sure if it was because my pick up order was near the end of their hours but now I wouldn't recommend going here. If you do want to risk food poisoning though - I would say their food is very delicious. Rice is great consistency and not too dry, curry is flavorful and a tiny bit spicy, pork katsu doesn't get soggy from the curry. During busy hours seating is a bit scarce.","I'm indian and I with my British boss...we both wanted curry. He yelped it and we walked around the block to this tiny place. Walking in I realized I needed to be more specific in the type of ""curry"" I wanted. Without being rude we eyed the pictures on the menu and chose chicken curry bowls. They were made very quickly even during the lunch rush. It should be noted we were the one only ones there. Our food was made and packaged up as we paid and left. There's about 4 seats in the place. Upon returning to our office I tried Japanese curry for the first time in my life. Oily but decent flavor. Not what I wanted but I ate it all anyways. I might try the flavors again but idk if I'd return to this place.","Good, its what you expect.The biggest problem was the katsu meat. I don't think they let the meat rest properly before cutting it. The juices ran out and my katsu was dry. They also cut it into way too many slices (very thin), further releasing the juices. If they had given me more sauce, it might've been fine, but it was sadly dry. I even got the pork..Their rice is too soft and spongy for me. That's probably a personal problem, but since the rice sits under the curry, you end up with very spongy rice.I enjoyed the sausage, shrimp tempura, veggie tempura, and cabbage. Although I wish those had more sauce on them too, especially the cabbage.",I was looking forward to the curry from Go! Go! Curry! and I was not disappointed. I got the pork katsu in medium size and it was a decent portion. The food came out really fast and the staff at the counter were very friendly. I really liked the crispiness of the pork katsu and the sauce complemented well with the katsu and rice. Water is self-serve and there are no visible bathrooms in this establishment. The place has some seats but it is definitely not meant to sit large groups of people. Most of the seats are single seats attached to one side of the restaurant.  I highly recommend curry from Go! Go! Curry! whether you are eating alone or with few of your friends. It's a quick eat-and-go establishment.,"I found myself starving while waiting for the Carly Rae Jepsen concert to start around the corner at the Hammerstein Ballroom, so I had someone hold my spot in line and walked over to Go! Go! Curry! I will say that it's a small space with friendly and efficient service. I had my curry combo with fried chicken in less than 10 minutes. The food wasn't horrible by any means, but when I compare it to other delicious curry dishes I've had at other Japanese restaurants, the food I had here was just okay. Would I eat here again, absolutely, but would I go out of my way to eat here again? ... Eh, probably not. I encourage you to try it out for yourself though.","Didn't get a pic of my food unfortunately but yum! Grabbed the Fish Katsu in the default Medium size. Came out to $10.55 for a really nice portion size. Fish was tender inside and not dry, with the katsu outside being perfectly crisp (not an outrageous amount of breading at all). I get extra cabbage always, will probably try to add the pickled side instead next time! The chicken katsu is good as well, and my sister said she loves the shrimp too. Apparently they also offer a free topping coupon. When you purchase on any day that ends in 5 you get a free topping for your next purchase. A pretty good deal to guarantee return customers! By FAR the highlight of my experience was whoever was working at the counter/in the kitchen shamelessly playing their Bon Jovi CD. ""You Give Love A Bad Name"" came on and they really shout sang it out of nowhere lmfaooo. Someone else might be put off by that, but whatever. It's not that serious. Happy staff means good food. Also Bon Jovi? C'mon. You know you love it.",Go! Go! Curry!
515,"The space is really nice. Food is pretty good, cheap but small portions. The drinks are not great. No liquor only Soju based cocktails. Cocktails are overly sweet. Would opt for beer- wines were nothing special. I came here with a large group on a quiet Tuesday night. Hate to say it but the service sucked. We were constantly looking for a server. Never checked on us. Some people never got their drinks. Food took a while and they were out of several items.On the plus side - someone left their wallet there and they saved it for us to pick up the next day.If the service was better and they had a full bar this place would be a 5/5.","Hate to be the guy to not rate them perfectly but my meal was not perfect . What wasn't perfect was their pasta dish that they make on Fridays and their salty stew beef gravy. Everything else was a hit particularly the plantains ,rice , beans , and the serviceeee. Guy was amazingly pleasant, kind and outgoing.  This restaurant is still a work in progress in terms of renovations and at the time not having central heating but I have no doubt this will be D spot in afew months .",Nice place but really poor service we need to.wait for 20 minutes just to pay are check this crazy we can leave with out pay the they will even see that sorry but I'm not recommended this place.,Santiago's is AMAZING. We just had our wedding reception there and it could not have been more perfect. I can't thank Matt (the owner) enough. He was so accommodating and helpful and every single request we made he was happy to make happen. The cost for the event was more than fair and he helped make our day absolutely perfect. The food is so tasty and the drinks are strong and delicious. This is our favorite neighborhood restaurant and a great little hidden away spot!,"Sooo good! I did a photoshoot here 2 months ago and decided to come back to try the food. So I went  during lunch and got the stew chicken & Mac & cheese... let me tell you! Very good! The Mac & cheese was nice and light and the stew chicken taste like my mother's stew chicken. They also have a chill hang out spot in the back, which is very beautiful! Through photos you would think you're in another country. Highly recommend!",this place is the crown jewel of east harlem. the food SLAPS! and the outdoor space is so cool. so much fun and great staff. you really feel right at home. you gotta check this place out. no liquor but the soju is great! and its all very fair prices. no matter what you order always get the coconut rice . i live two doors down and i eat here at least once a week. whether i go in and sit down in the beautiful outside or grab a plate to go santiagos is always the move. consistently delicious food. the stewed chicken is my favorite its soooo good! highly recommend. also the garlic sauce with the tostones is great. cant go wrong with anything you get here.,Santiago's Beer Garden
516,Brunch was incredible. Service was attentive and very polite. We had an omelette and the French toast and we will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.,"Our brunch was good but we wouldnt go back.Let's start with the positives: The food was good. I wasnt in the mood for brunch so I ordered the cioppino and my husband got the steak and eggs. The cioppino was very good, super flavorful and large. The steak was cooked well, a little plain but still well cooked. The food as a whole really wasnt our issue. Onto the things we werent so happy with: The coffee was HORRIBLE. They have Stumptown coffee (one of my FAVES) in little french presses. It was horrible. There wasnt enough coffee in the press and it was seriously GROSS. And for brunch one of the main things you want is good coffee. I was so disappointed. The service was pretty bad. There was one waiter for the whole (not overly large) restaurant and he obviously was trying, but it was just too much for him. We had to sit next to a table (for 6) of dirty dishes for our entire meal because he didnt clean the table. He was just running around all over the  place doing everything (and not well) so all the little details you love to see in a small neighborhood restaurant were just missing. If service isnt that important to you and you're looking for a decent meal in the area feel free to give it a shot.","We live just a four minute walk away and have passed this place hundreds of times. We have always wanted to try it, but it's always been empty so we were reluctant. The atmosphere is quite quaint and sea themed. Loved the cute cups on the tables. Price is right for the entrees. However, the glassware was dirty and table wasn't clean. Little hairs in the milk and grime on the French press. That's fine I guess..maybe it's part of the theme? Whatever. This wasn't the worst part of our experience. I got the crab Benedict. The eggs weren't runny like they should be and cooked through solid. The crab cakes were pretty good, not the best.  Our food was dry, under seasoned, and cold. Add some salt!  I didn't eat my side and let the waiter know that it was particularly cold. All he said was ""okay"" then walked away quickly and did not apologize or offer to fix it. Then he brought us the check. Very very rude. I wasn't looking for a discount, which I probably should have received, but more of an apology or offer to warm the potatoes. This is really bad customer service. Too bad that we live so close, but will never return. come here if you want cold, mediocre food and bad service.","The brunch is vey good. You'll never try another french toast like this. The benedctins are different to the traditional ones, but really good. And the Lobster Sandwich is amazing. Additionally the attention by Jim (owner), Andrés, and Anthony (chef) are very good and very gentle","Best out of the way seafood restaurant I've been to in Brooklyn. Nice wine selection, reasonably priced, attentive service and GREAT Cioppino. Can't say enough good things!","The ONLY reason why I'm giving 4 stars is due to not having specials available that they usually have for Sunday Brunch as well as drink specials. No bottomless mimosas/sangrias so it became a bit pricey. Other than that the steak that I've had other than being at a steak house was the BEST I've ever had! The white bread was thick & tasted as if it was homemade. The eggs which my family & I ordered all different ways were perfect, not too runny, not over cooked even the scrambled eggs were satisfying! Music was played very Low, it's good for couples or just with a friend or two. I'm saying that because even though it's spacious, it's very low key so having a big crowd as for us it was 8, it felt like we took up the place. Waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed but she made sure we had everything we needed, got every order right & was a super sweetheart.",Kevin's
517,"Food came on time, it was tasty. However, I got FOOD POISONED an hour after I finished the whole bowl of kale salad and a side of grilled chicken. It started with a headache and I suddenly felt nauseous and soon after that I felt like vomiting. I vomited multiple times.. until i kept gagging but couldn't manage to throw up because I had no more liquid in my stomach. I had to drink water to throw up the remaining salad/chicken in my stomach one last time. I was so sick. It was a long night... Im fine now, but I won't be eating from here again.",This place the manger refused to com to talk to me regarding my complaint about the portion of the order(market platte$18) for said of vegetables and he answered my concerns through the waitress refused any changes of the serving too much money for little food I'm not going there again they taken advantage from yong people,"The place is a cool concept- simple healthy food prepared well. I've tried different locations a few times, this is my least favorite. Last time I went all the food was cold & the hostess was very rude. Not worth $20+ for vegetables & rude waitstaff. Won't be coming back.","I was introduced to Westville just two weeks ago and I've already eaten there twice. I absolutely love it and it's quickly becoming my go-to for a great dinner!I love all of the veggie and gluten-free options. The market vegetables are def one of the best dishes and combos in a meal that I've ever tried. They have seasonal veggies too so that there is always a selection in rotation alongside their staple delectable mix. The waitstaff is quick to help you and ultra friendly. The food comes out promptly even when the restaurant seems busy. Also, they accommodate your changes and requests. The servers are happy to help (: Also, good alcohol selection.I will be coming back and maybe next time take some pics before scarfing everything down!","Ordered a Cobb salad for dinner tonight for pickup. Food was ready when promised - a steeper pickup time than most places, but wasn't a problem as I wasn't going to be heading out of the office until then anyway. The Cobb salad had chicken, bacon, avocado and bleu cheese with a really yummy vinaigrette that I asked for extra of on the side (they obliged). Portion size was pretty big. I wasn't starving so I ordered a salad for a slightly lighter option and I was struggling to finish it. For $14, a great value compared to salads in a similar price point (like Sweetgreen). Portion size of protein was pretty good too. Bacon was super crispy and yummy, chicken was a little bland but the dressing went a long way. Wish it had egg and/or tomato like a more traditional Cobb salad, but it was good nonetheless. Would order again as a somewhat-healthy alternative to other options. Place is cute on the inside but has limited seating. It was full when I was there (6:30 on a Friday). There is a decent amount of outdoor seating as well and has a very ""open"" feel.","I went here on a Saturday afternoon with a friend. We both ordered the Greek salad; my friend got it with tofu and I ordered mine with grilled chicken. We also got a tea and a coffee. Quite honestly, the food was decent, but it wasn't mind blowing. I was expecting the salad to possibly have more vegetables and be a little more savory, but it was pretty much just s decent tasting salad. The service was standard and the environment was a bit granola-y. Our total bill was $50; which for two salads and tea is a little pricey.Did I have a good meal? Yes. Would I return? No. Too plain and too pricey for what we got.",Westville East
518,"2 stars for food, 0 stars for service. We got the curried goat, plantains, and curried vegetables. Curried goat was subpar at best. Had lots of inedible meat that we left on the plate. I didn't enjoy the raisins and canned corn in the curried vegetables. We tried ordering the fried chicken but fried chicken and BBQ chicken are not available on weekdays (which is not noted anywhere on the menu or on their website online).***Unbelievably bad service, I will never be back here again. My boyfriend and I came in around 8:30pm tonight (Thursday night). The restaurant was 1/4 full (not busy at all). While we were dining, we only asked for 3 things 1) hot sauce 2) the check 3) a takeout container. Our waiter took over 10 minutes to deliver each one and ended up never even giving us a takeout container. We were so done by that point, we just left and didn't bother to ask again. We saw our waiter play on his phone and sit down in a chair doing nothing before he remembered to bring the hot sauce. We were tired of waiting for the check, so we went up to the counter to ask for the check but he sent us back to our table telling us he would bring it over. Then he walked around other tables before grabbing the check from the counter and coming by our table. I understand waiters could have bad days and other things on their minds but this was over the top, worst service I've experienced.","Ok this used to be my spot but, Something isn't right. I've gotten bad food from here before but it was confirmed yesterday again. When the restaurant isn't crowded you best believe your getting old food, they like to microwave things. I absolutely hate that!!!! I got my made to order food. But the rice and macaroni and steam veg were old... the food stank by the time I got home and once in the garbage it stunk up my entire house... I will not support their establishment anymore. I tried but soon after eating their food my blood pressure spikes. They cook with too much damn salt ... get it together please.","I started eating here because of yelp but I'll soon stop eating here because of the food, and maybe the somewhat standoffish service ......I eat from here religiously but I've realized this restaurants seems to microwave things a lot..... That's not cool...,I ordered Mac & cheese and I swear it wasn't made that day..... Never took the time to eat there because the place is smallllllll, ordering over the phone is depressing, they suggest what you should get instead of what you want (rude),.... Idk but I'm looking for a new love,... Cause the islands has lost it's flavors for me","The Islands is so tasty!! The jerk chicken is absolutely delicious. The roti, plantains, and rice and beans are very tasty. It's a fairly large space and it seems family run and very authentic. Definitely a good dinner spot and one I would recommend going to for great flavors.","The best damn curried goat I've ever had, and the portions are just the right size. I like especially that, when you order from Islands, the curried goat is mostly goat MEAT and not goat BONE. I often feel a little let down by a lot of places that give you a couple choice morsels and then a whole pile of soup bones and cartilage to gnaw on. That unfortunate circumstance NEVER happens at the islands, I cannot stress enough that I have never left there feeling any less than very satisfied. The rice and peas have a wonderful subtle spice to them that makes for a great snack as leftovers. And the service is quick too!","The food is absolutely delicious .... I mean , The BEEeeessssssT  Jamaican food I have ever had in my life ,  the food had so many favorable spices . My husband and I are definitely hooked on this new spot and we will return before the end of our vacation. If you are from out of town , in-town , or next door Please come to THE ISLAND ... trust me . You will not be disappointed",The Islands
519,"It's not really Asian, it's not really Cuban... some owner somewhere wanted an upscale American bar with an excuse to make plantains, rice and noodles bowl and call themselves asian fusión because Cubans and Asians both utilize rice....  If this was really an asian place, I'd expect better pork buns... if this was really a Cuban place I'd expect better yuka fries and mojitos, but alas it's a pub prancing around pretending to be some cuisine it's not. Pros- brunch, unlimited booze, no reservation needed, but taken for us antsy folks, and spacious","So, so, SO good!!! I got the oxtail fried balls as an appetizer and the 14 hours slow cooked pork as an entree. I was the only person in the restaurant at 5pm on a weekday. The oxtail appetizer came in a creamy sauce with mango (?) relish. The pork was flavorful and moist. A real treat in my mouth, even hours later in a take home container. Highly, highly recommend checking this place out. Minus one star because the box my take-home was in was leaking and soggy on the bottom two hours later. I had this upright in my purse in a plastic bag, but things could have turned out not so great if this had been in my purse sans-plastic bag or if I had stuck this in my carry on.","Good drinks. Overpriced and small meals. Tostones don't compare to authentic ones. 90 bucks for lunch with 2 sandwiches, a (single) drink, and a tiny app? Yikes. Show me a Michelen star and then we'll talk.","Love the concept of fusing two of my favorite cuisines into one: Cuban and Chinese. Came here on a Friday night with a reservation at 730pm, restaurant wasn't too packed and we were immediately shown to our tables. We ordered the following: seafood paella and pork char siu, and we got a order of yucca fries complimentary due to checking in on Yelp. Total bill came around $76 tax and tip included. AMBIANCE:This is where I really loved the cute interior design and the retro theme that they were going for. Think perhaps 1920s China marrying Cuban rum bar. Definitely works well. PROS:Seafood paella was delicious! Love the black squid ink that they used, and they cooked it al dente with a slight crunch to its texture. The seafood was very fresh, and the portion size was good. Paella was seasoned very well, with a good ratio between seafood and rice. I also loved the pork char siu we got, as the pork was incredibly tender and melts in your mouth, and it sat on top of a bed of sweet potato puree. That puree was AWESOME. Whoever slow cooked that pork to make it that tender deserves to win either a Michelin star or a James Beard award. Would come back just to eat more of that. Yucca fries were great too. Not too sweet and not that starchy compared to just potato or sweet potato fries. Interesting texture and taste, and very unique. We were also given a complimentary basket of shrimp crackers. Those were light and airy and had a good taste, texture, and crunch to it. CONS:Only complaint would be for the seafood paella, I felt like the paella was drizzling in oil and was slightly greasy. OVERALL:Highly recommend to try out a interesting eclectic mix of flavors, and to experience Cuban-Chinese food in its finest at Calle Dao.","Interesting combination of the mix of Cuban and Chinese, but it works! We came here for a late lunch and got the Cubano sandwich and mushroom and broccoli lo mein noodles. Both were very flavorful. The Cubano was good, but I think my favorite was the noodles. I love the variety of mushrooms they used; it tasted so good with the broth. If you get these dishes, you should dip the sandwich into the noodle broth! I know Cubano's don't normally come with a dipping sauce, but it tasted really good! Overall good, would be interested in trying some of their items from the dinner menu.","The food was good and expensive. We ordered a little bit of everything and enjoyed the paella's; we had three! The desserts were exceptional and the service slow. We were pretty much the only table there, so a long term run probably isn't in the cards . This tapas menu is lovely so order a lot. We loved the decor. -want to go back on a Friday and see if business picks up. There were four of us and a good time was had.",Calle Dao - Chelsea
520,Everything is good. I know this is short but when everything you want is offered by a restaurant there is nothing more to say.Large portionsGood amount of meat to rice ratioFast deliveryFriendly people,"Couldn't give them 5/5 and I'll tell you why. I can't say I'd recommend here but it is definitely a healthier option opposed to getting the traditional Jamaican restaurant greasy food. POSITIVES:- Staff is really friendly - Restaurant has a nice chill vibe - Fast / never crowded - I'm indifferent about the food because the flavors weren't great but overall it was ok. Didn't wow me away NEGATIVES: - EXPENSIVE (spent $20 on jerk chicken & bottle water) / ($4 for broccoli, plantain, other sides) - Very very few menu options (fish, jerk chicken or oxtail) - Not always open","This place descended from heaven on the eighth day. I swear, you will die and be reborn after eating here. Had the Jerk Chicken with red beans and coconut sauce. Nothing could have been better on a cold day lost in Brooklyn.Take a trip out of the way to visit these guys. You will not regret it.","Been waiting to go here for some time, but between my schedule and theirs, it took some time to work out. But when my big bro and I wanted to hang out, the universe brought us all together to The Food Sermon.   While smaller than I expected, the food packs a wallop.  We're both vegetarians, so my my bro had the Tofu Veggie with chickpeas in the coconut ginger broth with brown rice, I had the Veggie (which also has sauteed kale, mushrooms, and broccoli) minus the tofu, also in coconut ginger broth and brown rice, but with read beans. I have to say, we were both floored.  We were catching up on stuff, but half of every time I tried to talk my food kept calling back at me.  As we were sitting in the window seats (the place got packed really quickly) it did make my rudeness with chomping down my food mid-convo a bit easier, LOL.  The sorrel was also on point, which doesn't happen to often.  The only complaint is that they didn't have any ice, which to me is an easy fix, but the drinks were cool upon serving.  By time we left the place emptied out a bit and so we got to chat with the owner who is a very cool, personable guy. The staff is also on point, lending to my 5th star, which I do not easily dole out.  And the mark of a great meal for me is its heartiness...that you're satisfied for some time after. We ate close to 4pm but I wasn't really hungry again for the rest of the night. Being born and raised in Brooklyn, Crown Heights and Lefferts Gardens were always two of my favorite neighborhoods, so I'm glad a spot like Food Sermon exists here.","Really tasty and hearty bowls.  We had the oxtail and the jerk chicken.  I recommend adding the sautéed kale even though it makes the dishes a bit too pricey.  No alcohol and fairly slow service but they are a small space and seem to do a lot of takeout and delivery. If you get stuck behind those orders it takes a while to get your food even if you are dining in. Still, the good is good and you get large portions. I had two full meals from my one bowl.","THIS  IS  THE  BEST  MEAL  I  HAD  ALL SUMMERI have always struggled to pass by this place while it was actually open. Today was the day. Let me tell you about how the clouds open up, God reached down and said ""lemme get some""I had the salmon with brown rice, red beans, and the coconut ginger dressing.It was literally magical from the first bite to the last. And that was take out so I imagine there is an additional layer of joy and heaven if you are eating it freshly prepared.I don't like how the space is set up for seating but other then that it's a win for me.",The Food Sermon Kitchen
521,"The following review was sent to the restaurant survey from email. No response. The restaurant reservation is very confusing. I made the reservation through the open table 3 weeks ago, and got email to confirm it one day before. I emailed back to confirm and then the restaurant auto canceled my reservation after my email. Then l misses the phone call to confirm( don't know why they need the customer to double confirm in both email and phone ). I have to call the restaurant to confirm again. In the call, the assistant asked me if l have any preference seat and l told him window table would be perfect. He confirmed me to assign a window seat to me. However, when we got there on time, the other waiter was reluctant to assign me any table with window / outside. The excuse was: he worked there for 9 years and never seen that happened before. He refused to listen what l was told in the call. The restaurant messed up my reservation first and also didn't want to keep their word what they told me. I also saw some tables available outside and this can't not convince me that "" first come and first serve"". Also, l did not just walk in and l made the reservation. Until l insisted, the waiter assigned us a table outside. When we get table seated, l still can see 2-3 tables are available next to me. The restaurant reservation and waiter's attitude( especially the front desk) need to be improved.  If the restaurant can not do what they promise the window table, then don't ask the customer the preference at the beginning!","Did I go to the same restaurant as all the other people here? I'm so confused.I came with my family last night for Restaurant Week, and we were so disappointed. $42 for a three-course meal, and we also paid supplements for a pork belly appetizer ($5 supplement), the scallop entree ($7 supplement), and the steak entree ($10). Everything was so bad. We were off to a bad start with the complimentary onion foccaccia, which was overly greasy, salty, and cold. The watermelon carpaccio was super salty and not satisfying at all. The pork belly was a bit more satisfying and slightly more worth the price but it wasn't tender and didn't melt in your mouth. The absolute worst thing was the steak, which was not overcooked but somehow still so chewy and tough and my mom and grandpa could not chew or swallow it at all. The scallops were tiny and my family all said they tasted frozen. And the duck, which my mom switched her steak for, was equally tough and chewy. The only decent things were the desserts. We tried the berry pavlova with basil ice cream, almond panna cotta, and lavender blueberry crumble with goat milk ice cream. I really liked the basil ice cream but not the goat milk ice cream. If you like almond, you'll like the almond panna cotta, because the taste is very strong. Our waiter, while not bad, was not friendly at all and insisted that we *had* to place our full orders including dessert choices at the beginning. And the host was kind of rude and made a stink about not seating us until the whole party was present even though we had a reservation and our table was empty and ready for us. We also had to work really hard to get someone's attention whenever we needed something, like bread, water, or the bill, as the restaurant was severely understaffed. To top it off, the bathroom was a mess and smelled strongly of urine. My family all agreed that we would not come back even if it were 1/3 the price of the Restaurant Week price.",0/5 for service - the manager was rude as was the actual server. I go to the nearby dental school and while their menu was very appealing the service was a huge turn off . I was about to order a la cart but he told me to seat at the bar. The name of the manager was Peter pizarro.,"Where has this place been all of my life? I came here recently during 2019's summer restaurant week. I had scoured all of the RW menus on the website and this one had the most appetizing sounding menu - with items like Roasted Skate, or being able to mix and match pastas as either a first or second course, this seemed like good value. Sitting outside, two bottles of Albarino later, watching the sun set over the East River, this was the best Restaurant Week experience I've had ever. 1st Course: We started off with *the East and West Coast oysters (the West Coast ones were seriously jumbo sized).*Lamb Ragu Cavatelli (perfectly al dente) with charred corn, peppers, and parmesan2nd course: *Lamb Osso Bucco (this was tender and had a delicious amount of fat. That smoked eggplant was packed with flavor as well)*Roasted Skate & Octopus: The skate was perfectly crispy, and the texture of octopus was so perfect- not tough or chewy at all.Desserts:*Toasted Almond Panna Cotta*Cereal & Milk ($5 addition): chocolate ganache cake, caramelized rice puffs, vanilla malt. This dessert was so much fun. Worth the extra $5They grow a lot of their own produce in the garden right by the restaurant and also upstate. This is a total gem, and I look forward to going back for more!","What is the old saying? ""Location, location, location."" and Riverpark has this on lockdown. Tucked within a larger building, the dining room overlooks a small patio area with the river beyond, and at night, it's absolutely breathtaking to look out and see all the city lights twinkling like stars over the dark water. The interior is dimly lit, a blessing to my own nightshift eyes, which gentles the sleekness of the decor into something truly peaceful, cool whites and smooth wood dotted with arching arrangements of fresh flowers.Oh. Oh my.The food and drinks -a rotating selection that changes seasonally and likely on a whim- hold up to the promises made by the place's appearance. Flavours and textures come as a blend of the familiar and comfortable and the new and interesting [celery sorbet anyone?] and the staff is incredibly solicitous of your enjoyment without being intrusive on the overall experience. I am quite certain if there had been a flaw to be found it would have been remedied immediately, but we had no complaints [There was extra dessert we hadn't requested but that's not... exactly something we can complain about, as it was amazing and complimentary, though I cannot guarantee such things are common]. Given the changing nature of the menu I will speak only to the 'Cereal and Milk' which is a menu staple and unlikely to vanish no matter how old this review becomes. Delicate puffed cereals, a gloriously glossy dome of chocolate, and an unctuous interior that really must be experienced to be appreciated properly. Everything was magnificent and I cannot wait to return.","Went for restaurant week dinner. Beautiful decor, attentive service; however, the food and drink were just ok.We had catavelli, risotto, lamb and skate. They were not badly cooked, but there were just too many different spices like mint, dill and basil at the same times. It is a little bit too much going on and the whole flavor profile becomes very busy.",Riverpark
522,"Service was BAD. Our waiter was basically a ghost. We were provided more service by runners and the host. We were seated by the pass through window and watched our food sit there for at least 20 minutes before being brought to us. Delivery people waiting near by too and we saw that two orders never even made it into the kitchens system. These drivers had to wait 20 minutes for these to be prepared.Food was okay, but not the best seafood I've had. My salmon burger was room temp when I got it and I wasn't impressed. My dad whom I was with had carrots on his plate that were supposed to be cooked through were still crunchy and his fish was over done.Edit: the manager ended up comp-ing our meal. They apologized and recognized their service was not up to standard. It felt genuine and would revise my review from 2 up to 4 stars. Their delivery system was down which is what caused the deliver people to wait.",An expensive waste of money. The service was fine but the food was bland and overpriced for the amount that we payed. We left very disappointed and more than a little angry with our experience.,Unimpressed by the size of my fish. Look at the picture - it was smaller than my iPhone 6. Not worth $24+!! The only saving grace here was the ambiance (open doors throughout the restaurant) & the accommodation of the menu to replace items in my dish.Don't know if I'll be back here.,"Easily put down a 1:30 brunch reservation for four on a Sunday a couple hours in advance. The restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived- it's a good idea to go after 1 PM on a weekend. Absolutely loved the cute nautical theme and relaxed atmosphere. Not chaotic, cramped, or noisy as most brunch places are on the weekends.Smoked Salmon toast and the Lobster Egg Benedict are delicious! Very savory, filling, and amazing texture. The side kale salad that came with the toast also tasted fresh and simple, with yummy sweet potatoes and less dressing. I'd come back to try their salads for lunch next time.Might call this one of my favorite brunch spots in the city now!","I came here for a quick brunch with my husband. The hostess was quick and attentive when we walked in, even seating us 15 minutes early for our reservation. I ordered the avocado toast, shoestring fries and a Bloody Mary and my husband had the lobster Benedict and a fresh OJ. Both entrees where hearty and satisfying and the fries were very good! The waitress paid close attention to our water, leaving us to enjoy our meal but moving quickly when it comes to the check. Very lovely brunch!","My partner and I originally had another brunch place in mind, but after being told that we would have to wait for 30-40 minutes, we decided to bail and go to the next brunch spot nearby. So we came here! There was a wait initially, but it definitely wasn't a 30 minutes wait. It was closer to 10 minutes. We were seated outside (where we wanted to be) and our hostess brought us water fairly quickly. Because of our little wait, we had already figured out what we wanted (a pitcher of bellini, lobster benedict, steak and eggs, broccolini and mushroom, and crab gazpacho).Our drinks arrived pretty quickly, but once it came, we noticed that it was EXTREMELY orange/yellow for a peach bellini. We tried it anyways, but it was not peach flavored at all! It tasted just like food dyed prosecco! It was disappointing, but it was horrible, so we just brushed it off. The food came next. The lobster benedict was absolutely amazing! The bread was thick, toasty, fluffy, and buttery. There was also a good amount of lobster (which tasted fresh) and a delicious creamy sauce. The steak and eggs were good, but I wouldn't say it was $28 good (taking the flavor and the portion into account). The broccolini and mushrooms were cooked just right! Unfortunately, it was a bit on the flavorless side. And last but not least, the crab gazpacho! It had a good amount of crab in it, but the soup was not like the gazpacho I'm used to. I'd definitely say this restaurant is more for people who want to take pictures to post them on Instagram and such because the food (all of them) were absolutely beautiful! The food itself, though, was not on par.",Seamores
523,"Came out of here with foodborne illness and spent most of the next day in the bathroom. Regardless of the food's quality or good things I might have had to say otherwise, if your food is unclean to the extent it's making people sick, it's a public health hazard and an instant one star from me.","Came here for my birthday on a Saturday afternoon. We sat in the cozy area in the back, which was great for a group of friends mostly having drinks and not food. The good: The drinks are incredible. The whole menu is so creative and has such a diverse range of bases and flavor profiles to choose from. We had a group of 12 having several drinks, so among all of us we tried basically every cocktail on the menu. The Chiller Instinct was a popular choice among the group (bourbon, sherry, passion fruit and vanilla liqueurs, cinnamon, lemon oil). My personal favorite was the Date Night -- the salted butter washed rye made it a dessert-like cocktail without being too thick or syrupy.We didn't get dinner, but we ordered the guac and the chicharron and both were tasty complements to our cocktails.The bad: Our server was frequently MIA and seemed irritated with us the entire afternoon. We were a sizable group but were only given one menu to share among us, and we frequently struggled to get the server's attention. The restaurant is not that big and there were several servers working, so I don't think being busy was the issue.Also, a note to management: the pew benches in the back need to be sanded or re-finished. I was wearing a skirt so my legs were touching the wood seat and I got some small splinters in the backs of my legs.",The service is 5 stars.  The food is 3. I ordered Arepas and Civiche. The drinks are filled with ice. I ordered two shots of rum so I didnt feel like I was wasting money. Great environment.  Next time I know what to order.,"5 stars for cocktailsFood is probably overpriced with very small portions, was still hungry after paying $50/pp...Service was pretty slow but friendlyOtherwise cool atmosphere.Recommend reserving spot on waitlist on yelp so you can walk in when there's a seat for you","We have came to Leyenda before. We got the idea from visiting Clover Club their sister lounge/restaurant across the street. The cocktails and food are delicious there and we wanted a simpler experience.  Leyenda is a Mexican inspired tapas/cocktail bar. Our first experience we came early got a seat at high top table and it was somewhat pleasant. The food and cocktails were okay and was willing to try it again and here we are. We entered the establishment and no one was there to greet us. It was little later then last time but We did see some empty tables and was happy about that. There wasn't many people standing around so we thought we would be lucky.  A host came rushing over when we were going over to a table and asked if we would like to sit. We said yes and he said 45 mins. It was weird because there was just so many empty tables plus we heard they have a outdoor area.  We put our name down and saw seats at the bar and sat.  We figured if we can sit at the bar and eat why sit at a table. We ordered drinks and food and there was three tables that were empty for a good 30 mins. Really upsetting we couldn't have been accommodated. We order a some mixed drinks from the menu a Tia Mia and a bourbon type drink. Both were okay. They were fruity and thoughtfully prepared by our bartender.We ordered for dinner: shrimp arepas, ropa veijas, pernil with mofongo, and enchiladas with mole negro.  The arepas we ordered we never received.  We got something else in its place. It tasted okay. It was warm not hot. The ropa veija was tasty it was over plantains. We enjoyed this dish. The mofongo was tasty and pernil was good. We had ordered this the last time and it was our least fav dish. This time we really enjoyed it.The chicken enchiladas was cold! Like ice cold! And flavorless. I wouldn't get this.. It's crazy how delicious Clover Clubs food and cocktails are and how mediocre Leyenda food and cocktails are. Unfortunately, I would say this is prob our last visit here. The only thing going is the vibe. It's really a shame..Parking is somewhat easy(352)","We came here for drinks but i have to say that I would definitely come back for the food. The drinks are really good. Me and my boyfriend had three drinks each , there were all good and balanced. We ordered one appetizer just to try something , we ended up ordering three plates. We had the panuchos , the al pastor tacos and the poblano relleno. The poblano was my favorite !! If you can't take spicy don't even. It's spicy. Everything was delicious. We weren't even that hungry lol now I want to go back and try some other things. The place is cosy , the music goes with the place and the ambience invites you to stay. Great location too.",Leyenda
524,"The best way to describe this place is ""OK"". The food is fine and the decor is interesting (1 star for each), however the service is lacking.The waitress was just OK but I hate being asked ""how is everything?"" literally a few seconds after the food arrives at the table. Be more attentive and understand people need time to experience their meal! I don't believe she smiled once in any interaction which made her appear a little cold. The real point where the customer service was shown to be lacking was when my friend asked someone to take our photo. He simply said no and walked away without an explanation. I believe he was a bus boy but there is no excuse for how he dismissed us. If you are too busy, then simply explain this and say you will get someone else.A business is a team and everyone is working there to enhance the customers experience. By walking away and dismissing our question. This dropped the review down by a star all from one simple interaction. You might thing this is harsh, but honestly, our experience was decreased due to a rude experience and it was brought up in a conversation a few days later, showing that's what we remembered from our dining experience.Please remember that everyone has two jobs - the job they were hired to do and customer service. Everyone interacts with a customer and your whole business is represented by these interactions.","I wasn't very impressed with this spot, which was kind of disappointing as I was looking forward to it. The interior was really nice and I loved the decor. That was about all I liked about this spot. The food was decent but not worth the price. The fries were adequate and the calamari average. The chicken marsala was a bit undercooked and the flavor wasn't as rich as other chicken marsalas I've had. The most disappointing part was the tea selection, or lack of. They had the standard tea selection (earl grey, chamomile, peppermint) but not a very expansive tea menu despite the restaurant offering high tea (at the Times Square location). I ordered peppermint and was given a pot of Celestial peppermint, the exact brand I get at work for free...Overall, it was a cute spot but that was about it. The food was average and not worth the price.","It has a nice setting with decorations and seat, feel like in Europe. Other than that, nothing really special, food is over price and mediocre (pay for the location maybe?). We had 1 cocktail, two brunch entree and OJ. Total bill is almost $60. Way too expensive. Cocktail is $12 btw. Server dont really pay attention to the order, forget one or two small items we ask for. Btw the bottomless brunch $29 is only for the brunch cocktail, dont include entree. Which is sucked.",This gastro Irish pub packs them in both before and after the shows.  If thinking of eating a late dinner after seeing a show make sure to make a reservation.  Before the shows do not expect any happy hour specials as they have none.  The menu is full of items will find at most Irish's pubs like mozzarella sticks plus higher end fare.  Have good beer list which is on par with what you would find at craft beer bars.  Food is okay to good.  The look of place does remind one of a Victorian house which is not bad as far as gimmicks go. I like the large bar and tall ceilings.  Considering how busy service is good though do not expect bartender to chat you up like your local Irish pub. Considering options around theatre district/ Times Square this is a solid choice.,"Visit Date: August 10, 2019My friend treated me to lunch here before we went to see phantom of the opera (my 72nd time seeing the show). My husband was supposed to go with me and ended up scheduling his RPG game that he plays so I asked my friend who was visiting out of town if she'd go with me and she said she would. I loved this place the Victorian Era decor was amazing. I ordered two pinot grigio's and the gluten free pancakes for lunch. I was on track with my mindful eating at least for lunch time anyway so I just ate one pancake. They were so delicious they tasted like a donut. I would come back here again. I usually don't do a restaurant meal before a show but there are certain times I do and if I did it again I'd come back here for sure.",This place is good Victorian bar. It has lot of options for drinks and good ambience. Definitely recommend for friends or group for Friday or Saturday night. Generally it's crowded and hard to find seating.,Lillie's Victorian Establishment
525,"Good food but really slow (even there is no other customers) and bad service.Had food there yesterday, and waited more than 15 mins to get check (while the waitresses just chilling there). And when they finally came, I noticed they didn't give me my credit card back. Almost left the store without credit card. On the of that, there was no apology at all.",I mean seriously the ramen is incredible. I've tried all of them.  They close between lunch and dinner btw. Happened to me before. Hands down my local hangover cure spot lol,First time here and will be my last time. Pretty annoyed that a chicken based ramen has to have pork meat or no meat at all. Most places have an option to have chicken as the protein. I asked the owner to waitress to substitute for chicken and she said no. She claimed she asked the owner and he said no. We are literally their only customers at the moment and now I'm seeing why. I'll stick with other places in Williamsburg instead of coming back here.,"This hole in the wall is a literal stone's throw from my apartment and I never knew it existed. I love a good bowl of ramen as its comforting and a lot of love goes into the broth.  I'll throw it out there... if sharing a large table with strangers isnt your thing, or you prefer your own table, this place may not be for you. I tend to not like sitting so close to people I dont know but I was in good company so I went with an open mind. Their list of offerings is great. I really like their pork belly bao which I have i ordered for delivery. The Tonbara Shoyu Ramen is my absolute favorite; they offer the soup classic or bukkake. I opted for classic. They also have vegan ramen which is great for those days you just want something delicious but also want to feel you're doing your body a favor taking a break from animal products... of if you're actually vegan.  Like most traditional Ramen, it's not necessarily cheap but its certainly worth the price. Will be back for sure! Winter is coming!","I LOVE this place. The ramen bowls are my addiction! But at $13 a pop I unfortunately can't eat here every day or i would. I usually order for pick up and the staff is always super nice and never messes up the order. I've eaten inside a few times and also a great experience. It's on Varet st kind of tucked away from the dirty mess all over Flushing Ave and Bway so it's never very crowded yet always has a steady flow of customers inside so you know others agree. I live 2 blocks from here, for the last 10 years, and I am so happy this place it here. Def a great date night spot, to chill with friends, or if you live in this depressing hood and want to show your visiting parents/friends in town that your choice in apartment location is not all like an abandoned mental institution whose sanitation department exploded over a mile in all directions. Not that I don't have a twisted love for the area, but it isn't where you would intentionally commute to for a nice meal. But back to this place, they have alcohol too!","The food is flavorful and tasty.The decor is hip, modern, and perfect compliment to the delicious food (AND they have clean bathrooms!)The wait staff are friendly.Had ramen here once or twice in my day. Always tastes great and I am stuffed full afterwards.The last time I chose the bukkake style pork ramen, and it was a fantastic choice!Random experience: Walked in here once on a warm summer day and they had no air conditioning on. Walked right back out. Went to the BedStuy location that day and it was the same thing. Maybe they hadn't started using their A/C yet?? But that was just on that one specific day. Hopefully that was just an 'off' one.",Samurai Papa
526,I ordered food from these guys at around 8pm. It's 10:15pm now. My food never came. I called 8 times and there was no response. Kept going to a machine that says that the TimeWarner Cable customer hasn't set up their voicemail. They're supposed to be good. But I guess I'll never know.,Pricy for basic fish with tomato sauce and rice and onions: not sure what kind of fish it tasted a touch rubbery. No seasoning or grilling and as I write this I'm continuing to talk myself down from four stars and settling on three.,Nasty unkept place. Why would anyone eat in this dirty place. Nothing tasty or appealing about their food. I'd stay away if I was U.,the whole family works here and they're all such nice people. i've been here twice and both times the food is just amazing. the branzino comes to you charred black with a delicious shell of seasoning but still a very tender on the inside. the egyptian moussaka is a fried eggplant dish with tomato sauce on top that is so ungodly i've gotten it both times i've come here. i highly recommend this gem of a place for everyone to try!,"#Came by to check out the food, since I had to return my Verizon #FiOS equipment nearby. The Koshary is kind of like pasta, but with Middle Eastern spices. Nice people.Realized the next day, I forgot to return my #FiOS remote. Thought maybe it was a good excuse to come back to Little Egypt. But turns out I don't need to return it.","This place is a true gem!

527,"If you're going to go on a weekend, reserve a table. They have poppin' ass drink and O M G the food is DOPE ASF! If you know someone who is ""seafood friendly"" I would highly recommend you bring them to this place.","This earns a SOLID 3 stars from me.  We came here for food and drinks ... mostly drinks! They were a little all over the place, three different people came to our table to take our order, drinks took forever and just to sit at a table it was a mission ... the place was practically empty.  Maybe we will give it a try in a couple of months to see if they got it together.  Overall the experience was okay.","We came here once before for drinks and a snack at the bar and service was amazing. However when we returned with friends to show them this place we were turned off with the service because our server wasn't friendly and of our entrees never came out and no one acknowledged that. We had to waive down a busser to track down our server and when she finally came over we told her about an entree that we never got and just to put it into perspective- our other guests were finishing their entree. So she went to check on it but it was too late and we had plans after dinner so we asked to just cancel the order and she never once apologized (as those in hospitality do) about our entree that she forgot to check up on or offered anything else because of her and the kitchens mistake. So with this said, even though the drink I ordered was good- sadly I don't think I'll be returning.",christine at the high water was BOMB.COM she was so respectful calm and collective despite witnessing rude customers and just overall cheery and vibrant so much of the vibe is the people who work there and she was ALL if I t. kudos.,"Indoor & outdoor seating availableStreet parking availableFree house cocktail shot with yelp check-inFinally got the opportunity to brunch here and I was really looking forward to it. I tried a loco moco and the gravy reminded me of jollibee's gravy. Their chicken & waffles is pretty good, although I couldn't taste much of the jalepenos in their house-made biscuit. The steak was cooked correctly to medium rare, as requested. Their guac and chips is good; an extra order of chips is $3. Service was friendly and our waters was consistently being refilled, which I appreciate. I would come back here for brunch in the future.","Happy hour M- F 3 - 7I wish they would do a weekend happy hour like most places. Especially Sunday afternoons.If you sit outside, there are lot of flies.

528,This place is overrated. The food was ok but not great. My steak was ALL fat. Service was a little lacking. Seems like if they have an event going on in their back space everyone is distracted. Don't think we'll be making a second trip.,"Of course food quality is important but what irritates me the most is the lack of common sense and hospitality of employees.  We came in as a small party of 2.  We were told that there was a wedding in the adjacent room and that the outdoor patio was not available.  Our only option was sitting in the main room so we agreed.  There were several empty tables of 4 available but we were told that we cannot sit there since we were only 2.  Fine, we agreed.  I'm not a small guy so the table made me feel like I was sitting at a desk in 1st grade.  The wait staff saw that I was uncomfortable but conveniently did not attempt to remedy the situation.  While going to the bathroom, I noticed that the adjacent room did not have a wedding and there were actually 2 guys having dinner.  That room was about 90% empty so we could have certainly been seated there.  The outdoor patio was also empty with just 2 or 3 occupied tables.  What makes this situation even worse is that while we were eating, the available tables around us remained empty and were even empty when we left.  Lying to customers about closed off sections of the restaurant when they are actually available, and refusing to allow a larger table because a bigger party ""might"" come in doesn't seem to portray the kind of hospitality that restaurants strive to achieve.In terms of food, it was very much below par.  I ended up with a poached salmon.  It was extremely small and had absolutely no flavor.We avoided sticking around for dessert.",I gave this place 3 stars because the food can be ok..depends on the day..The service is atrocious and the attitude worse.This is Brooklyn not Paris..,"I came here for my cousin's bridal shower so there was a pre fix menu. First off, it's a lovely venue if you're wanting to host an event. There was a baby shower happening right next to us but weren't bothered by them at all. The food all in all was absolutely delicious. I seriously do not have anything negative to say about any of the dishes I received. Crab cake was full of crab meat and really good. The hanger steak is making me drool just by writing this.The creme brûlée as you would expect. Perfect. I'd definitely come back again to try the rest of the menu.","I just held my bridal shower at Bacchus this past weekend, on Saturday. I want to extend a big, big THANK YOU to Meryl and her team for the wonderful experience my guests and I had. Everyone is still raving about how delicious the food was. The service was perfect and the staff were very accommodating for our event. My decorator and some of my friends were able to come before the restaurant even opened to set up. Everything was perfectly timed out (with the passed hors d'oeuvres, appetizers, entrees, and dessert), even with some of my guests arriving a bit late. (I warned people about parking being tough and to even avoid driving if possible.) Someone was always checking in with me about when I want the next dish brought out, how much time to wait in between courses, when to cut the cake, etc. I had previously been to Bacchus two years ago for a friend's wedding and loved the food and outdoor garden space.I decided to host my bridal shower here and was so fortunate for the beautiful weather, as the garden was just the perfect area. There is a covering overhead with blinds that can be drawn down to cover from the sun. I loved the ambience of the garden space already, and my decorations looked great within it. I opted for the 4 hours open bar including mimosas, wine, champagne, beer, coffee, tea, and soft drinks. I also pre-selected two appetizers, four entrees, and two desserts for guests to choose from. I chose to print my own menu to match the theme of my party. I was allowed to bring in my own cake and have a dessert table set up by an outside vendor.Everything was coordinated prior to my event. I informed Meryl how many tables I would need (for guests and other displays including photo props, favors, etc.), sent over my Spotify playlist, and confirmed the menu. Everything went smoothly and the time flew by! Everyone greatly enjoyed themselves and is still talking about the wonderful party!Once again, thank you so much!! I will definitely be back !! :)","Bacchus is a wonderful little restaurant nestled in downtown Brooklyn. The atmosphere was inviting as well as the staff. Even with several events going on, the staff was alert and attentive. The drinks and the food were absolutely delicious! From the plating down to the very last bite- excellent!Totally recommend and definitely coming back!",Bacchus Bistro & Wine Bar
529,"Open faced omelette with cheese and tomatoes was this.. cold eggs, tasted like plastic. Unmelted cheese and raw tomatoes? Not what I had in mind.. waitress has not addressed the issue despite walking by dozens of times. Hasn't asked how the breakfast was and has completely ignored the fact that this plate was full of the unrated food. Won't be back.. many other places to eat in NoHo.","Catering catering catering!! A must for any get together or party! Skirt steak, grilled salmon and their roasted rosemary potatoes are to die for! I used Leno and coco and cru for my crew and it was a huge hit!","Nothing reminds me of home like going to an Australian cafe for breakfast. I often stroll past Coco & Cru, and had heard of it being Australian, so it had been on my list for some time. We finally came here as a party of two on a Sunday, around prime brunch time. We checked in with the hostess, and after being told that it would be about 20-30 minutes, decided to wait, and were just hanging around the front desk area for a few minutes, when she motioned to us and said she could actually seat us now. We were brought copies of the menus and glasses of water immediately. After taking a few minutes to decide, we ordered. Our food was served within 20 minutes. My husband's breakfast sandwich was a standard breakfast sandwich, with fries, egg, cheese, and sausage. He said it was good, but nothing special. My macro bowl consisted of a plate of very simply cooked vegetables, with avocado salsa. The vegetables were so simply prepared and bland tasting, I felt like I could have made something better at home. We were both really quite disappointed with the food. The ambience here is kind of weird - writing on the wall in bright colors, and very loud party music during the day on a Sunday. The acoustics of the cafe are also very bad, so it will be difficult to hear what your dining companion is saying over the din of the room. Would not recommend this place at all, and would not return.","This is a delicious lunch/brunch spot! I've been twice now and have gotten the greens bowl every time which is delicious. The flavors and ingredients used here are top notch, as I've been able to sample bites from friends' dishes. It's always so hard to choose what to get when you come here because everything looks so delicious and everything is super healthy as well!The drinks here are great as well, tying the entire dining experience together very well. The service has always been amazing which I always appreciate! I will say that this place is pretty pricey. Not a surprise given that we're in a trendy area, although the portions are decent. I will definitely be back as I work out down here a good amount and love stopping by afterwards for a healthy lunch! It's a small restaurant and definitely fills up so be prepared to wait!","MEALPAL I've been wanting to try this place but hesitated because of the price and seeing how busy it gets and how cramped it looks inside. Also can someone tell me what it means to be Australian??? Just brunch? I actually don't have a thing for brunch so not a consideration for me. Amuses me seeing people comment that their portions are big because it doesn't look like so in pictures. This is labeled as large in Mealpal too though. The MP option was a chicken burger with salad. It has an organic chicken patty, bacon, lettuce, tomato, guacamole. I think it's $19 on the regular menu. Besides potentially less salad than usual, I don't expect this to be any different than the sit down version so definitely a great deal thru Mealpal.It was surprisingly good! Someone said that the patty tasted like cardboard, but NOT AT ALL. It was juicy and had a nice mix of ingredients (carrots??) and seasoning. It was quite thick too, 3/4inch ish. The salad came with a white colored thin dressing. Not sure what it's exactly supposed to be but it was super sour. It's probably a mix of (A LOT) of lemon juice with some oil (emulsified). I feel like just lemon juice even isn't that sour. I actually like this sourness though. It definitely refreshes your palette. I dipped my patty into the dressing to have a new style. The thinness doesn't stick on to the patty but adds extra juiciness to the meat. I'm not sure if I'd go here to sit down and eat due to the price, but I'm glad I tried food from here through MP","I went here with a friend on a weekday for lunch. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and it was delicious! Love the different textures in this dish. It wasn't crowded when I went, so it was just a really nice place to chill and catch up with a friend. It was also around NYU campus, so it was very convinient to visit.",Coco & Cru
530,The cauliflower taco was not that great! My friends were very happy with their chicken and fish tacos. The service was horrible though. The host was not welcoming at all. The server first spilled water on us and then the salsa on the table. They weren't apologetic about it. The host was rude when asked to explain some things in the menu.,"Horrible attitude from the hostess. Scolded us for no reason, telling us we had moved our bar stools when we hadn't. Uncomfortably small space.",The waitress forgot my drink and food when I was the 4th person at the table... it wasn't even busy. And I remember the food being better.,"This place has so many reviews that it cant possibly need another one but I'll quickly add my two cents.We came on a busy Saturday night and luckily scored two seats at the bar. The bartenders were attentive right off the bat. Some quick tips:- start with the guacamole and chips. The guac is fresh and delicious- they make their own salsa which is yummy but spicy so beware- the enchiladas are to die forService was super quick and we were in and out if there pretty fast without a compromised dining experience. I will certainly be back, its THAT good.","First off the Shrimp Platter I got was soooo good. Possibly a little too salty, but I love sodium lol. Was it a small portion? Yes. Is it an overpriced area and place overall? Yes. Were the three avocado slices they gave me laughably paper thin? Yes. Was it damn good? Also yes.My boyfriend's steak tacos were also a very funny and small $9 lol. Service was really efficient and quick. The place is ever so slightly snobby lol. The shrimp was cooked perfectly though, and I ate every bite! Mostly because it was $18 bucks. Overpriced in my opinion, but I'd return if I had to. Only for the tequila cooked shrimp though. Yum.","I visited Barrio Chino during happy hour on a Thursday. It's a small restaurant, and it doesn't help that they packed as many tables as possible into it. But the atmosphere is actually pretty good, and even though it was full, it wasn't terribly loud.We were seated quickly. My date and I each ordered grapefruit margaritas, but mine had habanero as well. Best spicy cocktail I've ever had. Mostly grapefruit flavor with the heat from the habanero on the finish. We had a few apps as well. The mahi mahi fried fish tacos were the best fish tacos I've had in awhile. The pork ones were good, but since they're the same price as the fish, get the fish. Guacamole was good, with large chunks of avocado. But at $7 a piece, it's a bit expensive, especially since the tacos are so small.The service was great. My date spilled her drink all over herself and they brought her another one on the house. Would definitely return",Barrio Chino
531,"Best Shwarma ever. Buy two and be sure to get it with lettuce on the side. I've been going here since I was in highschool. Pre-9/11, 2001.  Nothing has changed but the price. It's almost a guarantee that the food will be the same from your first visit until your last. That have another location, not too far away, on St. Marks and the only difference is that the second location offers fries with this really good garlic sauce that pairs well with the shwarma.  This is one of those businesses that make New York have its reputation for good food.  The only bad part is the aggressiveness of customers on the line. But no worries, they handle the line quick.  Everyone wants Mamoun's.",My god try the spicy sauce with the Falafel.  You won't be disappointed.  This is the OG W4 train stop spot.,I had never eaten Falafel before I tried Mamoun's.  It has completely changed my life.  I have worked next door to this location for close to 2 years now and I eat Mamoun's for 2 years and every week I eat here at least twice.  I never feel guilty about eating this truly fantastic food.  The guys inside are so kind and after becoming a regular have learned not only my face but also my order.  I can't say enough wonderful things about this incredible establishment.,"Wow! really wow! i might sound too excited for this place, but it's been a while since I had such reaction from food and had something that made me have to pause after the first bite. this place is a hole-in-wall with line that extends out of the door. but service is fast and the guys have really good vibes. you can sit, but really it's so small just have it to go. in fact, i eat it while walking. by the way, i think they're cash only. it's really cheap though! crazy to think I've been to places that sell falafels twice the price and not even half the quality of this place had the Veggie combo sandwich filled with hummus and falafel. that hummus might have been heaven-sent. I just can't get over how good it was. the creaminess, the perfect nutty taste, how well it blends with the sandwich. the falafel was perhaps the best falafel I've ever had because almost all falafels I've tried is dry to the point I have believed that falafel was supposed to be dry, until Mamoun's proved me wrong. i enjoyed every single bite. i might have add too much hot sauce on my sandwich and will perhaps do a tad bit less next time but definitely will not skip the hot sauce (it's spicy, mind you)worth the hype. definitely in the list of NYC food I'll rave about","Mamoun's is a crowd favorite, student favorite and a celeb favorite! A small shop that can accommodate only 5-10 people and a huge line on one side. Inexpensive, quick and quality food. Food you can walk and eat is another plus!Go for their quick and easy falafel sandwich which has a good number of falafels, a good serving of salad in a fresh and soft pita pocket. Easy and not too messy. The Shawarma and Hummus are also quite good here. Beware - the hot sauce is HOT!Saw Ben Stiller here just a couple months ago! Try your luck!","I have visited Mamouns falafel up till number of times in the last few years. The queue is long but fast moving!Be prepared to stand in line for approximately 20/30 minutes at peak hours on the weekend! Falafel sandwich - the quantity is less but it's tasty! The salad is fresh, pita is warm and falafel is crispy! Do try!",Mamoun's Falafel
532,"Summary:A bit of a long wait for yakitori. While it is made fresh on a yakitori grill, it lacks that special taste that other yakitori places have, weather it be from the wood used or technique in grilling.Food:We ordered a variety of the yakitori and enjoyed some pieces while others were just so-so. In particular I thought the chicken skin was well done.Service:The wait again is a bit long. They do notify you so you can leave the area, but still not really worth the wait.",Yakitori Totto:What we order: 1. Chicken liver2. Harami3. Kalbi4. Gyutan，5. Japanese premium beef6. Negi Pon7. Teriyaki salmon set8. Vegetable don,Welcome to insect-tori... high on protein. Worst part is when you complain they say nothing and show no action to apologize. Not sure how they got their rating on the door. Hope NYC inspectors are reading Yelp reviews. Just zoom in the picture to see the cockroach.,"Totto is my new favorite yakitori spot in the city. After visiting Japan, this definitely met my high expectations. Every piece is cooked to perfection and every part of the meat tastes different and delicious. My favorite has to be the chicken tail. Order it now and you'll understand. The neck and tail have 1 limit per person. Why do you think?The chicken oysters and meatballs were not the best as people rave about them. The neck and the tail is where it's at.You must get the chicken skin as well. I was surprised by the lamb chops. The meat was so tender and juicy. I can't wait to come back again!","Sad to say Eric Ripert led us astray. Not that we knew Mr. Ripert recommended this place before we got there. We got there right at 530 and there was a line to get in. We were first on the wait list for a party of 4. While waiting for 45 minutes my husband noticed that the yakitori was being cooked on a gas grill. Not a good sign...We ordered chicken breast, shishito peppers, stuffed shishito, chicken skin, lamb chops, braised pork belly(they do not have pork belly here on skewers), chicken bun, gizzard, chicken oyster. All were decent, but not mind blowing. We've definitely had better at St Mark's as well as yakitori taisho. From start to finish we felt rushed. Waitress closed her order book 3 times while taking our order. All in all ok, but not worth the wait or the money.","High hopes with sad turnaround.Got the following:Chicken breast with scallions yakitori: 1 Star, super super dry Chicken thigh yakitori: 1 Star, as dry as the chicken breast Chicken meatballs: 3 stars, but the sauce didnt ""go"" with themChicken karage: 1 Star, dry and flavorlessBeef yakitori: 3 stars, the only thing we had worth eatingAlso got two of the rice dishes - both were not memorable.Will NOT be back",Yakitori Totto
533,"I can only judge this restaurant based off my delivery order this week. Honestly the food was fine but the portions were TINY. I mean so tiny that I paid $10 for ONE lamb skewer? Overpriced beyond belief, which is a shame because the flavors were good. Will not be ordering from them again.","When they microwave your falafel, you know you don't have to go back there. Such a bummer.",Just ordered delivery from here for the first time. The delivery window was something like 60-80 minutes but the food showed up in about 20/25! The two of us are completely stuffed with enough food for another meal at least. A++ will order again,"* 5stars = i (would) love to come back again...and again and again *We came here for lunch on a saturday afternoon and it was surprisingly not crowded -- and after eating there i cant imagine why but hey maybe we can keep it nice and quiet. The sides you get when you get an entree or a platter are smaller than ordering it by itself -- which was good news for us because we got to try more things on the menu!We got:- tzatziki 10/10: YUMMMMM. Do yourself a favor and get it. It was the perfect start of our meal on the hot sweltering day- gyro platter 9/10 (with the following two sides): meat was really good and the flavors were great. Also loved the salads that came with it (and the other entree we ordered). Our only woe was that we didnt get any more pita with it (but maybe we had to ask? Who knows)- spanakorizo 7/10: our least favorite if we had to pick just because we didnt know what to expect and wasn't quite sure how we felt about it..? My first time having it but it was a little underwhelming in terms of flavor (but maybe its supposed to be..who knows) but next time i'd rather try any of their other yummy-sounding sides- grilled veggies 8/10: these are literally all my favorite vegetables and i loved having them as a side to my meal. By itself, i think it could use a litttttle more flavor and a little less oil- pastitsio 8/10: for those of you (like us) who are having it for the first time -- imagine a non-saucy less-cheesy lasagna. I love pasta so i really enjoyed this, and again that side salad was yuuum- greek fries 10/10: we'll probably get a real order of this next time because YUM. The fries were a perfect texture and the oil+cheese were a really nice addition","I don't find myself in Brooklyn often, but last weekend my wife and I were exploring the town luckily stumbled upon Avlee! Greek food is one of our favorite cuisines so we were ecstatic to see other great reviews before stopping in. My wife and I split some fried calamari with our friend we were there with. It was very tasty, especially with the dipping sauce (I'm not quite sure what this sauce was, but we could have drank it that's how good it was). We got our usual dish that tests a new Greek place for us - the Chicken Souvlaki Sandwich/Pita without onions. The chicken was fresh and cooked really well, while the Tzatziki sauce was just right. I think my favorite part was the warm and delicious Pita bread. While there are a ton of other places to try in the area, it will be tempting to skip out on them to go back to Avlee!","Avlee is a good Greek restaurant in Brooklyn. I'm Greek-American and been eating in Astoria since I was a little kid, so for me to venture to Brooklyn for Greek food is unusual.  With this said, Avlee is a solid choice for the area.  Service was efficient and polite, and the ambiance is pleasant.  The food was all decent to good.  The halloumi was semi fried like a piece of saganaki rather than grilled which was not something I prefer, but this isn't a big deal.  Beyond this, everything else was just fine.  Nothing was outstanding, but I'd come back for sure.  Recommended.",Avlee Greek Kitchen
534,"Very interesting place with several dining options.It is underground to ""The Plaza"" hotel.I had lunch in an Italian restaurant and the food was great.There are two entrances. One on the side of the hotel and the other one is by the hotel's main entrance.",Over priced and too many tourists in the summertime. I'd stay away or just walk thru if you've never been before. All of the restaurants for the most part in this food hall has main locations throughout the city. Try and go to one of those to get a better experience.,Please replace the bar stools. Patrons are scrambling for seats and there is space for many more.,"Yes this can be an overwhelming experience, crowded, noisy and with limited seating, especially during the holiday season.That being said, the selection of food options under one roof is tremendous!Everything you can imagine, I tend to favor the Pastry and Chocolate vendors and there are plenty.Great for a rainy day destination.Just take a deep breath and take it all in.","I've spent many a day here wandering around the fancy food court trying to avoid spending excessive amounts of cash money on things like ""that piece of chocolate"" from fancy French people or those macarons (accent for emphasis) from those other fancy French people. I usually fail. I also use this place as a free restroom for when I'm in this lower Central Park area (It's open til 11pm).My favorite stands here have nothing to do with actual meals. Laduree, la Madison, lady M. The L's have it in for me to expand my waistline while shrinking my wallet. Ora Di Pasta is a good hearty option. Outside of these I don't usually eat here. Something about being at the Plaza for me is just an in and out experience aside from high tea.","This review will be limited in scope to the one vendor I tried here which is Laduree. However, before going there I wanted to explain the food hall in general. I entered through Todd English right across from Central Park. Apparently Todd English has their own takeout in this food hall because I noticed a sign that said you must pay for any food from this business before entering the rest of the food court. I was happy I came when I did since lunch hour was over and the place wasn't too busy.I made my way around and saw the bakery and sweet places I read about including Billy's Bakery and Le Maison du chocolat  to name a couple. Luke's lobster did look inviting but having just finished lunch elsewhere I only wanted a small treat. I noticed a gift shop off to the corner and began looking for things I read about online on the Plaza website. The lady at this gift shop told me that this store sells hotel merchandise only and the other stores i was looking for including the artist's bookstore is upstairs.The Plaza website she explained can be misleading. I was not impressed with what I saw down here so I decided to go for what I came for-Laduree.Laduree is a French chain pastry shop in Manhattan and they have a wide selection of baked goods including the Palmier. This is one huge almost pretzel shaped pastry but alas-It is meant to be eaten right away since there are no preservatives in it. I did make it over to the macaroon counter where they were displayed almost like giant toppings on a cake.I asked the lady what makes these so special and why does it cost more to get six boxed. She told me that their shelf life with refrigeration is only 5 days. Boxing them prevents damage so they charge $3.00 extra for that. I then asked why they are considered the best. She told me that they are imported directly from France. I ended up ordering 4 in a takeout bag. 2 for me and 2 for my husband. I got the raspberry and chocolate covered chocolate for myself.  I got him the caramel with salted butter and the lemon one.I took them to our room which had a small refrigerator so we could eat them during our stay. I loved both of mine as did he. They were both very fresh and breaks apart easily. However; I have had these same types of mouthwatering macaroons back in my hometown of Pittsburgh from some of our renown French bakeries. These sell for $2.85 a piece unless you pay the slight upcharge to $3.00 for the chocolate covered one. They were indeed very good and I was glad that I really didn't have the need to bring any home to share with those I intended to give some to. They have a great selection of pastries and believe me be ready to pack the pounds on if you eat here. They are quite big but reasonably priced.I definitely want to revisit this food hall on a future trip to check out their other offerings.",The Plaza Food Hall
535,"Uzbek cuisine is probably one of my favorites. I have already ordered online  multiple times and went to their cafe.  But today the ""manty"" was over-salted and for its price $16 for 4pcs I think it should be done in a proper way.        Their signature dish ""Uzbek Plov"" does NOT look how it is suppose to. Meet was chopped up into such small pieces that I've never ever seen  this in any Uzbek plov before. The traditional Uzbek Plov should have bigger pieces of meet not like ""bolognese"". Their ""Plov"" looks like a fake version of a traditional one. I am very disappointed and hope they will improve their quality of meal.",Lovely dishes with authentic flavors. Only downside was the service. The waitresses kept moving us around then took order of other Russian guests who came in after us before checking on us.,"I will preface with the fact that I am not familliar with Uzbeck or Kazach food, so I do not jave the referemcr to compare. I had Shurpa soup and it was deliciouse.","Lovely restaurant featuring delicious from from Central Asia, mainly Kazakhstan. I had the Lagman which is a beef broth soup with noodles and vegetables. It was delicious. The broth was light but full of herbaceous flavor. The dish was accompanied with bread and tomato salad. Bread was warm, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Baked perfectly.","4.5 stars.We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn on W 37th, and we were really happy to not only find that Yelpers so highly recommended this restaurant that is literally just around the corner from that hotel, but to later discover that those reviews were dead on.We had never had Uzbeki food before, but at Farida we discovered that we quite thoroughly enjoy it!   Farida has a setting of a very quaint and intimate restaurant, that one might just as easily expect to find in a village in another country.Looking at the menu there were so many things that sounded good, that it was hard to narrow down what to get.    In the end, we started with the Umka Perfect Puff Pies, I had the Lagman Soup as my main, and my wife created a side dish by sharing  an order of the Handmade Manti as a side.    Everything was very good, with ingredients that tasted fresh off the farm.       In the end, my eyes were bigger than my stomach, and despite enjoying my soup, I was unable to finish it.I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting NYC","Hands down one of the best dining experiences I've had in NYC. Everything we ordered was delicious, but what stood out was the outstanding service, even though it's hard to put my finger on any one particular thing. While nothing felt over the top or phony, I felt like we were VIPs during our meal. The owner/manager and staff really understand what hospitality is all about - not treating you like royalty because they have to, perfectly-scripted service or plates arriving on the table at the exact same moment, but making you feel welcome and that they are genuinely glad to serve you, as if your first visit was your tenth or one hundredth. One example is that instead of making us stand outside while we waited 20 min for a table, the manager/owner brought a table and chairs out to the sidewalk and let us sit out there (admittedly the extra round of drinks we ordered while we waited was good for them).As for the food, it was all great and we'd order any of it again. The pumpkin umka had a flaky shell and perfectly-cooked filling. The lamb ribs shaslyk had just the right combination of meaty, crispy and fatty bits, with refreshing salads and fresh veg on the sides to balance out the richness. And the Uzbek Plov was wonderful all-around - a good balance of savory and sweet (from the carrots), and the meat was tender and not just an afterthought (though the dish would still be very good without it). Everything was well-seasoned. Our friends also had the borscht, lamb skewer and lamb shank and had good things to say about them too.I'm not usually one to notice (or at least care about) decor, but the lighting fixtures are a nice touch and add to the ambience.The prices are all very reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food (and being in NYC, of course). The automatically-added service charge for a party of four was unusual, but in this case certainly warranted and well-earned. Needless to say at this point, everyone at our table looks forward to coming back.",Farida Central Asian Cuisine & Grill
536,"NYC Chefs: Please stop confusing cacio e pepe with Alfredo! It's 3-5 ingredients, depending on if you add butter and/or olive oil. Theirs was definitely not cacio e pepe, but it was an edible departure from what it should've been, so I stuck with it. Either learn to make it or call it something else.... whole pink peppercorns. SMH.","We came based on the reviews on Yelp.Given the expectations, we  were very disappointed!Starting cheese and salami platter was of low to medium quality, salad was mediocre, the calamarata pasta was not so good, the lasagna were ok to good, the papardelle were ok.We paid 140 including tip, for 3 people, no drinks.Would not recommend it.I would normally give 3 stars, but I give two, to counterbalance the current overestimated score.","As we remembered from Cafe Linda, the food, wine and service was absolutely 5-star.  What else can we say?","Who knew a gem like this existed in FiDi, of all places!First time I was here I was so surprised by the vibe and ambiance. The decorum is really great and the lighting is perfect, not too dark (unlike some trendy spots that go for an ""intimate"" vibe where you can hardly see the person sitting across from you..) The place is super trendy with cool pop art, a nicely illuminated open kitchen, over has a great feel.The food is quite delicious, I have ordered a few different things on the 3 times I have been there. I'd have to recommend the lamb fussili, it was delectable. I've also had the calamari which was fried perfectly to allow the juiciness of the squid to come through but with great crisp covering it. My friend ordered the black fettuccine and the prawns looked amazing and were huge!The best part about this place is that the prices are incredibly fair for the quality of the food and experience.If am ever looking for a place to eat in FiDi, especially Italian, I always push for this spot. Everyone I've taken here so far are always impressed!","Great experience!Food is really good, traditional Italian cucine with many regional specialties.All the staff is nice and professional, service is awesome. I definitely recommend either for lunch and dinner.","**update**The cacio e pepe is not good. It is more like fettuccine Alfredo doused in cream sauce w deflated peppercorns. Everything else we've had from this place is excellent but I had to remove a star for this classic dish done completely wrong.This restaurant has excellent quality Italian cuisine + great and timely delivery. I would highly recommend this as a neighborhood Italian joint with all of the classics to choose from on the menu. Note, we have never been to the restaurant. This review is based on delivery only. I am always trepidatious to branch out beyond my few favorite dishes but every time I do this place never disappoints.Some of our favorite dishes:Carciofini- artichoke heartsCarpaccio de Bresaola- dried beef carpaccio Parmigiana de Melanzane- eggplant parmPollo Alla MilanesePesto Gnocchi",Da Claudio
537,"$9 happy hour for good ramen, can't get better. Also had fried chicken which wasn't that great. Nice  ambiance too.","Not a fan.The interior is cool, but I was definitely not a huge fan of the food.The fried chicken was weird and even though she said it wasn't dark meat, it looked an awful lot like dark meat.The ramen didn't blow me away, it wasn't bad, but I had no desire to finish it.I was the only person in there.I don't think I'll be back.",Always attentive and doesn't overcharge for ramen like most ramen places nowadays. Tastes authentic. Would come back again.,"Happy hour 3:30-7pm Daily! Saturday evening. Group of 4. Quick service. Big portions. Delicious Food. Amazing prices. The ramens were pretty flavorful. The spice had a good amount of kick to it. Not too much, not too little. Will be back to try other ramens and their oysters","Not bad, very basic ramen that tastes good! I love eating thin noodle ramen so places like these really hit the spot. They also offer thick wavy noodles, and tsukemen during the summer. Their ramen just isn't special or unique to the store, I feel you can find ramen like this at several other places. But it is a solid bowl with good flavors in the broth. It's quite authentic to its origin, there's no awkward American twist to it to which I'm glad. What's unique about this place is that they also have a menu for oysters, which btw were very tasty and fresh, just pricy are regular hours! I wish I had came here during happy hour, I think it's a great spot to eat and hang out with friends during happy hour. Everything by itself is reasonably priced. So I would definitely come here again to enjoy a bowl of ramen and some oysters! Oh and they also serve this special matcha beer which was interesting to try haha","Was craving for ramen and want to try a new spot without paying $15+. I saw their menu that said daily 3-7pm ramen only $9 didn't know it'll apply to weekend but gave it a go. The place was a bit hidden cause the name was not that eye catching. The waiters were attentive, telling water quickly and asking if the food is okay. My bf got the regular tonkotsu and I ordered the spicy one. Both was very good and for the price makes it excellent. For $9 a bowl of ramen they gave a very generous slice of chashu and it was evenly with fat and meat. Would come back to try other flavors",Zest Ramen
538,"This is the spot is the holy grail of happy hour. It's in the weird desert of Williamsburg where there's nothing and it's in the middle of a intersection. The restaurant has a lot of character with dive bar roots. The bartender was a Renaissance Man, educating the previous crowd on something real estate related. He walked me through the menu they had a 10 dollar burger/beer on Happy Hour and 1 dollar boneless or bone-in wings. I was initially turned off by the price but got 5 boneless wings- it was everything I needed in life. I devoured it before I could take a picture. Too bad i don't live in the area I could see myself being there everyday after work. Can't wait to go back.",It's old. Like historic old lol .. but that's the charm.Walked in on a Sunday for some food and sat at the bar with high chairs.The vibe is chill and food hot.,"Food was bad. Ordered delivery, waited for an hour. Called the restaurant, no answer, called second time, voice mail was full. Another 45 minutes later, food finally came. Salad was all mushed, fries were all cold. Won't order delivery again. But will try dine-in and give it a second try.","BEST chicken and waffles ever!  Love the dive bar/hipster vibe of this spot - they make a good Bloody Mary (very spicy!) but the star of the show was the chicken and waffles.  I think they deep fry the waffles so it is crispy, chicken is amazing with the peppers and scallions - we asked for extra but they never came around to give us that.  100% would come back on a hungover Sunday for brunch!",Super delicious food but very shitty service. Our server forgot our stuff multiple times and we waited over an hour and a half for our food. They have a super cute patio and the place is never crowded which is a plus. If you come here expect to be here for at least 2.5 hours. Service time took this long both times I've been. Their vegetarian chicken and waffles is the best.,Best chicken and waffles I've ever had....and I've had a lot! The chicken is so crispy and delicious. The waffles are perfection. The peppers and spicy sauce give it so much flavor. Can't recommend them enough.,Hard Times Christmas Liquors at the Sunset bar
539,Came on a Thursday night and didn't have to wait long for our table. Ordered the king crab legs entrees and the scallops. The sautéed spinach was really salty.,"$1 oysters & $3 wine in Greenwich Village is a must go. The dollar oysters are regular probably blue point, fresh but nothing special. They have many different types of oysters which we'll go back and try next time when we're in the city.","Take a look at the picture I took. The name of this restaurant is ""Fish"" but when my 32$ order of fish came out it was this small! They should rename the place ""Vegetable"". I feel robbed.","I have found another fave seafood place ! This place offers everything very fresh. Lobster Bisque is so delicious ! Not like other place where either is too salty or bland like is from canned,  this one you can taste its homemade fresh flavor. Also in it, they give you pieces of the lobster. Oysters are very fresh too. For the entree, I had whole Branzino.  It was super yummy especially the sauce on it. The only thing is missing that they don't put enough sauce on it so fish is a little dry. Other than that,  this dish is still recommended. You gotta try their French Fries as well. Im picky about how my French fries be cooked.  I like shoe string type which is what they have and the crispness n saltiness are just perfect. My only complain is that their portion is small for the price charged. Fries $7 but not big enough. Calamari $14 is way too little ! Sauce is good though !I'll still come back to this place next time I'm craving for seafood .","I tried this place but the main dishes start at about $26.  On top of that the portion of fish I got wasn't very large anyway, and the dish consisted mostly of fries and green beans.  So I feel like I payed over $20 for fries, green beans and a side of salmon.  There are other places where your money will go further.Also music was too loud.",Food was actually decent and at a fair price. I got the Red white and blue (6 oysters and a pint of PBR for $9.99). I also got the fish market soup (awesome) and the catfish sandwich (which was ok).  Service was good. One star off because the restaurant is really dirty. There is a fine line between charming and dilapidation: these guys crossed that line. Menus had mold spots on them. Cutlery and dishes were dirty. Tables and chairs were grimy.  It's a good place to eat but I felt like I needed a tetanus shot afterwards.,Fish
540,"The service and beer selection are 5 out of 5. But the food choices are limited to northern American junk food with no much creativity or interesting flavours. We tried their koji salad with salmon and ahi tuna, the salmon and tuna was cooked just right, but really nothing worth than 3 stars.","I wasn't really hungry when I found this place. I just wanted to site down and watch the games on TV. I was seated at the bar promptly and the bartender helped my immediately. It was quiet busy but she did not let a minute go by before serving me a drink and takin my order.  It was brunch time so I got the brunch menu and went with...- Fried Chicken Waffle Club, it was delicious. I would highly recommend this if it's an option. It's was a bit annoying to eat because it wasn't really a sandwich. You have to cut it to pieces and it does slide all over the place.  Even though it was a pain to deal with. It was still good. If you're in the area give it a go","My boyfriend and I had lunch here last month. Thought it was a very average lunch. We shared a sandwich (just okay), fried cheese curds (kind of had a rubbery texture), and rosemary fries (better than the sandwich and fried cheese curds?). Probably would not recommend any of the food I had here as it all was just average to me. Despite being a relatively big restaurant, Malt House can get quite crowded during peak hours. Our table was also very close to the tables next to us. Taste | 3Atmosphere | 4Presentation | 3Service | 3OVERALL | 3","Happy hour here is great!!!!!!! The small food dishes are SO CHEAP, and it's very lively as well. I came here around 5PM on a Tuesday with one other friend for happy hour (4-6PM). Admittedly, I found this place to be a bit dark for my taste, but it was definitely packed by 6PM and the overall atmosphere was lively and friendly.FOR HAPPY HOUR, They have a selection of draft beers for $6, some wines and Moscow mules for $8, and a few mixed drinks for $9. I didn't find the drink deals to be anything special, but my friend and I ordered 2 sangrias. The sangria comes in a small glass cup that is REALLY CUTE with a useless paper straw that also LOOKED CUTE but could have done without. For food, we ordered the burger bites - which are essentially burger filling in wontons. Wings (comes with 6) korean style, and 6 oysters.The 6 oysters were a dollar each and came with a jalapeño inside each. Didn't taste really amazing, but also not bad. You have to order a minimum of 5 during happy hour. Burger bites were really....not good. Super salty and I felt like it was a weird fusion of burger wonton. Wouldn't order again, comes with 3 for 7$ and they are a bit small too.Wings are a GREAT DEAL. Comes with 6 wings for 7$. They weren't amazing wings, but they were meaty, decently flavored, and overall a LOT of food for the price. I would definitely come here again for happy hour, but this place does get packed!","I recently organized a work HH here and it was great! I worked with Leland and he was very easy to communicate with. I was working with a tight budget, and the Malt House was one of the few bars in the area that did not require a minimum but still gave us our private space. Originally, we planned for about 40 people but on the day of the event, it was thunder-storming, so a lot of people bailed. I gave them the heads up that it would probably only be about 15 people, and they were still happy to accommodate. We also told them that we only wanted people ordering the happy hour menu drinks (HH is M-F 4-6) and they were very good at enforcing this. For drinks, I had a Moscow Mule. It was refreshing, but a little too sweet for my taste.On to the food. We ordered the happy hour bites, and I didn't come across a single bite I did not like. We had the buttermilk chicken bites, wings, rosemary fries, and cheese curds. My favorite was probably the cheese curds, especially with the chipotle aioli it came with. I liked it even better with the cilantro jalapeno aioli that came with the chicken bites.Would def have another work event here, and even come back on my own to try some of the other food.","Overpriced, standard/average pub fare---The Malt House was the venue my friends and I decided upon for a much needed catching up todayLocated in FiDi, there is another in the Village. I've also been to that location. Both have a charming atmosphere. Regarding this Malt House, I've visited a few years ago for HH and some nibbles. Today was my first time having a proper meal and my overall opinion is lukewarm.Popular with the those who work in the area, the space filled up pretty quickly since it was prime lunch time. The service was prompt and efficient. We were done in about 75 minutes.We started off with some appetizers: guac and chips and the cheese curds. Both were tasty & decent sized portions shareable for 4.As far as entrees, my friend and I chose the Atlantic Salmon Po Boy (without the brioche bun) which was served with caramelized onions, avocado and dressing. We both passed on the fries and chose the side salad. I thought it was pretty good.  Our other friends ordered the skirt steak tacos (3 to a portion) and the Turkey BLT. They seemed satisfied with their selections.The Malt House was a quick suggestion for lunch and served its purpose. Frankly, I prefer other restaurants in the area.Not bad.",The Malt House
541,"Save your trip from this place, where so many other people already labeled and stated the truth of it being a dive & no frills spot. I'll also add to that, an uncleanliness place that serves you food that makes you go hug the toilet (pretty sure it was the fried pork and chive dumplings!!!) I'll digress, the place is cheap, food is kind of fast and that is about it for me. The place is small and sketchy looking with menus plastered all over the walls. You'll get brief spurts of weird smells and wonder if it's the food or something else. I ordered the #1 house special noodle soup and it came out in a tin bowl where I was afraid to place my mouth on to slurp down my remaining noodles and soup...beware. It was just ok, nothing special about it. I also ordered the above mentioned porn and chive fried dumplings and it tasted ...off. Not that it was rotten but the dumpling wrapper had too much flour in it? The stuffing was pasty? Lol I should've stopped eating it after the 2nd dumpling but I'm the type of person who hates wasting food. Like I said, it didn't have a sour or gone bad taste, just that it was not the greatest? And yup, it gave me the runs. So because of all of the above, I will give this place a 1 Star. I was contemplating 2 because of the prices but that wouldn't even justify the overall experience. Please skip this place. You'll thank me later.",Mountain Qi hand pulled noodles spicy for $7. Be still my heart. (Should I move back to NYC? No. But maybe for the food?),First time at this place Rome it right away I waited about 15 minutes to get somebody to help me. Maybe it's because I don't speak Chinese. Ordered the cook lettuce it was delish. Ordered the tofu wrap it was almost inedible I don't know what it was in the middle very crunchy. I ordered the meatballs $7.50 they were spongy not my thing. 4 dim sum it took me quite some time to get it. Not worth the $20 I left on the table.,The pork buns are AMAZING here and only 5 dollars for 3 buns! It is a steal honestly. The pork is cooked to perfection and the sauce and peanuts really bring the whole thing together. I also love getting their noodle soups - you can't go wrong with any of the noodle soups. My favorite though is beef brisket. The broth is flavorful and not too salty.Highly recommend.,"We've been coming to this place since 5 years ago. It's been constantly good. Small place, only like 7 table, 3 of them can only fit 2 people. It could be packed at some times. Place is clean, noodle ( knife cut or handpull) madeQuickly, my favorite is beef noodle soup. ($6.75  August 2019)Noodle came with spinach, no cilantro ( thank you!)Service is fast, nothing to complain about","This whole area just has a couple of spots specializing in a couple of dishes and I was excited to try this spot.We got the Mount Qi beef noodle, hot sesame noodles, sichuan style dumplings, stewed pork taiwan style, and stew pork burger.The taiwanese dish...was kind of what you expect (probably a bit too much rice relative to the toppings). I was so ready for the the mount qi beef noodle to be amazing, but I think it was just meh. The noodles weren't that special, neither was the broth. The hot sesame noodles...again high expectations but it was just meh as well. They didn't focus on the sesame/peanut flavor and it reminded me of dan dan noodles without the spice. The pork burger was yummy, but lacked sauce. If you put some chili sauce on it, it'll be good. My favorite was probably the dumplings and the sichuan sauce it was in, spicy and sweet. Also, there's no free water here.",Super Taste
542,"What a let down on multiple levels . Showed up for a 445 reservation and was seated less than five minutes later . Placed my order after another five minutes . Problem was was that I inadvertently ordered the wrong entree ( I own it) . My inadvertent order you ask ? The Chicken Schnitzel. I meant to order their chicken sandwich which boasts beautiful pics on yelp but again I own it . The schnitzel was beyond boring , flavorless and downright a paltry excuse of an entree. (See pic) at almost 30 dollars ! To top it off, the entree took almost an hour to come to the table ! No fault to the waitress either as she was amazin I will never want to see what their sandwich is like now that I tried their chicken . Likely to not return .","Leaving a review for drinks only at the bar - took forever to take our order - drinks were not made properly, watered down and spilled while making- not to mention getting our check to close out took another 10 minutes. Unprofessional / not experienced bartenders.","It's the equivalent to going to your local ""Friday's"" yes tuckroom is the Friday's of the seaport. A reliable semi decent mean a close walk from home.","Once we figured out to go up the escalators to the restaurant, we were seated immediately by the windows.  I got to watch the bridge.  Our experience was pretty good.  Our waiter Mel came over within 5 minutes and took our drink orders (Tuck Old Fashioned & Jack/Coke).  Delicious.  We ordered appetizers only, 1/2 dozen oysters (very good), crab cakes (good), cheese platter (no crackers to put cheese on - as I don't eat the meat).  I have to say it was good, portions are good as we were both full.  I can't say this was the best meal I've ever had, but it was definitely satisfying.  The cost for the above $106.  It's NYC.. expect nothing less.Also, for the ladies, the bathroom was very clean! (this is important information we need to share with each other!)The decor is pretty neat with books lining shelves, and a secret door behind the hostess station leading to a private room.  The bar area is kinda tight to pass through to the bathrooms, but that's ok.  The staff was very friendly.","I'd give this place -10 stars if I could. Literally the worst experience we have had in NYC. The service we experienced was borderline racist and just downright horrible. DO NOT COME HERE. It's a freaking tourist trap with mediocre food that is overly expensive. We came in during lunch time. They had a lunch special going on: appetizer, entree and desert for $26. Okay cool, we'll share that and order a drink and half a dozen oysters. Mind you the oysters are well over $18 + the drink is $6. Our server tells us that ""it's not allowed to share entrees"". But by the goodness of her heart she'll allow it if we order a side entree. Wow we're so lucky! Fine, so we order the truffle fries that are an extra $12. How convenient is it that a family sits next to us and we get to hear their order. ""We are going to share the caesar salad with chicken"". Their server tells them ""okay that's fine"". So why is it that the table next to us gets to share THEIR order but we are not allowed to? It gets worse. We tell her we're ready for the check while still working on our fries.  She literally takes away our whole truffle fries plate that's still half full. Like ok we were still eating it???I don't want to say that this establishment or server was racist but it sure did feel that way. Why were we forced to  spend more money while our counterparts sitting next to us didn't have to? IF the lunch special is one per customer they should CLEARLY state that on the menu. I've never been to an establishment that FORCES you to order more food and if there was a minimum at this restaurant they should state that too! Our server is lucky that we tipped at all. We were having such a beautiful day in the city and we left this establishment with a VERY bitter taste in our mouths. Btw, for the price you pay, the food does not compare. The oysters did not taste fresh. Literally you could find food ANYWHERE else that's better. Go try the Mcdonald's or Taco bell across the street. We experienced better customer service from there lmao.","I have to admit, I had a fabulous time at The Tuck Room. Honestly, what's not to like. The place is gorgeous and what you can't see (water view) on the outside is definitely made up for by the beauty on the inside.  The layout and hip art makes The Tuck Room such a wonderful spot to have a meal and drinks with friends. With that said, I visited The Tuck Room for happy hour with a few friends. The service was excellent and the food was not to had either. In our usually fashion, we typically order almost everything on the happy hour menu because ""we be"" hungry like that. Anyway, the chicken, calamari, and mac and cheese bite was excellent but I found the prosciutto flat bread to be a bit dry. None the less, everything was delicious. Also, our bartender Beatrice was outstanding. I had a few Norma Jeans an one sangria. Believe that was enough!! I'm definitely a fan and I will be back very very soon.",The Tuck Room
543,"I visited 21 Shanghai House when I took a visit to New York. I searched intricately for exotic food in the Chinatown district, and finally found something here, jelly fish. Now I wasn't a fan of the jelly fish, but I was a fan of the menu options that this restaurant offered. The area where it is located was not the best, so I suggest you go there during the day. It can be a bit crowded there as well, so if you have a big party it may be difficult to find seating. Concluding: If you are looking for a restaurant in Chinatown that offers authentic Chinese cuisine I recommend 21 this place.","The XLB skin is relatively tender but the meat is over powered by ginger. 8 for $5.95  The cold cucumber app is not worth the $6 though refreshing with a hint of sesame oil. The Shanghai pan fried buns are 4 for $2.95. They are greasy, fatty, and unimpressive. The price for the XLB is unbeatable but definitely not as good as anything you can get in Shanghai. 21 Shanghai accepts cash, Visa, MasterCard on the contrary belief it's cash only (based on the sign). They do not accept Amex even though they ironically have an Amex check holder.",Very disappointed in 21 Shanghai House. Shanghai Cafe Deluxe has way more authentic shanghainese food.,"So this place was bomb. Came here with Lebom and Jimz to meet up with a friend/work colleague of Jimz. The friend warned us that the waitress was a little cold, but when Jimz busted out the fluent Mandarin, she warmed right up. We got a ton of food. We started with 2 orders of pork xiao long bao and 1 of lobster xiao long bao...or soup dumplings for those of you who don't know.  These were the best I've had outside of the homeland. The soup was flavorful without too much grease. The meat was tender. The best part was, they literally made these in front of you so you could see how it was done. The Wu Xi pork chops were cooked in a flavorful brown sauce. The Sizchuan style beef was tender with a flavorful broth. You know the stereotype where Chinese people get better service and things not really on the menu? Definitely true.This is a place I'd highly recommend and come back to visit.","With so many Shanghainese restaurants in Chinatown, we came to 21 Shanghai House because of the positive reviews on Yelp. The menu had a good variety and prices were reasonable (around $11 for our fried noodle and $6 for steamed Shanghainese buns). After reading the menu, we knew this wasn't an authentic Shanghainese restaurant. Perhaps they include other dishes to cater to more customers, but you don't see Kung Pao Chicken, beef and broccoli, or garlic shrimp in Shanghainese cuisine. Of course, we were right. The Shanghainese Fried Noodles had shrimp, which isn't something you usually see in that dish (I'm not complaining though because I love shrimp!). The skin of the steamed buns was way too thick. We were a little disappointed with the execution and the authenticity of the dishes, however, the flavour was pleasant. They were quite delicious.It's amusing to read the other comments about the quality of service. The gentleman (maybe the owner) was friendly and great; no complaints about him. The female waitress wasn't rude, but we found her a little pushy. She kept on introducing dishes to us when we were still reading the menu. She dropped off the bill after we finished our meal. We sat for another 5-10 minutes chatting and drinking the tea, and within that time, she came by TWICE to check if we paid yet. I stood up to go to the washroom and she walked over right away to check on the bill. We felt uncomfortable like we were being kicked out or like we would make a dash out the door (we were seated next to the door). There were only 2 other tables so they didn't need to turnover our table.",Loved it all! Had a small issue at first but they were good about resolving it which is appreciated. I ordered the pork soup dumplings which were good- broken 2/3 but still good- the shrimp dumplings were delicious as well and so was the pork and noodles with veggies - I also had the Scalino pancake and it was crispy without being oily. My new guest spot.,21 Shanghai House
544,Beware the prices here are not what they say they are.... the first time I came here it was normal but this time they increased the price last minute.... we told them we didn't order extra toppings but they charged us.PLUS THIS PLACE SAID ALL CASH..... to avoid taxes.... scummy place.....,"Three words: Not worth it.Came here for lunch since the Shanghai restaurant on the next block was full. Right from the start we were told it's CASH ONLY. Ordered the classic beef pho, the cheapest pho item on the menu ($9.95). While this price is more similar to other Chinatown pho places, the other phos on the menu are super steep. Once I got it, all I could see and taste in the broth is OIL. The noodles might have been a bit under-cooked cause they were more firm than other pho places. The beef slices were sadly so dry and tough. If I didn't enjoy the classic, I highly doubt ordering something else that's more expensive would be of worth.The interior is nice and supposedly the bathroom too. But food-wise, I don't think it's worth trying out when more affordable and better pho places are so close by.",The food took forever to arrive and when it did they got 2 out of 3 of our orders wrong. The one order they did get correct ended up giving my friend food poisoning. Two of us got the Classic Saigon and one of us got the beef dumpling with noodle. We all got the 16 hour broth. I don't know what the heck is wrong with this place. We have all been to the Saigon Shack on the LES multiple times and have never had any complaints. I haven't checked the prices yet. But I also think that they have increased prices since the last time I visited Saigon Shack. We were all extremely disappointed and will definitely not be returning.Edit: I also got food poisoning. I hate the world. Classic broth killed us. My friend who got the 16 hour was aiight. Still never going back.,"Although I was wary of eating here at first because of all the recent hype, I was pleasantly surprised! This modern, hip Vietnamese restaurant serves up different types of pho, as well as a variety of rice dishes and vermicelli bowls if you're not feeling like having soup. I was intrigued by the fusion dish ""Viet X Cajun Pho"" (crawfish, shrimp, corn, and rice noodle in Cajun seafood broth) off their summer menu, and decided to try it with soft shell crab. The bowl came out HUGE compare to my friend's pho, and I loved the crispiness of the crab, bites of sweet corn, and the bold, fragrant seafood broth in it. I still think that I'd like the regular pho with beef broth more, but really enjoyed the Cajun twist to this one.Note that this spot is cash only!",The bun bo hue here was just okay. I've definitely had better. I tried some of my bf's pho as well and I thought it was just average as well. Both were not that flavorful. There's a good selection of beer though and I liked the modern interior of the restaurant.,The 'crazy rich broth' was about a solid 3 stars. Pho is either good pho or bland pho. The broth I ordered was pretty bland and flavorless. The rice noodles were clumped. However the service was great. Everyone from the water guy to the female asian servant was amazing. Get the:Spring rolls Buddha beer Bathroom ceiling interior was kind of appealing. I would only go back for the Buddha beer.,PhoBar
545,"Arepa Arepa!  Went here with a small party and everyone was a big fan of the sweet plantain chips with the guacamole.  One person had the Que Guyabo special but was not too thrilled about it (too watery).  Besides that, no dish had any negative comments at all.  One thing I will say is that both times we went the credit card machine was working fine (I did think after reading some reviews it would be a cash only place in the end but I was wrong)","Beware, this place is extremely small. We went on Labor Day with 5 people around 8 PM and had to pass. There were no sears and it did appear as if anyone was leaving soon. We eod have loved to give this place a try based upon the reviews but we're hungry and not up for a wait.","The smallest place with an even bigger taste. Good things comes in small places. If you know what arepas are, this is the place. If you don't , WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!","Obsessed with this place! I came here on a Sunday right when it opened at noon and it was seriously beyond delicious. My fiance and I shared the Pernil con Todo arepa (I think it may have been a special) and the De Pabellon arepa, which I liked more. I can't even put into words how good it was. The place is a tiny hole in the wall and doesn't look or feel very clean but maybe that's part of its charm. The service was SO friendly and it just felt like home. I can't wait to come back!","Went to Caracas Arepa Bar for dinner on a Wednesday. It's a small hole in the wall restaurant. Pretty dim inside and not too much seating. But if you do choose to sit in, there is waiter service.Service is pretty quick, but the food takes awhile to come out, maybe because they make it fresh. The croquetas were delicious, if a bit small. They were very cheesy. The arepa I got was the La Playa, which had tilapia, veggies, and a nice cilantro based sauce. Definitely a good spot if you want a lighter dinner, might want to get a second sandwich if you have a heartier appetite.","Excellent arepas. We ordered takeout from here and got a pabellon arepa with beef and a del gato arepa. The pabellon was definitely the winner, of the two. I'd love to actually come sit down and try some of the sides as well.",Caracas Arepa Bar
546,"Cute and cozy spot in Ft. Greene. Highlights include the ambience, the arepas and the churro donuts. Drinks and main dishes could use a bit more flavor and flair. We ordered the spicy mezcal drinks and both were underwhelming and a bit flat. The duck tacos also lacked flavor and creativity. Was basically shredded duck with avocado. Hate when you order something at a restaurant that you could make yourself at home!OK experience overall. Nothing super special or memorable other than the arepas and donuts mentioned earlier. In terms of value of the overall meal, not the best you can find in Brooklyn. Our total bill came to $150 for a few dishes and 4 drinks split between 2 people. Just sayin you could prolly do better at that price point.....","I wasn't sure whether to give my stars based on the food, service or the ambiance, so my 4 stars based on my overall experience. While the service and the back garden were absolutely lovely and I would definitely go back for a nice hangout spot with friends, but the food wasn't up to par imo. We ordered duck confit and steak and eggs. There was nothing special about the duck, and the steak was a little tough.","Finally had my last visit to Colonia Verde, which I felt coming on for quite a while unfortunately.We live around the corner and the food is straight up delicious...we've gone to dinner and brunch here likely 30 times over the past year-and-change, but each time we eked one step closer to our last visit. I'll explain succinctly: the service.The training of the waitstaff doesn't seem to include saying ""thank you"" ever, delivering food on time (it was made and sitting on the expo line many a time), filling up water or coffee, or providing perhaps a bit more welcoming service to those you acknowledge as regulars (for real, we would get recognized by our server because we went there so much and were still treated to poor service...and we always tip well as former service folk).Five stars for the food. Negative three because the service is so bad it's now deprived of us a favorite neighborhood place to eat.","I really enjoyed our meal here. Vibe is fun and energetic, and the place has a great outdoor patio space in back.Drinks - interesting selection, lots of spicy mezcal / tequila cocktails. I had the picosa, would recommend.Appetizers - Bangin'. We had the pulpo, tuna crudo, tacos. All were fantastic. I'd go back and just order appetizers.Meals - We split a few plates across the group. Highlights were the picanha, cooked to perfection and seasoned well but was not a lot of food. Baby eggplant was great.","Excellent Latin food in the heart of Fort Greene. Colonia Verde has a lot to be proud of. Drinks- very tastes went with the Big Wheel which is a newer cocktail to the menu. Chili infused tequila. Nice for those who like something with a little kick to it. Apps- the Sausage parrillada was the perfect pairing with our ribeye. Queso cheese, mini arepas, vegetables and sausage. Perfect pairing with our ribeye Ribeye- 40oz was more than enough to share for 2 hungry guys! The sauces that it come with also added a nice touch. Especially the spicy habanero mayo. Cooked medium rare. Was a little fattier than expected but overall a good cut meat. For desert we ended up with churros (2 ordered because we couldn't just stop at 1). Overall, can't say enough about the experience at Colonia Verde. If the weather is nicer out, definitely recommend the greenhouse or outdoors. Reservations are helpful but not completely necessary. If you go with the ribeye, expect to spend ~$100/pp (around $2.75/oz). Not the best steak I've had (Keen's and Luger's) but great Latin based experience.",Lovely servers! Gave us an extra dessert for my mom's birthday.Loved the food especially grilled steak and coconut cake.,Colonia Verde
547,"The one on the left. Late night dinner on a Monday, crowded and a bit of a wait. Service was a little slow / indifferent. Also I'm a believer in first come first serve and we were passed up a few times over some other parties that came after us for ordering and drinks. Maybe our (well behaved) kids were killing their super cool restaurant vibe. Food was tasty. Got the beef with sticky rice, chicken pad Thai, spicy eggplant with veggies ( instead of a protein), kahsol and mango sticky rice. Everything was tasty, probably a notch above all the standard Thai food places in terms of quality and flavor. We'd hit it up again.","I am very sad to post this review but I feel I must so you don't experience the same tragic we did today.Coming from a long line of Thai restaurant owners, I was extremely upset by the way we were treated today.  We are tourist and had a lot to see and visit at NYC and tried our best to make it to the restaurant in time before they closed - 35 minutes to spare to be exact. When we arrived, the first thing the waitress said to us was, ""we close in 35 minutes."" We then replied, ""we know what we want and we'll eat fast."" With tantrum-like behavior, we were seated. For the first time, my family felt awkward - and to say we eat out a lot is an understatement. We've never been treated so rudely.  Btw, I understand Thai fluently and I could hear the complaints about our late arrival- horrible. I ordered the noodle soup and wasn't even offered the spicy condiments.  We felt so bad, I was compelled to ask to have my food (half-way eaten) packed Togo. I thought, if they were customer-centric, they would insist and tell me to take my time, instead, they were happy to obliged. And on our way out, instead of saying ""thank you, have a good night!"" one was on her phone surfing the net while the other was counting money. So, we saw our way out and for sure, NEVER coming back.Needless to say, this is our ONE and DONE. There are plenty of Thai restaurants that would be more than happy for your patronage.  It may be a drive, but try Pye Boat Noodle, you won't regret!","I was here last month and thought their food was decent. On a Saturday night I decided to go here with my parents. I am regretting picking this one just because they offered reservation. Burnt drunken noodle, terrible red curry. In NYC for Thai food there are a million options. keep up ur game to be in the race. never again!",Come back? Yes. Service:Really nice and enough staffFood:The combos are great as well as their a la carte. The lychee champagne was good too. Space: Relatively small space (prob 10-15 tables only?) and crowd tends to be older. They have bathrooms.,"Ordered delivery from here tonight. Delivery arrived on time and was packaged neatly. No spills. Everything arrived hot. Order is correct. I ordered the Kanom Jeeb and the Guay Tiew Pad See Ew with shrimp.In the Kanom Jeeb was mushroom, minced chicken, and shrimp. I got them steamed instead of fried. I like that it's an option. You get six for $8.95. They were delicious! The soy sauce they came with is good too, salty. You can taste the chicken and the shrimp..you can see real shrimp in them too. Cooked perfect. Fresh lettuce. I'd order these again.The Guay Tiew Pad See Ew is wok fried flat noodles, brown sauce, egg, and Chinese broccoli it said. It seems like regular broccoli to me lol but it was cooked perfect, not too soft. The stems had a crunch. The brown sauce is delicious. The egg is mixed throughout and adds to the flavor. The flat noodles are soft and delicious. The shrimp is cooked perfect. Nice filling portion for $15.95. My only complaint is that you pay $2 more for shrimp than for chicken, tofu, or veggie and you only get 6 shrimp. Next time, I'd get the chicken.Very good Thai!!","Topaz noodle bar is good if you're looking for quick and cheap bites to get. But if you're looking for delicious food, you should go somewhere else. There is two of topaz. This noodle bar is the one underground. The store itself was pretty small, with just 7ish tables. However, it wasn't too crowded on a weekend dinner time, so that was pretty nice. I got the khao soi meal that comes with spring rolls as the appetizer. Both the khao soi and spring rolls were good but not too special. However, you get what you pay for right? :)",Topaz Noodle Bar
548,"The food was absolutely awful with tasteless salads, meh croque madame and the shrimp salad had only one shrimp in it. What a rip off.

By far the worst place I have ever been. The food was horrible, I have had better Huevos Rancheros at a food stand. And to top it all off the waitress snapped at me for asking a general question about what kind of food I should get and gave me attitude like it was illegal to such a question. Manager came by and was useless in handling the situation. It's sad, you want to go for a great experience and end up at a 1 star resturant.Go at your own risk - don't put high hopes in this place.","When my group of 3 walked by on a Monday night, we were worried we wouldn't get a table because all of the seats outside were taken. It was a beautiful night so it would have been great to take advantage of this, but we were happy to sit inside as well. We skipped the apps in favor of moving right on to our entrees, and we were all happy with our meals. I tried the mahi mahi and fettuccine with lobster, both of which were awesome. We couldn't resist the dessert menu and although the blondie sundae was not at all a blondie sundae (no blondie, only ice cream with two small pieces of shortcake), the creme brûlée was good.","As a Soho, West Village resident for the last 25+ years I have to say this place is quite simply pretentious and overpriced... it's the kind of cute little spot that loves its ""cuteness"", but just doesn't care enough to deliver. They're constantly playing table charades, shuffling customers out the door like cattle, with virtually a slap on the ass as you walk through the door. Feels like you're part of some slick game sitting there - where the service is suspiciously ""astute"" and the receipt is ever-ready. Do yourself a favor and try Oscar's Place on Hudson St, or Sant Ambroeus (directly next door), both of which earn their clout and esteem.","West Village staple. Great pastas, fish, apps. Chill ambiance (a little loud). Go for a glass of wine - the drinks can overpower (or get drunk with a drank). CAVEAT - it can get super loud and packed and when it does it's hard to hear OR get a drink. Literally was told once it would take 30 mins for a drink while I was eating desert. Morale of this review - Easy delicious Italian. Never disappoints.",Extra Virgin
549,Good food. Brings back the taste of the Philippines when I was over there with a bit of a fusion twist.,"Have been wanting to try this place out for at least a year! Came here for brunch with a reservation on a Sunday. Place wasn't super crowded which was nice. There seemed to be one waitress for the whole place though which was unfortunate. she was very pleasant , but kind of forgetful. We got the bottomless mimosas but the drinks never came. Our food came out but no drinks. So I had to get up and go to the bar to ask her and she said there must have been a mistake with the bar and apologized.  However, we were halfway through our meal before drinks came so kind of defeated the purpose of bottomless.  It would have been nice if she comped the drinks because in spite of paying for unlimited, only about one was drank due to the delay.  I know this place is popular so maybe it was just a bad day, but not sure I have mixed feelings about returning.","My friends and I decided to try some Filipino food on a Friday night at Jeepney, and unfortunately the food was really disappointing. It is unfortunate tht I have to give two stars to this restaurant, but here is why: We ordered the seafood noodles, mussels, and yam fries. Mussels and fries were decent, but I've had better in other places. The seafood noodles had a weird taste to it and was unpleasant to our palate. Furthermore, the food being disappointing we were super grossed out about the three baby mice that were roaming around on their outdoor patio area. We mentioned that to two of the servers, and they seemed to know about it and didn't think that it was a big deal. To me, that is just extremely gross and unsanitary! Management definitely needs to look into their mice problem. Makes me wonder if they have mice running around any other parts of the restaurant. I'm not sure that I will come again until the mouse situation is taken care of!","The hype is definitely real.This place has been featured on so many different shows that I knew I had to drop in during my visit. When I told my nephew about my plan, he was super excited.In my quest to work up an appetite, I decided that we would trek here by foot from Port Authority. You read that right, we walked what felt like 1,000 blocks. Fortunately for us, the weather today was great. We also stayed on the shaded side. We also took a couple of breaks. By the time we got there, we were so hungry I legitimately wanted to get a bunch of items from the menu.There weren't too many people when we got there. Of course about halfway into our meal, the brunch crowd poured in. We didn't have a reservation, but were able to score seats outside. What a great idea it was. The kababayan crowd were seated outside. It was highly entertaining to hear all the Tagalog speaking folks. So glad my nephew didn't understand a word because it was all adult stuff. Ha.My nephew got the ube/longanisa. I got the Tocilog. We both got a pineapple juice and shared an ube shake. We started with an order of the lumpia. I ate everything on my plate and then some. I helped my nephew finish his. S.O.  G.O.O.D.Had I been with adults I definitely would have gone for the bottomless drinks option. The couple next to us were having a great time getting their drink on. It was entertaining hearing them order their drinks since the drinks have funny names.Service was great. I have zero complaints.I definitely recommend sitting outside weather permitting.For a moment, you feel like you're not in the city.","I liked Jeepney a lot! I am relatively inexperienced with Filipino food (except for my best friend from High School's grandma making us lumpias) and found this place on yelp while trying to expand my horizons. It's interesting because there's like 3-4 Filipino places within blocks of each other, and our intention was just to walk in one by one and see which could seat us right away, and Jeepney was first and got us seated immediately. I wonder if they get a lot of business because they're first if you're walking south. The atmosphere is so cute - love the fun, retro, colorful decor inside and the outdoor patio is wonderful and full of greenery for a nice day out. For happy hour we had some pretty well priced drinks - I got some mojito situation I found to be a little too sweet but that's just my own taste. For an app we ordered the lumpias and they were absolutely DELICIOUS. Love love love them. For our main meal we ordered the Shrimp Hipon, shrimp in a sauce of garlic, ginger, achuete, and 7-up soda. We were kind of shocked there was a 7-up sauce based item but decided to give it a shot. It doesn't taste strongly of 7-up but the overall flavor was delicious!! We also had a side of bok choy, one of my favorite veggies. Lastly we had the Halo-Halo. I liked the ice cream and the jellies in it but I didn't love the corn and some other ingredients in it that I can't fully identify. Also the shaved ice was as hard as a rock and basically just a big block of ice, could have used it being more shaved/softer. All in all it was a very good meal with a few little downsides and I would absolutely recommend and return to try more things!","Before coming here, I was not a ribs gal. Now, I CAN'T get enough of the banana ketchup ribs. I will literally come here just for those - melt off the bone with a delicious tangy vinegar dip. Pretty good happy hour deals (wine, beer & 3 select cocktails) - though I think the HH is until 7 now instead of 8. We usually sit at the bar and the service isn't amazing but the food is just too good to let that get in the way. The outdoor area is a nice touch when the weather is nice. It gets pretty loud so can be hard with groups.",Jeepney
550,"Came here for dinner and it was just okay.Enjoyed the apps the most (sticky rice and artichoke hummus). Also loved the popover bread.The entrees took a long time to come out and we were told it was because they needed to serve a table with kids before us. However, the restaurant was only about a quarter full, so this was weird.Got the short rib pasta, which we needed to send back to be reheated, and the margherita pizza - didn't love the pesto on it and it's not fresh mozz. Both were mediocre.",We went for breakfast / brunch because we saw the reviews. We walked in and there was 1 table occupied. We sat down (party of 4) The had a pre fix menu for $25 Which included juice and coffee. The coffees were cold and the juice took 15-20 minutes to arrive. It was slow service and the party of 2 who arrived 20 minutes after got their food before. As far as food...The avocado toast was good but I would not come back because of the slow service.,"Went for a weekend brunch and there was no wait, probably because this place is tucked away inside a hotel so it is lower profile. Most of the tables were empty. The menu is relatively limited in choices compared to most brunch places, but it was some of the staples. The food was decent. Service was good.","This is one of my go to spots for happy hour after work. It's in a small hotel, but I love the cozy & classy vibes from this bar. Happy hour is at the bar and in the lounge, and my favorite spot to sit is on the couch in front of the fireplace (actually pretty warm!). Beer is $5 and select wines are $7 (inc. prosecco). If you're hungry, pizzas are 1/2 off and they do $1 oysters too. I haven't seen it get too busy either, so it's a great spot to catch up over drinks with a friend or two. Service is also great -- even though we were in the lounge, our server checked in on us regularly to clear our glasses/ask if we needed anything else!","Pleasantly surprised!!!If you are in the mood for simple brunch while catching up with friends without being interrupted by noise, I'd recommend this place.The good: simple menu, great coffee, not too strong with salt, low noise level, spacious, and great service!!The bad: I'm a big breakfast/brunch eater.. so I think the portion was little on the smaller side. I had the market omelet and that was so good. Although online reservation site said the time wasn't available, I was able to reserve a table with the time by calling in.I'd go back. I'd recommend. Did I say their service was good?","Dining environment was very nice and quiet. We were there weekday morning, and it's not busy at all, but everything took a pretty long time.     I was disappoint for the food. The toast was burned , and the sausage was over cooked. The rest of drink and food was okay.Hope it only happen today. Because I really enjoy the dining space!",Society Cafe
551,CASH ONLY. Booooooo. Ask yourself...why?  We know the answer. And I got this from a sign. No not God. An actual sign cuz there wasn't anyone to greet me when I walked in. To be fair I didn't have the food. I just walked out. They got an extra star. But I'll go back and try again when I have cash.  That's like never soStay Hungry,"Shio Black tonkotsu was good. It was rich and had a bit of umami. I couldnt say the same about the spicy tonkotsu or the miso. The egg was inconsistent between our bowls of ramen. One was deep orange while another was more of a neon yellow. Char siu don was good. The rice was fluffy and the pork was tender and flavorful.I wish i could give this place a higher score, but this place is just filthy.  There is a thick layer of grim on the floor and edges of walls.  The bathroom has a thick layer of grim (and musty) and looks like it hasnt been cleaned in its entirety in YEARS.  The old sushi bar also looks dirty and rusty.",Food is delicious but you have to write down your name on the waiting list first cause it is a tiny place in Greenwich Village - Manhattan,"Good afternoon everyone!I'm back once again with another ramen reviewwww!If my enthusiasm scares you, I'm sorry!I just love ramen so much!On to the review.I ordered the Shio Black Tonkotsu Ramen. It had your traditional toppings of kikurage mushrooms and scallions (haven't had a ramen with scallions in awhile) and my favorite, EGG! Before I forget, the ramen I had also had black garlic oil hence the name of the dish which it was quite interesting. The flavorful broth complemented the thin noodles, the denseness of it was just right. The firmness of the noodles were juuuuuust right for the dish. I love how fresh the scallions were as it went down with the broth quite well. I gotta say, the black garlic oil was a nice touch to the overall taste. The black garlic oil gave the classic Tonkotsu ramen dish an additional layer of flavor on top of the initial flavor, it has a subtle punch to it. I almost forgot, I also ordered a mini pork donbori.  It was delicious but lacked the traditional flavor of Japan. Then again, to be fair...this is NY, not Japan. All in all, this is a solid ramen joint and I highly recommend it to everyone!","Location: right at west village around NYU campus. Ramen-ya is very hard to find where it is small and the front door is shielded by all those big signs blocking your visions.  And the room is crowded where lots of people used to be in line to dine in. We were there around 6 pm but not lots of people there on Friday which is very lucky. Food: got their miso ramen and spicy miso ramen.  Nothing special here - soup base is okay but the noodle is very chewy. I like it. Service: not bad. They treated us with professions and because there are fewer people so we can be treated nicely. Overall: 3.5 ramen store where if you are in the area, you can visit.","My boyfriend and I LOVED this spot but the quality and taste has changed. Their broth isnt as flavorful and the amount of pork they give has decreased. Weve gone several time to hopefully change our minds because we raved about this place so much, but I dont think I'll be going anymore. I wouldnt recommend their dumplings either, they were bland and soggy. The one thing I would recommend is the pork rice bowl, it has been a favorite of mine and still is. The service is always amazing as well.",Ramen-Ya
552,"Unfortunately, I will never again eat here. The service we received last night was atrocious. We arrived as a walk-in (no reservation) before the dinner rush, there were three of us, and were immediately seated at a table. As soon as we sat, the hostess came back over to us and explained that the couple who had just walked in were a table of four, she asked us to move to the communal table. Generally, I would be put off by this, but we were happy to accommodate, though it was kind of tactless.However, when we sat at the communal table, over the next 15 min we were ignored by everyone in the restaurant. The couple who was given our original table received water, they made a wine selection, received bread AND their wine... AND ordered and received an appetizer before anyone even acknowledged our presence (and I want to note the second half of their party didn't arrive for another 20 minutes). I was literally making note of all of this after I became more and more upset. During this period, they were setting the communal table for a big group. While we were sitting and waiting, a server dropped bottles of water for the expected group at the table (none of which had shown up at this point) my husband stood up and grabbed a bottle of water that was set out on the table, this because in the 15 min wait, none had bothered to bring us water. When the waiter noticed my husband doing this, he glared annoyingly at us and aggressively replaced the bottle of water. I was absolutely shocked. We were about to walk out when a server finally came over at about 18 min of waiting, and took our drink orders. It was at this time the large group started to arrive. The restaurant immediately became so crowded that the servers had to inch their way behind me to work and they were constantly hitting my arms and back. We received our drinks as my husband tried to tell the server that we were ready to order, they had rushed off again, and waited for another 7 min... before they came back around. Still no bread, and the bottle of water we had acquired on our own was long gone.At this point we were so upset, we decided to leave. My husband talked to the waiter about all this, and asked for the check... not one apology, nothing. Even the hostess ignored us and our obvious dissatisfaction with the way we were treated. Listen, their food may be good but the service is horrendous, there are so many gems in this neighborhood that treat their customers like family. It's a shame this place misses the boat. Final warning: avoid Rucola it's just not a cool place.",Third rate brunch and horrible service. Yes sure celebrities go here but for real the food is horrible. I'm a bad cook and i can even make a better brunch meal than the guys at rucola. The bacon here is like the microwaveable kind and the food is so bad and bland. I would never come back here ever again.,"Waited over 90mins and I'm not a fan of small restaurants since they just jam pack you in there. We ordered a few things to split between 3 peopleThe appetizers came out quickly, but the mains took a while.Beef Tartare - no flavors, it helped a little when we added saltMussels - deliciousMain: Casarecce - this was decent & Short Rib - this was ok, meat was tender","We live around the corner from here, but always seem to turn up right between lunch and dinner... as someone who works in the service industry, that is incredibly infuriating, but everyone here is kind, quick, and takes care of us.A million thanks to the afternoon bar and waitstaff who deals with our drunk asses.","Rucola is the definition of a perfect date spot. Charming, intimate, and perfectly placed on a quiet tree lined street in Brooklyn, whether you go with a small group of friends or a Hinge date you won't be disappointed. Although they don't take reservations for parties smaller than 5, we called ahead on a Friday night and were seated right away! Our group sat at the community table, which often can be hit or miss in terms of service, but our server did not disappoint bringing our courses quickly and with a smile. The cocktails are strong but delicious and pair well with their homemade focaccia bread. As far as starters go, the charcuterie board is great to split with a group for its size and variety. 5 stars aren't given easily, but Rucola's homemade casarecce pasta, perfectly seasoned scallops, and fresh panzanella salad sealed the deal.","This place is a hit. Forget that it's a Wednesday night at 7:30pm with heat and flood flash warning, this charming small candle lit place is packed.We learned the hard way that they only take reservations for parties of 5 or more BUT...we also learned you can call over the phone to put smaller parties down on a waitlist.Luckily my friend and I were fortunate enough to grab 2 stools at the bar and had a very pleasant dining experience.The Northern Italian Menu is very attractive, reasonably priced and as we pondered what to get, everything around us being served looked impressive.On to the food...We started by sharing the Fried Calamari Appetizer ($13) which was a large portion and the actual calamari were ginormous. Serve with a nice bowl of delicious tomato sauce to soak it all up.For entrees we both got the homemade pasta:Garganelli: Cherry tomatoes, roasted peppers, summer squash ($18)Casarecce: English peas, parmigiano, housemade bacon, eggs ($19)Taking our leftovers to go there was no way we had any room left for dessert but maybe next time :)",Rucola
553,"Ordered take out with my co worker, I had really high expectations for this place because of the location and how busy it was.  The food was mediocre, and for the price tag it shouldn't be that (regardless of their ""lunch special"". ) There was zero quality in their dry pepper chicken combo.  The chicken was all breading and loaded with hot peppers that weren't even edible.  The presentation was nice and appealing to the eye, but for what I pay, I want food - not cheap ingredients and breading.Later that night my co worker and I both got sick.  Maybe an odd coincidence, maybe not.  I won't return to find out.",After all the running around I searched high and low to find somewhere to eat and charge up my phone. Sigh... I wish I was able to look under yelp 1st before ordering. This place looks cute but the food didn't do it for us. My son wasnt happy at all and he would eat just about anything I tell ya.His spicy beef soup was not good. His words not mine. The beef was too chewy he had to spit each one out after chewing forever. On top of that he said it was too salty. I had the cris,"+ Takes reservations+ Food was a bit salty but tasty and spicy. We ordered: dumplings in chili oil, ginger sour string beans, dan dan noodles","I'm always here.Food is consistent on flavor and cook. I've had dishes that came a little too oily or salty but I eat it anyway lol. My favorite is the extra spicy dry work tofu, and my husband loves their garlic chicken.Prices are average and the staff are always pleasant. Bathrooms are clean and if you have children, they easily accommodate them sealed off beverage cups, practice chop sticks and milder simpler dishes like noodles etc for them.","I come to this place way more often than I should. My partner and I always get the dry pot style and cumin style tofu at max spiciness (10). We've tried their other entrees but they are far worse in quality so we never stray from these two anymore. Last time we thought we'd be adventurous, we got Kung Pao Style tofu (too sweet and not flavorful enough) and Crispy Rice Style tofu (also too bland and the the crispy rice was so stale already - even the parts that hadn't touched the sauce) and we thought, NEVER AGAIN. Thankfully, the waiter had offered to switch us out for a different dish if we really didn't like our new choices so we took up his offer up to switch out the Crispy Rice. That was very generous. If we're feeling extra hungry, we'll get either the Dan Dan Noodles, Spicy Mung Bean Noodle, or Cold Noodle with Chili Oil. They are all delicious. But whatever you do, DO NOT get the Cold Noodle with Chili Oil at Spice Level 10. You will be crying in the restaurant and again in your bathroom the next day.","Always great service, food gets fast to your table!Even faster than the drinks!Súper affordable , bartender is super nice ( he even gave us recommendations for our honeymoon in Hawaii ).Dan Dan noodles are a must!",Han Dynasty
554,Get the fried corn appetizer and pork belly! Decided to be adventurous and try the raspberry soju but did not enjoy the after taste.,"Food 4Service 4Vibe 3.5Lunch Jun 23, 2019Dinner July 27,28, 2019","Used to be one of my fave restaurants. Loved their seafood noodle dish, which is no longer on the menu. You get a free rice cake appetizer and can order an unlimited amount. (Soooo delicious). But the menu isnt good as I remember. The size of their soja has reduced by 75%. You used to be able to get a large pitcher for $15 and now you get a mini size bottle for the same price. I'd possibly return for the food but wouldn't get any alcohol.","This place is great! Opens at 5:30 pm and arrived right before opening, with around 4-5 other parties trailing behind us. Once we arrived my friend and I ordered a Pork Bone On the Bone Stew/Hot Pot ($23.95) and seafood pancake ($15.95). We ordered a separate side of ramen noodles to dump in the Hot Pot, although some people order rice instead (forgot the added price, if any). They served us an appetizer of spicy rice cakes which were deliciously chewy and slightly sweet, followed by the seafood pancake which was the size of my face. There were averagely sized chunks of octopus and shrimp- tasted like something you'd get on Northern blvd for slightly cheaper. As for the hotpot, the meat literally falls off the bone and is sooo tender and juicy. There is a heaping portion of potatos, and combined with the side of noodles it was altogether a great dish.The service was great, and we didn't feel rushed at all once the place started getting uber crowded around 6:30 ish. The food comes out at a good pace, and we nearly finished the pancake once the hot pot arrived. The bathroom is pretty clean, and there's a mirror to check yourself out (lol- good for dates). The ambiance is chill- the cute decorations such as the floor plan of the restaurant painted on the wall as well as a floating rainbow-lit cloud installation constitute small quirks that make the place more interesting. Also, it's a little loud but you only have to slightly raise your voice once the dinner rush hits- would say that it's still good for catching up with friends or dates!","The first restaurant opened by the Hand Hospitality Company. If you're not familiar with them, they open a slew of Japanese and Korean restaurants, including Izakaya Mew, Her Name is Han, and NoNoNo to name a few. If you've been to any of the restaurants I just named and you're a fan, then you'll definitely love to dine here.This place does not accept reservations and does not do Yelp waitlist (hopefully that'll change). The few times I've walked by, they are packed with a 75 minute wait (appears worse on the weekends). I came here at store opening hours (5:30pm) so that would be the best way to beat the waitlist.The first thing they brought out was complementary rice cakes in some sort of sauce which was not bad. The apps came out which included the Seafood Pancake and Softshell Crab. Both of them I really liked. We also got the Kimchi Seafood Hotpot to be split amongst the three of us. This is more than enough and probably could do without one of the appetizers as the hotpot is huge.The food overall was really good. It is a little on the pricey side, but people don't seem to mind it given how busy they get from the previous times I wanted to try the place out. Service is pretty standard. Would love to try out other items on the menu for the next visit.","Although I really liked the huge menu of Take31, filled with tons of variety in modern Korean dishes, the food and its flavors come up a bit mediocre. The menu is so big and each dish looks really good visually, but some dishes were too bland that I wish they'd focus more on quality over quantity.We ordered the braised pork belly, garlic spicy crispy chicken, and the budae jjigae hot pot. The pork belly was pricy, bland and basically flavorless in my opinion. The budae jjigae also struggled with having a good flavor. It felt like someone just threw in a bunch of ingredients without focusing on the flavor on the overall stew. The spicy crispy chicken was actually pretty good, the only highlight of my meal. Overall, I have a hard time recommending Take31. It's a great spot for a night out if you want to try more modernized Korean dishes. The vibe and ambiance of the restaurant is really vibrant, loud, and exciting. But with this modernization, they lose sight on what's important which is the overall flavors of the dish. If you're looking for a meal where you want to focus more on your food and its flavors, this is not a good choice.",Take31
555,I've got two words for ya...Clobster Roll!,"Havent been in some time but ummm when the young lady gave me my lobster roll it looked like it was thrown on the bread. She said ""it looks a mess but its good"". Ok over looked that cuz ive been before and had no complaints. I opted to stay and eat. Get to the end of the roll and its cold. Like if it was taking from the fridge/freezer and not throughly cooked . I hope this isnt going to be one of those business that gave good service when they 1st opened but then turns to shit once they get a name for them selves. Im so annoyed because ive had a hankering for a lobster roll for a minute and came out my way here. In a rain storm ‍‍. Was gonna get another drink & banana pudding since its #winedownwednesday but im Throughly disappointed. Thats time and $30 wasted","Super over-priced for the portion size. I got the crab roll and it had about the same amount of crab as a California roll(a little more). $16 (after she added garlic butter on her own for $1) Crab Mac was $12 with a tablespoon of crab in it, so sad. Overall it was a let down of an experience. Automatically generated a 15% tip with no service required.","This is hands down in my top 5 fave foods this summer! Service was fast and friendlyFood was extremely deliciousDining area is really comfortable w beach-like vibesThe crab grilled cheese is a solid 10/10. I would drive 30 miles just to come back for it again. It's flavorful, with a crispy exterior but still soft and juicy on the inside. It has the perfect crab to cheese ratio so there's a great cheese pull. Surprisingly not overly greasy. Unbelievably delicious. Perfect thing to share between 2 people. The crab rolls are a 9/10 because it's a little smaller than we expected but mainly because we ate the grilled cheese first and that is just unbeatable. The crab rolls are so fresh, served on a Martin's potato roll. The crab tacos just ain't it. 2/10 Not worth the money. Sauce and portion of crab wasn't hitting the spot. Save your tummy space for other things on the menu Lemonade (not in picture) had a strong basil taste to it. Wasn't our thing but if you're into that, definitely get it. It's homemade! My girl and I came here 10 min after they opened and they already had served multiple people + sent out orders for delivery. This place is awesome!","Came here on a rainy day for a small dinner. I really loved their sandwiches. Me and a friend split a combo that they have every Thursday. For $20 you get three items; we got tomato bisque soup that was really great for the rainy day weather, crab roll, and a crabcake slider. The two rolls were super tasteful. In addition to this we also got a 1/2 bound bag of spicy shrimp. The shrimp was tasteful, however it wasn't the best boil and shrimp wasn't the freshest. I underestimated this place, the vibe was super chill and the server was very helpful in helping us choose which to try and even gave us two different sauces for the crab roll. Anyway, 7/10 would come back here for the rolls!","The food is great, but that place is small. That's the only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star. The prices are moderate but there are a few items I personally think are overpriced. The crab legs, broccoli, corn, peach cobbler, banana pudding, lobster roll, and crabby combo tacos were all great!!  I will definitely be going back!",The Crabby Shack
556,Came here again and gotta say that the hot pot and the seafood pancakes were $$$$. We ended up getting the Soju cocktails which while a little on the expensive side are on par of Pocha's.,"Food was really bad and the service was even worse. I don't understand why they ignore to take orders after they seat you. We ordered the kimchi pancake and fried chicken gizzard paired with hwayo and beers. The pancake was really the worst thing I've even eaten in ktown. The fried gizzards were super hard and way overly cooked. The service, again really slow and spotty from the beginning till the end of my dining experience.","ZERO STARS! They sell spoiled oysters! My girlfriend ened up in HOSPITAL, I myself had a terrible food poisoning, was vomiting and still suffer from diarrhea almost a week later!So, it was the place I had dinner with my girlfriend on thursday night, it was also only meal we had together for few days, we dont live together. One of the dishes was oysters with bacon, it tasted kinda funny, but well, I never had it Korean way before. And will never again!On sunday night at 4 am I started sprinting to the bathroom to both vomit and to do number 2. My girlfriend started doing the same at 4.30 am same night and got so weak/ poisoned that she had to go to hospital. Beware of this place!","Upon my second time here, i decided i should come here more often because i actually really like it here. It's not as crowded as other ktown places and i really like the high ceilings and the food is pretty good. Soju & food prices are pretty standard (starts at $15 per bottle).","Yes it gets really loud in here. I have a love hate relationship. The food keeps making me want to come back. They have a really cool menu with a wide variety of dishes that will really hit the spot - especially when eating with soju, beer, and soju bombs. Recommended dishes:-Radish Kimchi Fried Rice w./  Beef Brisket - sooo good. Don't usually order fried rice because you can easily make at home, but this was so tasty, especially with the stir fried cubed radish kimchi.-Spicy Squid& pork stir fry-Spicy Mixed Seafood soup-you can order this towards the end of your meal. Because this will coat your stomach after all the soju you drink and make you feel better so you are prepared to drink more for the next round. I don't even like seafood, but the broth was very good and tasty. Must try.-Fried Chicken-Must get. so crispy and juicy. Fried to perfection. Perfect with your beer. They rip apart the whole chicken in front of you. And it comes out super hot.-Beef Intestine w/ Spicy sauceIts great to come with groups of 3-5, but it gets so loud in here! It's pretty pricey-compared to other ktown bars. So when coming to places like this you have to know the right things to order!! They don't have pitchers..and they only have Kirin on draft.Also they only except cash and amex.Located on the 2nd floor (under third fl. cafe). You don't have to wait for the tight elevator-you can just take the stairs on the left. I suggest making a reservation ahead of time as the waiting area does get crowded.","TLDR: Nestled away underneath Third Floor at the corner of 32nd and Fifth. Modern take on classic Korean dishes. You'll have a good meal here but you will wait during prime time. Also, only AMEX/cash accepted.So I guess I tried this place kind of late. It's a very chic looking place, almost feels like more of a place to go for a drink as opposed to eat. That's maybe the idea though.The menu is relatively simple, there are several offerings of a lot of Korean dishes but with a modern twist.My favorites though are the Army Stew or Buddae Jigae and the Sam Gyup Sal or Pork Belly.The pork belly is a bit on the thicker side but they serve it with a dipping sauce. I'm fairly certain it's ddoenjjang or fermented bean paste. This is usually served as a condiment at most barbecue restaurants but here - it's boiled out where it doesn't have that thickness. Good stuff.I've had a number of buddae jigaes, it's probably one of my favorites of the Korean stews. It's difficult for me to describe but everything tastes slightly elevated. The meat seems to be cut a bit sharper, the ramen is cooked with the right firmness. Each slurp is filled with that acidic blast of processed meat and tastiness.I have also tried the pancake sampler (awesome) and the seafood crispy rice. I haven't had anything here I didn't like.They only accept AMEX and cash so just be aware of that. There are plenty of banks within walking distance though if you need an ATM.",Soju Haus
557,"Restaurant - 4/5 for a Japanese chain, there's a pretty cool, trendy, modern look to this place. Very quiet and spacious, so it's unlikely you'll have a wait. There's a bar section along with plenty of tables and minimalist decor. Service - 4/5 they're on top of things, but there's not much personality there. That's where the ""no tip"" thing comes into play, and I have no problem with it! They're just there to serve and feed. Edamame - 5/5 always a winner.Chawanmushi - 1/5 I hated this useless goo. It took me so much effort to not spit this out. Avoid. Gyu kushi yakitori - 5/5 beef that's very well marinated. I wish there was more of it!Vegetable yakitori - 3/5 simple assortment of a few types of veggies. Solid app to share, but it's just a couple bites. Sushi sashimi salad - 3/5 I ordered a different bowl, but they brought me this one by accident. I was starving, so I didn't have time to exchange it for the right one. It was light and healthy, but such a small portion that my hunger situation didn't change much afterwards. I've had better, but maybe I had the wrong things. It wasn't a horrible meal, but there are certain improvements to be made. Seems best to go with a group, so you try a bunch of things off the long menu.","After hearing many great stories about this site, I visited this place with such excitement. However, the experience was rather bit disappointing.The service was extremely slow. It took forever for our server to get our orders. I made numerous attempts to make an eye contact with our server, and i'm not sure whether everyone was purposely trying to ignore us, or was actually really busy, but it took over 20 minutes for us to order our foods.The food was also quite disappointing. My donkatsu was extremely salty. My lips were hurting because of how salty the foods were. Chirashi was okay. The steamed egg that we ordered as an appetizer was the only thing that had a positive impact on our experience. I was genuinely excited to visit this place, but my overall experience at this establishment was bit depressing, and I'm not sure whether I'll visit this place again.","Friendly staffs and mediocre food. If you find the prices are a bit high that's because the tips are factored in, I do like the no tips policy. But not impressed by the food.",I had a dinner here with family and friends.All the dishes are in set and are really nice. Highly recommend the sukiyaki and the salmon pot. All dishes are seasoned beautifully and plated delicately. It's hard to imagine such high quality food can be served in such a huge amount in such a short time.The dining atmosphere is cozy and relaxing. All the staffs are really nice and welcoming.I'd definitely be back for any dish in this restaurant. Highly recommended for dinners with friends and family. Really nice place to enjoy the food and chat.,"One of my fav Japanese spots. Great service, good quality food and nice ambient. Ootoya could also customize according to your taste: I opt for less salty for their food since they tend to put a lot of sauce on their dishes. A perfect place for a quick Japanese bite and I'll come back again.","I've never at least 200time since they open in 18street. It was great at beginning and then price increases. It was ok. Still good for what it was. And few months ago they increased prices again but quality(taste )of food is decreased significantly. ..,Many of my friends don't go there anymore. I hope they should do something.",Ootoya Greenwich Village
558,"Terrible, terrible, terrible service. No napkins, no utensils, water from the sink & flat beer.",Unnecessarily over priced food here. Soggy fries and the music is so loud at noon you can barely hold a conversation with your office mates. Food here is so-so although their whitefish Reuben is quite good. This place is nothing special. Super Divey.,"Is there an option for negative stars?? It takes a lot to give a bad review but this place was the worst. Our server took our orders. And over 30 minutes later we had no food, no checks for refills, not even our appetizers which was an easy plate of beignets. Than I see our server grab a plate from the window. Sit himself down in the back to eat breakfast and watch a baseball game. I ask the host to get us our checks for coffee. We are the only table in the restaurant by the way. One had just left and another was coming in. And one person at the bar came after us. Was already served appetizer, drink and meal. When I asked for the tab for the coffee was still ignored. At this point Im annoyed the bartender said ""So you're not going to pay for all this food? Its already made."" It took over 40 minutes them ignoring my request for the tab than he made a stink when I said ""If anything coffee should be on the house w that service, our food isn't here, and our servers back there eating watching tv."" And the bartender said ""yeah pay for your coffee. Get out and don't come back"". At that point I told him learn how to run a business paid for our coffees and got out. How this has 4 stars I wanna know bc its trash. Your service is trash. Your work ethic trash.","Important PSA: Happy hour (aka HH) hours are now until 6 PM on weekdays!!! I think it starts at 3pm but I'm not 100% on the start time.Hurricane nachos are still my all te favorite from this spot. And frozen margartias are $8 during HH and $12 otherwise, with flavors as $2 extra.General pricing is pretty dang great for this place's location and its popularity.Food has NEVER disappointed me (but I almost always just order hurricane nachos).FYI - ask them about their $3 mystery shots! =D","ordered pull pork taco (2 pieces) , about 9 bucks (+tax +tips).juicy and flavorful pull pork, bbq sauce on the sweet side.simple sour cream n fresh slices lettuce on top.soft tortilla.**cute tiny mermaid decor on the soda.** a good lunch place for small group n large group.food served about 20-30mins after order is placed.","This place is a beauty. Other than serving incredible wings and shockingly cheap beer, it captures a NOLA vibe in the heart of Seaport. In other words, everyone is your friend, conversation is easy, and dare I say you could make a friend here, or bring a few if you already have them. I write this because I'm on a crowded Amtrak train back home and I wish I was enjoying some nachos and tequila instead...",Cowgirl Seahorse
559,"Alright, I'm writing this review because I walked into this place with my boyfriend blindly without checking Yelp beforehand and we didn't know what we were getting ourselves into. So here's what you should know:1. There's no physical, visual food menu. Instead, a (likely very bored) server comes around and asks if you ""want to talk food"" and then scribbles the menu items on the paper that covers the table. She verbally mentions a few of the ingredients in each dish, including the fact that they charge extra for tomato on a burger. The writing is illegible and it makes no sense why the restaurant doesn't just print out menus each day. They're not saving any trees (or anyone's time, either) with this table-paper-menu-writing idiocy.2. The service is a joke. Our waitress sounded super bored and bitchy the whole time--and listen, I've worked in service so I know how it can be sometimes, but I felt as if *I* would be doing *her* a disservice by asking her to repeat the menu. She also forgot to bring us a beer we ordered, during which time we saw her bringing drinks to other people's' tables, and by the time we asked for the check, she said: ""Did you ever get that beer or just chug it really fast?"" Uh, no, there's no beer on the table so clearly we didn't get it. After we saidno (politely and respectfully, without the attitude i'm showing here), we thought she'd at least offer one on the house, but nope. 3. There's no sign for the bathroom; it's tucked away near the kitchen area, beyond a swinging door, and the bathroom the first door of three. You might accidentally walk into a stairwell if you don't know exactly where the bathroom was ahead of time (our waitress just said it's ""over there""), and how any regular customer would know that is beyond me. Overall, this place was a total waste of our time and money. We were expecting some level of dumb bougie Williamsburg hipster bs considering where we were, but not quite like this. Luckily, you're smart and looked this place up on Yelp ahead of time unlike my boyfriend and I, so you should pat yourself on the back! And then don't go here.","Expensive for what you get, small menu, not a ton of vegetarian options. Didn't like that the waitress sits down and writes the menu on the table, it's incredibly inefficient",Terrible experience overpriced mediocre food. Went with boyfriend. As soon as we sat down the waitress told us about how much she hated writing down the menu on the table and how humiliating she thinks it is (we did not ask) ordered a cesar and the bass. The fish came ONE HOUR AFTER we ordered!!! The people next to us were complaining about their plate having too much paprika to the point they couldn't eat it. No one apologized.,"This is one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The restaurant is small, it's an old train car they've converted into the restaurant and it's super cute with no frills. We had a 630 reservstion on a Wednesday and the restaurant was about half full.We were recommended to try something called the ""orange wine"". It's like a white rose, it's made with the peels mixed in with the grapes and it was delicious. I highly recommend it.Diner has no menus. Your waiter comes over and explains that nights specials and writes everything down on the parchment paper on your table. Most appetizers range $16-20 and the entrees were around $25-35 with the burger which is always on the menu for $23.We split the broccoli tempura to start which was served with greens and feta ($17) and was so yummy. For mains I got the duck with ratatouille ($30) and my friend got the burger ($23). My duck was good but I'm just gonna say it, that burger was the best I've ever had. I extremely regret not getting it myself and I'll definitely be going back to get it","Fantastic food! Get the buttermilk chicken sandwich if it's available!Service and ambience are good, too. I don't recommend the appetizers (priced too high), but the entrees are great.","Good food. Menu changes daily but we had a buttermilk fried chicken sandwich that was wonderful. Sausage with mustard cream fraiche was fabulous. Everything was great except the toast. Airy, hokey bread had too many air holes but taste was great. Service was great. The waitress with the blonde dreadlocks was funny, attentive and got it right. Decor was authentic complete with old tiles and curved ceilings. Try it, really good",Diner
560,"Loved their Yam Fries but second try was not as good as what I remember anymore, quite disappointed. Pumpkin Cake was fine.",Three stars only for the lousy service you get. I've heard their service is really bad before we went but still got really disappointed. Extremely slow for not so busy time and got my order wrong. The upside is the noodle is actually decent. So order take out!,"4 stars if the menu fits your expectations.A charming small place.  Very pleasant ambience. Very attentive and helpful service. Modest prices. Large portions.Ah, but this is a restaurant and food counts. Be warned, this is not a typical Chinese restaurant.My problem with the menu was that I didn't know what to expect. As far as I can figure out all of the main dishes are really noodles in a soup. Hence, for me the choices were very limited. Even the pork ""bun"" was not what I expected. It was soup surrounded by dough.When I was there the clientele were all Asian. Evidently they know what they are ordering. The dumplings were very good.","Meet a humble gem. Meet noodles has Taiwanese style cafe food, noodle soups, teas and drinks. They are affordable, have an impeccable service and interior with a taste to match. OrderedBasil fried chicken - very good must get. A good amount of saltiness. Only missing the tooth pics :)Fruit tea - fairly sweet and fruity. Would get againSeafood soup - good amounts of noodle, mussels, shrimp, fish, and squid in a light and tasty broth. Would get againBeef noodle soup - the broth is a bit on the light side, but still goodShrimp dumpling - good taste a bit over steamed. Overall good","Maybe 3.5 star for food. +0.5 for the very friendly services. I don't think there's any East Village noodle soup WOW me, this place is the same, but considering the price it's very reasonable. Chong Ching one - very flavorful with strong taste, pretty liking. Tomato Beef Noodle - soup was too bland or water down. Tomato still remain I'm chunks in the soup, should have stewed way longer to deepen the flavor. Vegetables Noodle Soup was not bad. Fried Chicken Basil was pretty good but slightly dry, ViVi was probably better. Fried Yam (fries) was the winner! Perfectly cooked in texture and balanced proportion of the yam and batter. Don't forget to check in on Yelp to get a free appetizer!",I tried the spicy and sour yam noodle. It is the best noodle soup I ever had in nyc.The portion is huge so I asked for two small bowl or take the noodle and soup home.Word the bowl bottom has a poem. I bet many people won't see it unless they drink all the soup .,Meet Noodles
561,"I came into the establishment for a birthday for a friend. We got a table for about 15 of us. Our waiter was Kayla. My two friends asked her to take their order, but she was asking to take the order for the entire table on one card. The table was not ok with this due to some people leaving earlier etc. She walked away from the table when we didn't abide to charging on one card and ignored us the rest of the night. We had to go to the bar to order our food and drinks because she stopped approaching our table. So much so to the point that when we raised our hand to call her over she literally made eye contact with us and turned her head. Train your staff to have some Fukin manners. If we couldn't place our order on one card the least she could've done was let us know and give us an alternative solution. She's pathetic.",Omg the bartender right nowSuch a b%^chCatering to one friend at the barDoesn't know what beers are whatGave me the wrong one and didn't offer me the correctSince when is tasting a beer against the rules/law?Whatever!!!Done By the way-blond with glasses,"-First Impression- Outdoor seating is totally instagrammable-Food- no complaints! Had the hot chicken sandwich (not sure if it's still on the menu), which wasn't that spicy, but that's just my humble opinion-Service- a bit scarce, but not bad-Price- very reasonable-Did Not Like- the tables inside are bench style and very close to each other. It was a bit difficult and awkward to get in and out of my seat without bumping into someone from the next table-Noteworthy- Grilled cheese donut!-Recommended?- Will return specifically for the grilled cheese donut and truffle fries","Clinton Hall is a great spot to grab a drink in FiDi, be it with co-workers or just friends/family.A majority of the seating is outdoors, so it could be very weather-dependent, but there is also construction currently going on so the scaffolding provides a nice ""shelter"".There is ample seating at community-style tables, the lighting is perfect, and they have several different games to occupy your time (including Bags, giant Connect-Four, big Jenga, and a foosball table).They have a solid list of craft and German beers and a small list of cocktails - all of which were tasty and refreshing. They also serve food but we didn't have any.On top of that, our waiter was super cool and chill. He checked up on us occasionally and all was good.You shouldn't be disappointed with a visit to Clinton Hall, no matter the occasion. Stop over and check it out.","This is a great place for groups, they have a lot of place outside with a variety of table games and not only to choose from. I've been here two times. The burgers are not epic but they have some unique variations that just interesting to try but flavor-wise just ok this time . And the bun become a cheaper version of what they used to have. This place has a nice list of draft beer, I think everyone will find something for yourself. This time around we tried their donate, which was presented with syringes with which you can insert the caramel, or chocolate, or raspberry filling. I loved it, so smart and tasty! The downside of this place is service, we were waiting so much time first to order then to re-order beer, and then to remains them about our donets. They could make more money if they work faster and more efficient","I really really loved this place ! Very cute and cost place with a lot of table games and some other games . Me and my husband got burgers and both were very good quality meat . I will definitely come back , because I need to try that cheesy bagel  and those fantastically huge deserts....",Clinton Hall
562,"Not a super memorable bar except for the rude AF servers. Went with a party of 6 and had mandatory gratuity as a part of our bill (at 18%, so it wasn't a lowball), so I didn't tip on top of that. As we were leaving, two of my group were stopped by two servers demanding that we tip.Interior was pretty in the clubby kinda way. Music was trendy and super loud on a Saturday night. If you want a place to sit with friends and have a conversation, it's not the place for you. Cocktails were really pretty, but tasted really syrupy, which is imo about what you'd expect from ktown bars. They also had really tasty fries, but we didn't order much else food.",I could write a long review about how the this is a typical Ktown bar where way too many people are screaming and far too many douchebag finance bros go to act as though they're cultured but I'll keep it short and sweet. This place sucks. Like truly sucks. They refused to add kimchi to our pineapple fried rice like wtf kind of anti-korean bullshit is that. But their soy garlic wings are great and I'd love to eat 30 of those while drinking beer and watching a game. I'm sorry I'm still not over the kimchi debacle. This place is trash.P.S. stay the fuck away from the vegetable dumpling yaki. I had one bite and almost vomited. That shit was so gross I genuinely want to contact the Department of Health and have this place shut down solely for that bite.,"Interesting place. Came here on a Sunday night so not the liveliest of times, but the drink items are typical for New York. Overpriced. Servers were distant and paid little to no attention to us. Club music playing constantly at a deafening level, lots of soju options, and food and drink menus. A bottle of soju was $17, most shots were $8-$10 dollars, mixed drinks ranged anywhere from $12-18 and bottles of everything were all over $100.","Hidden gem in K-town, and ideal spot for an after-work drink in Penn Station vicinity. The two times I've come here, it was not too crowded so we were able to get seated pretty easily.Located on 3rd floor (via elevator), the place opens up to a large space with bar and tables in front near windows and in back with booths. I organized a large 12 person group here on a Sat evening and it worked out perfectly. Our table was ready when I arrived and we were seated immediately even though our entire party hadn't arrived yet. Happy hour menu was available even on a Saturday and it included beer, wine, and well drinks, which we took advantage of. I appreciated that the prices of all drinks including well drinks were included on the menu - there were no surprises. Wait staff was very attentive, even as it got busier. Food was okay - chicken fingers were a bit too crispy for me but we devoured them. Note that check for large group includes 18% gratuity. Icing on the cake: not only was our karaoke spot located just next door, but we also got a 10% discount by showing them our receipt.","Wowowow, came here for the first time last night and absolutely loved this place! So nice that they have Yelp Res, easily made a reservation for 10 people on a Friday night super last minute. We were seated in the back room immediately even though only 4 of us arrived about 30 minutes before our reservation. Back room was cute, semi-enclosed with two long tables that seat about 10, would be great for private events I'm sure. They have an extended menu of Korean bar snacks, love that happy hour includes not just drinks but food as well!! We started off with some lychee and yogurt soju, if you haven't tried it before, yogurt soju is a must even though it may sound a little weird. Beer pitchers are just over $20 for HH, which goes until 8pm. The food was amazinggg. Kimchi fries rice was probably my favorite, super well seasoned and loved the spam and micro greens on top. Seafood ramen was another favorite among the group, they were generous with the seafood- the shrimps were huge and meaty. Crispy wings were crispy and delicious. My boyfriend had the avocado crostini with tuna and yuzu and the citrus was awesome. Had a really great time, wait staff were attendant and fast. Never a line for the bathroom. Awesome happy hour prices. Definitely recommend this place!",Awesome spot for happy hour drinks and food that goes until 8pm (even though the menu says 7pm)The waiters are really great and helpful---kimchi fried rice: hit the spot when we were starving ---fried wings: you can order them flavored but we just asked for them dry. Nice and crispy NOTE: if you save your receipt you'll get 10 percent off at their sister karaoke spot and sister billiards place,The Maze
563,"As a student, ordering takeout is considered a ""treat"" for me and I can't help but feel choosing Bedouin was such a waste of an indulgence.The meats both chicken and lamb were extremely tough. The texture of rubber, and chewing time of gum. Basically inedible and had to toss out.Definitely bypass this place. Tons of good eats a neighbourhood over.",Hidden gem. Cheap. Authentic. Make their own pita and it's the best I have ever had. WillCome again and again.,"I really like their falafel, and their pita is amazing, and they use excellent lettuce & tomatoes in their salad, but, honestly, their leg of lamb & also their chicken & also their baba ghanoush & also their hummus are disappointing. And since their prices have gone up a couple bucks in the past couple of years (AND IT'S CASH ONLY), overall, I really find it both undesirable and inconvenient, sad to say...","I rarely give out 5 stars, but this place absolutely earned it. I've been looking for cheap eats in Brooklyn and so far this place was high on value and quantity!I got the falafel plate which came with a salad and a side. I got the babaganoush for my side, which came with pita. Everything in the salad was super fresh and the pita came right off the grill. I ended up only eating half cause I was so full, but $15 for dinner and lunch the next day is a good good deal. Definitely a winner! Bring a friend and eat outside on their cute little patio!","All cash only. The food was good but less flavorful than expected. - lambjin: okay, looked better than it tasted, was much tangier than expected.- merguez plate: merguez was pretty oily as I suppose all lamb is but I had expected some oil would have dripped off as it was being grilled. Was less flavorful than other merguez's I have had.- chicken plate: chicken was lean but, again, had less spices/herbs than expected.Overall the food was okay but not as flavorful of most other mediterranean food I have had. Would not return.",I would have come here ages ago if I knew they had a serviced back patio! Stumbled upon the backyard as we came in planning to get a quick snack - ended up deciding to sit for lunch. Food is really A+ and very reasonably priced. Service is very fast and staff is very friendly. Plates are big - we got two dishes and had leftovers between two of us. We loved the assorted salad option (you pick 5 of the salads you want) and the chicken plate with pitas. So good and very filling without feeling heavy. Will be coming back soon!,Bedouin Tent
564,Not impressed. First the wait was longer than we were told and the first table was right in front of the toilet. You can actually see the toilet seat and you have people lining up right behind you. After we changed tables it took another 15min until someone took our order and then around 30min for the food to come out. The food is good if you can deal with all of the above.,I had the beef shawarma. It lacked flavor and wasn't that great. I wish they had a side of yogurt or sauce to make it less dry. What I did like was their home made harissa.,"Atmosphere is great, service is good but the food is really bad. it pains me to give a bad review because I love Mediterranean food.Listen, I lived in the Middle East for 5 years and traveled all over including Africa, Greece etc and never in my life  I ate such a bitter and crappy Humus and a horrendous Shawarma like in this place.For appetizers we asked for the flat bread which was ok, the humus Plate (terrible) and a salad which was good. Main entree we got the Shinitzel with mash potatoes and the lamb Shawarma.The mash was tasteless but shinitzel was pretty good. I have no words for their version of  Shawarma. I get that this neighborhood is yuppie and they try to look cool with ""fusion"" like plates. Presentation is important  no doubt but the taste is what really matters and they failed  miserably here. The meat tasted like a washed up stew and smelled weird with an overpowering orange sauce. It was so bad that we were not able to eat much of the plate.I give them props because the place was packed and everyone was buying their awesome decor and ambience but it doesn't work for me...  I rather seat in a hole in the wall with great food.","Miriam is easily one of the top brunch spots in park slope. All the food I have had is great. My favorites are definitely the boreka breakfast and the schnitzel sandwich. The boreka breakfast really has a nice balance of everything you would want in an Israeli breakfast while the schnitzel is cooked to perfection. One thing to note is if it are having an espresso based coffee drink, get it in early- I think they have only one machine so it can take a little while to get your coffee. Also, they don't take brunch reservations so make sure to show up early as you probably will wait 15-30 mins depending on your group size. I would not come here with more than 4 people if possible. I have not come here for dinner yet but wave to try it at some point. All I know is their brunch is definitely worth the visit","We came for brunch and ended up waiting close to an hour. They said it would be 30 min, when we got the text to come back. When we arrived exactly 2 minutes after getting the text, they didn't have a table for us. We said we would wait longer if we could get a table outside, which the waitress promised, but we ended up being crammed into a corner spot inside. The food was fresh and flavorful. Overall: 4/5. Good food, mediocre service.","Miriam is my favorite brunch spot in Park Slope. I am sure others agree too as it is always packed, and wait to be seated. But, once you are seated service is great and food is delicious.I ordered Blueberry Pancakes, a side of Home Fries and freshly squeezed Orange Juice. Our table had also other orders such as Red Shakshuka, and 2 Eggs. Everything we ordered was very delicious and absolutely worth the wait. Food was 10/10. It is a little noisy but not too crazy. Service was great.",Miriam
565,"Screw these racists. I'm Indian and my girlfriend is Chinese. Tonight we made the mistake of stopping by this mediocre noodle slop shop. We ordered two very basic dishes that took almost 60 minutes to be served. During that time we watched the other tables around us that arrived after be served first, while none of the waiters would make eye contact with us. Our own waiter gossiped with the tables around us while making snide comments in our direction. At the end of our meal, coming out of the bathroom, a waiter walked full force into me, shoving me into a table of other patrons, yelling at me in Chinese. When I demanded an apology, the staff ordered me to leave. I'll never come back to this trash pile, I've enjoyed better food at PF Changs.","Meh. I had high hopes because my dad recommended it. I suppose the price is crazy unreal, at $5 for a bowl of congee. The place looks like it's been here forever. I prob should have gotten something off the BBQ racks, which looked good. Non-Chinese beware this place would be intimidating as there was exactly one non-Chinese in the whole place. The duck egg rolls were really strange. They made that s**t up with their leftover duck. The Sampan congee was underwhelming, with barely any meat in it, and completely tasteless. I had to drown it in salt and white pepper at the table. It was a far cry from what you'd get in HK. And we got the fried breadsticks to go with congee, and they were stale, old, and tough. That is just unacceptable in a shop that is supposed to be a Noodle/Congee specialty shop. All in all this is not a foodie or any special stop, just another one of a 1000 run-of-the-mill hole in the wall watering holes in Chinatown. I guess their claim to fame is the 20 year old menu with low prices, and right on the Bowery.","Workers were rude and even placed a wrong order on my table. My fiancé got his two meat combination rice before I did. Five minutes after that, an employee placed a beef stew rice dish on my table and when I waved him over, he gave me an attitude and asked rudely in Chinese what did I order. I told him the Wonton Noodles. A few minutes later, my noodle soup finally came. Wonton noodles shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to make, so first things first, they got my dish wrong. Second, it took forever to make. The soup didn't have much flavor and the noodles were overcooked. They were more on the mushy side and not on the spongy side, which is how I normally like it. If you're looking for a better wonton noodle soup head over to Wonton Garden on Mott Street. Less wait time. Noodles, they give a large amount and their wontons are much bigger with more flavor.","Favorite spot in Chinatown. The deep fried soft shell crab is phenomenal. Some of the best I've ever had and for a decent price - you just can't beat it.The Singapore mai fun is also great. So much flavor. Honestly you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, the food here is exceptional.Be warned though it's consistently packed and if you're looking to sit down and eat in, KNOW what you want to order. So take a look at the menu before, because once your server comes around, he's ready. No BS drinks first coming back and forth while you wait to decide.It is a large menu but they do expect you to know. It is a fast paced true NY joint after all. I give it the Ken Adams official seal of approval!","Great NY Noodle town ........ more like Good NY Noodle Town. Don't get me wrong, the place is solid, and the food was decently priced for the flavor and portions we got.Was it worth waiting 30 minutes? Probably not. To me was one of many solid Chinese food spots in Chinatown that didn't really stand out.Got beef chow fun, roast pork fried rice, beef wonton noodle soup, salt and pepper squid, and general Gaos chicken. Top picks would be the general gaos chicken and the roast pork fried rice. We avoided what seemed like a tourist trap in the fried soft shell crab.Overall, Good Noodle Town... I wouldn't go back. Cheers","If you just want a quick Chinese dinner with no frills, this is the place to go. Cash only but prices are not bad. We shared a roast duck wonton noodle soup and the sautéed bok choy special. The latter I thought was a little pricey at $13 but, hey, it was a great veggie dish, and we ate it all. The roast duck wonton noodle soup was great. Thin noodles. Huge wontons. And a decent portion of duck. And for less than $9. Really??!Appears there were a mixture of tourists and locals. But for a quick fulfilling meal of down home Chinese good, this is the place to eat.",Great NY Noodle Town
566,"Don't understand the hype. My meal was just average. I had corn soup and lemon pasta. Lemon pasta was good - not great. And the corn soup tasted like corn water, which was not the best. Overall, I'd give it another chance but I certainly was notBlown away.",Just left here - I had an 8:00 reservation and wasn't seated til 8:50. Once seated it took another 20 minutes for a waiter to come over. The service was terrible. Food was average. No one gave a -ish. No one said anything about the wait. Will never go back.,"We ordered a chicken dish and a fish special + a beet salad. The staff was nice with a nice atmosphere. I just felt, what we ordered was kind of boring. The food and flavors were disappointing. Judging by other reviews, we probably ordered wrong. If I try this place again, I will order pasta/something more Italian.","Gathered 15 of my friends here for a garden seated birthday dinner! The staff is very accommodating and reserved the back garden area for our group. a great spot for special events, large and small parties. Highlights were We are family style and tried the black kale salads, tagliatelle bolognese, rigatoni ragu, cacio e Pepe, orecchiette, a squid pasta and mussels. Highlights were the tagliatelle and squid pasta! Cash only is my only gripe, especially for larger groups.","Overall:4.2/5Food: 5/5Service: 3/5We came here around 7:30pm on a Saturday night. Surprisingly we were able to get a table for 2 without any wait. The food was AWESOME. We got mezzi rigatoni ragu dinner, black linguini with calamari, roasted garlic bruschetta, and tiramisu. All of them taste amazing and we really enjoyed it. The only 2 things we wish they can improve is:1. No one told us this was cash only. Usually the waiter will tell us at the beginning but no one informed us. And we didn't notice any sign saying cash only at the entrance.(maybe there's one but it was not obvious)2. The wait time for food and service(especially checkout) was long. We understand that they might be busy during dinner hour. The waiter actually saw us while passing by, but she/he didn't come to our table until around 10 min after.","It was okay. We got a good table. Had to ask two or three times for little things... Light the candle, some pepper for the salad, stuff like that.Panzanella salad we had was mostly kale, very little soaked bread or tomatoes.Tagliatele was good pasta but it was supposed to have asparagus and peas... Almost no asparagus.Waiter was nice. Good wine list. Cash only? I tried checking in on yelp but the free glass house wine is only during happy hour.",Gersi
567,Went in on a Sunday afternoon and sat at the bar. Our food was really good. Got the sliders and the poutine. I'm going back for more.,"Cozy and laid-back lunch spot! We ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, avocado salad and cowboy burger. Since we came after the usual lunch rush, we didn't have to make a reservation or wait to be seated. Pro-tip: if you check-in with Yelp, you'll get 10% off the bill!","This place is close by, but wasn't impressed. Food was cold, fries were mushy, mimosa was flat (after they brought over the wrong drink first).Also, apparently there are 3 different ways to spell omelette that I was unaware of. I guess if you don't care that much about your menu, you might not care about the rest of the offerings.Pro: I didn't get sick from any of the food, so at least I didn't die eating here.","Ordered delivery from here last night. Food arrived hot, quick and on time! Order is correct and everything was packaged neatly! Included utensils and napkins and Heinz ketchup! Amazing!I ordered the cowboy burger (medium), the three cheese quesadilla, and a soft pretzel.The soft pretzel was freshly made and it gets hard real quick I found out cause I couldn't eat it right away! I love that there's no preservatives in it to keep it soft for an eternity. The cheese to dip was good too, cheddar. Only complaint: it's a bit pricey for just a soft pretzel ($10), so I wouldn't order it again only for that reason. Yummy though!The three cheese quesadilla was sooo good! Melted cheeses and flour tortilla had a crunchy outer edge. The salsa had a mild heat and was tasty. The sour cream was cold and fresh. I'd totally order this again! Delicious!!! Great appetizer. $10 and soo worth it.The cowboy burger was YUMMY! It had cheddar cheese, grilled onions, grilled bacon, and bbq sauce. The grilled bacon was cooked perfect. The burger had a nice chargrilled flavor. I ordered it medium and it came medium rare but I'm totally fine with that. The grilled onions were cooked perfect with a nice char flavor. The toasted brioche bun was soft. It comes with fries. I asked for them to be extra crispy. They were slightly crispy, whatever. I ate a few and then gave the rest away. They were good fries though! I was just too full haha. $17 for the meal. A bit high, but it's NYC. Delivery fee is $1.49, not bad.I recommend trying this place!! Great food!!","Wow! I was duped into eating here by my fellow yelpers. But now realize that most of the 4 and 5 star reviews for this place are from out of towners. No real New Yorkers. And perhaps people who have no idea what good food tastes like. I'll take caution next time I read a review that starts with ""we came into the city"". I made a reservation for Friday August 30th at 6pm, through Yelp and that was easy enough. We were greeted by the pretty model type with the blank stare at the front and seated in the back. After only a few minutes I started to sweat like a whore at church. It was hotter in the restaurant than it was outside. So I asked the waitress to pretty please turn the AC on, which was situated on the wall 5 feet away from me. She walks over to whom I assume is the manager to ask about the AC. This guy seriously had the audacity to roll his eyes and purse his lips while looking at our table. How dare we ask for comfort while spending our hard earned money at your dive? She ""supposedly"" turned the AC on but that thing never kicked in. Because it's broken!!!! The crab cake sandwich I ordered was disgusting! Simply awful. I kept pulling pieces of, what I prayed, were crab shell out of my mouth. I even gagged while eating this usurper of a crab cake. Our waitress was not at all attentive. Took our order for drinks then again for dinner and we never saw her again. Why? Well, because she was too busy doing shots with the guys at the bar. What a poor excuse for a server. She did not earn the 15% tip we left behind. (We tip 20% normally) We left this dive feeling thirsty and super hot. This place is unworthy of the 4 stars it has on yelp. I strongly advise you go elsewhere for a drink and grub.","Cute place. Convenient location. Came here for a Saturday morning brunch, was able to make a reservation through yelp the night before. Got their a little early and they were able to take us right away. 3 brunch entrees - nice portion size, however wasn't anything special. Didn't love that the bacon was charred as if it was in direct fire. Waitress was super nice and always attentive to refill our drinks. No complaints on wait time, food came out pretty quick. Easy location just outside of Times Square without all the chaos. Was easy for us before a show, but not sure if we'll be back.",Lilly's Craft and Kitchen
568,"Avoid this place on Sunday's. And Saturday's. At brunch.  Service: 4Ambience: 4Food had: 4Food offered: 5 Price to portion ratio: 3 Ambience: 4 Basic batch ratio: 1:2 (who am I kidding, it's like 90%) Possibility of the person at the next table rubbing their ass on your shoulder as they get up to use the restroom: 4 Return possibility: 5, but UWS location. How much you should thank me for this review: 1","So I have to take them down a star after tonight, our second visit. We stopped in this afternoon because Jayson's been dying to go back, and he was craving scallops. It wasn't overly busy. We got a nice spot outside. Then, I don't know what happened. It took forever to have anyone come over. And when he did, we ordered a dozen oysters and a bottle of sparkling water. The oysters came. And I don't know if these were just the last of what they had for the week, or the ones slated to be thrown out, but they were just all kinds of wrong.  They were just thrown on the tray, they didn't look fresh. Actually, they looked kind of sickly. Jayson only got through three. And after 20 more minutes, we were still waiting for the sparking water and to place our order. We finally just got up, paid the check for the oysters and left. Very, very disappointed.","Great food and excellent service. However, Alejandro, the  manager, can be a bit creepy, especially with female customers. He constantly interrupts our conversation and also waits for me to use the restroom to approach my partner to ""chat"" with her. There's friendly, but this is over the top and with each visit it's gotten worse. We'll probably give this location (2nd Avenue) a break and check out their other locations in the West Village or the Upper West Side. It's a shame because thisLocation is really convenient. But for his behavior,  which borders on harassment since it makes my partner very uncomfortable, would have given them 5 stars.","It's been 6 years since my last review of The Mermaid Inn. I'm happy to report that it is still as good as ever. The East Village location offers Happy Hour in their entire restaurant, which is a huge plus in my book. Chef's oyster selection of the day is $1.25 each and clams are $1.00 each. Select cocktails are also only $8.00 each. The HH menu also features tons of nibbles for affordable prices. I finally tried the crab dip this time and it was very good. Could use with a more crunchier chip though. Also tried their mini buttered lobster roll and it was so good. It's only about 2-3 bites but it's very rich and filling. Order it with a side of old bay fries and some oysters and you've got yourself a meal! They still give out free chocolate pudding and a fish at the end. 10/10 would recommend (And I do, often!) to friends.","I can't believe I never wrote a review for Mermaid Inn! I absolutely love this place - especially during their happy hour. I've been here twice and both times they had a different East and West coast oyster on their happy hour menu. Both times, the oysters were delicious and fresh. I usually get a glass of their house white or rose whenever I'm here because despite it being the house wine and also the cheapest wine, it's pretty good. I haven't tried their cocktails yet but I promised myself I would be back to try one. Their mac and cheese is phenomenal and the clam chowder is very creamy and filling. I also love how they give you complimentary chocolate mousse at the end of your meal. It's just the right amount of sweet to round up your salty and fishy meal!","I happen to think that the UWS is lacking in really good restaurants so this place was a very nice surprise.It's seafood so if you don't like fish, then this ain't your spot. For those who do enjoy the gems of the ocean, their happy hour oysters were great especially for $1.50 a pop. Their cocktails, wine, clam chowder, tartar, fish tacos and kale salad were all delicious. We also ordered the steak which was just eh (it's our fault for ordering steak at a seafood restaurant so I shouldn't be complaining). Overall, the experience was a good one. If you want to pay less, come for happy hour, sit at the bar and enjoy the really cute bartender who will serve you :-)",The Mermaid Inn
569,Wasn't what I expected...spinach fettuccine in Alfredo sauce was ok. Spaghetti with sausage needed to be cooked a little longer. Came. Saw. Ate....next,"Meh. So/ so.Which bums me out because I have been wanting to try this place for so long. Ordered the cheese ravioli special and damn, I should have stuck with the carbonara because that was originally what I came in to have. Ravioli tasted a bit bland. It was just nothing special. I also got the fig crostini- that was good. Although I wish the pieces of fig had been cut and sprinkled over the piece of bread because it was hard to chew.The service was OK, I think we annoyed our server- but it's a bit hard when we were given the worst table in the restaurant. It was oddly placed right when you walk into the restaurant, it is a tiny circle table that sticks out and causes you to be in the way of everyone getting past you. I felt bad that I was in the way. I want to come back to try the carbonara. All in all, it wasn't bad, but it also wasn't good enough to crave.3/5","Let me tell you guys how disappointed I am at this place , me and my friend went to have dinner. We finished having dinner ... we are about to pay when the waiter tells us it's cash only...our tab was $58 with tax. We took out $60 ... we left $65. We are half way down the street when the man comes out running after us asking why we only left a $7 dollar tip ( 15% of the tip would have been $8.40) we were BAFFLED!!!!!! we explain to man that we only had our credit cards & that we had used our cash. He kept on asking us , why we left such a tip... then proceeded to ask if we were from New York  as if that had anything to do with the tip. It completely gave us a bad taste of this place ... it was the most rudest thing I've ever come across. THE DISRESPECT!!! Had I known I should have left nothing.UPDATE:After eating here , my friend got food poisoning. ( not worth our $7 tip after all)","Adorable little place with great food and service   I had the spaghetti with sausage and broccoli rabe.  It was so so good!   It's tiny, very tiny but we went at 3:30 while it was quiet.  Wait staff was super nice.  One note * CASH ONLY","Nice, small restaurant with lovely service and interior. It was busy on a Saturday night and the bar seating area was a bit of a squeeze, but the food was delicious.Recommends:Burrata (mozzarella appetizer)Salsiccia e BroccoliBucatini AmatricianaWashrooms are in the back. It's a good spot for an evening date.","We found this place through yelp & because of the great reviews we figured why not give it a try.  once seated we started with some wine asked for a bottle of white, they brought it out in a large glass bottle? little funny not seeing the bottle but not bad, wine was good. They start u off with some bread & olive oil, it was good. Appetizers we had the Burrata, very good nice taste with the pesto, also had the Arancini rice balls, the Pesto was very good the Beats one was very tasty didn't expect it to be so good. Main dishes first up the Carbonara pasta wow this was great, nice tasting sauce, good pasta next was the Kale pesto ahh I wanted to like this more but the bitter taste of the kale was taking away from the flavor, it was ok for me. & finally the Lasagna this was good as well a little on the heavy side but not bad. very small location, nice simple decor.. service was not bad a little slow but it wasn't an issue since we were just enjoying our time.  Decent prices, initially we didn't noticed the cash only kind of a pain since half the time u don't carry cash they of course have an ATM available all good, in the end we enjoyed our meal.",Spaghetti Incident
570,This place is really famous for their milkshakes which are pretty good. I got the oreo cookies and creme shake for $15 and it was amazing. They gave a oreo ice cream sandwich with the oreo shake and a ton of whipped cream.  I also got the order of onion rings. Do not get it. It was $8 for 7 onion rings that tasted horrible. It doesn't even look like your normal onion ring and is covered in this skimpy batter. Sooo not worth it.,"I've been to Black Tap quite a few times. The burgers are decent and the shakes are worth a try but my experience sitting in the basement seating area was terrible, the smell was of bleach and burger grease, and the air was stuffy being that your underground. I was there on a warm July afternoon and the ac was lacking. Overall not a good experience and probably won't be back to that location.",Service is not so good here had to ask a couple times to be helped had to find my own seat Ordered the birthday cake and that was good don't like the cups they give u to drink in easily can chip ur teeth  This location is small not so good if u need room pretty tight,"Wow! Wow! What a burger!! I had the Carolina. It was soo great. Such a face punch full of flavor. Perfect cook on the burger, pulled pork and coleslaw toppings sooooo made it awesome. Fries cooked to perfection.Super friendly staff and really quick to get the food. Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.","Decent burger place in the city. The shakes were massive and cool. It was very pricey though. Not sure I would go back if not for the novelty of the shakes. Oh and if my buddy Dave reads this, yes I ate a whole piece of cake from the top of the shake in one bite. I wasn't wasting $30 on a shake without getting my money's worth!","This place is one of those Instagram worthy food places. Not gonna lie- I expected it to be more classy because of the photos and expensive prices. I walked in and it was more of a casual diner. Staff wasn't very welcoming. Sat at a table for 20 minutes and finally had to ask if we had a server. The server responded by saying 'Yes I am I'll be right with you'. Considering we were one of two tables this was a disappointing start.Server with the poor attitude aside, milkshake was everything I expected . I ordered the Cinnamon Toast Crunch churro milkshake and wow! It came with a frosting rimmed glass and caramel to cover it with Cinnamon Toast Crunch. It was topped with a choco taco and churros. The milkshake itself was cinnamon to the max and had Cinnamon Toast Crunch within it. Absolutely delicious. The girls at the table next to us got a cotton candy milkshake  and a birthday cake milkshake and they looked equally as picture worthy. Also was pleasantly surprised to learn they had a happy hour which included $5 apps. Fried pickles were great, but nothing could take my attention off my award winning stellar milkshake.",Black Tap - Soho
571,"There are many things wrong with this place:1. Bartenders are barely paying attention to you and the counter is so sticky like in a college bar2. Once you get your overpriced cocktail you are constrained to a tiny area with even more sticky and dirty tables. The rest of the rooftop is only for guests with reservations. Which apparently you need to make a week in advance. However most of the tables where empty regardless.3. You are allowed to make a quick run through the wider rooftop area but if you stop to take a picture they approach you and start kicking you down to the reserved tiny area I mentioned in 2.4. Music is quite mediocre.5. And for all of that you need to line up for half an hour downstairs to get access to the rooftopBottom line, too inconvenient and unenjoyable for the price you pay. Will not go there again.","This is one of those rooftop bars where locals take out of town friends who got stuck with a bad hotel room view, or they take their special date who hasn't been yet.  The view is the million dollar prize here especially at sunset, and for that million dollar view, you can also have some expensive tasty drinks and small plates of food.  Don't hate the player- hate the insurance premium and taxes on rooftop bars with views.Even though the chicken empanadas look like they were made by tiny elves in a mini-me Santa workshop, they actually pack a full punch of flavor that didn't make me want any more food.  I looked over longingly at the plate of ribs- but didn't have the courage to ask to eat a stranger's plate of food.",Came here for girls night. No room to sit. Freezing and windy outside. The drinks weren't that good. Stood in line for no reason to try here. Came up for only about 20 mins got drinks and left and went back to queens for better bar and drinks.,"A group of 6 of us needed to find a place to celebrate the end of our rotation so we decided to check out Westlight. As soon as you walk in the lobby you are just hit by the grandeur of the space both in the lobby as well as the entrance of the bar. As we walked in there was two levels of outdoor seating. We decided to go to the top level which had an absolutely gorgeous view of the skyline which you can take in from the comfort of couches and bean bags. There were also a couple of foosball tables and cornhole set ups - all of which were free to play! Drinks themselves are pretty average. They didn't have any amaretto so I could not get my usual amaretto coke :( but was able to settle for a vodka cran. All in all, such a great place to hang out with a group and just chit chat. It was a little on the louder side but still a wonderful place to take in the surprising beauty of Williamsburg. This is definitely a rooftop I need to keep in my repertoire.","We were hanging in the area & decided to give this place a try , we came in & ended up getting a table outside. Once seated we ordered a bottle of Rosé , the rose was good nice light tasting. This place is pretty impressive because of the amazing views u get ... wow we were shocked to have such an enjoyable day just hanging out drinking, listening to music & enjoying the day & amazing views of Brooklyn & all the way into the city & beyond it seems. Service was good & prices were not bad since we had a group, we enjoyed our time.","Beautiful rooftop of the William Vale in Williamsburg - make a reservation just before sunset for the best views. My friend and I weren't able to be seated outside despite having a reservation, but it ended up being a blessing in disguise. We got a center table indoors which allowed us to take in the view but also have some more privacy and shelter from the wind outside :)Surprisingly, the food was better and service was friendlier than we expected. We ordered the tempura bass buns, crispy potato skins, chicken empanadas, duck tacos, and fries (yes, we were super hungry). I highly recommend all of them, as everything was flavorful and fresh. The crispy potato skins were incredible, especially with the caviar on top.Westlight also has an expansive and creative cocktails menu. The Lavender Lake and New Wave were delicious. All in all, a beautiful space to relax and take in the gorgeous NYC views.",Westlight
572,The service is top notch. But I found the food a tad disappointing. The wing app is so good but the scallion pancake all to easy to choke on with large undercooked hunks of scallion and zucchini (also a tad stingy with the dipping sauce).  We shared several appetizers and my daughter and I started the monkfish. I wish our very helpful server had talked us out of that. Plenty of string cut veggies but perhaps 3 oz of monkfish that were cut into small cubes and hidden in the mess on the plate. I took three lil hunks on my plate and put one back so my daughter would not be hungry.,"If you want Real Korean food, don't come here. As a Korean who grew up in family who owned successful Korean restaurants, I find the food and atmosphere here offensive to true Korean culture. The mandoo (dumplings) were undercooked, the banchan (side dishes) were bland, and the kalgbi was average. What bothered me the most were the wait staff. They were inattentive, rude, and had no understanding of Korean food. Also - the price points do not justify the experience. If you want REAL Korean food do yourself a favor and go to Koreatown.","We got seated ~9:30-10pm on Sunday. Apparently, this place was featured in NYT.+ good service and ambiance+ crispy spicy yang-yum chicken wings - standard but good+ grilled oysters seaweed butter, brioche toast - very tasty!+/- ran out of the mackerel, which they are famous so I was disappointed. They substituted the dish with sea bass, which was very good.+/- spicy cured cod roe, tuna sashimi, perilla bibimbap. The seafood was fresh, but I didn't think it tasted special. - saucy and spicy rice cake fundido, chorizo - average, very cheesy","This was really outstanding -- among the best Korean places we've tried in the city, up there with Her Name Is Han (my other favorite Korean ""comfort food"" spot) and a slight notch below Kawi (which is more upscale).First visit, we came with a party of four and got the scallion pancakes, grilled oysters, rice cake fundido, sablefish, pork barbecue ssam, spicy kimchie chigae, bibimbap with spicy squid, and then finished with the beignets and warm chocolate cake. This was a pretty perfect amount of food for us -- we killed everything and were solidly full, but not sick. The fundido is as amazing as it looks, so no surprise there. What was a surprise was that the sablefish was maybe our favorite item of the night -- it's not overly huge, but it really was perfectly done. We really loved the pork and the bibimbap as well, although it would be very tempting to try the short rib ssam and the tuna sashimi bibimbap next time around. I'd probably try a different chigae as well -- the spicy kimchi was very good, but didn't blow us away.Overall, an amazing meal and I hope we get back here sooner rather than later.","Treated myself to a birthday dinner here. Sat at the window counter by myself because I have no friends. But what I did have was an amazing meal.Lots of banchan to start off. All delicious.I ordered the fried scallops (served with a corn tartare topped with masago) as an appetizer. Perfectly fried and didn't detract from the taste of the fresh scallops.For my main, I got the jalapeno chicken. Generous portions, juicy chicken, and just the right amount of kick. Highly recommended!Washed it all down with a delicious glass of cold sake.An amazing experience all around!","We got here around 9:30pm on a Friday. It looked crowded on the inside when we passed by, but luckily the wait was only 15 minutes for a table. We were seated outside. While I usually like outdoor dining, I wished they had turned on their lights outside so that diners could actually see their food. (However, I walked by the restaurant the other day and noticed they had the outside lights on, so maybe they figured it out.) So the food photos aren't great because of the lack of lighting, but it was definitely delicious. The rice cake fundido was cheesy and the perfect size. The tuna, sea urchin, and cod roe cold bibimbap was pretty good too - lots of toppings. But my favorite was the boneless beef short rib ssam. Love wrapping it in lettuce wraps with rice. They also brought us a bunch of banchan. I don't remember the name of the cocktail I got. The waiter recommended it and I believe it had strawberries in it. It was not my favorite because I prefer drinks on the sweet side, but I think it was just personal preference.A big plus: our waiter was nice and extremely attentive. All in all, an amazing dining experience and I'd definitely come back.",Haenyeo
573,"The Spicy Mushroom Ramen Tofu is the best vegan ramen dish in the city. Bar none. Don't even waste time trying other vegan ramen dishes.

The Spicy Mushroom is the one vegan ramen to rule them all.",Had no expectations coming in and literally blew my mind how delicious this place was! I got the umami miso and my bf got the spicy mushroom pork. Both were full of flavor and just the right amount of salt in the broth. Will be coming back all the time!,"5star for noodle 1star for delivery serviceI've been ordering from Ramen Ishida for two years. They raised the price only on yelp (but not in store) this year, the ramen from 13 to 15, the pork bun for 8 to 9. However, this is not the issue I'm complaining about. For delivery orders, they are always so stingy about giving out extra chili powder somehow. The photo is the amount they give for two orders of ramen with the comment ""a lot chili powder please""; to be honest, it's not even enough for one ramen. I totally accept that if they let the customer to pay for the extra chili powder, maybe half cup for 2 dollars, but they don't give this option, nor enough chili powder. One more thing is that, my f hates mushroom, so when we order together, I commented ""no mushroom paste"" with the order. I then received a call saying they have to put the mushroom paste in. But WHY?? If it is a rule of Ramen Ishida, I have to say it's a dumb one. I really like this ramen place, but I do hope they have more reasonable delivery service.","Got the vegan Miso Ramen and it was pretty amazing. Being vegetarian, getting the vegan option at a ramen place is usually a toss up. This place had one of the best vegan broths I've had in the city. My friends got the miso and spicy miso and said they were also very good. Place is small, but very clean and cozy atmosphere. You can see them prepare your food in the back. Looked like a 2 person operation and they were both super nice. Definitely a place to check out for ramen lovers whether you're vegan or not. I'm sure I'll be back to try out more of the vegan options.","Highly recommend you when you visit Lower Manhattan. To tell me the truth, the friend of mine who put in the work for ramen recommended me also. I have tried a lot of ramen shops in the States. Nothing is better than any other ramen shop in Japan, in my opinion, without Ramen Ishidaya.I have ordered New Tonkotsu Ramen. The ramen has two different types of pork belly, an egg, vegetables, and garlic-based black pepper source. Smells really good, let alone tastes.I'm planning to go there once a week at least while I stay in New York.","Came here and tried two bowls of ramen (the new Tokyo style and the spicy mushroom ramen with pork). Also tried the pork buns.Starting with the pork buns, they were good. If you're expecting good pork buns, I'd say you get exactly that. If you're expecting some extraordinary ones, not so much.For the ramen, they used two different noodles for these. The mushroom one had a much thicker and rectangular shaped noodle. It was a lot more firm. The soup broth was heavy, but I just didn't necessarily enjoy it and the minced pork didn't gel well for me. I could quite figure out how to eat everything in this dish.The Tokyo new ramen was good. The noodles were more in line with what u expect, thinner and firm. The broth was very light, something not super traditional. I saw them make it and it seems like it's just a couple of sauces (soy sauce, sesame oil) and then hot water. It had a hint of truffle flavor and I actually enjoyed that sine that was the only rich flavor relative to everything else.If you're looking to sit here, be careful as it's a veryyy small place. This for sure isn't your traditional ramen place.",Ramen Ishida

Fancy named drinks , no good.","We had a reservation & they literally seated us 2 full hours after our reservation time -- telling us it would be ""ready soon"" in half hour increments -- then had the audacity to tell us they already had last call & couldn't serve us any drinks & the kitchen was closing! They were also very rude and the food is silly overpriced. Go here if you enjoy the worst kind of fad restaurant -- filled with pretentious, self-important people.",Thai food for white people. Tries so hard to be Thai but isn't really. Even the names of the dishes are gibberish.,Make a reservation in advance to skip out on the two hour wait! The Khao Soi was out of this world. The curry was so creamy and chicken so tender. Adding the dry egg noodles on top was so crunchy too! If there's only one dish you order go for this one. Bone marrow dipped in the bread was a good touch too.,"Walked in on a Thursday night as a party of two with no reservation, at like 7pm. It was 2 hr wait for a table, but the bar was only like 20 min so we did that! I also appreciated that my delicious mocktail was only $4! ...some places still charge like $12 for mocktailsThen we got two starters and two mains. 1 - octopus starter: this was more like grilled calamari. Pretty good, and actually a pretty large portion for 2 people. Good for sharing with a larger group. 2 - the top sausage. I think it was the ""sour"" one. Note the slaw it comes with has some little red pepper pieces that are very spicy! You can easily eat around them though if you want to/know 3 - the boneless short ribs with a side of jasmine rice. This is really good for all of the meat lovers out there. I, however, thought it was just too ...maybe heavy, or meaty? Plus the restaurant was on the hot side, and they don't put ice in their water. So I was left wanting something more fresh. 4 - then my favorite was the rotisserie chicken with mango slaw. Yum! Not spicy, but came with two different dipping sauces. We unfortunately didn't have the coconut sundae dessert - too full. But we heard good things. They do take out too! From a smaller menu. I saw someone order it at the bar and then the bar tender told her to come back in like 45 min to pick it up/he would call when it was ready. You could also stick around for drinks in the meantime if you wanted. Overall: pretty good, but not worth too much hype! My husband was a more impressed than me though.","I went to Uncle Boons around 9:30 pm on a Friday without a reservation. We were quoted a 2 hour wait for a table (they will take a phone number) and a 35 minute wait to sit at the bar (they will not take a phone number for the bar). We opted to wait for the bar, and got a drink next door quickly while waiting. We were seated within our quoted wait time and got a small table next to the bar. The service was good - we ordered as soon as we were ready and the food arrived as soon as it was prepared. We got the Yum Kai Hua Pli, Thai Sausage Duo, and Massaman Neuh. The Yum Kai Has Pli was VERY spicy. We needed the Jasmine rice to alleviate the heat from the spice. We also got the Thai Sausage Duo. Both were good, but I would recommend only getting the Thai Blood Sausage - it was superior and much more unique. Lastly we got the Massaman Neuh which was extremely tender.

They have outside seating but might have long lines depending on time/day.","This is just a fantastic restaurant that delivers an A+ experience. It was a beautiful Oct 1, ""Indian summer"" evening. Yes it helped that we got a parking spot right across the street from the restaurant. Yes it helped that there was no wait and we got a perfect outdoor table.The food was incredible. All of it. The pita bread, the Greek salad, and spinach pie. The steak, the swordfish, the lemon potatoes, the beets. Delicious.Now the service. Everyone is attentive and caring.  The waiters, the busboys, and even the hostess attended to our needs. They were also helpful and accommodating to food allergies in our family.All in all, this is dining out at its finest. Can't wait to go back again.",Delicious greek food in Astoria. Plenty of outdoor seating and some indoors. Grilled octopus was delicious! Chewy and flavorful. Calamari tasted freshly battered and fried. The fish is very tender and all the portions are big enough to split. Chicken kebabs were huge and not dry. The entrees also comes with sides. We also ordered a greek salad to lift up the the heaviness of the meats. They also provide a complimentary dessert afterwards - a greek custard with cinnamon. Overall great place to go when you want fresh greek seafood and to treat yourself.,"Five of us ate here last night and were very lucky to have had the right number of people for the one open table out on the patio on a beautiful fall night. This popular restaurant gets very crowded quickly but everyone we met was friendly and welcoming. Also they are very efficient directing patrons to tables. We began our meal with some very tasty crispy eggplant & zucchini chips with a garlic dip and their complimentary loaf of bread - well two actually, a humongous Greek salad and a bottle of their house white wine. For the main courses I had not one but two cooked perfectly Greek hamburgers (my wish come true - a place that gives you two patties, not just one :-). The others in my family had (per their feedback) delicious lamb chops, Branzini (Mediterranean sea bass) and Barbounia (red mullets). For dessert they give you a complementary custard pastry that was the perfect ending! The minor glitches that kept this review from being 5-stars were the vegetables that they serve with the entree - chard that was bitter and that none of us liked at all and that we had to ask three times to get a second plastic bag in which to bring home our leftovers. So overall, I am a fan!",Taverna Kyclades
576,"Like a lot of trendy Mexican/Spanish spots in the city, Brooklyn, and Queens, they don't let you pick and choose the tacos you want. You're forced to get 3 of the same. So if you hate the first taco, you're stuck with 3 tacos you hate. The happy hour is limited to 3 beers and 1 frozen margarita (whatever flavor the choose for that day) which is obviously terrible.Do yourself a favor, go to Taqueria on St. Marks and 1st ave. The tacos are great, you can choose the tacos you want your bill will be half the price. 3 stars for space and decor.","go here for a drink and all of your instagram pics for sure. with all the decor and colors, BOMB. vibe is hella chill, def not a dancing spot even with the music. food is average, service is not great. like our appetizers came with entrees? lol ok. and took forever on top of that. you've been warned!","The service was ok. The food was terrible in taste and portion. The prices are outrageous, they get away with it all bc the place is relative new and the decor is super welcoming. Especially for the IG fanatics. Our drinks were very very weak and we were a group of 9 ladies and I can tell you we all had the same negative experience.",It is a two floored Mexican place with a rooftop on its top floor. Ambiance is very chick . Amazing place for food and drinks especially for  group. Recommendations:- MAKE reservations. The place is huge but it gets pack very quickly so please please make a reservation(especially for the rooftop)- Frozen margaritas(original). They are quite boozy. Two drinks are enough to make you high(hehe). -Guacamole is to die for. Hands down one of the best grauc ever had. Pros:- Great ambiance.- Great food- Great drinks-Great service(What else you want)cons:- Gets quite noisy especially in the indoors but its ok. Ambiance and the vibes compensates for it.,"Came here for Taco Tuesday with good company so had a great time! Their Taco Tuesday deal is 3 tacos for $10 so a little pricey. My boyfriend and I shared the Juan Punch Bowl ($20) which says is for two people but it's a little small in comparison to other punch bowls we've shared. We shared the nachos (which were amazing) and I had the chorizo tacos which I really enjoyed but my boyfriend didn't like his carnitas tacos. The ambience is really nice and has nice decor. Definitely has a party vibe even on a Tuesday! The service was really bland though. Our server barely checked on us except when it was time to pay and leave. Would probably come back during their late happy hour, but other than that, wouldn't be back. Way too pricey for what you get.","Second time here pooping in before heading over broadway play in the area. The ambience is trendy, the music is borderline too loud but the food speaks for itself. We came on a Tuesday for their Taco Tuesday and managed to snag some happy hour margs as well. Cauliflower tacos can be, let's face it, nasty if not cooked and season properly. But not to worry! Vida verde has dressed these guys up and they're vegan too so love that for me. We ordered a healthy salad too and it was still memorable amongst the tacos and tequila. Yum!",Vida Verde
577,"FOOD POISON WARNING: Worst diarrhea my family and a friend had after having dinner at this place. From 2 a.m to 7 a.m., none of us could sleep because we had to constantly go to the bathroom. My 18-month-old son also had more diarrhea-like poop and cried all night after eating the cold sesame noodles. My wife even had extreme colic lasted for half an hour. Infuriating how poisonous the food they could make there! We never had a problem like this after trying so many restaurants over the years. Looking at the old reviews seems like other people also suffered from stomachache and vomiting after eating in this place. It is also ashamed when you invited a friend to a so-called ""good restaurant"" but ended up causing them severe diarrhea.We are shocked because on Yelp this restaurant highlights ""healthy dining"". We came here mostly because I mistakenly believed the false advertising ""Best Szechuan Food"" they put on the website. After reading more reviews, I found that the owner of the Zest Szechuan invited a lot of Yelp Elite reviewers in an event to make them look like a ""4-star"" restaurant. (and Yes, it fooled me! I surrender to your marketing strategies) so BE AWARE! You would NOT have a 4-star experience at this place. You don't want to be the next one to be filled up with filthy ingredients and suffer from hours of torture.","Not sure how this place has such great reviews. The service was disinterested in serving and the food was boring, underseasoned, muddy flavors and over cooked noodles.","This dish was awesome.  Possibly better than the L6.  Lotsa pork and tofu.  Perfect Mala flavor that I was looking for!I'm not sure if its normally Mala, but I put 麻辣 in the notes, which I'm assuming was enough to tell them what I wanted.I put in an order at 1130 to pickup at 1200 and it was ready shortly before 1200, so no problems there!Will be back again soon.  Need to diet again first though.(Most Favorite) L6 - L14 - L28  (Least Favorite)","I've been to this spot a couple times now for dinner. Every time I have gone, it is always pretty packed, but I never had to wait long. People are constantly in and out! The interior isn't anything special, but the food is good. I really like the spicy fish fillet with tofu. It pairs very well with pea shoots or baby bok choi. I also like the cold appetizer dish with tendon, tripe, and beef in chili sauce. The last time I was here, we also tried the beef tendon and potato dish. I thought it was okay, but feel like I wasn't craving it. Nonetheless, will definitely be returning.","Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat for dinner on a weeknight. This place is in a little bit of an odd area so it was not very crowded when we arrived and is designed very minimally. After perusing the menu, we decided to go with the General Tso's chicken, dumplings, scallion pancakes, sautéed string beans, spicy chicken, and the free dan dan noodles for checking in on Yelp.Let me just start by saying that this was one of the most disappointing meals I have had in NYC and I was shocked honestly as the ratings of this place are pretty good. First off, the free dan dan noodles were hardly edible as the flavor seemed a bit off. I have had a lot of dan dan noodles and never not enjoyed it until this meal. Also, the spicy chicken was overcooked and didn't really have much flavor outside of its combination with the peppers. Finally, the string beans were also overcooked and lacked the real crunchy quality that I was looking for.Overall, this place serves up meals quickly and the pricing is reasonable, but the quality is majorly lacking. I would skip it and try another spot as there are much better options around the city.",My husband and I were invited for the tasting. The food is great.If you are trying Szechuan for the first time this is the best place to go and if you like this cuisine than go ASAP. Prices are pretty decent for the quantity they serve. The ambience is very normal but the food is amazing.(you won't be disappointed for sure) Pros: -great spicy food-very generous with the quantity in comparison to the prices-staff is friendly(it was our first time trying this cuisine so they explained the whole menu). Lisa- who owns this restaurant is very friendly and sweet. Cons:-ambience is very normal. Recommendations:-grilled fish (must try)-mapo tofu(spicy)-mung jean jelly noodles(Must try),Zest Szechuan
578,"The mustard chops weren't welcomed, thank you--I ordered the elk chops; they had an excessive, overpowering amount of mustard. I enjoy and can handle well spicy foods, but this was an overkill. I was tearing up, and couldn't taste the meat allegedly exquisite meat underneath the mustard. Shame on the chef!The black sea bass and the consommé were alright, to be fair.Nice Pinot Noir, ok.Overall:Bah.",I opened a yelp account and downloaded the app just to write this. So so so bad. Inedible food but the waiter was cool,"ABOMINABLE !I went to the old Henry's End through the 90s and early 2000s.I thought it would be exceptional enough for a friend's birthday dinner who I wanted to have good food and a good experience. That did not happen, and to a shocking extent. The food was revolting slop that looked like what you would find served in a prison, and (literally) toxic to an extent you would not EVEN find in a prison. I have never written (or felt compelled to write) anything like this--and the following--ever before.I made reservations a week before, discussed that it was a friend's birthday, and requested a good table as I was booking in advance. This meant nothing when arrived as we were sat in their new not very exceptional dining room, at one of the even less exceptional (or desirable) tables, just as if we walked in off the street. When I asked if a better table could be provided (there were a few better empty tables in the room) I was told no, and that people reserved the other tables THAT day. However, after a while we WE'RE given a less bad table and told ""people canceled"" as if a favor was being done for us.We started with drinks. I was given a martini on the rocks that was watered down from the ""couple"" if ice cubes in it. My friend's daiquiri was unrecognizable from any daiquiri EVER and tasted like nothing I have ever tasted even in the worst dive bar. She sent the drink back, and it was not the first thing that got rejected from our table during the evening. (I should have rejected everything.)I had started dinner with the Caesar salad, she, the Duck Mousse. The salad was 'OK' but the mousse was more a puree than mousse and came with the unwanted surprise of chutney mixed in the under portion of it. This was NOT listed in the menu description. We also both switched to wine knowing no ""mixing skill"" would be required. THIS is the least awful part of ""dinner.""The entrees came. We both ordered ""Braised Duck with Seasonal Wild Mushrooms, Shallots, Thyme, and Lingonberries."" My dinner companion ordered mashed potatoes, and I ordered sautéed spinach. The plates with the duck were non-descript brown heaps of sauce with something underneath. The spinach was swimming in water and the mashed potatoes were slopped onto the plate in lumpy mound. We each tasted our side dishes. Mine was at least not overcooked (I would suffer form having eaten it later.) Hers caused an expression on her face that caused me immediately to taste it. And I was APPALLED.It was a tasteless mountain of paste except for the overwhelming amount of SALT that had been DUMPED into it. She then tasted her duck, looked horrified, and said ""I cannot eat this."" I tasted it as well and it was horrendously tough, over cooked, and comprised (again) mostly of salt. This was to an extent I have never encountered before. If there were mushrooms, rice or shallots (described in the menu description) anywhere on the plate, I could not tell. Everything was mixed into an ugly overbearing brown sauce that was slathered over the inedible --equally ugly--brown carcass on her plate. BOTH of her dishes got sent back. Unfortunately, my friend's appetite was destroyed at this point and she said she could not eat anything else.MY duck was not so badly overcooked, but equally buried underan ugly, heavy brown sauce. Perhaps out of shook over encountering one horrible thing after another, I ate my duck along with my spinach. It was not good and I would pay for that--in a couple of ways. My paying with my health, continued the day after eating at Henry's End, by feeling extremely unwell and like I mainlined SALT.I convinced my friend to order dessert. She acquiesced. ANOTHER big mistake. Her ""Black and White Mousse"" was a thin layer of chocolate mousse under a thick layer of frozen cream. My Chocolate Hazelnut Cake was nothing you can't get in a diner, except for the ""extra"" taste of salt. This added to the toxic levels that at that point, had already been delivered into my system.I foolishly ordered coffee. The coffee had a ""burnt"" odor, and when I poured the cream into it, a curdle ""chunk"" plopped into the cup, sending little curdled particles of cream out in a ripple effect throughout the surface of the beverage.Today as last night, I pay with my health by still feeling ill from the mega does of salt I can still taste and was DUMPED in COPIUS amounts into almost everything served. I usually have no problem with salt. But today, the thought of it makes me feel ill. As I and my dinner companion both believe the duck was prepared MANY hours before it was served, it may have been left out to accumulate bacteria. That would account for how bad I felt the following day.I saved up for last night. If anyone thinks as I did--of their good memories of the old ""Henry's End"" with a mind towards going, there PLEASE reconsider.Shame on you Henry's End... for the last time I was there !","Wow.This place is an institution, and definitely one of the best places you can go to in the neighborhood for a real sit down meal.    They moved down the street from their old location but the food is the same and the atmosphere is better than before. In the fall their wild game menu is wild!  Year round the menu is filled with hits.  When my girlfriend goes a week without giving me a hard time this is where I bring her for date night, and they never disappoint us.Sit down have some wine and choose anything on the menu, you can't go wrong.",This is a bold statement... but Henry's End may have one of the best menus in all of New York City.  Just go.  The end.,"A true gem of Brooklyn Heights! A very unique menu featuring many fresh ""game"" meats (I.e rabbit, deer, duck, etc) which maintains unbelievable quality and is well worth the price. Food: I had ordered the a mixed plates with duck, rabbit, and venison and everything was impeccable. My friend described his chicken as best chicken if his life. Drinks: short but fantastic beer menu featuring local gems. I ordered wine special which was excellent and fairly priced.Service: really amazing service. Wait staff was very attentive and genuinely cares we were satisfied. Vibes: My favorite part of Henry's End is it is not pretentious. To have this level of food and service it is refreshing to have a relaxed unassuming atmosphere.",Henry's End
579,"This place had promise last time I went out with a friend but upon returning last night I can certify that I will never forget this experience...and not in the best way. Besides the drinks being poorly constructed (unmixed, syrup sitting at the bottom), I had a full can of BEER hit me in the back of my head by the bartender...apparently he was trying to throw it to a customer. What possibly could have compelled a fully grown man to toss beer in the midst of a crowded bar I will never know. He apologized, asked if I was okay, as did the guy who was supposed to be catching it. I didn't get drinks comp'd and looking back I probably should have but I was in a fair bit of shock and confusion. This was a nice divey little place for casual dancing at one point but the disregard and carelessness is not worth tolerating. Get your act together Commodore.","Yikes.... this place has gone down hill. I normally wouldn't bother to write a review for a bad meal, but my gfs and I had terrible food poisoning after eating there on Sunday. As usual, the bartenders were rude. This is normally ok because the food is good, but if you are going to be rude and give us food poisoning, you can step down.Tables sat dirty for 15+ minutes. Waitresses walked by and cared not at all. We bussed our own table. They claimed the pina coladas had four shots of alcohol in them and there is simply no way. We would have blacked out. They were weak as hell with barely any booze in them!Fried chicken was all breading and little chicken. The nachos I've been ordering for years were half their former size. I'm almost glad the portions were minuscule, as our food poisoning has been awful. GOODBYE commodore, your ship has sailed.","Chicken sandwich delicious! Drinks OKAY. Service HORRIBLE. Went with my sister and our husbands on Saturday night and our bill was overcharged(bartender working that night should be fired for how disgusting he speaks to female customers). When we went to tell the bartender, he gave us such a hard time and he was very defensive. I told him to please check the receipt and his response was ""well I don't have it in front of me"". Instead of listening to the customer and trying to find a solution he decided to argue with us. Not professional at all! Turns out that he charged us for an extra drink plus some. When we told him he never gave us the drink he yelled at us and said ""yes I did, I handed it over to you!"" Unfortunately, he really didn't, but he kept arguing with us so we left it alone (I really wanted to tell him to check the cameras to prove him wrong) it ended with ""I don't have time for this"". Not only was he rude but a very big liar. I can't believe that an establishment can just steal customers money like this. I will definitely file a complaint with the BBB. Point is, MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR BILL. Do not leave your tab open. Unfortunately, you must order food at the bar which gets super crowded and leaves a lot of room for error.We left commodore with an overcharged bill. As delicious as the chicken sandwiches were the horrible service and rude bartender ruined the whole experience.","Probably my favorite bar in all of Brooklyn, if not New York.Free pinball and that super sprint alone make it 5 stars. Add to that a great cocktail menu, fun vibe and the best bar food in NYC? Yeah, go here.Get the fried chicken or burger.","""I need to find the best chicken sandwich in the city,"" my cousin declared out of nowhere as we were shopping in SoHo this past weekend. Happy to oblige, I quickly pulled up Yelp and did some research and The Commodore came up. So, we ambitiously walked from SoHo across the Williamsburg Bridge and into an unmarked dive bar that we correctly guessed was the right place with the help of a dusty neon sign advertising ""breasts"" out front. What have we gotten ourselves into? That was the first thought that went through my mind. This certainly didn't look like a place where, an hour and a half later, I'd be sitting in sheer bliss thinking ""this was the best meal I've ever had in my life."" And yet...We placed our orders at the bar: she had the chicken sandwich ($13) and I had the chicken platter ($14). Along with the food, she had a frozen mojito and I a frozen piña colada (both $12 I believe) after admiring the ones our neighbors were drinking. We headed out to the back porch, and after admittedly a little bit too long waiting (we think they forgot our orders initially) our food arrived.BEST. CHICKEN. EVER. Perfectly fried, crispy but not too greasy, the perfect layer of breading, tender and juicy and cooked throughout. 3 large pieces with practically no bone and no grizzle. Served with two hot sauces (both delicious) and a honey butter that was to-die-for atop the three phenomenal mini biscuits. And for only $14? Absolutely unheard of. Already planning my trip back. This place changed my life.",A hidden gem in Williamsburg. The outside of this spot make you not want to go inside. But once you have a drink and order the fresh fried chicken or the chicken Sandwich you going feel like you went to heaven and came back down. The chicken is fresh and crispy. I really enjoyed my meal and drink with my family at this hidden gem,The Commodore
580,"I had friends visiting from out of town for 4 of July weekend. It was 6 of us. We got a table upfront with an AC dripping down on top of us, although it wasn't a problem. My friend ordered black ink pasta with shrimp, that came out over cooked. We wanted to notify the server (or host, or manager it was hard to tell who was it), but he came by the table very annoyed and instead of listening to what we were saying he just cut us off saying that this is how it should be.. disappointed. The tips, of course, were included.. the rest of the food was good, service leaves much to be desired",Tasty. I had the home made fettuccine with meat balls. I could've had more but it did leave room for dessert. They provide bread with oil which was handy for dipping on the meat sauce. Came on a Tuesday so it wasn't it too busy and service was attentive.It's not budget friendly but that's Manhattan!,"I wouldn't come back here. Only came once and the service was subpar. I didn't know who my server was. No one ever checked one during my meal to see if I needed anything or just to see how I was doing. I had the special: pasta with meatballs. The meatballs were dry and rather bland, with what seemed like little bits of ground up bone in it. I didn't eat much. Left disappointed.","We've had Barbalu on our list to try for months now, and finally worked up the motivation to make our way over. It certainly did not disappoint...we started with the prawns and avocado appetizer, which was a bit underwhelming but not enough so to deter our positive opinions. Once we received our entrees (gladly priced with wine from their affordable drink menu), there was no turning back. The fettuccine bolognese was splendid; the noodles were cooked to perfection.  And then you there's the  Pear and Ricotta Fagottini with Cream and Truffle Oil. This dish was everything that I could have imagined, and pictures do not do it nearly enough justice. The truffle cream sauce takes you back to Italy, and the impressive way they pair it with the pear is unlike any other dish I've ever had. A must try if you eat here! Their prices are reasonable and they don't skimp on meals, which gives them an additional notch in my book. We will definitely be back soon!","I came here for Italian Restaurant Week for dinner. The restaurant is mom and pops family owned restaurant. The service was on point as the server and staff were really nice and accommodating definitely better than Felidia.The food in this place was also good, but I had my favorites. For the appetizer I had the special which was the bresaola with arugula. The appetizer was a lot of food for something that is cold cut but no complaints. The Pear and Ricotta Fagottini with Cream and Truffle Oil  was my favorite dish. The fagottini was freshly made in house and it was to die for. The Tartufo Gelato was also delicious but was not memorable. The overall experience was great, cozy and low key. I would definitely return and even hold a birthday or girls night dinner.","Just hosted a bridal shower this past weekend (5/11/19) for a group of 20 girls and worked with Stefano the entire time. The process from booking to finish was a breeze and the waitstaff was attentive the entire way through!We had the private room in the back from 11:30am onwards, although our event was actually from 1-4pm. We had an amazing deal for shared apps (cheese and meat plates along with arugula salad), entrees (delicious perfectly al dente pasta [get the rigatoni!!] or omelettes), and paid a little extra pp for a shared dessert plate. We also ordered several bottles of wine and a bottle of prosecco for a toast. The space is really what shone for us. All of our guests ooh'd and aah'd over the expansive space, the gorgeous brick walls, and the sunroof ceilings that allowed streams of light to wash through the entire space. As mentioned, the waitstaff was super attentive, from set up (helping us fill up vases to loaning us scissors) to making sure our glasses were full throughout service, to cutting the cake and giving us ample takeaway containers. Really easy to work with Stefano - all it took was a simple email request and $200 deposit to hold your spot. If I had to nitpick, I'd say that the bathroom situation was a little small (2 restrooms for the entire restaurant) and the A/C was a little weak in the room, but overall the event was so smooth. Really one of the best showers I've ever hosted/attended! P.S. I would say 20-22 guests is the perfect amount as the space will likely get too tight over that amount.",Barbalu Restaurant
581,"Where the food should have been the star of the show, it simply wasn't very memorable. After leaving ABC Kitchen, Chef Dan Kluger opened his first restaurant, with a menu that was very similar in feel. Elements of American fare, elements of Italian, and plenty of veggies at the center. Only these components didn't fuse together as they do more organically at ABC. We left having been lost in a fog of underwhelming veggie preparations, pastas with flavors that just didn't seem to work, and a pizza that ticked all the wrong boxes. Many diners may come and go, paying less attention to the food, and fulfilled (or fooled) by the upscale ambiance and trendy vibe of this Greenwich village hangout. But if you're out to dine with food as your focus, you'll be easily disappointed by the disconnectedness of this menu and dining experience.","Where the food should have been the star of the show, it simply wasn't very memorable.

I rarely go to a restaurant in nyc twice because I love trying new spots, but I would come back to Loring Place time and time again. First of all, the seasonal menu ensures fresh ingredients for creative dishes. My boyfriend is STILL talking about the ramp pizza we had in the spring, it was that good. Some must order staples include the baked ricotta, the fresh bread, the calzone, and the burger. Second of all, the service is wonderful! The wait staff provides genuine, honest recommendations and is attentive and friendly. They brought us a cute dessert plate on the house for my mom's birthday as well as a sample of the beet appetizer, which was amazing! Third of all, the aesthetic is gorgeous. It's a modern place with higher ceilings and dim lighting. HIGHLY recommend this Greenwich Village spot!",- Came for brunch- Cute little spot in the village- Got the cheddar waffles & eggs ($19): It tasted so good and I wish there was more. The portion was kind of small. For me.- Bright and beautiful lighting at the tables near the front of the restaurant- The back area is kind of dark- Found out after that they have a lunch prix fixe menu for $32. I might go back and give that a try.,Loring Place
582,Store hours on the door and yelp says they are open from 11am to 10pm but I came by for lunch at 2:30 and they were closed!!!Try updating your hours on Yelp and change the hours on the door while you're at it.,Besttttttt FRIED CHICKEN Rice  BOWL!!!!!! Tender and juicy at the same time and coconut rice are amazingly flavorful,All I have to say is jerk pork and pineapple quesadillas. Literally the best things I've ever eaten. So much food and flavor from the pineapple juices mixed with the jerk pork.,"Still on point! El Jeffe was busier than I expected, but rightfully so. The flavors with the food never fail to make me happy. If I lived any closer, it would be difficult to stay away. I've introduced this little gem to a number of people, and get jealous when they tell the picked up food without me lol. The service is also great.  You will have to wait for your food, because each order is freshly made but absolutely worth it. The frozen drinks are a treat and great to sip on while you wait.  Don't pass by without snatching up some really good tacos!","I apologize for not having pictures, but I am always too focused on eating my tacos. The food is well seasoned, and this is actually one of my favorite places for tacos. The staff is great as well! It's also really cute inside :)","First suggestion. If you are starving, don't come here expecting an immediate order and delivery of food to fill your aching belly. This is one of those take our time to deliver some really good food, kind of spots. You've been warned. I got a steak, chicken and jerk pork taco with chips and salsa and my spouse got steak quesadilla. The wait time... Oh that wait time... I was told that it takes a while but geez it really does. I'm speaking about that starving suggestion because that was me. I am the person that had an aching belly. I was so happy when they finally called my name. We took it to go and had a nice picnic style meal in the cool of our home ( this was one of the hottest nights of the summer, we usually eat in the living room but with no ac, that room was an automatic no.) The chicken and the steak are good but that Jerk Pork... I don't even have the words but it's all positive. I wanted to go back out and get more. They have a pineapple ( optional) in it and it is my new jam. Really looking forward to craving tacos. Really going to call and order ahead instead.",El Jeffe
583,"5/5 for the vibes - bright and cute decor (think white benches and green plants everywhere) and lots of tables and booths, so good for dates or small groups. 4/5 for the food - the veggie spring rolls are KILLER (must get), but the pomelo shrimp salad was disappointing (tiny shrimps and tiny portion). Don't expect an authentic beef pho when ordering - the soup itself is very tasty, but just not the pho flavor you'd expect. A good bowl of noodles but I'm not sure it's worth the $15. Would probably try something else on the menu if I came back","Too much hype but decent for what it is (a beautifully-dressed corp de ballet). I tried the grilled fish which was delicious but the sauce was very salty (probably cause of the fish sc). The rice that came with this dish was just overlooked and sad...over cooked and no flavor whatsoever. This would normally be a minor issue but it's a hideous crime coming from an Asian restaurant (yes, I'm exaggerating but don't you agree?) Also tried the pho and I considered it average...","First time here and not sure if it's worth coming back. Wait was long but food wasn't as good as we expected. We've been to Vietnam and Hanoi, and it did not meet our expectations. We had the Vietnamese pizza and please don't get that. It's nothing special and does not taste good at all. For soup, we got the beef pho hanoi and bun bo hue. The portions are really small for what you're paying for and flavors are just not there. Madame Vo is still my favorite.",The place it's self is a delight.   Straight up cute and fresh approach an interior.  The staff are absolutely the most welcoming i have met in a long time. The food - well if you are looking for traditional Vietnamese then no you are in the wrong place and should probably run.    That being said the menu is kind of cool and innovative with some old favorites mixed with new. Everyone raves on about the pizza but I wasn't digging it.  The scotch egg was again different but so small it barely touched the sides. Last but not least the pho was ok but seemed to lack depth in the broth.  I like the place and will give in another go but I'm not sure it's hitting the spot.  Def a 3.5 *,"Had dinner here last week - 4 of us.It was one of the best dining experiences I have had in NYC over the past 30 years. We have eaten Vietnamese food many times, but this was in a league of its own. Everything we ordered was exquisite! From the appetisers (shrimp rolls, Vietnamese pizza, and pig tails), to the entrees that we shared ( crispy fried rice noodles, dry BoBo chicken, rice paper salad and done phos).I have no hesitation recommending DiAnDi. One of the best modern Vietnamese  restaurants in town!","Di An Di is a modern, fancy Vietnamese restaurant. I'll have to admit that's not something I'm entirely used to so the prices did shock me. However, for NYC I guess it wasn't that bad? I really enjoyed the papaya salad with the shrimp chips (my fave!) as an appetizer and the Hu Tieu as the main dish. I normally get my Hu Tieu as a soup but they didn't have that option here. I'm not complaining though because it forces me to try the dry version of the dish and I am a fan. The food was great, the atmosphere was really cute and nice, and the service was good! So all in all I had a great dinner",Di An Di
584,Absolutely exceptional.   I've tried every Michelin tasting menu out there and this is by far the best.   Read all the other reviews to get a sense for what to expect but don't read too many as you want some element of surprise.L'Appart is absolutely phenomenal from the moment you sit down until you leave.  We can't wait to go back when the menu changes.,"This is a very unfortunate experience. My friend and I came to L'Appart with high expectations, but putting aside taste, which is shockingly bad (the monk fish extremely salty, the tasting menu was designed with too much dairy which is very heavy), I had mentioned to the host and one of the chefs about this. Both of us started to feel uncomfortable as we ate and drank (we got the wine pairing with it too) and when we got home both of us felt nauseous, felt the chills and ultimately threw up a few hours later - symptoms of food poisoning. We didn't have lunch together and both felt fine when we went to dinner, and after dinner both of us had similar symptoms. I thought maybe the taste was off but didn't expect a restaurant of this caliber to have food safety issues.The host (who was Belgian) said that the main chef was on vacation and insisted that the quality of the food without the main chef is no different - if this is the case, then I would highly discourage people from coming here unless they want to come away with food poisoning, the pain and suffering is certainly not worth the $800 we spent there. The service and ambience were great but that's pointless if a restaurant can't get the food and safety right.",It's an adventure just finding this place but once inside this very small maybe 10 table restaurant the experience of pure pleasure unfolds. It's about an eight course meal every dish tasty except one was average the menu changes every month. The staff could not be more friendly and attentive. The wines were spectacular. The only downside was my wallet which was $600 lighter for two people.,Excellent service! The food is delicious and ambiance is trendy and upscale. The free lemonade at the entrance taste really good too. My favorite dishes are the lobster and lamb and one desert.,"Cool space, great service, but very average uninspiring flavors for $800. My wife and I felt that a lot of effort when into presentation (verbal and visual) and little else. The business model is also heavily weighted towards upselling diners towards additional dishes and caviar courses. Last I checked sturgeons create caviar, not a human chef. If I'm spending this much for a meal I want to eat something that required skill to prepare and cook.Anyway the dishes I can remember were as follows:1. Uni (sea urchin which I love) on a 1 cm square piece of toast, something else on a micro spoon and squid w/ink on a micro spoon. [ the uni was good and I think the squid was OK but it was so small I could barely taste it]2. A small piece of turbot which was OK, perhaps a little overcooked, but unimpressive, I can cook fish 5 ways I prefer than this. We also got this course as an added extra to the standard menu3. two strips of another kind of fish about 3cm by 1cm with (I believe) an olive/anchovy tapenade. this was quite good.4. A small loaf of bread (the whole loaf was comprised of three slices) with something like a cream cheese spread. This was probably the best bread I have ever eaten, but do I want to pay $800 for a small loaf of bread no matter how good it is? No Not really. I good bagel with cream cheese would have been close enough.5. Burrata cheese with micro basil and other vegies which were given a ""hair cut"" right at the table by the waiter onto the cheese. This was then combined with some type of bread/cake substance to produce a dessert .This was creative but nothing really special in terms of flavor6. A half sized martini glass with almost non existent layers of wonderful sounding things with virtually no flavor at all. Bahhhh, thank you for playing.7. A tiny dark chocolate brownie with something on topAs you can see I am also complaining about the tiny size of some of these courses, yet I am a total believer in small courses for fine dining because it focuses your attention on each dish, but if the food is not good it really backfires. Also some of these courses required a magnifying lens to eat and portion size has to be a certain size just so you can extract enough flavor from the food. Flavor becomes illusive below 1/3 of a teaspoon full.I believe this restaurant has a star, but having fared equally badly at a few other 1 star Michelin rated restaurants and I am coming to the conclusion that Michelin should stick to making good tyres, and give up rating food.I will try Le Bernardin next, maybe I will be surprised.","Food: 3/5Service: 5/5Value: 0/5Food was fine, nothing screams amazing, not worth the $700 we spent... I'd choose l'Atelier over this in a heartbeat...Service was undeniably great, intimate space, interesting concept, great place for an anniversary or an important date.",L'Appart
585,"Every time I stop in New York I make it a point to stop by Tony's  Di Napoli the food is always on point and the customer service is exceptional, I recently took my niece here and she has an allergic to cheese which I did not mention to tell our server because I did not think her food had cheese in it ( spaghetti with meatballs) when the food was brought table the server asked if we wanted cheese on top and I mention that my niece was allergic and the server did not hesitate you remove the spaghetti because she said that the sauce was made with cheese of some sort, they moved really quick bought back spaghetti that she was able to eat which she loved and still talks about.  I definitely plan to go back and plan to bring some new faces again when I'm in town.",Service was greatThey honored our reservation in a crowed pre theatre nighgBut food was really just fair. We even returned one dish. Linguini with clams and they gave us another dish spigot bolognese but the pasta was again way too cooked and over doneService 4-5Food tonight 2 but it was expensive,"I wish I could have reviewed the food. But never got past the reception desk! We had a 5:30 pm reservation for 2, after 10 minutes they told us it it wouldn't be longer than 5 minutes, after another 10 minutes they said it was going to be another ""few"" minutes. We finally gave up. Very unprofessional Tony!","This is one of my go to places. Every time I eat here the food is great, the service is excellent and I leave fully satisfied. I've had several things of the menu which have all been tasty. The salads are hearty with lots of veggies and toppings (it's not just a bowl of lettuce). The pasta is always cooked perfectly and the sauces are flavorful. Everything is family style but they do have an a la carte menu if you ask. You must get the red sangria pitcher! You will not regret it! Great find in the dreaded Times Square area. Highly recommended!","Had a reservation for 6, didn't get there till about 6:20, and they were nice to hold the reservation!! We called of course. It's a large restaurant, with dining available Downstairs. The restrooms are down stairs. I find it odd that a restaurant of that size has such a small bathroom. The place was so busy, and the service was good! We started w a pitcher of red sangria. Then we had Caesar salad, which, I didn't find to be so great. Too dry, and all green! I like more of the white part of the romaine.  Then we had fried calamari, and rigatoni ala vodka, w mushrooms! It was very good. And plenty.I would return, maybe with a larger group, so many good things on the menu.","Come hungry because I can promise you one thing... you will leave feeling like you're going to bust out of your shirt!!When you walk in you are overwhelmed with how crowded this place is. But you will most likely get a table within the first 10 minutes somehow. This family sharing style Italian is perfect for large groups. I'd say the chicken parmigiana is one of the best I have had. Also had a chance to also try the meatballs, ravioli, spaghetti. The flavor in the spaghetti sauce had to be one of the most flavorful homemade sauces I've ever experienced. What is more impressive than the food is how fast the food comes out. As soon as you sit down you are greeted with bread and butter. Shortly after you place your order it; your order appears quicker than you can imagine.I would highly recommend this place is you're looking for great Italian restaurant with a group. If you plan on coming alone, good luck as you wheel need someone to roll you out of the place.",Tony's Di Napoli
586,Meh. Moved from South Florida...this is not even close to a good arepa. I don't even know if I would call this place an arepa place because of how they are made. Their arepas are very tough and instead of using 2 they slice one and try to make it work. Drinks were straight juice - couldn't taste any liquor. We went on a Tuesday around 7 o'clock and the bar area was starting to get crowded. Happy hour isn't really happy hour - drinks are still at least $8 a piece.,"Not the best arepas, but not the worst, pretty standard. The sangria was also pretty basic. It gets pretty loud in there so I definitely wouldn't try to have an intimate dinner. The customer service was decent.","After 2 hours waiting for our food, we got arepas that are barely stuffed that for the price it's kinda a scam. The pabellon plate it's so small for the price also. The passion fruit juice was acid no that sweet. Not happy at all.","Super cute place with a lovely back area, highly highly recommend sitting back here. We just popped in for a quick bite and had one of the Arepas and a drink. We ended up becoming immediate friends with the table across from us and sat down together with our new Israeli friends for our meal. The arepa was delicious and the drink very solid. More than anything, the staff was so lovely and accommodating. We weren't really hungry or looking to get anything but they were so inviting that we ended up from the outside looking in at the menu all the way to the back enjoying a meal. They also deliver which is huge. Much respect @Caracas. One love","I've never been to the brick and mortar in person, but I've ordered takeout.   Though not cheap, most run about $12, arepas here are delicious. Awesome $9 cocada drink if you like coconut, milk, and cinnamon.  This might even be my favorite item on their entire menu! Arepas here are tasty.  Vegetarians rejoice, for many tasty vegetarian arepa options and modifications abound.  I ordered delivery via their website.  Purchased 3 arepas and 1 cocada drink.  Arepas: La Surena $10.50; Los Muchachos $10.00; La Mulata $10.00.  After taxes, mandatory delivery charge, and tip, these four items cost almost $60.   Quite a pretty penny for something that's supposed to be simple Venezuelan street food.  La Mulata is a great vegetarian choice, and tastes even better if you choose to add their tangy zippy yellow sauce.The food here is fantastic, but I'm docking a star for the hefty $3.75 mandatory delivery fee.  It took 40 minutes for my food to arrive.  If you live nearby, or only have a small order, it's more worthwhile to pick up.  In any event, eat good food... eat Caracas!","My older brother likes to go to the same places, over and over and over. I on the other hand, detest routine and can become easily bored with monotony. That's why NY is the best place for me. There are a million options for anything your heart desires. When my older brother suggested the same restaurants that we've eaten at for years, I had to think quickly. It came to me, by some miracle, Caracas! Arepas! Something about that Venezuelan hot pocket makes me so happy. They even have vegan options now.  I enjoy the black bean, plantains, cheese and jalapeño one but have to add the extra avocado. When I arrived there was a man at the bar eating the best looking chicken soup. It looked colorful, fresh and delicious. My older brother couldn't resist ordering this hot soup during a hot day. Thank goodness there is air conditioning. Caracas is a fave of mine for the quality in food, atmosphere and well made drinks. My brother and his friend were raving about their experience for hours. I think they will become new regulars.I feel like this place is kinda hard to spot in grand but worth the visit. It's large on the inside but it gets full. If you are planing on coming during the weekend then I would come early or plan in advance.",Caracas Arepa Bar
587,"I'm new to the neighborhood after 5 years on the UES.  After a day of unpacking the apartment, my boyfriend and I were looking for a quiet place on our new block to have a drink and chat. Found the bar staff to be very condescending and rude.  Things started off with informing my boyfriend, who happens to be a bartender at a high end cocktail bar, how their happy hour works simply because he was surveying their top shelf while he was waiting for me to pick something off of the menu.  We were then largely ignored.  Even though the bar was pretty empty, it felt like we were a nuisance.Im giving it two stars because the food looked incredible - but I won't be going back anytime soon.","Average brunch here. Thought the French Toast portion was really small, overpriced, and nothing special. Don't plan on returning.","Overall we had a lovely experience at Lokal. There were some small issues with one of the waiters who served us today. While one of our waiters was clear, competent, efficient and friendly, the other was less clear, said things confidently but was wrong, and made some small ordering errors. eg I asked if a certain dish had egg allergen present, explaining that a child in our party has an allergy. He confidently said oh no no, of course not. I asked about another dish, and another, same answer. It dawned on me that he doesn't understand allergens, and is simply answering that there is no visible egg in this dish. I ask him to go and check with the chef, I was unsurprised when he returned with the answer that these dishes did, in fact, have egg. The second example is that I asked for my side salad with no dressing, he seemed to get confused by my complicated order (burger with a side salad with no dressing and a side of fries to share with the table). Again, unsurprisingly, my salad was drenched in dressing. I simply don't like dressing, so this was annoying but not deal breaking. But I do so hate wasting food, and it looked like a good salad ... if not for the coating of dressing and salt :/","Both of my visits here have been great. Nice atmosphere. Good Bombay and tonic from the bar. Ordered falafel, mezze platter, salad and caviar dip.  All were excellent.","Both of my visits here have been great. Nice atmosphere.

I ate here with a few friends a few weeks ago and really enjoyed the food. They had a ton of df options so I ordered a lot of small bites to sample. We shared the dip sampler ($22) among four people. We picked all the vegan dips, with the eggplant being one of my favorites. One mistake we all made was eating too much dip / bread early on in our dinner. By the time the main courses came, I was already pretty full. Unfortunately, their hummus is not dairy free so I didn't get to try it - although, I have heard good things about it! For the main course, I ordered the avocado tomato salad with a side of falafel. This was way too much food, but the restaurant was pretty good about packing up my order to go.",Lokal 83 Mediterranean Kitchen
588,"Stopped by on a Monday night. Ordered ramen, and fried chicken, and a Sapporo draft beer. To be honest, the taste is pretty good! However, there several reasons that it's only three stars: 1) the ramen is over price. Even though on the menu it said there are several topping included, when you actually see the ramen you will realize the amount is small. 2) service is not very professional. I am not happy that a quarter of my beer is just foam. 3) NO AC!","Overall, not a bad bowl of ramen, but something was missing in the broth...it felt a little bland.",Ordered on seamless. The ramen and oyakodon were good but the fried tofu was disgusting and reeked of peanuts and was discolored. The Onigiri rice ball was pathetic with tiny flakes of salmon in it. It was just basically a ball of white rice with seaweed wrap. Wont be ordering from here again.,"First time having this place and it was amazing!It was like 66 degrees but I want ramen, I know y'all. LolBUT, I wanted spicy so I got the Lunch A: SakuraJima with 2 toppings for the special. I got an egg and kimchi. The egg was soft boiled which I forgot meant it was still boiled just runny in the middle. Yummy still.I LOVED the packaging! The broth separate from the noodles and toppings. Everything was pretty cold once it got to me, but I had a microwave and it's broth so who's really complaining? Also ordered a pork bun. YAALLLLL! So SOFT and the pork literally melted in my mouth. Didn't get to chew. Spicy mayo and cucumber was the perfect ratio and it was an amazing snack to munch on while slurping my ramen. Delivery man woke up the baby I was nannying for when I specifically asked not to buzz and to call, BUT, the food made up for that...a little. $30 lunch but I ate it ALL and enjoyed every second. I'll be back.","This is probably one of my favorite ramen place to go to in downtown Brooklyn. I have to compliment their interiors because when you first walk in, it feels like you went to Japan for food. The staff were very polite and the service was very quick. We ordered an house salad with 3 choice of dressings which are yuzu, spicy, and seasame. We picked the yuzu dressing with our house salad. Then we got our ramens. We ordered the Kagoshima ramen and ibusuki ramen. All the food came pretty quickly. It took about probably 20 minutes to arrive so the service was fast and quick. One thing I like about this place was their house salad with their yuzu dressing. I have to give all 5 stars for this salad. All ingredients were fresh and it had a good amount of portion to share with someone else or you can eat it yourself. I think one ingredient that made this salad so good was the yuzu dressing. It pulled out all the flavors in the salad. There is a bit of tangy, sweet, and sour flavor which made it delicious. Definitely coming back for this salad again. Next is the ramen. Both ramen had their good portion serving but it was a bit salty for both ramens. The broth was a bit salty but the chau sau wasn't too fat and it was very juicy and flavorful. The ramen has a chewy texture which makes the noodles not too hard to chew. But everything was good other than the salty broth. I would definitely come back for their house salad because it was delicious. If you are a absolute ramen fan like me, definitely give this place a try!!!!","Menya Jiro's claim to fame is that they competed and won in a number of ramen contests a couple of years in a row. Their most popular tonkotsu broth is punched up with the addition of chicken broth, so I imagine it's a deeply satisfying meal in the winter. Since I don't consume pork I can't speak to the main event at most ramen restaurants, and my experience with vegetarian ramen is that the veg bowls are often added as an afterthought. Umami is difficult to create with meatless broths so it's really impressive when they can achieve a nuanced vegetarian broth. Menya Jiro's vegetarian ramen was decent, but my friends were wow'd by their tonkotsu ramen.What I can speak to is the takoyaki, which was very good. They held up well and had a perfectly crisp exterior and flavorful interior.  A great option if you're in the area.",Menya Jiro- Brooklyn
589,"I've only ordered delivery/take-out. The food is decent (the naan is particularly good!) but I'm not sure if this place is particularly worthy of any elevated praise. One thing I found particularly strange (not necessary a bad thing, just surprising) was that they don't accept take-out orders over the phone. Only via GrubHub/YelpEats or Delivery.com. When we arrived to pick up our order, no one greeted or acknowledged us (including the bartender and wait staff that looked right at us when we walked in). Then the waiter(?) who finally helped us was a bit unpleasant. It seemed like take-out orders were beneath them and if we weren't going to dine-in and have a cocktail, then we shouldn't bother at all. Plus, when we got home, we realized that they messed up our order. My paneer makhani was chicken makhani. I eat chicken so it wasn't a big deal but - you know when you have a craving and that happens, it's disappointing. The area has no shortage of good Indian food so I don't need mine with a side of unmerited pretentiousness.","Absolutely overrated place where the staff is getting ruder and ruder. The food is decent to pretty good and I have to hand it to the bar staff for amazing cocktails but omg the wait staff..This last visit we ordered done appetizers and asked if she could give us a couple minutes on the main courses, mind you this is after 5-7 minutes of sitting down. We were told ""no we don't operate like that you have to choose now"". And then this pretentious person just stood there staring at us while we tried to speed read the menu. One our food arrived which was meh, she was no longer to be seen to refresh drinks even when we were frantically trying to wave someone down. She literally looked straight at us and didn't respond.Another time we were seated and then told to get up mid meal to move to a different part of the restaurant because a bigger party has come in.I will not be going back, okay food, great hours, shitty staff that destroys the whole experience.","Downgrading for just abysmally awful service tonight.  Our server was incredibly rude and unprofessional.1. We were seated and waited over 15 minutes before she came over2. After ordering, it took over 25 minutes to get our food3. Water was never refilled4. When we finally got the check, she rolled her eyes when 2 of us tried to pay stating ""I don't give a damn who pays.""This is completely unacceptable and the ONLY saving grace was the lamb biryani.  The potato pancakesand fried okra were very meh.","We had a wonderful time at the Drunken Munkey yesterday. This quaint, cozy and proudly Indian joint had amazing cocktails, a surprising balance of spice in their food and curated a mood that made me feel at home in New York. The bartender was friendly and the owners whom we met late at night before closing were heartwarming. Highly recommended!","Vibes/Ambiance - the place was smaller than I expected, make sure you have reservations beforehand it became packed quickly!

I'm a very specific with what I like when it comes to Indian or Pakistani food. Was not expecting to be blown away but I sincerely was. We ordered the mango salad and crispy okra as appetizers. The mango salad was delicious but the okra was even better! We also ordered the dahi puri, omg they were amazing. Usually the puris at certain places are stale but there's was very fresh. We ordered the chicken biryani, it was on point as was the raita and naan. All very fresh, came out piping hot.","I came with a party of eight people on a Sunday night.Food:I got the braised short ribs ($29) and mango lassi ($5).

Are you kidding me?Sweatshop by definition via Wikipedia A factory or workshop, where manual workers are employed at very low wages for long hours in poor conditions.",Simple but bursts of flavor for your taste buds. That avocado toast was a protein punch .,I stopped by Sweatshop for a quick snack. I ordered the acai bowl and thought that it wasn't anything remarkable. The place was on the pricier side in general. The acai bowl was small for its price. The flavor was typical of any acai bowl. The home-made granola was a little overly sweet and hard.,"I love love loooooooooooove this place. I joked with my friend about moving upstairs so I could walk down each morning and start my day there. Except I wasn't totally joking.My friend and I both got the Brekkie Bun, and we were both extremely satisfied. I slowed down my eating because I didn't want it to end. The bread is a perfectly my preferred amount of crisp but softness, the bacon was amazing, etc., I have nothing bad to say about it. Coffee didn't blow me away but was good!Interior is also super cute and staff was very nice.I'll be taking my parents here their first trip to New York. That's how you know how much I like it!","I heard a lot of hype about this place. I had their latte and an açai bowl. The total with tip came to about $20.The latte was pretty good and was average in pricing. It didn't have any distinct notes to the coffee, it was just a solid drink. The açai bowl was also good. It has cacao nibs which were my favourite part. The smoothie itself was just ok. The chia seeds hadn't been soaked, so they were hard when you bit into them. This place lost a star for me because they didn't really have AC going on a 95 degree day. So, sweatshop was a fitting name in this case. Also, there was a lady in the cafe who had her bare feet on the bench. There were also not many seats as it was a small cafe.","I heard about this place online while trying to find a bite for breakfast in Williamsburg. Stopped in on a Saturday morning around 9:30 and the place was fairly packed. We opted for drip coffee and avo toast. Up on my millennial bs game.The wait was minimal and we snagged a table near the front counter, albeit the table was pretty dirty. The coffee was available immediately in small mugs and we were told the refills cost, I don't remember how much. Okay. The toasts came out shortly after. Don't get me wrong, the toast is huge and tasty. Some of my avocado chunks were browned but there was enough that I could knock some of the chunks off. Honestly, I would have paid half the price to have less avocado tbh. To add bacon and and egg would add, like, four bucks. Half the staff were nice half were annoyed the place was crowded.All in all, it was fine, but I found this place pretty typical-pretentious-Brooklyn and I wouldn't be back to eat unless I wanted to spend over 30 bucks on breakfast for two... which I don't, especially in a cafe grabbing a quick bite.",Sweatshop
591,"I had lunch here with a friend in April and was so amazed by the duck breast dish I had there that I wanted to write this review 4 months later.

However, this meal was a start to finish disappointment. We ordered the carbonara and fettuccine with lamb ragout. Both pasta dishes were barely warm, as if they had been prepared and were just sitting out for some extended period of time. Carbonara was mediocre and the fettuccine was very bland. Our waiter was inattentive - we were not offered cheese or pepper with our pasta, and he never came to check to see how our food was (we would have told him it was cold/bland). The restaurant was not that busy, so the lack of considerate service was disappointing.Will not be returning here, as there are so many better Italian restaurants in this neighborhood with proven quality food and service.","We had dinner outside - should have stayed inside as traffic was noisy and it was getting chilly. Our waiter was very attentive, though we worried if he had our order correct as he had trouble hearing us over the traffic! We had the Involtini di Melanzane (grilled eggplant rolls) and the Carpaccio di Polpo for appetizers. They were okay (though the Carpaccio di Polpo from Norma's we had earlier in the week was much better). Our entrees were Lasagna with Broccoli and Italian Sausage, Ricotta and Spinach Ravioli, Chickpea Gnocchi with Roquefort, and the Black Linguine. All were good, just nothing outstanding.","Came back to Angeletto again , may be the forth time in the last few months. The service was again warm and welcoming, spacious and not noisy perfect for business conversation or date. Elis was serving our table again and made our dining experience very pleasant. My guests loved the bone in veal, and I took Elis's recommendation of the branzino (sea salt crusted) which was more than phenomenal. The crust was lit and fish deboned tableside , just wonderful!The sides (broccoli rabe and Brussel sprouts) were also cooked perfectly to our request , not oily / salty / burned which tends to happen with most steakhouses. Will be back soon!","I wish I had discovered Angeletto sooner.

Upon arrival we were greeted with coats checked and seated right away.Elis , our waiter was courteous and recommend us some of the best items , both on the menu and special creation by the chef. The bone in veal was phenomenal, cooked to perfection at medium and dover sole was also delicious. Food was excellent and so was the service , I will be visiting again soon!","Average food, and the service--while not bad--has room for improvement.I came here on a Friday at 7pm, had a reservation. Sadly, I entered with my date and there was no hostess to seat us. The waiters did their best and seated us.The table for two was a touch smallish but the chairs are comfortable. The servers are attentive and waited for a good moment to slide into my conversation with my date to ask for our orders. They also refilled our glasses of water.I ordered the carbonara and the pasta was a tad chewy, slightly undercooked. I've made better carbonara at home, to be honest. The portions are just about right, but I felt the price was a touch higher than they should've been. The ambiance is quite nice. It wasn't as quiet as I would've liked for a date, but it was by no means too noisy.The waiter seemed to be quick to take our check though. He took the folder even though I hadn't stuck my credit card into it (it'd be visibly sticking out), and he seemed to come back quite quickly to retrieve it, before I had signed it. Not a big deal, but it would've been nice if they'd read the situation and noticed that I was trying to have a nice conversation with my date and not feel rushed out of there.On the upside, they did serve us limoncello at the end of our meal!",Angeletto Restaurant

Smallish portions.",Came here with the family on a Saturday.  It wasn't too busy when we got there but within an hr the place was full to capacity. I order a chicken pad thai which was sooooo salty.  It was so salty that I couldn't finish it. And I hate to send food back so I boxed it and ate it the next morning lol. (Also don't like wasting food lol). Someone from my party got really sick from a mushroom dish. She believes the mushrooms wasn't fully cooked. Poor thang vomited thru out the whole car ride from long island city to Brooklyn.,Came here with a friend for lunch. I was really glad to see that they had lunch specials. I feel like for a thai restaurant it almost has to be standard these days. Anyway I had the pad see ewe and the roti canai. Both were above average and the price was right. I'd definitely want to come back one day but the one annoying thing was that parking was a big pain in this area.,"This place is probably my favorite in town. Every time I happen to stop by in Vernon Blvd, I think of this place. I've come to this place more than 5 times . My favorite in this place is pad se ew , fried rice, and thai iced tea.      Everything was on point as usual , I love their pad see ew and salmon lemongrass. But, soup and pad thai was mediocre this time which can be better though:)        I'll be back again.",This is one of my favorite places in the area. I've been back a few times now and I've ordered delivery from here a few times.(order from their website directly instead of one of the apps and avoid delivery fees)I've had the pad thai and the tom yum and I really liked them but my personal favorite is the kai ra-berd. So simple but its amazing and its my go to whenever I come here,"Steady 3 out of 5Great service, interesting decor, the place is neat, clean and spacious, we had plenty of room. It wasn't busy on Friday night so we didn't have to wait for a table.But food was not so great. And on a pricey side if food vs. price is concerned. Very americanized Thai cuisine, definitely not a place if you are looking for a closer to authentic experience.Be mindful that 20% tip added to parties of 6 & more.Description of what we had and prices - in pictures.Wouldn't come back.",Tuk Tuk
593,"Not sure if it's this branch's location or that's just how they roll, but I literally got my noodles minutes after I order even though there was people who order before me. (Definitely less than 10) And this was during lunch hours around 1:30 pm.I got the little hot pot noodles and my total was $8.70. It had glass noodles, shanghai bok choy, bits of bean curd and black fungus. Soup was not overly salty and overall, it was a decent noodle soup if you don't want the spicier noodle dishes. The only con was it only filled me up temporarily before I got hungry soon after, probably due to lack of toppings in noodle dish.There's limited seating in the front and back of the room. It was a good first time experience.","This is a no frills noodle house. You pay, get your food and they expect for your to put away your garbage and dishes afterwards. As I was eating my food, I saw a group who are tourist leave their dishes behind and the staff was not impressed. However, the area where you are suppose to put away your food is not clear. My issue is they will not provide tap water. You need to buy bottle water instead or bring your own. The food was ok. I have had better food and better service.","Expensive street style food. You have pay extra for protein to feel full.No regular drinking water provided in the store, forcing us to buy their drinks. They use so much plastic...very eco unfriendly. Will never be back.",I'd take a picture but already ate all of it.Take out from this place about 10 min away. Still fresh and hot when I settled down to start eating. Everything was securely placed in containers made it easy for the walk.Ordered the Bao Bao Noodle medium spicy and dipping buns.  Best noodles ever!,"I'd been to the Gramercy location before, so when I was in FiDi, I knew it would be worth stopping in.I got the N1 (their signature Bao Bao Noodles). Got it to go, and they separated the soup from the noodles/meat, which was nice. So good, so spicy, so delicious. Reasonably priced at $9 too.There's a ton of seating in the back as well as the front, so a pretty good lunch option in the area!","Staying next door at the Fairfield Inn for work on a rainy day and needing a quick lunch led me to Bao Bao Cafe. Now I'll probably make special trips to the FiDi to eat here! Had the Bao Bao Noodles (medium) and an order of dipping buns. Noodles had the perfect mix of noodles, meat, and veggies. The broth was definitely spicy, but didn't knock me out. But the dipping buns! I'm going to dream about them. Delicious little fried puffs with condensed milk poured over top. Crunchy and a great balance to the spicy broth. Ordered at the counter and took my food to go. It was all packaged nicely in sturdy containers with a little roll of chopsticks, spoon, and napkin.  Go if you're a noodle fan or want to become one. You won't be disappointed.",Bao Bao Cafe
594,Waitress got us strawberry short cake instead of Tiramisu and insisted the short cake was a Tiramisu (when it clearly wasn't)...and later confirmed it actually was a short cake. Did not even adjust the check accordingly. Definitely gone down over the past few months...so disappointed because it used to be my go to spot.,"Didn't love this place. Writing this review because I had high hopes for this one given the high rating but was disappointed with the experience. I guess I would describe it as bland (food & atmosphere). We came in on a Friday night. When all of the restaurants around this one were packed with customers sitting outside enjoying the weather this one only had 4 tables outside (not available at the moment) and the inside was huge, dark and empty - not super cozy and inviting like a lot of NYC restaurants with character. We ordered the prefix menu which was actually a really good deal. For $38 we got chilled pea soup (really lacking flavor, regretted this one wish we ordered the tartare) and the ricotta (nice presentation, maybe could have used more honey? have had better) as appetizers, followed by a steak for each of us (pretty good! just came out a little cold), and two deserts - chocolate cake (have had way better) and the cheesecake (also not a fan). The summary? A ton of food but not that unique/tasty.Service wasn't the best which added to the experience. Waiter didn't know how to answer some of the basic questions we were asking about the food/drinks, ignored our directions (can we have an extra bowl for the soup? don't pack the ice cream in the desert to go box because it will melt) and was a bit awkward.Won't be coming back to this one. Experience was not at the NYC level that I was expecting given the rating. Just average and a little dull.",Poor service. Poor quality. Overpriced. No one who worked at this place could answer questions about what was in the food. Big problem since the person I was with has severe allergies. What staff did share about what dishes come with was inaccurate. Drinks were brought to the table only 3/4s full. Slow service. Way better options in the neighborhood. Do not recommend.,"Everything was on point. I have been eating through Manhattan recently and I have to say that this place stood out. The food was great. Grilled Branzino- definitely in my top 10 list of branzinos. The one I got looked a bit different from the pictures posted on the Yelp page, but maybe the ingredients or presentation changed a little. Mine didn't seem to have the green sauce in the pictures. However, it was still divine. The skin was just perfectly crispy while the inside was soft and not too fatty. The vegetables underneath the fish were refreshing and did not distract from the star of the show, the fish itself. Although it was not a whole fish and it was only one slice, I still felt satisfied. The inside looks really big actually with plenty of seating. They also had seating outside but unfortunately there weren't any tables open for that part at the time we came by. The service was wonderful. Very attentive and cordial. I would definitely come back for the Branzino. Maybe I'll also try other dishes as well.","This review is only for the lunch special, which was BOMB!For $22 (I believe), you get an entree and a dip! Let me tell you though, this place does not skimp on the portion size for this deal either! The dip alone was enough for three people (but it was so good that I may have eaten it all myself). I got the honey ricotta dip and OMG! Best dip of my life! Wow that was amazing and the crusty bread is perfect with it. You NEED to get this if you go! I also had the veggie burger which was super fresh and light. (I'm not a vegetarian at all but I really liked this). The best part was that nothing sat heavy; after all of this food I still felt ready to take on the day. Overall, this place is great and I would highly recommend!!!","This gem is tucked away in the lobby (and off street) from the Hyatt Union Square. Their food is delish. I've tried them several times across breakfast, lunch and dinner. Every time the flavors are wonderful and the freshness is top. Try the Brussel sprouts and the burrata if you stop in for a drink. Both top notch. For breakfast they have some great options including a ricotta toast and also some great dishes with fresh avocado - yum. They do have a happy hour with specials on apps like hummus, shisito peppers, marinated olives and $6 wines and other drinks. It's a go-to for me in the area for a trusted food experience.",Bowery Road
595,"Made reservation for 8 two weeks in advance but  friends had to cancelled last minute due to emergency. Four of us (one of us heavily pregnant) showed up on time and the staff stated company policy and refused to seat us. While explaining the emergency, the staff repeated the same statement to us, looked in the eye of my 8-month pregnant friend and suggested us to join the yelp wait list (which we did, for shits and giggles, placed us with a table at 10pm, 3 hours after our original reservation)  In hindsight, we should have just found other random person in line waiting, complete our 8-person party and be seated for our reservation. But the restaurant is petty for not sitting us. They felt their popularity now give them the right to enforce so-called policy to their guests, without giving any flexibility. We will see in 6 months in this brutal Chinese restaurant scene of NYC.","This place offers some authentic Chengdu hot pot experiences. Tripe, tendon, intestines, esophagus, blood... and many meat options of course. A little disappointed that they don't have many options for green vegetables (spinach isn't on the menu).","It's an okay sorta establishment. Lots of little issues that leads to a bland experience. Ironic since it's a spicy hot pot place. The seating process is an online scan code that puts you on a waitlist. The timing still seems to be off since I was told one time and was called back at another. Not the biggest issue but hard to plan around. The tables look fancy but it's not comfy seating for average to tall individuals. I couldn't bend my knee 90 degrees with these tables. The entire time I sat with my legs to the side of the table or I had to bend my ankles a lot. It just wasn't comfy and I'm by no means a tall person.  The establishment was new and clean overall. Ventilation seems to work well as the steam didn't linger around. The portions you get are on the small end for the price you pay for. I guess you would come here if you want their soup base or miss going to one in China. I was surprised to find a plastic sauce packet in the soup before we added the food. I guess whoever was making our pot dropped the plastic tube in.  The meat wasn't bad but had to order a second round to get full. They had a unique item that seems to be a fusion twist with the typical fish tofu. They fill it with cheese and it's mixed in there. The taste and sensation is a cross from American grill cheese and Chinese fish ball. It's a bit gross for my taste buds. I wouldn't recommend it as it was the worst of both worlds smushed together. If you like it, all the more power to you, but I will have to put a hard pass on this item. Again it's not bad aside from all these little quirks, but I really don't see why I would come here versus the other hot pot locations in Chinatown.","Food: I would give 5/5.  The freshness of the food and the taste of the broth are super delicious and authentic.Price: they are expensive based on the portion of the dish. Service:  the waiters need more training. Because there is no one comes to collect or change my dirty plates. The attitude of some staffs are very rude.... ok we tip them...We costs ~$180 before tips for 2 people.   We only order one plate of meal.  I give 4 stars because they do taste good it worth the money.   But, I think the portion is wayyy too small","When we were seated nothing was given to us. The menu is on the side of the table and I didn't know. I was waiting for someone to give me a menu to look at. I looked around and then noticed the menu with things to check off. Ehh... Ive been to multiple hotpot places and this place is just okay. They charge 2.99 for sauce per person. That's insane. First time I've been to a hotpot restaurant that did that. Luckily for me, I save that amt because I normally like my food just by itself. But it is pretty pricey for the food. The meat is pretty tender though. I wished they had more soup options. The service here is just okay too. They helped explain what was in the veggy platter. My mom complained the spicy soup base is too oily. When she dips any of the food in and pull it out, it's coated with spicy oil. Top layer of soup is coated with spicy oil and we even scooped some out but didn't make any difference. It's okay but the price...maybe I won't be coming back for some time. ‍","I came here with my boyfriend and we got a 2 flavor pot. One side was the traditional malatang, and the other side was the pork bone broth. We ordered beef tendon, spicy pork ribs, crown daisies, cabbage, king oyster mushrooms, kung fu tripe, marbling beef, and shrimp. All of the veggies are very fresh. Unfortunately, the beef was frozen, which alters the cooking time. We had a couple pieces which were either still frozen inside, or beyond overcooked. The shrimp and beef tendon were the highlights of the meal. The shrimp were so sweet and the beef tendon was delicious.The service is attentive and the space is nice and bright. I would recommend coming here with smaller groups for an intimate experience!",Dalongyi Hot Pot
596,:( ordered the poke bowl and it was probably one of the worst I've ever had. It was incredibly bland with stale toppings.,"Service: 5 stars Food: 3 starsOverall: 4 starsI came on a Thursday afternoon. They were not super busy but the girl working at the front desk was super sweet and nice. She saw me struggling with my baby in the stroller getting into the restaurant. She came out and helped me with it without asking. I've been to a lot of restaurants in the area and most of the people working at the restaurants just pretend that they don't see me in the same situation. While I was waiting for my food, I was listening to her interact with the chef and customers on the phone, she was very sweet and thorough at taking orders. She would explain the menu and repeat the order. Once I got my take out, she assisted me with the door to get my stroller out.",I would give negative stars if I could. Ordered a salmon bowl and it was a disaster. Rice was cooked like glue paste and it's entirely inedible. Used to be overpriced but okay. Worse and worse every time I order. DO NOT ORDER.,"So I go here a lot. So close to my 10 stars from their rewards program! I've tried a good amount of items here, and nothing disappoints. I'm a huge fan of both poke and bento boxes! Their poke is generous in size. You can choose white/brown rice, quinoa, or salad as your base (though it is extra to half and half bases). The fish is always tasty and fresh. My favorite is the ahi tuna, sooo full of flavor. They really pile the toppings and I love them for that!!The bento boxes are delicious too! I love the Hamburg curry. The hamburger patty is really juicy and the curry sauce has a good amount of flavor. But my absolute favorite is the short rib bento... YUM. No bone, just the meat is sooo tender omg. And soft stewed carrots are my weakness. Cooked together in the slightly sweet, rich stew... Yum. I love the egg salad side too. It has a slight hint of truffle that really makes it interesting. I wish they put more to be honest lol.The space is cozy. Expect to share seating at the one large table, or the two-seater bar or two-seater table.","Super fresh, fast, & affordable. The 3 key necessities of today's lunch. I'd avoid the modifications on delivery orders though. I paid extra for more seaweed, (my only modification) as I get a salad base and prefer a bit more density than lettuce. Was disappointed to receive less the normal amount of seaweed that comes on average bowls. However, you win some some you lose some, and quite frankly the food was so fresh, fast & even with the extra add affordable.So go for it! Will definitely be a staple in my future.(Minus any modifications to skillfully manage expectations.) ‍","I ordered through Seamless for pickup yesterday and I clicked order by mistake when I wasn't done so I had to make a second order for L since it was so hot outside and I was carrying heavy items. Anyway I ordered spicy salmon for both bowls by mistake again...since I get so lil sleep. Food was good. I haven't been here in quite some time. Whomever is working there is always so nice, we were able to dine in even though we ordered online. I ordered a Lychee fruit tea for L, he loved it; it was sweet. I like anything with Lychee. I only had a couple of bites and it filled me up, I usually don't eat much in the afternoon.  Fish was fresh, gave us the energy to keep moving in the heat! There's tap water in the fridge if you need it, but I had my own.",Simple NYC
597,"The food was average... I ordered fish tacos and it was nothing special for the price and the kale salad was just kale, croutons and dressing.  The service was terrible the waiter was no where to be found and I had to get up multiple times to grab what I wanted. When I tried to get his attention he would just walk right passed my table.  The place wasn't even busy, if it was busy I would understand but there were maybe 3 or 4 customers seated outside at the time. It was still very daylight out before the dinner rush.",love this place! need to write a more in depth review soon but it's temporarily closed due to a fire,Walking around the neighborhood and stumbled upon drag brunch... nuff said... here I am!,"This was my third visit to Forrest Point, the first two visits having been when I first moved to NY about 2 year ago. I had enjoyed dining here in the past (I remembered enjoying the tuna tartar tacos and the jalapeño Mac n cheese burger) so wanted to come back and bring a friend for dinner in their outdoor garden. I had made a reservation for a Friday night but the restaurant wasn't too busy and we got seated immediately outdoors. The ambience was perfect and the garden wasn't too loud so it was perfect to chat and catch up with my friend. For drinks we ordered the Purple Rain cocktail and a beer. We started with the Tuna Tartar Tacos, which I had remembered from a previous visit and had seen pop up in many yelp reviews. We were a bit underwhelmed. The tuna was tasty and fresh, but overall the tacos seemed to be lacking something to compliment the tuna and guac, and the shell was a bit oily and overpowering. For entrees my friend ordered the Breakfast Burrito and I ordered he King Louis Burger. The burger was well cooked and the ingredients were flavorful. Overall the food was good, not great, but the ambiance made up for it and we had an enjoyable dinner","I sat at the bar, bypassing all the posh outdoor seating, so I can only speak to the interior. It's a little dive-y, and the menu has some really good deals, if you know what to look for. (Hint: Look for the beer+shot combos.) My friend and I each did a whiskey+Narrangansett ($7), slamming back the shot then steady sipping the beer. I got great vibes from the laidback bar staff, and the people eating lunch around us seemed to be enjoying their food. It's the kind of place where no one looks twice at you, and everyone is welcome. Or at least, that's what the whiskey in my blood made me think.Cool spot! If you want a classy, upscale experience, that can be arranged; or, if you want an affordable drink, no questions asked, it'll happen.","Forrest Point is one of the best places I've tried in the area. I've been here on a number of occasions and the second I sit down, I'm already planning on when I'm coming back. The jalapeño Mac n cheese is incredible; the portion is large so it's usually enough for me to share with another person. The fajitas are amazing, though I ordered them from a special menu they were offering at the time (still, check it they're available). They also have amazing s'mores hot coco. The atmosphere is very very chill, especially at night. They put up a small projector and play movies.  I recommend this spot to everyone.",Forrest Point
598,"Tim Ho Wan is a great option in NYC for me and my mom's Chinese stomachs after having so many western food for the entire trip.It's my 1st experience at this very famous dim sum place. The cashew pork rice noodle wrap is my favorite no. 1 dish today. The turnips cake is their famous dish according to my mom. The eggs white spring rolls is also very unique. Sticky rice with chicken is my must order one.The only one thing I must point out is their chicken feet is not the normal ""steam"" one but from the stew sauce. It doesn't look the same from the menu photo they provide. ( I didn't like it so I only ate one)TIPS:Better reserve from Yelp before you leave your house. I almost didn't wait and get a table 2 min. after we arrived.","Horrible experience with the hostess (who seated me). She told me I could not bring my coffee with me while I saw two tables with outside drinks right in front of me. I asked her why, she just ignored my question and insisted she wouldn't seat me with a drink with a temper.The waiter was also very awkward when asking us what we wanted and when trying to advertise their seasonal specials. The dim sums were ok, and the shrimp dumpling and shrimp rice roll were pretty good. However, doesn't feel impressed knowing that their Hong Kong branch is a Michelin guide restaurant and having high expectations.","Finally got to try Tim Ho Wan last Saturday.  My friend and I got there around 1pm and we waited for about an hour (it was not too bad for a Saturday).  You would have to check in with a host/hostess holding an iPad to put down your name, phone number and party size, so they could text you when a table is available.  The only issue is that the person is not necessarily standing in the front, and crowds of people could just walk up to the person without following order.  The hostess allowed 2 people who jumped the queue to put down their information before me while I was waiting patiently. If you prefer not to wait,  you can dine in by standing at the bar area, which is just a bar in the waiting area.  Once you got to a table, they would give you a drink menu and a food menu.  The placemats have pictures of some of their signature dim sum. Food: 1. Roasted pork buns - one of their most famous dishes.  The color of the buns is lighter than the ones I tasted in Hong Kong.  The bread is freaky and the oil from the roasted pork fillings compliments it well.  The texture of the buns reminds me of pineapple buns but of course without the sweetness and crumbs.2. Lettuce with soy sauce - classic Cantonese preparation of lettuce, it preserves the crispness of the lettuce leaves. 3. Steamed ribs with black bean sauce - really bland.  Would not recommend it.4. Steamed chicken over rice with soy sauce - the meat is really smooth and soft.  The rice lacks fragrance.  Overall, the favor is average, not too impressed by this other than the texture of the steamed chicken.5. Pan fried white turnip cake - the cake is really doughy and the white turnip cake does not have too many fillings.  It's lacking flavor.  Would not recommend ordering it. 6. Stuffed eggplants with meat - average, lacking some seasoning. 7. Shrimp dumplings and siu mar (pork dumplings) - the shrimps in the shrimp dumplings do not taste fresh.  And the pork dumplings are average. Overall, I know this is a restaurant that was made famous selling Michelin star awarded dim sum at reasonable prices in Hong Kong.  However, the dim sum at this location is average to say the least.  The dining area is spacious and the seats are comfortable (pro compared to the Hong Kong location).  I probably would not treat this as my first pick when I crave dim sum in New York.","It's a good dim sum place. Very limited selection but has all the key dishes. Taste fresh unlike other dim sum places. Shui mai was very good. Smaller in size than what I'm used to but it's the perfect one biter. The chicken feet is braised and is not like the chicken feet at traditional dim sum places (the red sweet sauce) it is more savory and in the liquid braising broth. There was 3 in my party, exactly an hour wait which was just enough time to put our name in, grab a coffee down the street. The interior is very clean. The bathrooms are clean too(key). Staff is so friendly and efficient. Food comes out quick. Each dish is around $5-7, the most expensive being $6.80. I recommend to try at least once and you'll actually probably come back for more. Also, I believe you can get on the waitlist online through yelp before even getting to the location so you don't have to wait as long on site.","They do not allow call in order . We were trying to call in for some takeout , they told me that we must be in person in order to do take out . We had ordered a lot ~ and the gelatin cake were just water inside.  Everything else taste OK , it's pretty much the only choice around when you live in midtown, and you don't want to go all the way to Chinatown ~ Most of items tasted much better than the one in east village - but still cannot call outstanding dim sum quality ~ They should have improve more on customer service as well as better dim sum since they got one Michelin star in HK ~ or Michelin  should rate them differently in each location !","love that theres a waitlist on yelp for this!! beats wasting your time waiting in front of the restaurant!staff was not mean (at a dim sum restaurant this is a stark contrast to other places hahaha) and as usual THW's shrimp hacao crystal dumplings were piping hot and served soft. The turnip cake wasn't bad.Their congee was surprisingly good and savory! Price is ....inflated as usual but i wouldn't mind to continue coming here; while the selection is more limited i feel the food here is clean and the fact that there is a WAITLIST seals the deal for me.

Extremely poor customer service.PS   Not surprised to find other similar reviews who were discriminated.

Service was attentive but not rushed.  Recommended if you're in the area.","We were charged 20% gratuity for a party of 4 by default, even though there was no mention of this on the menu.The service was quite indifferent as well. Not going again.","Holy smokes, the little neck clam pie might be the new favorite.  Or a close tie with Capizzi's plain.  This is best crust I've experienced that demonstrates true skill and experience.  Thin, evenly/properly kneaded, and durable.  And with the best topping, clams of course!  Garlic too.  Mmm!!!Also my server was top notch (glasses with beard).  Was professional and fast.  Also, the oven cooks a pie in like 1-2 minutes!","Great Italian food in Hells Kitchen, Tavola's cuisine is based on regional Italian fare, mainly Puglian, Roman and Sicilian. The restaurant features two wood-burning ovens specially handcrafted in Naples, one is used for Pizza and the other for meats, fish and vegetables.I have eaten here several times while in the city and have enjoyed it each time. The food is delicious, the service is spot on and the location is away from the madness of times square with it's tourist trap restaurants. If you are looking for a great Italian meal and Neapolitan pizza you cant go wrong here, nice relaxed atmosphere and service.On our last visit we had the Insalata Mista,  organic mesclun, fresh herbs, tomato & cucumbers salad and the Rice Balls Risotto,  1 Veal & 1 Shrimp as starters. For or entree's we ordered the  Orechiette & Esposito's Luganica Sausage Broccoli Rabe & Bread Crumbs and the Rigatoni  Bolognese Wild Boar Veal Meat Sauce.

600,Everything I said before but more amazing!No seriously... from the never never to the last word! Amazeballs!!,"This place is a great cocktail spot. It's unfortunate that it's okay for their staff to undermine women....I took my team to blueprint after a corporate event. A male employee of mine tried to personally pay for a round of drinks and I interjected with the company card. The (I believe) Aussie male bartender thought I was a friend/date when I tried to pay for the bill and refused my card. I tried to explain the situation... He turned to the guy and asked him if he was ok with me paying! I had to argue with him for a good 3 minutes before he accepted my card. Once he finally agreed to re-run the cards, rather than apologize for the confusion, he had the audacity to ask why I had an attitude and  turned to my employee and said ""good luck""! (Still assuming I was a date I presume).He later stated that he was offended when I called out his actions as sexist....Maybe I'm mistaken, but I have not witnessed any man facing these same obstacles when trying to pick up the tab for his team (or even on while trying to pay for a date) #no #equalpayequaltreatment #idontwanttobepaidfor #ijustwantrespect #RBG","Probably the worst cocktails I have tried. We were here celebrating a friend's birthday. Our waiter told us that none of the cocktails, except for one, were that sweet but he was wrong. Every one we tried was cloyingly sweet with no depth of flavor. For a cocktail bar, I expected the mixers to be hand squeezed and of excellent quality, but all I tasted was Tropicana grapefruit juice and mezcal. Nothing worth $13.  By the middle of the night, our group was drinking wine because the cocktails were so bad.","Hung out in Blueprint while waiting for a dinner reservation in the neighborhood. Very very cute antique-feel cocktail bar. Drinks were quality and staff was friendly. I didn't have any of the bites but I would definitely go back to sample the menu - there were even a good amount of vegan options. Loved the vibe, I am glad I stumbled upon this place!","With dim lighting, tapas to share, and bomb cocktails, Blueprint is perfect for date night. The moment we entered, all we saw were couples, so beware if you are thinking of coming here with friends. They also have a cute patio in the back that can be used during the summers - check it out if you come here!The food wasn't mind-blowing, but the drinks were delicious. We got the bourbon based My Dear Julius and gin based Satan's Bell. My Dear Julius has egg white in it and therefore is a tad heavier. I expected Satan's Bell to be your classic gin and passion fruit juice flavored cocktail, but was pleasantly surprised by the red bell pepper juice that unfettered the drink! Satan's Bell was light, sweet and presented well. Kudos to the bartender, who invented it. The food. We came here for dinner, which was supposed to be the main event, but left enjoying the cocktails more. The baby octopus with potatoes was okay but had more potatoes than octopus and wasn't anything to write home about. The roasted Brussel sprouts were a bit disappointing as they completely lacked salt. We dipped the sprouts in the lemon juice of the octopus dish to give them a bit of a kick. As the final dish, we got the Blueprint duck club, which definitely was the largest plate of all. The club sandwich had thinly sliced tasty duck meat. It was the first time I had duck as deli meat. Definitely not your typical date food though. Your hands are a bit of a mess after holding a club sandwich that looks like could belong to a diner.","I've been writing this review for months... lol. I kept bypassing it but last night I stopped in for a drink and dessert and just had to share why I like this spot. Setting: after 7pm the mood to me says date night. The lighting is dim and the tables are set for intimate conversation or you can sit at the bar and flirt with the bartenders...lol.Drinks: the drink the night was called the Doctor is in...if you like a gin cocktail w/ a lil rum and a pretty flower this is the drink for you! My companion had wine, and enjoyed their pinot grigio.Dessert: the bread pudding...OMG! It's my favorite dessert and I like to try it at any new spot I go to. I'm floored there's a spot this close to me with bread pudding that's so good. Final thoughts: I'll be there tomorrow",Blueprint
601,"This was my first time to visit here. Food was okay ,but the thing was that they served me a cup of dirty water. I didn't notice when i get the water and just drank. But the taste was really weird so I asked them. So many small black things were floating. Even I asked to server what was it, but they couldn't explain just said apologized . They had to explain about it properly but i felt like they don't really care. And also i really wanted to order lunch set which is a small bowl and udon but the udon was not available even soba noodle. They didn't mention anything about the unavailable udon and soba, until i ordered them. It would be a lot better if they notice me first before i decided what to order because i wouldn't have any expectation on udon or soba.","This has been in my list for quite a while. This Friday night, with my friend, happened to be at Times Square. So came here without hesitation.[Dishes]Kaisen DonI would mark 3/5 generally. Nothing special. Fish is not in rich kind. Plus there is no fish kind special for this season. Egg roll shouldn't appear in a kaisen don with a price setting like this. And what are these cucumbers for exactly...? This is super amateur. Chicken egg donMy friend ordered this. I didn't give it a try. I think it looks just normal.Beef rollBoth of us are hungry. So besides main dishes, we ordered the beef roll. It's thin beef slices, with scallion rolled inside. There are vegetable salad serve as sides. A little bit greasy for me. [Environment]Slightly hard to find the place of the restaurant. Got very large space inside, but still a little bit crowded. The room between tables is small.[Service]Just average level...They even gave us a wrong dish. What's more we found they add another dish for us when we checked, which is never served. Really not a surprising dinner. Won't visit again probably.","For the price the food is definitely underwhelming. I got the Japanese butter fish and for 26$ the portion was tiny and didn't live up to the taste which I expected to. Plus they charge extra 3$ for the rice, which is outrageous! I ended up being still hungry after my fish set. Ordered a carafe of sake for 26$ which was also quite mediocre. Overall would skip and seek better options for Japanese fish.","Ootoya was recommended by a friend for a very traditional Japanese experience. It's also really popular, so it made its way onto my list of my must tries. WAITThe Bryant Park/Times Square location is as busy as you'd expect anything in this part of town, so definitely take advantage of the yelp waitlist, as they don't take reservations. If you plan ahead, it's not too much of a hassle. AMBIANCEThe whole Ootoya experience is uniquely Japanese. From the service to the interior design, it reminded me of a lot of restaurants I've been to in Tokyo. The servers are super attentive (I dropped a chopstick and it was replaced within 20 seconds). FOODWe went with three dishes to share and a pitcher of Asahi. The Katsu Toji dish was great. Similar to a lot of other katsu donburi dishes minus the rice, but the ingredients were high quality and stayed hot in the sizzling plate it was served in. You can't usually go wrong with something like this because it's so simple, yet good. The Beef Sukiyaki Nabe was probably my favorite dish. The marinade of the beef creates a nice umami flavor that pairs really well with the broth and enoki mushrooms in the dish. The Buta Kimchi Nabe was also really good. The pork belly was thin and had a good fat content  that made for a perfect bite with the tofu over rice. I wish it was a little spicier though. OVERALLGreat Japanese restaurant experience in New York. It's on the pricier end, so expect to spend from $30-50 per person depending on how much you can eat. But there is no tipping, as this is a traditional Japanese restaurant.",Came here before seeing Hamilton. It came highly recommended and I was excited when I saw the line out the door assuming it would be amazing. We came when the restaurant opened at 5:30 so there was no wait.I think the food and service is just okay here. The food is very traditional Japanese which I'm not into to begin with. The portions are tiny and super pricey for what you get. We ordered the homemade tofu and they told us to put soy sauce on it before eating and it ended up being painfully salty which could be user error. We also ordered various items and shared a kaisen don which was again painfully average for the $40 price tag.Would skip.,All Ootoya location as usual provides the same high standard and kids/family friendly environment and menu.With beautiful presentation and flavor it's always a good choice to dine in.,Ootoya Times Square
602,"I used to love coming here but the new food system is ridiculous.  There is a website that you order from, the link is on the chalkboard and you enter the code and then use Apple Pay to purchase.  When I was there I was in the middle of ordering when the site suddenly said they were closed.  They weren't.  I asked the kitchen they said they were open but you have to use site.  2 other people came up with the same issue right then.  We were told the internet must be down and they will work on it while the kitchen staff sat there doing nothing waiting for orders.Really lame","I'm giving this place one star because you have to give some amount of stars. I waited 26 minutes for a simple cheese quesadilla. There's a super douchie security guy who has no life that asks you to move (and TOUCHES YOU WITHOUT ASKING) for no reason other than to maintain employment. Oh, and the quesadilla sucked.","This is a great place if you're looking for a lot of seaworthy east river aesthetic and a lack of common sense. The bar is perfect for a wait, they were very careful with the single bar placement on the only part of the establishment that is floating in the water. The staffs inability to fix the bathrooms which I could have easily fixed myself (I am a plumber) caused a massive, looping line that was not quite conducive to the crowds inability to navigate even a turnstile. There was a quality performance where they moved two canoes through a crowd that could not have possibly been used for anything else other than to enhance the essence of inconvenience.",It's an outdoor seating area and an extended barge that has a separate bar and music. You have to order your food online and when it's done you pick it up from a sealed up kitchen with an open serving window. Seating is a bit tight and ppl leave their trash and spill stuff on the tables but there's a guy who cleans it up. View is beautiful and food/drinks is great which makes up for everything else. Security is there to keep out riff raff and porto potties for the bathroom so if you're a germaphobe just a heads up.,"It's a beautiful GORGEOUS place. The water and set up is amazing. It is a visually pleasant place to visit. But the staff is not friendly at all. You order your food on an app or website. Then you pick it up, the folks that cook the food are almost robotic. They scream your number and that's it. No good day, how are you. And believe me I get it. I worked in customer service all my life, but each interaction is a new interaction. You may be doing the same thing all day. But there are people that actually care about chatting with you and how YOUR day is. As selfish as I know customers can be. So I understand that, but I personally I expect a certain level of communication when I'm visiting a restaurant or bar. So yes it's beautiful, but it killed the mood of my little birthday celebration we were having.","I went here on a sat night.  The good: beautiful views of the water and city, I enjoyed socializing with friends while enjoying the water, sunset, and the moon. The bad: the food was overpriced, I ordered a lobster roll that cost me about 20 bucks with tip and it came to me with half a bun, as if they ran out and were rationing. You had to order your food online and pick up your own food, waiters didn't bring it to you. What's the tip for?!??Super crowded, I guess bc it was Saturday night.Not a diverse crowd, had a frat vibe.And porta potty bathrooms.Will look for a better spot on the waterfront",The Brooklyn Barge
603,"First of all this is my first & last time for San Marzano, Not recommended to make reservation for this place. Because if you do you're forced to order the $45 prefix menu and they forced us to pay for gratuity 20%. I asked her to take off the gratuity because there were no notice or warning in their menu, Open Table or even on the website. The manager said ""WE CAN NOT TAKE OFF THE TIPS BECAUSE IT'S A POLICY""  I'm not mad or upset but the way you guys treated us is really shady. This is disrespectful and rude I understand we need to tip for the service and the servers want tips to pay their bills in New York City but this is robbery. TLDR: Our server is pretty nice and kind but the system sucks","Went here on a Saturday morning for brunch. Got there right before 11am and there was already a line. We were waiting for someone in our partyof 3 to arrive by the bar, and ten minutes after, when we all had arrived, the host told us it was a 30 minute wait, despite multiple open tables. Ended up waiting around an hour and settled for a table outside in 85 degree weather.Food took only around 10 minutes to come. I tried the shrimp scampi with spaghetti. It was reallyoverpowered with lemon, but the noodles had a good texture. Shrimp had a good texture too, not tough at all. Pasta overall was 3/5. Also got a side of fries which never hurts. 5/5 Out of all the restaurants, I've tried in New York, San Marzano has some of the worst service. Waiters did not refill waters, other tableswere offered parmesan for their pasta but ours wasn't, and there was a really rude host that also never told you when your table was ready (we went up to the host on 3 separate occassions). On the plus side, food is cheap for New York. Would only come back if there was absolutely no wait","Was expecting a much better experience from this restaurant. Started poorly as the hostess really doesn't know what she's doing. Called my name, but ran away with no explanation. Came back in 20 minutes, called my name again and then said my table was ready.The worst part of the night though was the pasta. I've never in my entire life had something so flavorless. It's not hard to mess that up. It was literally incredible how bad it was. Off night maybe? The plate is only $13 so I guess you get what you pay for?One star for the waitress and one star for the wine.","I ate at San Marzano for the first time last night with a group of friends after having quite a few people recommend it to me. We got both white and red sangrias for the table, as well as the bacon brussels sprouts. (So fluffy and melt in your mouth!) I got the gluten free pasta with the bolognese, which was delicious. Very savory and hearty, but not too large of a serving. Everyone's food was very yummy and came to the table quickly after ordering, so it was warm. The sangria wasn't too strong but that was fine. The server was okay, but not great - I'm not going to dock the rating for that though because she could have just been having an off day. Overall I had a great time and I would definitely go back. The prices are hard to beat for such great food.","San marzano is totally worth giving a try! I've been here twice and both times I luckily didn't have to wait to be seated. It's a cute, comfy spot that is VERY popular. The food is delicious. I've had the wild boar ragu, garlic bread, bolognese w/ rigatoni and of course wine! They do have a brunch menu but it didn't look very enticing to me however it seems quite popular and the mimosas are plentiful. Whenever I'm in need of some carbs this will be my go-to spot. It's a perfect spot to go to by yourself, with family, friends, date night. I'm a huge fan!$50 lunch date, with wine and tip included!","this place is pretty good for delicious pasta on a budgeti used to come here pretty frequently, and the only reason i really stopped is because its just sooooo crowded now and there's usually a wait for brunch or dinner unless you have a reservation for a group of 6 or more and do the pre-fix menu. 4.5 stars because there are some issues with consistency... once i got the burrata app, and the prosciutto tasted very packaged and not fresh at all, not sure waht happened therethe pasta is good but sometimes you dont get enough sauce, or you get too much and not enough pasta. taste is always amazing thoughi have never tried their sandwiches but the bread its served in looks super crusty and delish, i might try one day that i go if i'm ever not feeling pasta... but fat chance hahatheir sangria is amazing (both red and white) and i always share the pitcher a pitcher with my girlfriend. such a great price too!",San Marzano Pasta Fresca
604,"We won't visit again only if there is no line. The boil is really popular that it tools us almost 2 hours to wait for a table for 6 people. Their seafood was fresh, well flavored with different sauce you could choose and sides were decent but everything was overpriced (cash only!). Their waiters served us not really friendly but the reason might be they were so rush all the time.",This please has changed a lot. The service was horrible from the hostess to management. It took the waitress over 15 minutes to acknowledge us to then get our order wrong. Manager didn't care to fix or even check on us.Before the night was over they were already picking up mats off the floor and rinsing the mop in the sink 2 feet away from where guest were eating. Andddd no air conditioner on (85 degrees outside).,The food was great. Unfortunately they don't take credit cards so make sure you bring,"The best drink here is the cajun Mary... I have never been a fan of Bloody Mary since The Boil. I think it is perfect with the seafood. Also the cat fish basket is so delicious, as well as all the seafood combos. Last night I had snow crab legs, craw fish, and shrimp, which were all delicious. Get the Boil Special sauce, it's out of this world. If you decide to go FIRE...good luck.... spicy is pretty spicy.... mild is safe and won't turn your stomach inside out Keep in mind that the combos are meant for sharing and it is a lot of food.",- I like this Boil better than the other one- They actually had a resey open on a Friday- It is more spacious and open- They love Cardi B and Chris Brown on the soundtrack- Service was excellent- The food is excellenter- FYI The ATM is $2.75,"I prefer the one at Grand street more as it has been consistently great. The one at this location is a miss or hit. One time I was here, the brussel sprouts came out soggy and not crisp & there was not much sauce in the bag w/ the seafood (that was overcooked). Staff was also very busy and not as friendly. If I ever crave for seafood, I will just go to the Grand street one.",The Boil
605,"UPDATE: the owner reached out to me and said the $12.50 is a ""suggestion"". And that he will make sure the waiters know. Becuase the waiter I had said we HAD to spend $12.50 and that he will just ""add on a scoop of ice cream"" for $10... but anyways, he gave me a full refund which I really appreciated. The customer service is nice. I would definitely come back knowing I don't have to spend the full $12.50 a person.$12.50 Minimum A PERSON!!! Don't bother coming here if you want to share an item with someone. It's so fucking stupid.

They have big portions and expect people not to share?? This is the dumbest place ever. Huge Tourist trap!! Don't waste your money coming here it's ridiculous and the cake wasn't that good it was dry. And the icecream that was $10 was also average. it's a crime to be charging that much. I would have left, but I walked 1 mile to get here. Wish I knew before about the stupid minimum. This place S","$12.50 Minimum A PERSON!!!

I only came for the frozen hot chocolate because that's what they are known for and I ate way too much the entire day, so I couldn't have eaten more if I wanted. I was surprised at the appearance of the interior. Very eclectic and random... many odd things to look at. I ordered the frozen peanut butter hot chocolate. Seemed easy enough to make really just hot cocoa mix, maybe some milk and blended with ice and some peanut butter then topped with fresh madeWhipped cream and chocolate shavings. It was good, but more liked it for the experience of it all. They had many crazy looking sundaes coming out of the kitchen. I'd probably try one of those next time.","New York City is just not a destination worth visiting without including a stop at Serendipity 3. You must, must indulge yourself here, under the beautiful decor and on the vintage tile floor that encapsulate the quintessential dining experience in New York. Come here. You will not be disappointed. I have never had an experience even close to the service, attention, efficiency and quality offered by the staff under the incredible management of Debbie, and the attentive, thoughtful service provided by Krystal. Everyone who works so hard to provide service in this eclectic eatery wears a smile and has a kindness of heart that is the epitome of a boutique, trendy, and one-of-a-kind eatery that embodies the spirit of New York Dining. Everything about this hidden gem beckons to the local, the business person, the traveler, the student...everyone is at home at Serendipity.The dessert menu will ruin any dessert you ever have again. Hot fudge, chocolate and cheesecake win the day here. There is no competition for New York's Best! I will be back again and again.","So my girlfriend's favorite movie is Serendipity. This should tell you enough about our trip here. She has been here once before and made sure we came again at the end of our trip. We were supposed to have a reservation at the famed 'movie' seat but unfortunately we got there too late and they had closed down upstairs. I agree with other Yelpers when they say that the layout was a bit small. You can definitely feel a bit cramped if you had a big party. We were sat pretty quickly and given the menu. The menu is huge and has a bunch of items ranging from ice cream to sandwiches to fruit. We ended up getting the frozen hot chocolate (Again from the movie). The chocolate itself tasted great! The price, eh not so much. It was around $12 and although the portion size was worth it, the price would normally scare me away.This place itself is nice and probably worth going to once and a while but I would not be a regular there.","I need to preclude this with we're from Houston, and we are used to bigger, more spread out spaces. The space is very tight. Even when we had a reservation, we still had to wait like 20 minutes in the front, which is incredibly cramped. The food was average. Nothing to write home about. The dessert was massive- my 6-year old was in heaven trying to eat it all. Service was nice, but took a while. Like 30 minutes too long. Would I go back? No. Or maybe Houston has just spoiled me. ‍",Serendipity 3
606,"I expected much better food considering the reviews and buzz but they were expensive, small plates. The entrees were fine but forgettable. I won't ever come back.","Olmsted definitely lives up to the hype. I'm not gonna give a rundown of everything we ate because I don't feel like writing that much. Just know that almost everything we ate was exceptional. There were a couple misses (Kale Rangoon and Popcorn Fish), but both were still good. They just weren't as amazing as the rest of the meal. Service was warm and non-pretentious.","Was excited to eat at this semi hard to reserve restaurant. Brunch was ok, while the selections were unique/creative, i didn't fall over my chair. Restaurants looked was nice and crisp w an open kitchen concept. Where my review will go wrong is service. Waitress did fine up until we indicated to her there were live budancing in our food. (Notice the many plants throughout the restaurant) However the waitress had this ""eww"" look on her face (eww at me for pointing out something I need help correcting or the bug?). The shocker was no apologies comment/feedback from her (so I guess the eww was at a picky customer who don't like bugs in her food). She simply took the plate away and later came back w a new one. I thought this was a Michelin graded but that was an odd and I suppose rude experience....unless the bugs were part of the culinary experience.","My expectation was sky high the moment I walked into Olmsted.  With James Beard award for the best new restaurant and raving reviews on Eater. I expect the best, and Olmsted does not disappoint.  I liked the vibe, the coziness, the back patio with string lights a bathtub koi pond, all the details of the decor really make the restaurant pop and be as inviting as it can be.  Food was amazing - The fried crab rangoon was a stand out, along with the clam carrot crepe and the grilled pork belly were my favorites.  We ordered a burgundy red ($100) that was pretty good value and paired well with the food.  Highly recommend","Short cut; lovely place, bright, & friendly staff, with expensive, unremarkably tasting food but real hi end presentation. They recommend ordering 4 - 5 plates for 2. We did. Even though I try not eat things I dont love (why waste the calories) my nephew is 19 with the appetite and metabolism of a line backer(read eats ALOT of anything) so I was sure we would order more. We did not. It was just too much mediocre food. We had the Duck Pate - sweet and fluffy a very weird texture for pate, I did not like it. My nephew liked but didn't finish it. The Waffle - came with a scoop of ice cream, and some very tasty fruit across the top. When served they pour the syrup immediately over,  not enough I found myself hunting for it and suddenly could not get the attention of anyone to bring me a little more. We were at the bar. He demolished this! The Duck Eggs with Bangers - meh. Didn't finish. He didnt like the eggs, I thought they were over cooked and missing salt. There was a homemade loaf which was really more like a muffin that I thought was good. He was unimpressed. The drinks both non & alcoholic were very small and took a ridiculous amount of time to get considering they were mostly premade ( and we were at the bar!).Staff: The staff was bright & friendly but drinks and plates came out without regard.  We waited, while a couple whom sat & ordered well after us got an Egg Dish we had ordered as well. This happened several times but it may be because we never finished anything.  Brunch for my nephew and I with tip came to $120. Almost everything was just lackluster in taste but lovely eye candy. Maybe this is what English food taste like. (No offense to English Food )","The food: 2/5. Visiting from Chicago we were excited to check out our home grown chef who is not only a Kendall College graduate, but also had such impressive stints in his career as Alinea and Blue Hill. At the end, we weren't sure if he had learned anything at all from Grant or Dan Barber. I'm always a sucker for farm to table/seasonal menu and generally love veggie options, but Olmstead didn't deliver. Everything was either bland or not balanced, their sauces didn't add anything at all. The watermelon sushi had 3 distinct flavor profiles that didn't go well together. Shishitos were alright, I make those better at home with a miso glaze. Squash was a spin on the traditional Thai papaya salad but with squash noodles and charred zucchini which was nice, but their dressing was off balance, far too acidic and sour. Crab Rangoons tasted fishy. The biggest disappointment was the tomato schnitzel. It was your regular tomato fried in egg wash that cost 20 some dollars. It had no flavor profile at all, as the sauces didn't do anything for it; fresh tomatoes from the farmers market taste better than that. The only highlight of our meal was the tuna, which was a very stingy serving but I liked the smokiness paired with fresh basil. Shishitos - 3/5Watermelon sushi -2/5Squash - 2.5/5Crab Rangoon - 2.5/5Tomato schnitzel - 1/5Tuna - 4/5Cocktails - 3/5No complaints about the service, but their bathroom was both out of toilet paper and paper towels. Overall: 2/5. If you want to pay $23 for a slice of a bland tomato, come to Olmstead. Otherwise, get a drink at their beautiful garden in the back and go for dinner elsewhere.",Olmsted
607,"Sadly, we came all the way from Seattle and were excited to visit this restaurant. If you care about transparency and customer service, this may not be your place. Jenna, one of the wait hosts was so rude. We walked in (party of 5) and was told they had a team meeting in the back but they were going to clear the table for us. Meanwhile, we were separated, by 3 of us at the bar and the other 2 of us just sitting on stools with no table. While we waited they got the tables ready. We were patiently waiting and I inquired howMuch longer until we could all sit together. We were told that those tables were resolved and those actually weren't ours. Confusion amongst the staff. Regardless, they didn't make it right and those tables continued to sit empty. Super disappointed by the lack of customer service.","Absolutely awful experience. Horrible customer service with the exception of Greg, the doorman. Bartender was aloof at best. Food was okay at best. Service in general sucked. People around the bar were exceptionally terrible. Can't explain how let down I was. Hadn't eaten here in over ten years. Will never go back.",This is the kind of place that you want to sip cocktails at all day. They have lucky snacks and a killer bartender. Highly recommend!,"One group dinner was all it took for Joseph Leonard to become our favorite restaurant in the area! Our group of five friends came in for an early dinner on Tuesday 9/24 to celebrate a friend's birthday. We found the food to be scrumptious, cocktails on point, and ""upscale-rustic"" ambiance to be the perfect start to a great night. What truly set the dinner apart however was the great service that we received from Megan. She knew the menu inside and out, helped us pick the perfect drinks, and kept us laughing the entire evening!Although we're easy-going, the truth is that we can easily be a waitress' worst nightmare with a vegan, vegetarian, pescetarian, and two full-on carnivores in the group. Add to that a self-proclaimed foodie or two and you can see why we're a tough crowd to please!Megan was patient with our order and even surprised us by taking the initiative to bring out two versions of a side dish - both regular and vegan. It's NYC in 2019 - seriously, who still cares enough to do that? She kept the banter going all night, matched our group's energy and even referenced the Talking Heads! (Side note, the restaurant features a killer playlist). We really enjoyed having her personality add to our conversation.But wait, there's more! At the end of the night, one of the girls casually mentioned that it was our friend's birthday. Without skipping a beat, Megan jumped into action. She brought over some great Lemon-drop shots, took one with us, and organized a scrumptious dessert to celebrate the birthday in style!There are a thousand reasons to make Joseph Leonard your restaurant of choice for an intimate, fun, and memorable small-group dinner or date. Ambiance, food, decor, vegetarian options, delicious cocktails, music choice, detailed design and top-notch service that is both thoughtful and professional are just some of our favorite reasons to return. Add to the list the writer's manifesto in the bathroom in you'll see just why I'm still thrilled about the experience a week later. Thanks to everyone involved in making our night so very special!-Vinay & Friends","One of my absolute favorites brunch spots in NYC. Great for other meals too. Tucked away in the West Village, this cozy den probably seats no more than 40 people. It's a small room centered around a panoramic bar, and half the seating is bar seats, which is a fun experience. Great energy, fun servers and bartenders and overall good vibes to Joseph Leonard. Vibes aside, the food is excellent. From egg sandwiches to omelettes to burgers to fried chicken sandwiches -- it's all delicious. Drinks are great too. Highly recommend for brunch but a great cozy spot for really any meal.","Had an awesome brunch w family at Joseph Leonard's in the West Village. Been wanting to go here for some time and they did not dissapoint. The service, similar to all Happy Cooking Hospitality restaurants, is awesome from the second you walk in. The decor is rustic and cozy with old black and white pics on the wall. This is a neighborhood spot with a cool bar in the center, lots of natural light and picturesque windows overlooking Waverly Place. We started with house drip coffee and warm, dark banana bread. The bread was smooth and silky. We had the special of the day which was a crispy porkbelly sandwich on a warm toasted bread topped with pickled slaw and house-made aioli. This was sooo good I can still taste it. Wish I hadn't shared it!  The other dishes we had are:-Avocado Toast w shallot butter on multigrain bread topped with a perfect poached egg.-Eggs Sardou on artichokes with spinach and hollandaise sauce.-Burger w English cheddar, bacon, garlic aioli and frites. I didn't taste this but my cousin said it was great.Our sides were an incredible hashbrown, spicy brussel sprouts and thick cut bacon.For dessert we had French Toast with maple syrup, strawberry and sour cream. This just melts in your mouth.I will definitely come here again hang at the bar and have dinner.",Joseph Leonard
608,"The first thing you encounter when you walk into Taverna Kyclades is the hostess.  She's gonna tell you it's 15 minutes for a table.  No problem, the place is busy.  Good sign.  While you wait at the bar, you'll survey the place and notice the Executive Chef, Thomas Fotouras.  You'll notice him because he's not in the kitchen.  He's in the dining room in is clean coat just kinda hanging out with a sour look on his face.  As long as you're standing there, and let's just come out and say it, you're gonna be waiting way longer than 15 minutes, Chef Fotouras isn't ever actually going to go into the kitchen.  He'll hang out by the hostess stand, he'll hang out by the bar, he'll watch your girlfriend from behind as she walks to the bathroom.  You know, great chef stuff.But hey, the crowd seems friendly enough.  Pretty homogenous set, but whatever.  Actually, just about everyone looks the same.  Lot of white folks in from Jersey, tonight.  Or is it Long Island?  Huh, no matter.After forty minutes, boom, you got a table!  Too bad it's one crammed into a corner.  But hey, at least there a direct view of the women's room (see photo), am I right!  Let's eat.  If only a server would stop by.  Ok showtime, at last.  Would you like a $30 upsell on every item you ordered?  No?  You sure?  Hmm ok.  So you're cool with being ignored, then.  Got it.A half-hour later, you're in business.  The appetizers are solid, and the pita even seems like it may have been warm at some point earlier in the evening.  Another thirty minutes later, you still won't have seen your server since declining his prompt to switch you from a $26 chicken souvlaki to a $70 fish special.  While waiting for entrees you'll realize you can see into a part of the kitchen.  And hey there's your server!  He's chatting with the kitchen staff and half the other servers.  They're eating, they're handling food, they're on their phones, they're definitely not washing their hands in between.  It's terrific.Finally, a food runner will slam down your entrees, which are fine.  At this point, you'll be most interested in just getting the hell out of there.  I mean really, how many women can you watch head in and out of the bathroom before you lose your appetite?So you'll order the bill, feel like it's 25% more than it should have been and slink out with your leftovers in hand.I know all this because it's happened to me every time I've been here.  I live on the block and have given this place far too many chances.  The food here is fine but not worth enduring the long wait, the miserable service, the cramped dining room, the chef who's a dick and doesn't cook, the overinflated prices and the visibly questionable hygiene and cleanliness in the kitchen.Go to literally any of the other Greek spots in the neighborhood instead.","I used to go to this Astoria location when I lived in New York. Sometimes when I'm visiting I come to this east village location twice! It's that good. I recommend the Greek salad, the octopus, the lemon potatoes (comes as a side) and most of all the dips. The Astoria location is usually packed but the East Village normally has tables. Even on Saturday's.","Great food and service. But when they are busy at night especially they  would like you to leave as soon as you finish eating because it is a small restaurant that gets crowded. They don't serve coffee, tea and I noticed no desserts.",Terrific service - they were attentive from the moment we walked in until we left. The place was busy but it seemed to run so effectively and so well. Food was great - I had the lamb chops and I loved them! I would also recommend the grilled shrimp.,Delicious and fresh food. I love Mediterranean food and this restaurant was a very homey and comforting Greek vibe.The food was good and tasted very fresh. I love that they had olive oil on the table.The service was friendly and very attentive.,"We had a wonderful experience here! We came in and were seated immediately during Sunday lunch. We ordered the large Greek salad, oysters, lamb riblets, grilled octopus, calamari, and sardines. Everything was really really good. The only thing is the oysters had some shells in them otherwise this place would have been given 5 starts. The prices are reasonable and the restaurant is very clean. I can't wait to come back and try other things on the menu. I have to say though, the best dish thus far was the Greek salad, it's a must!!Will visit soon.",Taverna Kyclades - East Village
609,"Came here on a Wednesday night, took a second to find the entrance, and when we walked in, we were told that the wait would be a bit more than an hour, we were a bit surprised since it's a Wednesday and it's FiDi, but we left our number to join the waitlist. We never received a text from them, more than two hours later, I texted to remove my name off the waitlist and didn't get any response. I think they might have removed our names out of spite because i said ""oh didn't realize it's so busy on a Wednesday""One guy legit gave me a dirty look, as if he's responding: ""yeah, we are VERY popular.""I didn't feel welcome here, and for sure wouldn't be back.","Even with a reservation (on a Wednesday night) ...we were treated like we were waiting on line for Studio 54 back in the '70's.  No estimate of time to wait (again, with a reservation), no I'm sorry, no offer for a drink ...just wait.  After 30 minutes (again with no estimate) we decided to leave and tell them that we were disappointed...the answer from the desk was ""okay."" Haven't tried the food - but customer service training is in order.","Parts of this were superb. Parts were disappointing. Disappointing - I asked for an iced tea. It took more than 20 min to get. The tartare was ok. I can't place the seasoning but I didn't like it. The sunchokes, cauliflower, crudo, and carrots were all incredible. Service is slow. My server was a little cranky because we didn't have alcohol.","Crown Shy is worth the hype! It doesn't have signage by the sidewalk, and you have to walk into a lobby to find Crown Shy's entrance. The decor is stunning. Concrete, neon lights, architectural elements, high ceilings... all give the appearance of a futuristic, minimalist dining hall. So much thought was put into the details of the experience, from the crystal lowball glasses, to Le Labo fragrances in the bathroom.The food was excellent. They started us off with a pull-apart bread with what tasted like everything bagel seasoning, with a yogurt dip I could care less about, but the bread was fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside - so good. I had the hummus, charred carrots with clams, caramelle chantarelle and corn pasta, and the grilled quail. I would wholeheartedly recommend all of them, and the broth the carrots were in was particularly flavorful.This will certainly not be my last trip here!","I'd rate crown shy four and a half stars.Upscale restaurant located nearby the south side seaport. They have a tremendous wine selection. We came here for a late dinner after seeing a concert at Pier 17. They have a few local, craft beers on tap. I had a lager from Folksbier in Brooklyn. We started with their gruyere fritters. For the main course, we shared their short rib. The short rib was served sliced and neatly laid out on top of the bone. It came with a chimichurri sauce and sunchokes. For dessert, we shared a blueberry and yogurt ice cream with dried cornbread. Everything was delicious and I'd bet any item we ordered would have been delicious too. The service was outstanding. The staff was extremely polite and attentive. The restroom was quite nice too.","Overall, I'd give a 4.5/5 to Crown Shy after having a super lovely experience celebrating my birthday here with my fiance! Normally, I have no reason to go all the way down to FiDi, but we had errands to run so I decided it was the perfect time to give this much-hyped place a try. Reservations were very easy to get - there weren't any available online, but we called a day ahead and were able to get an early Thursday dinner table.The vibe of the place is super cool, e.g. Le Labo soap, APC-style staff uniforms, and a jazzy/hip-hop/chill playlist. Service is attentive but not fussy or formal. The menu, like the decor, is quite minimalist. Wine by the glass had just a few options per category, but I fairly enjoyed my Cabernet Sauvignon from Bordeaux. Restaurants of a similar price point can get away with charging for bread service, but Crown Shy's free (!) lemony, olive-stuffed pull-apart bread is some of the best free bread in the city, and comes with an addicting labneh spread. Couldn't help but get seconds of this.As for food, the two of us shared two appetizers (red snapper crudo, charred carrots), the short rib for two, as well as the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. The crudo was good, although if it weren't for my current no-cheese policy (wedding diet), I definitely would've opted for the caramelle pasta dish instead. The charred carrots, which came with a foamy, clam chowder-like sauce-broth and razor clams, was also pretty good but again, I would probably try something different next time. The real winner was the short rib, which cut like butter and melted in my mouth like a wagyu brisket. The accompanying chimichurri perfectly balanced each fatty bite. The side of burnt ends hidden under a silky layer of horseradish mashed potato was also amazing, and I would've ordered it as a standalone dish! The other side, a grains salad, paled in comparison with the rest of the dish, but the bites with sweet corn and fresh tomato were still a delightful, clean contrast to the richness of the meat. Do NOT skip on this dish.As for dessert, the sticky toffee pudding was delicious, and so was the apple sorbet that came with it. They tasted better separately than together (the thickness of the toffee sauce is maybe too much versus light sorbet). Because it was my birthday, the staff also surprised us with a giant cupcake with a candle and adorably tiny crown. We had no room for the cupcake, so we packed it to go, and that became a delicious dessert for the following night!",Crown Shy
610,"Attention Ownership & Management;Night: Thursday Time / Check Closed: 6:06pmServer: Penelope HCheck #: 7694Rev Center: Dinning RoomTable #: 61Came here with my family (fiancé, her mother, and our 2 kids. From the reviews, location, and ambience it looked to be a great spot to come eat a early dinner. Upon entering the venue we weren't really welcomed by the host, it almost felt like we were killing his laid back vibe as he leaned against the host service area. After Seating we were finally approached by the server (Penelope H). No introduction to the restaurant, no overview of the menu, and none of the typical questions you would expect from a well trained server. As we waited for the food, she just laid back chatting with multiple coworkers, chewing gum. Typically those are Restaurant industry no no's; huddling up with coworkers chit chatting in a area where guests are supposed to be greeted. Zero interaction prior, during, etc. Overall horrible service with the exception of the food runner, which we tipped directly with cash. After all, he was hospitable and didn't want him to get stiffed from something he had no control over !! The food:The smashburger & fires were actually really good. The onion rings were great and we're liked by the entire table. Sucks for the owner that has invested into a really nice venue to have workers that seem not to care about his/hers investment.","Wish I could give this place anything more than one star.... but the bouncer ruined it for the place! Literally had 20 mins before close(and I get it Im a bartender) but all I wanted was a shot(super quick) and the bathroom... wouldn't take long, and I'd be out well before four! He actually put his hands on me... not cool!!! Again, quick shot and done should have not been an issue considering they had pretty much a full bar. Not cool guys. Talk to your bouncer!",Not good. Staff is unpleasant and the drinks are mediocre. Better places in This area to visit,"The interior of The Spaniard is beautiful, and it's a great spot for special occasions. I was organizing a last-minute farewell party for a group of 15 on Friday night. The Spaniard was quick to respond and let me reserve a spacious section near the entrance. I accidentally messed up the start time of my reservation, but they were incredibly accommodating and let me change it last minute. I'm a huge whiskey fan, so the drink menu here was right up my alley. They have an assortment of international whiskey options and cocktails. Our server was constantly checking on us and was quick to get our food and drinks out. I also loved that the music wasn't too loud and I could actually hear everyone at my table as we conversed. Overall, I really enjoyed my time here. It's a little pricier than the surrounding watering holes, but totally worth it!","Such a cool bar in West village. Has old school. Charm but a youngish vibe. Has a great selection of whiskies though could do better with cocktails.We enjoyed our visit there, music isn't too loud either. A bit on a pricey side though.Do drop in for a few drink or two if you happen to be in WV.","West village watering hole. Read: good for drinks. Been coming here since they opened in 2017 to get my whiskey fix (they have over 100 types) and without fail it's always a crowded scene. Food, not worth it. Buffalo duck wings, nice try. Patty melt for $18? Please. Huge fan of their other locations (if you're in the good go to Wilfie & Nell instead, or even better yet travel for The Wren for a real cocktail).",The Spaniard
611,"Came here for a night cap. It was a bit disappointing to watch the bartender pour the cocktail out of a bottle pre-mixed.It was stale and bitter as if were sitting all day waiting...We asked the bartender to make a fresh one and he got really defensive and said that the ratio was all the same pre mixed and it will taste the same.As someone who pays for $16-25 cocktail, it needs to be mixed fresh. This is the baseline in Manhattan. YOU DON'T SERVE A PRE-BATCHED MARTINI OR ANY COCKTAIL FOR $17 EVER!!That's how cocktails should be made freshly mixed and not sitting in the fridge for a ""mixologist"" to pour it in the glass.The place is overrated for cocktails I must say and recommend more training for craft and service.","Horrible customer service. At 5:30, the tables and bar stools were reserved after they post to come down for negroni pop up. When asking the host, he laughed in our face - twice. Their instagram is very misleading for a cafe that only has space for dinner reservations.After asking about happy hour reservations on instagram, they blocked me.",Underwhelming... came in with high expectations but the food fell very flat. The flatbread was awful. The cheese plate was ok. The pasta and chicken parm were also ok. Not worth the money!Also they were blasting music so loud inside that we had to be asked to be seated outside even though it was a bit chilly that night.,"I've been to Dante twice now in the span of a month and have to say it is a wonderful spot. The cocktails and service are fantastic. The food is delicious though I wish it was a bit more substantial. They had a special ""Zombie Spritz"" cocktail that was apparently from their summer menu but PERFECT for fall as it had note of vanilla and cinnamon. Burrata is delicious as were the pastas. Overall its a great New York restaurant and I'll be back many times! Make a res as it is ALWAYS packed.","I had my brother and best friend in town over Labor Day weekend, and had another close friend visiting - both times I went to Dante and boy oh boy it did not disappoint. Yes, you read that right - I went to the same restaurant in a matter of a couple of days. I love love love their aperol spritz, ricotta appetizer is killer (burrata is great too), lamb sausage flat bread is killer, and their side veggies are always delicious. Such a great date spot, and I love the location. Dante, please don't ever change!","Wow wow wow.  This place is amazing.  By far my favorite cocktail bar in nyc.  Drink menu for days.  We each had 5 drinks over a couple hours and food.  Every drink was expertly crafted and presented.The food,was amazing and sitting at the bar, watching the bartenders, was awesome.  The negroni menu was os much fun and the cocktails on draft were delicious.I can't say enough about how awesome this place is.",Dante
612,"Went for Good Beer Passport DinnerFood - 2/5. The poblanos were really overpowering on the burger. Despite being roasted pretty well, the large slices of poblanos with their stringy texture did not fit well when eating a sandwich. Since you're cutting with your teeth, it wasn't a good texture especially when you have everything else to chew at the same time. Beef patty itself was pretty average and the two8two sauce was barely noticeable. There was a reason they served the burger with ketchup on the side.Service - 4/5. Friendly and courteous.Value - 2/5. Their namesake two8two burger runs at $10.50. It sounded good on paper, but the actual burger itself wasn't good to eat. Despite the price point, it doesn't come with any sides at all either. I definitely expected more.Parking - Street (Free)","Delivery was a complete nightmare Ordered a burger at 7:52pm, didn't receive until 10:33Yes, you've read that correctly. I was a hangry bitch. Called and the manager made excuses, took no responsibility and directed me to call caviar. Never ordering from here again.",I've only had the Greek fries from here and I've returned many times to order them again.,"Located at '282' Atlantic Avenue (somebody is a clever wordsmith), Two 8 Two Bar & Burger serves up high quality burgers and a solid selection of draft beer in a family-friendly neighborhood style pub.  Service is incredibly attentive, warm, AND down-to-earth - which makes this spot deserving of repeat business.The menu is pretty straight forward.  Order your choice of burger and a side, a drink or two, and sit back and relax.  We thought it was pretty cool that they offer a dedicated hot dog menu (classic, garden, bacon cheddar, chili cheddar, and two8two dog).  But, we chickened out and went with two Pub Burgers and a side of fries.  The patties were tasty, well-seasoned, and cooked to perfection!  Our only gripe was the two8two sauce.  There was simply too much of it and the flavor overpowered the dish.  It was good, but balance would have been appreciated.Also, this place offers outdoor seating in the back.  You should definitely take advantage of this while you still can!",I wasn't blown away. Burgees spots are so competitive in Brooklyn that every burger spot you try it's always expected to be better than the last. I had the veggie burgers with grilled onions and onion rings . The onion rings were very good. My burger was just ok. I know it's veggie but that doesn't mean bland and tasteless. I felt like it was missing something. I also thought they were pricey as well. $70 for 3 burgers and a kids meal with chicken tenders. I'll have the onion rings again for sure but I'll pass on the burger.,"My thought process with burgers always begins with the question:  Is it better than Shake Shack?  I can confidently say Two 8 Two passes that test and earns the 4-star rating for taste.Burgers are flavorful, cooked correctly, and have a good meat-to-bun ratio. Prices are right and service is friendly and efficient, and ambience is cozy and not too loud, and there's a nice little garden seating area out back . Great place to catch up with a friend or watch a game; great rotating beer selection.",Two 8 Two Bar & Burger
613,"I know everyone who doesn't write negative reviews always starts off their review with ""I'm not one to write negative reviews..."" but really, I'm not one to write negative reviews...  HOWEVER, the quality of service provided by one server, whose  name begins with an R and has a mustache (not disclosing his full name because I'm not that much of an jerk :) ) was horrible. I hate to pull the racist card, but I couldn't help but notice that he had a standoffish attitude that was only directed to us (the only table he had with non-caucasians) and provided us with the minimum level of service possible. He never checked in our table once, whereas I saw him conversing with all the other tables. For example, even when dropping off the dessert menus, i observed that for every other table he'd actually converse and verbally explain that it was the dessert menu, whereas he simply dropped off the menus and walked away without saying a word. Hopefully my experience isn't a recurring pattern, or maybe it's a misunderstanding. If anyone else has experienced this, I would encourage them to leave a review and/or bring this up to management as this behavior made us pretty uncomfortable. Not only that, but steak was mediocre and was over cooked. *Edit* based on other reviews, looks like I'm not the only one that experienced this here.","Keens recently made the news because of racist 19th-century, Birth of a Nation-era pictures adorning its walls, a product of its Gilded Age origins. I'd never seen these, but here is a summary of it from Eater.com: ny.eater.com/2019/8/22/2…Manager Bonnie Jenkins made the right call in removing these. I applaud the move rather than superficial historical preservation arguments, as if the world and social mores are not constantly in flux.","Absolutely an average steakhouse. Claimed to have aged meats but I don't think so! You can taste meat when aged but this was not. Best part of the food experience was the baked potatoes and creamed spinach. Service was professional and business like but not friendly, maybe it's a NYC thing but I don't like it.","Keens along with Peter Luger are my two favorite steakhouses in New York City. So, I guess this makes Keens my favorite steakhouse in Manhattan. It's a very old school steakhouse ambiance. White tablecloth, fancy. It has thousands of smoking pipes on the ceiling which is pretty cool. Also, there's a Theodore Roosevelt room where he ate, and he's my celebrity crush, so that's really cool. The steak is fabulous. What I love about it is that it's salted perfectly. The whole outside of the steak has these huge grains of salt that just makes it soooo tasty. The meat is super tender and perfect. My parents and I split the steak for 2 (I honestly forget what cut) but it was the only cut for 2. The for 2 left the three of us with leftovers so it's a huge portion!!! The bread is great too. Loveee Keens.","Came here with friends and was welcomed by the staff. The ambiance is rustic, which makes sense. First, the bread was great - very crunchy and soft on the inside. Perfect size but dangerously good since I had like 7 rolls. Interesting, they had carrots and celery as appetizers as well. We also had the rockefeller oyster which had a good blend of seasoning and balance of acidity. We had the bacon, which I highly recommend. Never had bacon like that - probably would give me a heart attack if I had more. Finally, the porter house for 2 was divine. I never had an age stage like this one.Overall, the food spoke volume for it. The only thing kept me from giving this is a 5 star was the attitude of the waiter. We didn't order drinks cause we already had some prior, but he gave our table a dirty look. Like dude - our bill came out pretty high without the drinks. Good place to celebrate and would definitely be back!","A wee stuffy but if you are nonplussed like myself, the coolness quickly wears off and you are just fine. Our waiter wasn't super versed in the difference between cinsault and gamay of red blends, so he quickly offered to give me a sample of both. Fantastic. I opted for a glass of a familiar- Syrah... but should've gone with one of the 2 samples honestly. No harm done there and they give a generous pour. His silver lining was a pretty tequila Cointreau grapefruit lime cocktail. Rustic bread and celery, carrot stalks and olives where quickly placed before us. We settled on oysters Rockefeller, the mutton chop and the prime t-bone. The mutton arrived impressively large with a side of sautéed romaine/mustard greens? Whatever they were, the greens were citrusy, crunchy and delicious. The mutton- so we heard this is famous here... was good. Especially the rind peeling off the large lamb tbone shank. There was another equally fatty rind on the plate that must've fallen off from the grill- it was so good. The shank itself was a tad overcook on one side and pretty accurate on the other. But lamb meat that was some 4 inches thick was a bit arduous to chew through just because there wasn't enough fat embedded in between. His T-bone steak on the other hand, was the best I've ever had. Savory, tender, still juicy and charred at the same time with marbling and that aged meatiness throughout- that is a dam steak if I ever had one. We had such high hopes for the mutton, but He noticed no one around us was ordering that. Dam, fell into the tourist trap. Don't get me wrong- Keens does a good mutton. It just that we learn through this experience we are not lamb people, especially when beef is available. And Keens does a crazy t-bone. Insane really. Very lastly but definitely not least- we shared their key lime pie after he told me about the pics he'd seen but let me tell you, good pictures does Not do the KLP justice. It's basically perfect, just like their T-bone steak. So, my comment to him as we left was that, it makes sense some of the staffers act a certain je ne sais quoi... hell I might too if I worked at arguably the best steak house in nyc.",Keens Steakhouse
614,"So I'm still sitting here as we speak. I think rating establishments is all about expectations. For the price point here, you cannot possibly expect more.I've had the all you can eat BBQ here last time and for less than $40, the quality is phenomenal. I'll argue about this all day long. I've also had the BBQ sets (not all you can eat) here before and I still think it's well worth the money. The quality of the meats is there, and that's what makes the KBBQ experience. Fast forward**Today I'm feeling a bit under the weather so I opted for the beef brisket and bone marrow soup. Again, I'm very pleased- It really hit the spot for me. It literally tastes homemade with no MSG in the soup at all!! But let's get to the important part: the BAN CHANThis place has some really really tasty Banchan. Those bean sprouts and spinach (or whuddeva you wanna call it) is marinated with sesame oil and went so well with my bowl of rice. I got it refilled 5x. YES! 5X!! And not a single one of those times, did I initiate the request. Which leads me to..The service: 10/10 the waitresses in here are so hospitable. They kept asking if I'd wanted more, refilling my water every few minutes, and brought me another bowl of rice without me even asking because she saw me gulping everything down like a mad man. The damage: $14.10....  WOTTTTTJust make sure to tip them well if you get any more than 1x refill on them Ban Chans :) It's the right thing to do.","We went for the all you can eat Korean BBQ and to be honest I was very disappointed. They sad it's all you can eat but that's not right. Inside the menu the steamed eggs and the soups are included. But it's not. If you order more soups or steam eggs they do extra charge. Also after the first round we wanna order more meat the waitress would imply you that if you don't finish the dishes that you order you have to pay for the fine. I have to say it's totally not a pleasant dining experience compared to other all you can eat Korean BBQ. At Grand Seoul you can feel that they are stingy. All the female waitresses are the same. There are many options for the meat, they charge you extra fee if you want more soup or steamed egg, they would not happy if you wanna order for the second round. Would never come in again!!!","Food was a bit bland for my taste, but luckily they gave us some salt on the side, which helped A LOT. the ban chan was a bit weird.. never had hotdog for ban chan before..So we were planning to go to Flavor 99 but we weren't that hungry and opted for this place.. since we just wanted something quick and warm before heading over to Holiday Inn (this was in Feb). They were advertising $10 lunch specials, but  once seated, they give you a menu without the specials on it, so ask them and they will give you another menu. (Very sneaky).","First time here for lunch with a large group of 9 and enjoyed the food very much.  Bibimbaps served in a large wider bowl were tasty. The lunch combos with jjigae (i.e. kalbi with either kimchee or mixed jjigae) for less than $20 was delicious as well.  Jap Chae was yummy too.  Overall everything was good including service and hospitality.We did not drink, but they do have a liquor selection.  Worth a try for new patrons.  I will bring my friends next time.","I visited Grand Seoul, a Korean bbq place near Grand Street Station for a regular meal (not the AYCE bbq) since I was craving KBBQ. It was a bit expensive to have a regular meal rather than the AYCE they offer. The AYCE would have probably been more worth the price as the bill for 2 people, who don't eat a lot came out to $90. I think the food was okay and the same as any other Korean BBQ place. However, there wasn't as much Banchan as I'd like. I also asked for a refill on the sliced fish cakes 3x's through my meal and never received it. I wasn't impressed with the service. We were was not doing AYCE so we did not order too many things and there was also very few other guest during the time I visited. Even with a few other guests, I still never got the fish cakes I asked for throughout the one hour I was there.tl;dr - not doing AYCE is not worth it, not impressed with service - asked for sliced fish cakes 3x to 3 different waiters, never got what I asked for.","Make a reservation if you're feeling carnivorous! Great AYCE BBQ! We came here with a group of 13 and had the best service and value out of our dinner. We had 1 vegetarian so she was able to order on her own and not do the AYCE option $35/person. With drinks, it came out to be $52/person.We started with #1, 2, 4, 5. The marinated ribeye was the highlight. Super flavorful though takes a bit longer to cook. The waitresses were really attentive and cooked everything for us. You get unlimited side dishes and egg soufflés and tofu soup.The thinly sliced pork belly was delicious if you cook it until it browns. We also loved the regular thinly sliced beef, which paired so well with the scallion salad. I would've loved to try the spicy ones but the sauce made up for the flavor. They do charge you if you don't finish what you order. So be sure to start conservatively since you can always order multiple rounds. They do adjust the portion based on your party size but some plates on one side definitely came out to be more than the other side since we had 2 grills going.",Grand Seoul

I ordered my meal at 7:07pm and it's now 8:11pm.I chose to have my food delivered because of work , the delivery guy had the wrong order when he arrived. I called the shop about my situation and was told it would be arrive it five mins which was a lie !!! I called the shop ( horrible customer service btw) with no remorse about what happen. So I wasted my lunch time and no food to eat.I will not be ordering from this establishment. They also charge my card so now I have to figure how to get my money back.",Quick service and great food!

With nearly 15 sandwich options and three types of tots, there's something for everyone.  But be forewarned: it's messy.  As I ate my truffle melt, cheese oozed and truffle oil dripped from all sides of the sandwich.  But it was an oozing, dripping, pile of heaven.  The tots are pretty good too, and the parmesan topping was addicting.  Bonus: Melt Shop has gluten free bread, and it's safe for celiacs! I've now been here three times, and it's safe to say, I'll return again.  During the weekday, it gets PACKED.  But on the weekend I didn't have to struggle for seating and even had the place to myself at off-peak hours.  And whether you're gluten free or just craving a good grilled cheese, Melt Shop is a great option for fast-casual comfort food!","I was visiting New York with an insane number of Yelp bookmarks, but needed something quick and close to my hotel. This fit the bill, and I'd even seek it out in the future! With about 10 different grilled cheese options plus different varieties of tater tots, Melt Shop is quick casual comfort food at its best! I had the classic, but honestly I want to come back and try them all. And tater tots that are gluten free? Whaaaat? Bring on all the carbs!Whether you're gluten free or just craving a good grilled cheese, I'd highly recommend checking out Melt Shop!","My hunny and I wanted to get back to our picnic roots. Instead of whipping up a huge spread we wanted to relax and grab sammies so we could enjoy each other and didn't have to slave away in the kitchen. We both ordered the Fried Chicken Melt. My hunny substituted the Melt sauce with garlic mayo. I added sautéed onions. I wanted mozzarella cheese but they didn't have any. My hunny decided not to put any cheese on my sammy. The sammies were pretty solid. I'm not a huge fan of the melt sauce. The only downside is that I wish we ate them right away. I placed them in the fridge and decided to reheat them in the oven which made the country white bread crunchy. I should've removed the chicken pieces placed then in the oven and warm the bread for a few seconds in the microwave. Next time I'll order mine with the pepper jack cheese, sautéed onions, sans the cabbage.",Melt Shop
616,Overpriced. Overrated and terrible customer service. The dancers are good however the reservation policy is a complete ripoff! Really wanted to like this place.,A few years ago a friend told me about Duane Park and tonight was my first visit. Now I realize why I was hesitant in the first place ... It was a very blasé experience. The food reminded me of a wedding reception dinner and the show didn't keep us intrigued - it was not worth the $400 spent. It's not a cool or sexy place as described. I was greatly disappointed in the entire experience.,"Performers were amazing! The MC and band were also great! But this experience wasn't worth the price ($115 + tax and 20% mandatory tip, + $15 cocktails not included. Money I don't mind spending if the food and service was good). The food was blah and the service was absolutely terrible. I live in nyc and eat out often, and also travel globally frequently so I have a lot to compare to when I say that the management/staff/customer service is some of the worst I've ever seen in the world. Person at door acted like he owned the place (if he did that makes his attitude even worse (so beyond rude), terrible process trying to get seated - they made 7 people stand at the door while we waited for 8th person, even though we were willing to put in her food order if they seated us. Rudest staff I've ever seen and no reason for the level or arrogance for just blah food and bad service.If this is a gift for your spouse or something go, they will enjoy the show, but be prepared that the food and service won't match the show so set expectations in advance. Management tip - customer service is everything  in this social media/rating review world. Learn how to treat customers well and make a night at your place a total experience. Step it up if you want to stay relevant.",Excellent service Good food Great entertainment I love the themed nights. They give you a variety of evenings that showcase different artist with a running them for the night. Love it!!,"Food was wack and only 2 vegan options cold soup or zucchini spaghetti which was extremely sweet yuck. The show is great , make reservations for 8pm show starts at 9-10 if you make 7pm reservations you'll feel like you're waiting forever and it gets pretty boring.I would see the show again NOT to eat.","I absolutely loved this restaurant. The concept is amazing and the ambiance is magical.When you walk into Duane Park you are taking a memorable blast into the past. While you glide down a dimly lit corrider, you are welcomed by the electric sounds of conversations and music. You are ushered to check you coat( you can't have anything on the back of the chair, you are allowed to wear your jacket as long as it stays on for the duration of dinner) The show starts at 9 so the best thing is to have a 7, 7:30 dinner reservation to have time to eat and converse with your dinner companion. The food was delicious! I ordered the Shrimp and grits, very flavorful, and the grits were cooked to perfection. The Short ribs are tasty but I feel to much demi-glace was used so it kinda felt a little too slippery. But what stole the show was that tasty bread pudding. I wanted to lick the spoon it was too friggin good! The ladies were amazing as well. They had an array of talent, from fire breather/swallower. A great time for a special occasion, I would recommend getting a seat next to the entrance to the stage or the middle its best lighting for pictures and interactions with the ladies",Duane Park
617,"Pros: Cheap, good portion, not too bad taste, decent service for a chinese spot. Cons: The food quality is not the best. You can literally taste the chicken and tell it's not fresh and probably one of those cheaper chicken breeds. Some of the people who goes in are not the well manner people you will meet at a professional but are rather rude low income ppl. They will cough in front of you, skip the line, etc",Not a big fan of the bun at all. It wasn't fresh and tasted stale. Chicken was decent.,"It took 10 seconds to walk across the hall and jewelry stand, look at the menu, and choose #1 item (BBQ pork). Soft spoken man behind the counter asked, ""spicy or no spicy?"" I said spicy. He did a wide spin, grabbing a brown bag and something else, and returned with my lunch ($5.25, cash). I was in and out in 30 seconds. If you want to eat there, there are some high tops and AC. My spicy BBQ pork was *spicy*. There are chunks of jalapeño (or some other spicy pepper) with spicy sauce. I had half for lunch and the other half 4 hours later - plenty of food!","I have been coming here for their vietnamese sandwiches for at least 12 years now! Introduced to me in my teens and I have been hooked since.  Especially when I used to work a few blocks away, there were many times I had it for lunch and dinner and my friends all know how much I love this place. My go to is their pork Banh mi but sometimes I would get their chicken Banh mi. The Banh mi comes with pickled veggies wrapped in pate which gives it a nice crunch and adds to the overall taste. You can customize your order with spicy levels - no spice, little spice (just sriracha), and spicy (jalapeno pepper) and mayo or no mayo. One order will definitely fill you up as it's a long baguette that is split in two. I've had other Banh mi places but I always tell friends this is my favorite.","Very quick and fast serviceOrdered #1: BBQ roast pork banh mi The crisp exterior, soft interior baguette, roast pork and pickled veggies are perfectly blended. They also cut the sandwich and wrapper together in half so you can easily just eat only 1/2 at a time and save the other half for later. It took only a few mins to get the banh mi after ordering. So the line moves very fast. But wish there was more seating area!","I had my first banh mi sandwich here and it was not a disappointment! We went around 3PM and it was not that crowded. I ordered #3, which was sardine fish banh mi for $6.25. It was ready in a jiffy; I didn't even wait 5 minutes for it! The service is fast. They only accept cash by the way. I sat down to eat my sandwich, which was sliced in half and nicely wrapped. It seemed overwhelming at first because of how large and stuffed it was with pickled cucumbers and radish, cucumbers, sardine fish, parsley, and some other stuff I can't remember. Even though a lot of the stuff kept on dropping out and I got slapped in the mouth sometimes, it was delicious! A tad spicy but it hit the spot so well. The sardine fish kind of just tasted like tuna fish, but I am not quite sure. I am looking forward to coming back here and trying the other sandwiches that are oh so wonderfully crafted!",Banh Mi Saigon
618,"Good place for dinner, more seating in the back. Yum pizza dinner! Accompany your pizza with a glass of wine. You can do half & half flavors on the pizza","This was my second time at this place and a much different experience than the first.  For this day in age, getting food shamed at a restaurant in 2019 is unacceptable.  I came in Saturday night with two friends of mine.  I had been here before and we really were ready to spend money to try lots of different food.  At first, I sat down and asked our waitress about the wine selection.  She told me the wine we picked was light bodied, but turned out being very full bodied.  As a wine connoisseur, when you get a glass you are smelling to make sure the wine is not corked, not actually tasting the wine.  Judgement 1 came when she said ""ummm... are you going to taste that??""  Judgement 2 came when we ordered our meal.  2 apps, 3 mains, 2 sides.  For 3 people, not too much food as the portions are not huge and we had big appetites.  ""Umm, are you sure you want to order all that food.  That is a lot.""  Why is she questioning how much food we want to eat?After our meal, she had the check before we were even asked to see a desert menu.  We wanted to see a dessert menu and then we were REALLY food shamed.  ""You guys look really full, are you sure you want to see a dessert menu??"" This is horrible.  Stop telling me how I look, stop judging me on how much food I ordered when this is going to be your tip.  Food was good, but the overall experience with her as a waitress, not so much.  She made me feel horrible for taking myself out to a nice meal.  In the past, I have not had this issue at this restaurant.  I plan on speaking with the manager soon.","Covina, in a sea of mediocre Murray Hill restaurants and very bro-ey bars you are a gem. Waking in, I was in awe by the beautiful modern decor and coziness that didn't feel uncomfortable or pretentious.On a Friday night at 7:45 without reservation for 4, we waited about 20minutes before sitting down.I tried...-  Spicy Honey Pizza, $18 to start. 8 pieces great for sharing for 4 as an app-  Mandilli  (folded pasta sheets, basil almond pesto, house made ricotta & san marzano sugo) $24...the stand out dish-  Bucatini (guanciale, pecorino, crushed red pepper, san marzano sugo) $22.... good but spicyOnly regret was not having room for a brioche donut. Damn you stomach","Loved Covina! Everything was amazing from the service to the food to the ambiance. We had the burrata and heirloom tomato appetizer to start, then for dinner my husband and I split the mandilli and spicy honey pizza. I recommend all of the above! I also really enjoyed my ""house of the rising sun"" cocktail which was a mix of sparkling wine, grapefruit and bigallet china-china. Will definitely be coming back!",Had a great breakfast experience with my wife and 2 kids (ages 5 & 8).  Short menu that does not cater to children but had nicely done basics.  Kids liked the pancakes with the lemon curd in the side.  Croissant (from Balthazar) sandwich was great as was the avocado toast with poached eggs.  Again not particularly catering to kids but we adults had a great meal and the kids were happy (even if the pancakes didn't have chocolate chips!),"What a great restaurant close to the Flatiron District. We arrived on a weekday for late dinner and were promptly seated. Our server, Mohamed, was terrific - explained the menu and was courteous in all interactions. We started with a fantastic Chicken Liver Mousse and then ordered the Mandilli and the Tagliatelle - both delicious. For dessert, we shared a big slice of carrot cake that was OK. Finished with a nice glass of port (Vale D Maria 30yr).Overall, a positive experience - would recommend.",Covina
619,"Not my fave. Fish is not that fresh. Left out in the open on ice so when they torch the fish, the top is warm and bottom is cold",My boyfriend took me here for my birthday. We went for the 20 piece Omakase and also purchased some sake to go with the meal. It was absolutely phenomenal.,Most mediocre Omakase so far.  The squid was so off the balance.....saltiness overwhelmed. The egg was quite tasteless. I wouldn't recommend this place. The whole experience was quite a disappointment especially when it came to the squid with salty chili paste. I feel bad to say the taste of it make my stomach feel sick.,"Perfection from start to finish. This place is tiny, but that just means each guest gets more attention throughout the meal. Staff were very friendly and attentive, I challenge you to finish your tea before they can refill it, I was never able to.My boyfriend and I both got the more expensive omakase, both the chef and hostess were very good about asking if you have any allergies or dislikes, and crafting a meal to your liking. We were lucky to have the friendly and talented Chef Ishizuka serve us this evening, I'm sure all of their staff are very skilled but he's a fun guy and would highly recommend asking if you can be served by him when making your reservation.A genuinely great experience, go book your table now.","Like numerous omakase joints in town, Kura offers an intimite setting, seating around 10 guests at a time. The staff is welcoming, especially the host who brought us to our table. She also gave us a My partner and I opted for the 20 pieces. The whole experience was  traditional and easygoing. My favorite pieces were: the stuffed squid as entrée, scallop, torched salmon, uni and shrimp sushi.The reason why I only gave Kura 4 stars out of 5 is because (1) the chef seemed very rushed to serve us the sushi. His pace didn't exactly follow ours, which made us feel pressured to chew faster than we could. I'm saying this because we are not slow eaters in the slightest and do not take our time ravishing the pieces. (2) The sushi experience was too purist for my taste. I like being surprised from time to time by non-expected or non-traditional ingredients. There were none at Kura. Overall, I enjoyed my experience, especially since getting a reservation with Kura is easier than many other spots in the city.","My partner took me here on a Wednesday night. Reservations aren't difficult to make and unlike Tanoshi and other omakase spots in the city, there aren't specific time seatings for this restaurant. Kura is unassuming - you wouldn't recognize it well from the outside - and it's a small restaurant. There is one table you can sit in and the rest of the seating is for bar seating only. There are four omakase choices - 12 piece, 16 piece, 20 piece, and 20 + kaiseki piece. We opted for the 20 piece omakase and paired it with some sake recommended by the wait staff. The 20 piece omakase actually comes with a few extra smaller dishes, favorite dish being the rice stuffed octopus. It was sweet and crunchy - delicious. Regarding the omakase - the chef was very generous with the cuts of fish. Rice was room temperature and a little undercooked but generally good. Notable pieces were the ebi, snow crab, salmon, and the toro. Service was good and I'm glad I tried this spot - I'm not sure I'll be back but the price points are fair and it won't disappoint you.",Kura
620,"Ordered takeout from here and it was only about 15 minutes for a Beef Soft Tofu Soup. The soup also came with rice and small sides of kimchi and pickled veggies (I think cucumber and carrot). The soup wasn't very flavorful or spicy. It had a significantly mild taste. I'm not sure if they have the option to make it spicier, but we weren't asked what spice level we desired. The beef within the soup also wasn't good. It wasn't soft, seemed like it was cooked too long, and also slightly burnt. The beef also wasn't in small portions, it was a large chunk that didn't come apart easily as most of it was held together with hard to chew fat/tendon. Very disappointed in the dish.I'll probably give the place a couple more tries since it's the only Korean place around this area, but expectations are low.","We tried to like this place, we really did.  My fiance and I came here for early dinner on a weeknight as a treat and hoping to eat some delicious Korean food.Two servings of kimchi and picked radish banchan arrived shortly after we were seated but to our discovery, it was stale tasting and had lost its crunch/bite.  It was a forewarning as to the remainder of our meal. To start, we ordered Truffle Parmesan fries, Bulgogi Nachos and 6 pcs of Soy Garlic wings.  They ""ran out"" of Bulgogi Nachos at 6:30 pm.  The wings were overdone; the fried batter could have taken out a tooth.  Only one out of the six piece wings order was actually a wing. The Truffle Parmesan fries were the safest thing to eat, although I barely tasted any truffle. For our mains, my fiance ordered a Jeyook Dolsot Bibimbap (pork shoulder) and I ordered the Galbi BBQ entree.  The server came out with a Jeyook Tofu Kimchi entree instead of the Jeyook Dolsot Bibimbap and didn't realize it until we brought it to her attention.  Dolsot bibimbap is not the same as meat served with rice on the side.  The Galbi is supposed to be short rib ... but there was no bone and it tasted like overdone, chewy flank steak.The server was nice overall, but it just reflects poorly on management and lack of training at this place.  There were at most five tables seated (including ours) the entire time we were there, so it's impossible to attribute this sub-par experience to the chaos of running a busy restaurant.  The glass which my yuzu lemonade was served in was cracked and very obvious to the naked eye.  We won't be coming back, especially when the beer and fries were the ""best"" things we had and so many things went awry. It's unfortunate I happen to be a stickler for details... is there a reason why the only Korean characters that appear on the menu is on the Soup category??","I ordered delivery from the Yelp app and got Kimchi Fried Rice and Soy Garlic Chicken. The chicken was delicious. Addictive even. I finished that easily! The kimchi fried rice on the other hand... was very different.I don't call myself an expert in Korean food, but I feel like I've been to enough Korean restaurant and ordered kimchi fried rice at many to know what it should taste like. And this was very different from all of them. The kimchi didn't taste fresh, but a couple of days old. It the meat wasn't tender. The egg was cooked all of the way through instead of being a bit yolky. Overall this was a disappointing experience for me.","I came here with my friend for lunch after walking by and seeing how cute it looked on the inside. The restaurant has a rustic interior barn feel to it and has community tables with a few private tables against the wall.We both ordered our meals from the Lunch Specials menu, which had a very special selection. My friend ordered the Kimchi Fried Rice with Bulgogi and it looked very good. It came with 2 sunny side up eggs. I should've asked her what she thought of it, but I hadn't seen her in ten years and so we were busy catching up :). I had the Kimchi Fried Rice with Chicken Wings and I thought it was delicious and satisfying. The chicken wings were sweet and sticky. I normally like my food to be savory, but the wings were an exception. My order has 1 sunny side up egg. The service was fast and friendly. When we arrived, the place was empty and it was still empty when we left. It was odd because we came here in the middle of lunchtime. Nevertheless, I love this place.Will definitely return when in the area!","Inconsistent!I came here on Wednesday of this week, hadscallion pancakes which were crisp, super light, not greasy and very flavorful.Today (two days later) I thought since the scallion pancakes were so good, I'd order the kimchi pancakes. They came out, over cooked on the outside and flouryrubbery and greasy. I sent them back & the waiter kindly agreed to have some more more. Another order came out and they were the same. By this time I was over it. I paid my check and left.Really wanted this place to be good! Alas","Decent Korean food that's a bit pricey. My friend and I ordered three appetizers since the reviews for this place are pretty mixed. The truffle Parmesan fries were very crispy and overall tasted good. They could've been more generous with the truffle and Parmesan though, since the flavor wasn't that strong compared to other ones I've had. The spicy rice cakes were passable. The rice cakes were a bit too soft for this type of dish, and overly chewy because of that. The sauce tasted different from other ones I've had but it's not bad. The seafood pancake was probably the best out of the three. It was crispy yet soft, and not mushy at all -- the perfect consistency! The seafood inside was also well cooked, and the sauce was great. Overall, everything tasted okay but it's pretty pricey for the quality of the food. The restaurant is pretty cute though and it wasn't busy at all on a Saturday night.",SSAM
621,"This place is hyped up. I ordered 2lbs crab, crawfish, shrimp and 1 pound of mussels. The shrimp was not cleaned. The mussels had sand/brown & black goo in it. It wasn't cleaned properly. I was disappointed because I traveled so far, paid over $130. 7lbs of food I was disappointed with. All they really do is boil the seafood without cleaning it and then toss it in sauce when someone orders. I got the hot n juicy sauce and it was loaded with garlic chunks. On top of that, when I went there, there was pest control in the restaurant. The man kept asking to speak to the manager but the employees kept prolonging him. I won't be coming here again.","In my opinion the food wasn't all that I expected it to be.the food wasn't seasoned that well seasoned either, the sausages weren't fully cooked either. overall first experience wasn't everything I was told about. I would give this a 1/5 and my reason is because they had the food hot SB: NEVER GOIN BACK!!!!",Don't waste your time.... the service was subpar. The food was mediocre. This is nothing like the DC location. I'm not even going to waste a review. Just spend your money elsewhere if you're visiting.,"This place is wonderful. Staff was really great we especially enjoyed the way Chay chay continued to check in on us and make sure we had everything we needed. The pricing was pretty decent considering some of the places I have been. The drinks could have used an extra shot. (A little watery) Crawfish great, crab legs excellent. Will I go back, of course!!!","Hot and juicy has a serious reputation for being one of the best seafood places in America, so my expectations was high. We ordered alot of food. We ordered two buckets of seafood combos, oysters, mozzarella sticks, and  snowcrabs. Oh yeah and we ordered drinks. So the bill was high lol I had a whiskey sour and I was kinda drunk lol. Everything I ate, just came at a blur. I just ate. But there was an error on the crawfish. The crawfish was small and there was nearly any meat. But I was aware that it wasn't fresh. The taste was sweet and nice though. The stuff with the combo was good to have. Potatoes, sausage, corn, and the sauce was awesome. Oysters had a nice clean taste, the mozzarella sticks was good, the sausage was nicely cooked, and drinks had me eating lol. But the crawfish was kinda of a let down. Overall rating is 4/5.",I'm loving the 2 pound bags of shrimp. Ya heard. Make sure Neimra and Tahirah are in to take care of you,Hot N Juicy Crawfish
622,"Not sure what all the hype is about this restaurant. Had an early dinner here on a Friday night with two friends.  Crowds of people were coming in.  Music is too loud to have a conversation.  For drinks, I had the pepinada - was more sweet than spicy. Too much cucumber. Then I had just a regular spicy margarita which also wasn't very good - too much mix in it.  Drinks were more expensive than what is on the menu online. For dinner, we shared guac which was tasty but small portion. We had the cheese dip dish which was weird - hard to pull apart. We shared the fish tacos and the brisket tacos. Brisket was good. Fish was okay. Very tiny. We also had the avocado fries which weren't that great.  Service was attentive but they kept on clearing plates without even asking if we were done. Overall everything about this place is mediocre and not worth the price.","What a rip off. Over priced -can you say $9 for a 4"" street taco?Pitcher of margaritas that has heartburn inducing sour mix-$60Find a bodega. You'll be better off","$13 for three 3"" street tacos. Thirteen dollars for three embarrassingly small corn tortillas with meat and onions. I won't be going back.","Went with a group for a friend's birthday. We made reservations due to the group size. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. We had the queso dip and guacamole which was really tasty. Ordered the chicken tacos with rice. The chicken was authentic and very flavorful. The rice was okay but needed some sauce to flavor it. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal and the overall experience there. Overall, good atmosphere and experience especially due to group size. The staff was friendly and worked to accommodate us. I would check this out again when return to the area. Good food, prices, and nice space.","Completely upset at knowing I spent any type of money here but happy at the same time because I know not to go back. I ordered an avocado salad from the Ritual app using the dollar special they had going on this week. I wasn't expecting to get anything grand for that same reason but I also didn't expect to get ""salad"" I got. I paid an additional $5 for a piece of grilled chicken. On the app, it asks if you want the ingredients mixed, any additions/substitutions, etc. I specifically asked for beets to be removed, oil and vinegar (which is an option they give), and the chicken. When I got back to work and looked at everything, the chicken was in a separate plastic container, the avocado was smaller than the palm of my hand and I have a small hand, the beets were very much present and the kale looked like it was taken directly from a bag onto the plastic container. Nothing was mixed and everything was dry. Although I only spent $6.33 to be exact, I now know not to spend anymore. The same avocado salad goes for $10 and to add chicken would be another $9 according to their menu online. I would've hated to spend that much more.","Came here on a date night and had only an average experience, at best. With plenty of reservation options available on a Saturday night, we took a table at 8pm with most of the restaurant filled. Ordered a few appetizers (including your standard chips with guacamole and salsa) and settled on a few entrees. Our waitress was very nice and immediately served us drinks including a frozen margherita and mojito. We could hear ourselves talk and managed to have enough time to breath before having our food finally arrive, a huge relief for dining in a place like NYC. But after ordering our drinks, it took us a while to order food given how overstretched the waitressing staff seemed to be. Their menu is fairly small with few selections for vegetarians besides the Chile Relleno entree- a dish containing roasted poblano peppers filled with quinoa, mushrooms and kale, Oaxaca cheese, crema, tomato and habanero salsa. Their appetizers include sopa de tortilla, queso fundido (melted Mexican cheeses, flour tortillas and tomatillo salsa) and taco options including the ""chapulin"" (with oxacan grasshoppers). Our dishes came in a timely fashion with fairly big portion sizes, but the quality just didn't feel up-to-par as other Mexican restaurants in the area. Finally for dessert, we were quite pleased to have had a second dessert ""on the house"" (chocolate cake with pop rocks) to complement our chalupas. Overall we ate well but the ingredients didn't taste the freshest and our service wasn't the greatest. There are a TON of Mexican food options in Hell's Kitchen so it's doubtful we'll be back for seconds.",Tacuba Hell's Kitchen
623,Probably my own fault but the kimchi ramen was very whatever.  Not sure about this one at all. Sorry guys not your biggest fan or did I order the wrong dish. Place is nice though.,"Very underwhelmed, americanized/Asian fusion flavorsWhat we got:***Kale salad with fried sweet potato, golden raisins, and fried seaweed tempura? -really good, could eat a whole bowl to myselfRamen ughh starting off the bowl priced as $14 with no proteins , pricey We got the Miso As well as Sesame garlic ramen. Decent sizes, but both lacked that simmering for hours umami-ness, no depth of flavors.My sesame garlic ramen was not worth finishing.Bottom line: I'll come here if I just want salad","Service was excellent but quality of the food was average. Tried the pork buns, miso & soy ramen. Porks buns had a little much mayo for me and not enough meat. The miso broth was a little on the salty side and soy was okay but nothing special. I did enjoy their curly yellow noodle. They were cooked well and still had some bite.","Let's get right into it. Chuko's menu isn't exactly fun. You get 4 different ramen body options all with no meat or proteins involved but each a different broth so make sure to ask for a run down. If you want to add anything it's going to cost you. For 1 piece of pork 1.50 or ground pork or an egg, etc. It feels a lot like a cheap pay to play (expensive really) game. That being said plan to spend at least 20 to get what you'd expect from you average ramen bowl. One bonus is for the veggie lovers you have options as any bowl is Veg friendly from the start. Fortunately I got over it quickly and said fuggit I want me some ramen. I got the miso bowl with one piece of pork, ground pork, rayu garlic chili oil and a soy marinated egg. As you can see, yes I would like to add guac(if You missed this reference go ahead and skip this review). The broth was thicker and buttery which is exactly how I like it. The spice from the ground pork gave it a rich orange-reddish hue. I usually shy away from spice but as long as I'm spending I mind as well punish myself a little too. It's a solid medium broth, I've had heavier but the flavor is there. The noodles were thick and cooked perfectly. The corn was sweet and a great counter balance to the spice and saltiness of the broth and protein. The miso ramen comes with cabbage which in general I can do without in any ramen. They feel like large incongruent guests in the bowl. No flavor and awkward to bite into leave the greens for dinner with your parents. The ground pork was a mild spice at best(which I think is perfect). There was enough kick to let me know they play with fire but not enough to burn. The slab of pork was okay, not as soft and melting in your mouth and the taste was actually akin to what I grew up with. It was good but in my ramen I love feeling like it came right off the grill with the charred flavor of most ramen spots. Still I'd recommend it. Broth- 4 out of 5 noodles. Medium heaviness with your classic miso taste. Definitely will be back for more. The outfit- 3 out of 5 noodles. it's pretty to look at as I don't normally have orange ramen. The vibes- 4 out of 5 noodles. Cool, modern, minimal. The music was nothing to note. We got there right when it opened so it was quiet which gave it an intimate feel. Staff is friendly and smiling. However they did not have a happy hour, they should cuz it'll help me say fuggit add TWO eggs in this mutha. Overall I'm gonna give Chuko a 4 out of 5 dumplings because 1- the name. ""We're going to Chuko's tonight to get drunk on ramen."" That's fun to say. While the pricing feels like a bit much they make up for it with the vibe and taste. Staff is super friendly and more than happy to explain the menu to you which is better than most ramen spots in nyc. If you end up going say hi to Micky for me and tell them I sent you- trust me they'll have no idea what you're talking about.","I came on a weekday during the afternoon and there wasn't a line. I must have made it after the lunch and before the dinner rush. The ambience like everyone else is saying is very modern and slick. I ordered the the sesame garlic ramen which is the tonkotsu base ramen and the pork bun. The ramen broth was rich, but not too fatty; it was just right. The BIG disappointment with the broth was that it was TOO salty and this is coming from someone who loves his salt. I'm the type of guy who only uses salt with sesame oil as my condiment of choice when I'm eating korean bbq. The noodles was perfect and there was a lot of noodles! My only other disappointment is the price. I also agree with some yelpers. Maybe it's just New York, but $14 for just the base (noodles, broth and veggies) with $1.50 per topping is a bit much(especially 1.50 per slice of pork, but they are thick slices). The pork in the pork bun was cooked perfectly it was moist and juicy. Unlike other ramen places they don't sear or season the pork at all; it's very clean, a good cut of meat and well cooked. They let the pig do the talking.","nice place, loved the interior. Everyone was super friendly.Got the tots and ramen.Tots were different and def interesting dish but I wish there was more SAUCE it got a little dry towards the bottom so I was like meh.My thing with ramen is I love when its premade with toppings and i just ask for extra meat or whatever. Here basically you pick soup and then toppings which was meh for me. It was  tasty but I wasn't as amazed as I thought I would be given the raving reviews.",Chuko
624,I liked the flavor of the beef wrap and the scallion pancake was good. Has somewhat of a soggy consistency. I did not like the jasmine green tea with the hard boba. Too much ice in the cup.My friend did not like his chicken bowl because it didn't have many veggies. Didn't feel like a balanced bowl. Very wasteful to be given a plastic lid for the rice bowl even after we said we were dining in.,"Not good. Tried 3 things here:1. Pancake with curry dip: just okay. Dripping with oil and the curry sauce was oily too. Not much flavor.2. French fries: these were not bad, but I ordered them with nacho cheese sauce and they came with some added white cream sauce on top that I wasn't a fan of. Would it kill you to list what toppings you're using?3. The spring roll mac and cheese was the worst. Super oily to the point where all I can taste is oil and grease. The mac and cheese flavor wasn't even there.So yea, this was one of the unhealthiest meals I've ever had and it was definitely not worth it. Stay away.","Ok, so you can call me a liar if you must but this place deserved a 5 star the first time around because I CAN NOT get enough.Granted- I still only order in but my god, is this food delicious.I crave it constantly. My go to order is the Korean style Bao and the Philly cheesteak wrap, add spicy mayo and a Thai iced tea. Guys, these flavors are incredible. I should try something else I'm sure,  but I just can't get enough.Definitely a favorite and a go-to.","I'm eating this tonightIt's probably gonna start a fightI know it tastes so rightHey bao come onI love food endlesslyWhen I'm in NYCSo now it's time to eat and eat it aloneI know that I eat no moreIt ain't no lieSo I'm taking this food out the doorBaby Bao Bao BaoBao Bao!Don't want share my food with youThis order is not one that I made for twoYou may hate me but it ain't no lieBaby Bao Bao BaoBao Bao!Don't want to make it toughI just want to tell you that there ain't enoughIt might sound crazy but it ain't no lieBaby Bao Bao Bao!Why did I wait so long to re-try the damned Bao here? They are so good!In fact I've never had one that I liked in my life until I tried this one. Yes it might be a little bit hipsterfied, but in this case that's a really good thing because they added really really top quality kimchi and Korean beef and spices to a very well made Bao, and they've turned something which I always skip on Dim Sum menus, and never enjoy on any homestyle Chinese menu, into something that I would eat and eat and eat again and will even recommend to people.So this place, which moved here from Queens a long time ago and which is serving up a type of food that I don't even like, is now one of my favourite snacks on the whole island.Oh, and the server was really cool as well especially in that he told me where to go to use the bathroom.If you want chips, go to the FRITO LAYO SHOPPEIf you want condiments, go straight to the MAYO SHOPPEIf you want condoms, I prefer the other WAYO SHOPPEBut if you want Bao, it has to be the BAO SHOPPEIf your name is Cruz, you came from the TAIO SHOPPEIf your cat needs neutering, go straight to the SPAYO SHOPPEItalian? Friends with Kashif? Nadia? That's the MATTEO SHOPPEBut if you want a snack in Manhattan go to the BAO SHOPPEWHAT?","This food may cause me to become Baosexual.Bao Shoppe looked pretty fancy back in Astoria, which is where I first tried it. Now it's just another trendy place in Chinatown, known as ""the place that moved from Queens."" I finally tried the new location and I like it just as much as the original, even though I prefer Queens. I don't know why people say it's ""real"" though. It was always more Manhattan. That's why it makes more sense for it to be here. Queens is real, Manhattan is trendy. These Baos are good, but trendy. Innovative. Fusion. Experimental. Edgy. Very, very Manhattan. I prefer traditional foods, but as far as innovative Bao go, these are good.","This is a great little gem in Chinatown (near East Broadway) for a quick bite! My friend and I came on a Friday afternoon and got their curry fries, OG Bao, Korea Philly Bao, and the pancakes with curry sauce. My favourite was the curry fries-- they were such a perfect mix of the crisp from the fries DUNKED in SUCH SAVOURY CURRY it was incredible. I was so happy!! The baos were phenomenal as well, super stuffed. During our meal I saw them squeezing a bunch of lemons and I got really excited because I didn't know they offered freshly squeezed lemonade so def coming back for that as well. No bathroom, so you have been warned.",The Bao Shoppe
625,"Haven't had a brunch this bad in a while. It honestly felt like brunch from Hell. We came in on a Sunday when they had a live bluegrass band playing. Totally a preference thing, but I personally find this genre absolutely grating. The type of music you start making when you've been in isolation and inbreeding hard. Anyway, this review isn't for music. The food was just so mediocre! It was mostly generic Tex-Mex fare. Exactly the Mexican food you deserve while you're listening to redneck jazz. Burrito was bland, mostly just over cooked scrambled eggs wrapped in a gummy tortilla and drenched in watery hot sauce. Served with 3 nuggets of unseasoned potatoes. Pathetic. $16, in no universe justifiable. Coffee was dirt water. No one seemed happy with their food. It was just the lot of us, slowly shoveling tasteless, tepid, soft mounds into our mouths. Service was fine though, can't fault them for anything.","I was in the neighborhood for a film so I wanted to try something different so local and Mediterranean sounded right up my alley. I ordered the French onion soup, which was lukewarm. My bf ordered pulled pork tacos and a sandwich with a side of chips, both were underwhelming. I ordered a Chilean sea bass, which was pretty steep,(attributed to local procurement) but again, the fish was lukewarm and the portion left me hungry for more. I'm not sure but I feel as if we ordered more alcohol we would have received better service.",I can only review the service because myself and my other half walked in. Asked if we could sit at the bar and as we sat down the bartender didn't even acknowledged us being there. He kept on walking back and forth. Fed another employee chocolate while we waited for him to finish hoping we can grab his attention. 7-10 min passed by another couple sat at the bar and he directly went to them. Needles to say we walked out.,"Love this place! Been a regular here for roughly 4 years. Know some of the staff. Worked with some of the staff on side projects.Came in here with a friend recently and had a great time. We paid our tab, I went to the bathroom came back, my friend went to the bathroom, I took a sip of my full water and the older male barback/bartender with the salt and pepper beard on September 29th at roughly 4 pm bussed my full water immediately after I took a sip... I mean I know I paid my tab but I'm not suddenly chop liver buddy... and to take the water away so abruptly and then practically snap a 'thanks goodbye' at me... made it seem like I had stiffed him on the tab or something when I left way over 20% in cash. I'm in the industry, I know what tips mean.Anyway, we left, toured my friend through my old stomping grounds and came back for a game of pool and enjoyed some of Christina's company which refreshed at least my experience...","Updated Review (2019)I can say that this place is now 'super'. An 8-member group of us had brunch here, and I will say that the service and food were definitely top-notch. I do not think there were any complaints within the group about our dining experience. My small complaint is that the live band is a bit loud, but the kids in the restaurant seem to like it. Note: the restaurant is very kid-friendly. Also, I called the restaurant and the hostess, who was working brunch on 9/1, was super (see what I did ;) ), friendly and accommodating. If you are super hungry at brunch, I would highly recommend getting the pork chops and eggs. Man, that pork chop was HUGE and beautifully prepared. ---------","I do not know about the super part.I will say that the bar/restaurant has a really cool layout and the decor is very artistic. The place kind of has a fusion between the old and new school in terms of decor. It seems that this place invites a very diverse group of people, which is one of the things that I love about New York (but we are seeing less of in the city).  I did not experience the food here, although the pictures of the pork chops look pretty amazing. Superfine has a very nice list of beers and cocktails, so everyone can find something that they like.Although the bartenders were very nice, the service could have been a little better. Even though we are sitting at the bar, it seemed like we had to shoot a flare gun in the air to get any of the bartenders' attention. I think that many folks from the neighborhood hang out at Superfine, which is cool, and the bartenders were chatting with them. I mean they weren't extended conversations but it felt like we were waiting a long time to get acknowledged for ordering drinks.",Superfine
626,"Oof. I was so deceived by all the Yelp reviews. Really friendly staff, but overpriced everything with bad food. I had a coworker from New York say Little Italy isn't where you go for real Italian food and I definitely should have listened. We got seafood pasta that was waaaaay overcooked and I can't remember the other pasta I got, but it had pork and beef stuffed into pasta. I couldn't finish it because it was so salty. Maybe it was one off experience, but I was definitely put off by the experience.",Friendly staff! Food okay! Bread wasn't good at all. Red Sauce was watery! Fettuccine Alfredo was good though.,"Can get enough of this place every time i take a trip to nyc this is the first place i eat for Alfredo and homemade pasta and sauce, i will be back every time I'm in the area and I suggest you do the same the staff is the same every time i go and they are so nice and fast I can't recommend the place enough the food and staff speaks for itself!","This has been a go-to spot for me in Little Italy. I absolutely love the atmosphere, the old-time classic music, and the friendly staff; particularly Oscar!  It looks like it hasn't changed in decades, and feels so very comfortable and inviting.The food is classically Italian, and more than enough to fill you up.  I had the Lentil Soup, the Penne with Vodka Sauce, and Chicken Parmigiana.  It was perfect and flavorful.I love my relationship with these folks, and it will continue for many years.","Oh boy, this is a hole-in-the-wall that really delivers some good food. We came for the 3 course lunch which was $15.95 a person. Jeez the food was incredible. We started with the lentil soup which was perfect on a cloudy, cold day. The linguine with marinara was amazing, and the pasta here is actually properly al dente. The chicken parm was insane; it came with nicely browned cheese, and some roasted veggies. Overall, the portions were massive, and we left really really happy.Oh, and shout out to Oscar, who took care of us the whole time. The staff here is awesome. I always come to Benito One when I can!","I would honestly rate this place 100 stars if it was an option. This was my favorite place I went to during my first trip to NYC. The food was excellent, the wine was incredible, the dessert was to die for. We had a table right outside and it was absolutely perfect!",Benito One
627,"Definitely disappointed with our brunch experience at this Americanized Spanish tapas chain.  The service was slow, disjointed, and inattentive and the food was inconsistent.The table ordered the two rounds of Bloody Mary's, the Pimientos de Padron, two Huevos Benedictinos (with Salmon), and one Huevos con Chorizo.  Initially, the meal went off without a hitch.  Drink in hand, noshing on some solid shishito peppers!  However, it took 45 minutes for our brunch entrees to arrive despite the restaurant being at less than half capacity.  In addition, it took 10+ minutes for the second round of drinks to arrive after our meal had finally been plated due to our waiters forgetfulness and an incredibly slow bartender.The eggs were well prepared, but the mixed green salads served with our Huevos Benedictinos came with way too much salt!  In fact, salt is all you could taste.It's a double disappointment given that this restaurant charges premium prices for less than premium execution.  #NotARepeatCustomer","Went Saturday before Christmas with a group of 54.5 stars for the food, we got the cheese chicken croquette, seafood paella, scallops, Brussels sprouts, grilled octopus and a pitcher of sangria and ended with churros as dessert ... Service was -1 stars, we had a very hostel server who was very condescending.... when she told us about the special ""squid ink pasta"" we were contemplating between the seafood paella and squid ink pasta and she told us ""you know they're two different things""  Which we thought was an awkward comment because she was stating the obvious... but it what really solidified  her  poor attitude was when she rolled her eyes at us when we asked her about the wait time for the seafood paella ... she stated ""you know paella takes45 minutes"" .... It was all very strange... I've been in NYC for 6 years and yelp elite for 3 years and I've never had experienced such poor attitude service at a restaurant.The bills ended up being $200... UGH ... I would have recommended this place if the experience was more pleasant ... what a shame TL;DR: Disappointed","We had family fly in from out of town and chose this restaurant for dinner on Saturday night. We booked a reservation here several days in advance to make sure we'd be able to accommodate our group of six during the busiest time to get a reservation in New York City. We had eaten here just a few weeks before with s group of 6 on a Saturday night and didn't have to order off of a special menu. We got a call shortly before our reservation on Saturday informing us that we will need to order off of their special $50 per person menu because we are a group of 6. We explained that we didn't have to do that last time, had family visiting and had this reservation for a while, and asked if they could accommodate us with a regular menu because it was so last minute that we would have trouble booking something elsewhere and were not interested in their special menu. They refused to accommodate us, even though when we originally booked this there was no mention of this requirement. Talk about bad service. This place has unfortunately become another example of getting ripped off in New York City.","We went to the restaurant with a group of 7 for my birthday dinner. When you have more than 6 people, you can only do pre-fixed dinner. There are two different levels: $49 and $60. The staff is going to pick the dishes for you. It is actually more convenient for a group and the staff did have a good pick. She balances well between meet and vegetables. I like the clams, the octopus, the short ribs, and the seafood paella. There are a lot of food and they are delicious! The staff are also very sweet and they wrote a birthday card for me. Thank you! The restaurant is also great for group dinner and celebrations!","So my husband and I consider ourselves churro connoisseurs and looking at yelp saw that this place had several Churro options. (I think they've updated their menu since some of these pictures were posted-like I didn't see the churro ice cream sandwich on the menu that was pictured on the yelp food photos). We ate dinner elsewhere and decided to stop at Boqueria on our way home to grab dessert. It was around 6:45-7 on a Thursday night. Very small out side seating area, but was empty (was chilly outside and actually started raining but the awning covered us-but probably only reason there was availability). Looked like the Inside was crowded. Service was very friendly. Dog was allowed in area and given water. We chose the churros rellenos dulce de leche -got 5 for 11 dollars. You can get 9 for 17 I believe. We LOVE our desserts a la mode. So we asked for ice cream on the side. The waiter asked how many scoops 1 or 2. We said 2, we weren't driving. It was delicious. Churros and ice cream very good even if the ice cream scoops were the size of little melon balls.HOWEVER-we got the bill and were charged 21 dollars (after tax) for this small dessert! I don't care if this is NYC, that's insane. Great dessert but not worth 21 dollars. You can see the size in the picture attached with this review.","Meh. I've had better tapas. Sangria was fine. Nothing spectacular but nothing wrong with it. The bacon-wrapped dates are my all-time favorite. I detest bleu cheese and was hopeful that I could pick it out. Wrong. I ended up sending them back after 1.5. Also, be cautious...they're not depitted. That seems like a liability. I haven't seen that in any other tapas place with this dish. We had the eggplant, which was surprisingly good. I'm not an eggplant fan. The patatas bravas were okay until you got to the bottom. I really didn't like the spicy tomato base. My favorite was probably the tomato bread...lots of garlic and good quality prosciutto. The garlic shrimp were also pretty good, though nothing that really stands out from the crowd. The service was lackluster but to be fair, it was happy hour and they were super busy. I wouldn't hold it against them, but they could maybe use more servers during the surge. Overall, probably wouldn't come back. There must be better tapas in this amazing city.",Boqueria UES
628,"Not sure why I gave it a 3.5 before, this is definitely a 4.5 or 5. Things to order:-gimlet-lamb shank-tahini & date salad-feta herb flatbreadPass on:-catch-of-the-day-eggplant mainAlso a tendency for the servers to be sort of obnoxious, better-than-you white men. But not all.","This place is overrated. I never write bad reviews but here it goes. As soon as you walk in the door the host is rude. She let us know that the bar would be available in a half an hour and then when we came back she was absurdly rude saying we misunderstood what she said so as to cover up her own errors. When we pushed back to let her know that she told us 7 pm she insisted that my boyfriend was rude and being ""rough"". The owner disappeared from the incident and stood behind the bar. When we sat down to eat- we we're recommended a rosé that was blah, too sweet, cheap. The food took a while to come and when it did the feta bread was extremely salty with low quality cheese and way too much of it for the amount of bread. Everything was too salty. The lamb shank too. The food was seriously just fine.  My boyfriend took a sip of his water and found a piece of glass in his mouth. When he told the bartender what happened nobody did anything- no apology or word from the bartender- who was cold---no notifying the manager. The place should know the number one rule of business which is treat the customer well- from the first step in, to the empty reserved tables, to the food, to the glass- nothing went well and no one was there to correct it with a complimentary dessert. The restaurant needs a warmer approach and a less defensive and uptight host.","Came here in December with a rezzie for 5 people.  Had been dying to get in since the infamous NY Times Article on how great it was.  The good:+cute vibe in the heart of BK neighborhood off Flatbush Ave.+nice, simple restaurant that is loud and lively but not too loud or lively.+the food is very good and authentic.The bad:-HOLY SHIT IT IS OVER-PRICED.  you can get the same meal easily in Boston or NYC for probably half the price and 4X the authenticity. But, you pay for fancy ish. -the service was TERRIBLE. they forgot things we ordered and were so slow getting us drink, food, and take our order, etc. that eventually the person who owned the restaurant had to take our orders.Would only be back for drinks, not food.","Scored the last 6 PM res on opentable by checking randomly the night before. Start with the eggplant dip, you won't regret it. Don't pass up the kofte meatball, the sauce and tender meatball will have you keep returning back to the dish. The roasted cauliflower is spicy as warned but goes well with the yogurt underneath. The lamb shank is tender will all the meat falling off the bone but the steak kebabs are some of the BEST marinated steak we've ever had!  The pomegranate flavor really comes through and the steak is perfectly marbleized. Both went well with the carrot rice. Tahdig wasn't quite like homemade but is always a treat!Ice cream sandwich was unique and delish - the ice cream is all 3 flavors of pistachio and saffron with rosewater. Incredible food!","I came here on a Friday night and had reservations for 745 and it's a good thing I had reservations because it stayed packed. They do apparently have a downstairs room too though that is meant for walk ins. Everyone was super kind and welcoming and the menu was very interesting, there wasn't really anything bad but I didn't leave feeling like I have to come back. We had the eggplant and Whey dip which was very good but also very rich, I had to stop eating it at a certain point worrying I wouldn't feel so good later. We each got the lamb shank and then split the orange zest and carrot rice which was really good but also slightly less flavorful than I would've expected. The lamb was incredibly juicy and just came right off the bone without even a knife, could be cut with a spoon.For dessert we got the ice cream sandwich, the ice cream was so flavorful and interesting, highly recommend!","Really beautiful spot with some solid Persian food. It's white and expansive and spacious and doesn't get too loud. I ordered a bunch of things, including:roasted cauliflower - not my favorite. It was a little too oily, and could have been more seasoned.grilled carrots and yogurt - the grilled carrots really brought out its natural sweetness, and was really tasty. orange zest and carrot rice - this is pretty standard, but the long grained rice was fluffy and fragrant.lamb shank - the lamb shank was pull-apart tender. The crispy onions was a nice touch, and the broth was really tasty and worked well with the rice.smoked eggplant - my favorite part of this dish was probably the poached eggs that I could swirl around with the roasted and charred eggplant.tahdig - these were just a few pieces of crispy rice bits; I don't feel like I need to have ordered them again.",Sofreh
629,"Wat in ACTUAL tarnation. We came to NY and stayed for not even 72 hours and felt the need to eat here not once, not twice, but THREE times. My sister is vegan (I'm not) and it's not like there aren't a plethora of amazing options...Champs is just that dope.One late night run and two breakfast stops- there is not one thing we had that didn't rock my world. Seitan asada fries, tatertachos, breakfast burrito, kickin' cowgirl, mac and cheese, the burger with the artichoke dip and onion rings- everrrrry thing had amazing flavor and such a good mouth feel. If I lived in NY I'd be at this place every damn week. Food aside, the service was also amazing, everyone was super nice, and one of the waitresses even spotted us some of her glitter for the pride parade. If you're vegan/vegetarian/carnivorous/human I highly HIGHLY recommend.","ONE OF THE BEST!!!!-Mac n Cheeze, Po Boy, and Buffalo Cauliflower are all worth trying, open late too.","I have never experienced a restaurant where the customer service and staff were as abysmal as Champs Diner. Ever.My friends and I came by (they are both vegan) for a late night crave so we got take out. Upon ordering, the staff was dismissive and cold -- but it's late so alright I'll let it slide. Next, we were waiting by the counter area (NO ONE ELSE WAS THERE) when we were promptly told to literally wait outside -- no please, no question, no nothing. They literally just kicked us out, and it's not like they had any new customers coming in or that they needed the space. Next, when our orders were ready, they stupidly decided to call out our names, even though the restaurant was very loud, we were outside, and we couldn't obviously hear. Once we saw them with the take out bag and checked it was ours, they seemed so impatient, like WE were the idiots for not hearing them over the noise inside and the WALL. Oh, did I mention the food took forever too? And they forgot nearly half the order, at which point we were the ones who had to point it out.The staff also had the nerve to start putting up chairs before closing and while half the restaurant was still packed -- if you want to get out so bad, maybe just close early.The arrogance, rudeness, and unprofessionalism of this staff makes me want to never come back, regardless of food quality.","Chicken and waffles ? Lobster roll ? Someone please tell me why humans keep eating animals at this point ?! LolChamps food is soooo good. They need to expand to ATL (wink*wink) I came on a Monday afternoon. Maybe 11:30 and it was crowded. Maybe 1 extra table. I was surprised. But after eating the food, I totally understand. I had the chicken and waffles and it was delicious! The waffle was a crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. The chick'n was soo good. I loved the breading and it wasn't dry on the outside. Im pretty sure it was soy. Im not a fan on seitan so this was perfect.My grandma had the lobster roll and fries & she loved it. She said it tasted just like seafood & the rolls was crispy & buttery. She loved it. Only bad thing is we ordered biscuits & butter to go and about 10 mins after leaving, the brown paper bag ripped and my biscuit rolled on the nyc streets. I was sad af ! Get better bags :) lol","First visit, came for date night.  Parking is scarce (street parking).  We came around 7pm and the first available parking spot was two blocks down. Restaurant is small and seating is tight, very little elbow room between guests.  Food was good and our servers were very efficient.  We started off with the cauliflower wings.  It was very spicy but good.  For our entrees we ordered the Reuben and the Mac attack bowl.  I ordered the Reuben and was surprised at how closely it mimicked a meat texture. I highly suggest the Reuben. My fiancé ordered the Mac bowl and enjoyed it thoroughly. Spices from the buffalo sauce with the grilled chicken, cheesy from the Mac n cheese, and tangy flavors from the pickled onions, it was a first for him but he was very pleased.  We decided to order dessert, the Cooke dough sundae.  The ice cream looked to be home made.  I wasn't to hot about the cookie dough taste, the cookie itself would have been better enjoyed if it were crunchy but overall it was good.By the way....everything served is entirely ENTIRELY PLANT BASED and FREE OF DAIRY PRODUCTS","I have to say it was quite delicious... Their philly  cheese steak is on point. Their chocolate chip cookies are HUNORMOUS! All the servers were really nice but the gentleman behind the counter who sold me the cookie was mehh as far as costumer service. (I'm really big on that and can read faces really well). The AC was blasting so I was freezing, I recommend a sweater!The food was honestly worth every penny!",Champs Diner
630,It was really a mixed experience here that could easily have been 5 stars.  The food was outstanding and definitely exceeded expectations.  Prices are high but this is NYC so you expect it.  We had a major failure in the service department whereby we had a gap of approximately an hour from the time we received our appetizers to the main dish.  Our waiter and the rest of the staff disappeared.  Chicken under the brick was an amazing dish - definitely get this.  Avoid the uni pasta dish - way overpriced and underwhelming.  Another major miss is the ridiculous wine pricing.  Beyond marked up and no real values to be had.,"Came here for my birthday a few years back and boy was I disappointed. This place was way too hyped up with its reviews and after organizing it with a prefix menu, the food wasn't even all that great. I was actually shocked especially since the service was on point. I couldn't believe that the price and the food didn't align. If I remember correctly we had the chicken and it was not very moist as I would've imagined it. I really wish this place was better as I had put it in my bookmarks for the longest and wanted to try it but it was no up to par. Sadly I won't be making another trip here","Was looking forward to this dinner forever. But the service from our waiter was so bad. He was incredibly rude. We were a group of 4. We sat for a while without menu's. Then when ordering drinks we asked do you have pinto grigio ? And the waiter said No.He didn't offer an alternative he was short and rude with his response. The entire night he was rude to our guests. They were vegan/vegetarian so had  minimal options so went with small plate rather than an entree and he asked twice what else do you want in an annoyed manner because they were only getting a small plate. Honestly said AND?!?!? In an annoyed tone. I got a seafood dish that was nearly $50 and it had 1 scallop, 2 mussels, bread, and literally that's it. It had great flavor but literally there was hardly any food. We then waited for 30 minutes for our dessert and asked for the check instead and our waiter came up and said his shift was over (thank god) . They should've taken the dessert off the bill for how long we waited, they said some machine broke??? Who knows... they gave us complimentary shots but honestly the service was so bad it was whatever.I was so disappointed and borderline embarrassed I brought our guests here and wish I said something to the waiter. Had a really really bad experience overall.The 2 stars are for the flavor of the food and the ambiance is pretty... candles and rustic. The service however is zero due to our rude waiter. I wish I remembered his name.","It's way downtown, which for me was the only downside.Order the Chicken. And the Chile Lobster. And expect to leave happy And extremely full.And a bit poorer.Much of the Food is eaten with your fingers. Don't hesitate to dive right in. It's also a bit rich (greasy, saucy, oily, buttery, fried). But who cares! Do you think about calories when going to Lugers? NO!!!  So you won't care that you've eaten like a million calories. It will become your new favorite place.If you read my other reviews, you will see that I usually only write bad reviews. So to give a 5 ***** for something on Yelp! is rare for me. Enjoy it  on a date. For a birthday. Any special occasion or business meal.","I had such a memorable anniversary at Marc Forgione. From the moment I stepped in to the moment I left I felt fully taken care of. My boyfriend made a reservation a few weeks ago so I'm not sure how it would be like if you were a walk in but they have a bar area to the left that seems like a more casual place. When we sat down we were greeted with a nice card on the table congratulating us on our anniversary paired with a glass of champagne. I loved the personal touches. It seemed like so many people were eating here to celebrate something. The couple to our left was celebrating a promotion and there were a couple of birthdays in the mix. We opted for the tasting menu just because we never came here and wanted to sample what the chef had in mind. The spacing was great and I loved all the food dishes. My favorite was actually the dessert. It was called ""the egg"" and although it was theatrical it tasted great as well. I feel like a lot of other places use theatrics to mask taste. If I were to come back again I would opt for the chicken because that seemed like what everyone was getting. Although, the tasting menu was such a great choice for our anniversary and if you haven't experienced it I think it's a great option especially for the price.","This place is an amazing date night spot. The vibe is great and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Even if you can't decide, the service staff are extremely accommodating with their recommendations. I highly recommend the beet salad. And for drinks, there's this pineapple rum cocktail that's crafted to perfection. Hats off to the bartender on that one.

631,"TLDR; Food poisoning. Fish may be switched out for unfresh fish. Beware.Severely delayed review, as I visited Zauo in late January to celebrate my birthday. [edit: I wanted to give this review detailed attention, and simply just didn't have the time for it. The fact that the response I received to the late review was that if I truly had ""food poisoning like you said,"" I should've posted this sooner was revolting. First of all, I don't live in NY, and had a schedule so tight, writing a review simply wasn't an option until now. Second of all, this response was more upsetting than the situation initially was, being that it was written as if I was making this up. It's not every day that I would choose to publicize that I suffered food poisoning. Such a terrible and rude way to treat customers. I am truly appalled by this response, and DO NOT RECOMMEND this establishment AT ALL.]As exciting and fun this establishment was, I was so disappointed at the freshness of the fish. For a party of 2, they did not have small salmon, but rather, whatever you size salmon you caught, which was meant to fed about 4 people. I was given my fishing license, and a plastic poncho to cover myself, then sent downstairs to fish out my dinner. I was given very little guidance, as someone just handed me a rod and walked away. I dipped the line into the pond filled with large salmon and other fishies, and hoped for a smaller sized catch for that night. After 30 minutes, the fish just kept swimming by the hook, and nothing was happening. I asked someone to help, and they offered to put something else on the hook for the fish. I tried again, and finally something caught on to my line and I felt it struggle. All of sudden, the line snapped and the fish got away before I could even bring a net close to pull it up. I turned to look for an employee for help, and had to keep trying to waive someone down to ask for assistance, but I finally gave up and just grabbed another rod, replacing my current one. After another 20 minutes, I felt that the fish were not interested and just kept shying away from the rods or surface. An employee had to net a salmon up for us. I was given a photo op of the fish, pre-cooked, before they took it in a cart and off they went with our choices of how they would be prepared. We were given four different ways it could be prepared - we chose tempura, double amount of shabu (essentially sashimi, we were told), and another cooked in soy sauce. We were told to return back upstairs to our table as we waited patiently for our prized fish. We were slowly handed 3 plates. When our entire orders were shown, it felt much less than the ginormous salmon I had caught. The shabu style came with a make-shift water boiler made of paper and a candle. It also came with a fly swimming in it. I had to point it out to the server, and she brought us another, with dust that she wiped away as she brought it to our table. We consumed our food, and marveled at the novelty of it all. The salmon didn't taste fresh, to my disappointment and surprise. As I finish my meal, I start feeling bubble guts, and this only happens when I eat unfresh sashimi or sushi. I can't help but realize that this must not be the fish they claimed that I caught. We, of course, had so much leftovers, but we only took the portion cooked in soy sauce, as that tasted a little better than the rest. We placed it in the fridge for the night, and when we opened the fridge a couple hours later, it smelled as if something had died in there. That is not the smell of a regular, fresh cooked fish. It is the smell of old dying meat, masked by the sauces. To wrap this up, we had food poisoning from this experience, and am so disappointed at how great this could've been.","Really overpriced and plays on the novelty of the fishing experience. Fishing was not that fun + tanks made the whole restaurant smell fishy. The food was fine but honestly not worth the price, we were hungry afterwards and went for popeyes","Easily the worst dining experience I've had this year. Let's start with the basic premise of the restaurant. Zauo has 3 large, cloudy-as-heck- tanks in its restaurants and will give you the opportunity to ""fish"" for your fish. Most of these will cost you about $120-150. For one fish. I like spending up for quality food but really? They prepare the fish head-to-tail but that's not really that much food/meat, right? We're talking maybe 20 pieces of sashimi and a fancy cartoon-ish skeleton of a fish brought out to you on a big platter. Given this, our group of 4 opted to skip this and go straight for the cooked dishes (and other sashimi dishes). When it came time to ordering our food, the waiter had absolutely no idea what he was doing. ""What's the price of the uni fried rice? (it read 'MP')""""Oh I don't know. Let me check.""""Where's the uni from?""""Don't know that either. Let me check.""Dude also couldn't remember what we ordered and couldn't do as simple run-down of what'd been brought out and what hadn't come out of the kitchen. We also received our last appetizer after the end of the meal. I want to also flag that the sashimi was the worst damn sashimi I've ever had. The fish wasn't cleaned properly and I felt like I was chewing through strings of floss and uncleaned meat. It was absolutely disgusting. This place is just an all-around joke and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","For this year's birthday dinner, BF took me to Zauo Fishing Restaurant. We didn't get the chance to go when we went to Tokyo earlier in the year, so it was nice to get to try the NYC location. We had a 7 pm reservation for a Thursday night. It was pretty empty, but the restaurant is also pretty huge (2 floors). They give you a menu with the pricing - different types of fish have different prices, the sizes are just big or small (not by weight), and you have the option of fishing it yourself or having the staff do it for you (the latter option is more expensive). We of course chose to fish ourself because that's the whole point of this restaurant experience. We decided to go with a large rainbow trout and a small lobster.First, they give you plastic ponchos to protect your clothing. Then they give you a fishing rod with a bait on it. The rule is that you can't catch and release so if you caught one you didn't like, too bad. It's yours. It was actually pretty difficult catching a fish we wanted. The small and the large fish are in the same tank, so the smaller ones are always the first ones to go for the bait, since they're more agile. We each tried for maybe about ten minutes (the staff was super patient), until the employee finally just told us to point to the one we wanted and they caught it with a net. For the lobster (tank is on the second floor), they give you a long plastic glove and you just reach in and grab the lobster's head. If you don't want to catch your own fish (can get pretty pricey), they have a lot of other options. I would come back and try some of their sushi.Next, you decide how you want your seafood to be cooked. For the fish, they're able to do a mix and match so you can pick several ways too cook it (tempura, grilled, simmered in soy sauce, tataki). Apparently, due to NYC food laws, they can't serve sashimi from a freshly caught fish (makes no sense to me). It's best to ask them how they recommend the catch to be cooked, as each type of fish is different. As we waited for them to cook our catches of the day, we ordered a few apps - salmon sashimi, fatty tuna sashimi, and truffle salmon sashimi (actually had truffle shavings on it). All of them were great but my favorite was the fatty tuna, which melts in your mouth. The soup came out next, which was a nice way to wash all the sashimi down. For an extra $3, you can have them use the bones for a miso broth, so we did that. Both the lobster meat and the fish came out at the same time. We did tataki (lightly seared) for the first half and tempura for the second half. For the lobster, we went with the classic steamed, and then had the head baked with cheese (also extra but so worth it). We really enjoyed both. The fish tempura came with some kind of peanut (?) dipping sauce, which seemed like an odd pairing, but it wasn't bad. The garlic soy sauce (?) that came with the tataki was amazing. We even began dipping the lobster in it. After that, they brought out the baked lobster head. It's a little messy to eat but definitely worth getting your hands dirty for it. To finish it all off, we had the matcha tiramisu. I really liked it because it wasn't too sweet and there was a huge matcha flavor. They also brought out a mango mousse-cake and some ice cream as my birthday treat.Service was great from the beginning to end. Everyone was super helpful and seemed happy that I was celebrating my birthday there. Now, I definitely want to try the one in Tokyo!",Really liked the whole fishing concept.Thought it was really unique and fun.But I felt that for the price the quality of the food and taste didn't meet up.We ordered about 9-10 items and I think the best item out of all was the thick sushi maki.Everything was just ok or below average.First the tuna ochuro was not fresh at all.It had a fishy smell to it and was not buttery at all.The salmon was over cooked.Was told the braised brisket was a thinly sliced meat but a cube meat pieces showed up.The pork belly was a bit too fatty and the meat wasnot as tender as it should be.Service was really slow.All our foods took a bit longer than expected.It was really hard to get the servers attention.Overall experience was not great. Not sure how they have four stars?!?Hopefully it'll get better?,"Came here for the first time a few days ago -- honestly such an enjoyable experience! 3 of us ordered 2 fish, calamari, karaage, and two sushi rolls. the highlight was definitely getting to fish for our dinner though! fishing for your food is cheaper than directly ordering it, and it's so much more fun, so honestly, why not??After a somewhat long debate, we decided on fishing for the rainbow trout and large mouth bass. the steelhead salmon was considerably more expensive, but friends have mentioned that it's the most value for the price. After going downstairs to take a look at the tanks, I can easily confirm that the salmon is very big :) definitely worth the price it's charged. So tldr my girlfriend caught both fish -- the bass was a really quick catch, just a matter of hooking the fish from under its gill. I was supposed to catch the 2nd fish, but I failed miserably and after 10 minutes of me struggling and being picky on which fish I wanted, the employees ended up letting my girlfriend also try to fish for the trout. Within a minute of her joining me, she caught a trout, and as expected, I came up empty-handed :) Still a really fun experience regardless! We decided to have the bass cooked half and half (grilled and shabu shabu) and the trout also cooked half and half (simmered and teriyaki). If my memory serves me right, the salmon had 6 possible ways of cooking and the trout had 9. So many options to choose from! That being said, I have heard from others and can also personally confirm that teriyaki and shabu shabu are great. If you ever get a chance to go, I'd recommend cooking at least one of these 2 ways! All of them were delicious imo though. The appetizers and sushi were both great as well, but it's needless to say they weren't the highlights of the meal. If you're coming here just for the sushi or the apps, you're doing something wrong. Great as add-ons to the main entrees though! Price -- I knocked the star rating down 1 because of price. The taste was great, aesthetics of the restaurant was great, and the interactive nature of the course was also amazing. I would just caveat and say that in order to eat a full meal, expect to spend over $50+ a person. Three of us ended up spending $200 pre-tip, which was a fair price given how much we had ordered. Would definitely come again, but probably not a daily spot! Highly recommend this place even just to try the fishing component of the meal!! :)",Fishing Restaurant Zauo
632,"Very cute restaurant, the food was a huge let down.Pancakes were over cooked and burned, really terrible. Shakshuka, ravioli and farmers breakfast were all completely unremarkable.The second star is only for decor, maybe the drinks are good but I would avoid the food. Also the bathroom fan is broken and smells terrible.","I experienced some of the worst service at this restaurant that I've ever had in New York. Came here during summer for a pleasant brunch with friends, and I picked this place because of the garden in the back. We got seats in the back, and it was very pretty, but the waitress didn't acknowledge us much, and served other tables without coming over to check on us. We had to flag her down several times and ask her for water several times, which she forgot. Finally, another waitress came and brought us water. Food here for brunch was mediocre, with prices being on average around $15 - $20. I had a salmon tartare that was okay, but nothing remarkable. The best thing about this place is the outdoor courtyard in summer. Wouldn't recommend for people wanting a meal here.",To have a nice backyard Is definitely not enough! Went to Milk and Roses after work for early dinner with a friend. Place was really nice... but the food wasn't even okay. My Red Chicken wasn't cooked well.,Beautiful restaurant. The type of place you can stay and chill for hours enjoying cocktails and food. We took our kids which I DO NOT recommend but we had no choice. Walk through the front past the very cool library wall then pass the small quaint bar to the very romantic garden. Great vibe. We split a egg dish up for the two kids and I had the linguini Genovese. So tasty. With short ribs onions and reggiano. Delicious. Great low key spot will be back without the kids.,"Called to make a brunch reservation for the next day, and the lady on the phone said ""WHAT?"" before I could finish my sentence. When I repeated myself, she said, ""Uh, we have a WEDDING here tomorrow"" in a tone that suggested I was privy to Milk and Roses' private event schedule and should have known better than to ask. Then she hung up on me. Hopefully she's not a reflection of the entire restaurant (I ate there once a while back and really enjoyed it) but our phone convo turned me off from ever trying them out again.","This place is such a little gem. Definitely worth the trek to Greenpoint. The decor is beautiful, as is the romantic little greenhouse and garden in the back. The waiters were very sweet too. My friend and I came here for brunch, and we were stoked to learn about their pre-fixe deal, which includes an entree and unlimited mimosas for only $24!! Needless to say, we both got pretty shwastey. I had the mushroom and egg scramble, which came in pretty small portions but was nevertheless on point. I can't wait to come back here to try their lunch and dinner menus! I could see this place being extremely cute at night, especially the garden in the back. Only negative: cash only :(",Milk And Roses
633,"Top 5 favorite restaurant in the city. Never disappoints. Menu changes, but the classics have remained.","The meal was good but not impressive, there're some good aspect but too many bad dishes, there's always some aspect that stand out to much and is to harsh that destroyed the overall balance. Like the razor clam soup, it's delicious but the pineapple flavor was too much and for me it's too acid and sweet. The plating was ugly I have to say, the best dish is probably the foie gras dessert.","The food was nothing espectacular. We sat at the bar and we were expecting something really especial coming out of this super famous place. I was not impressed. The customer service is very good, I like how tip is included in the prices because tipping is the dumbest thing we have to deal with in NY. I don't think I would go back for the restaurant since I wasn't impressed with the food at the bar.","Momofuku Ko may be a bit misunderstood.  This restaurant is certainly not for the uninitiated.  I've had multiple individuals inform me that Ko was just okay and I definitely respect their opinion, but Ko is definitely one of those places where you really have to know and understand what is really being presented in order to fully appreciate it.I loved Ko.  I always say that it was perhaps the best combination of eastern and western cuisine in a tasting menu that I've had yet.  It also might be one of the most unique tasting menus I've come across; there's really no one else that presents the kind of cuisine available at Ko.   Especially when we're discussing restaurants in this upper echelon of culinary experiences, Ko strays from the more familiar formula of classic French with a hint of Japanese offered by the likes of the majority of the Michelin 2/3 star establishments.That isn't to say that I don't love those other restaurants.  My favorite experiences to date have been Eleven Madison Park and The Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare.  But if you've ever asked yourself ""what else is out there?"", then Ko is a great place to start. There were combinations of flavors that I simply never had before.  Who else would have the audacity to serve a sour cream and onion based crisp as the very first amuse bouche?  The lobster tart that immediately followed it was one of the very best introductions to a tasting menu I've ever had. I still think about it to this day.What followed were memorable pickled fish dishes, one of the most subtly formed uni dishes I've had, a poached egg combination I would have never expected to work as well as it did, and this cold roe based soup(?) packed with freshness.  The duck was expertly cooked, which was furthered by the fact that you could see them being hung and aged on the wall lining the counter.  It was paired with a Korean inspired sauce combination that strayed so far away from what I would have ever anticipated.  I really really appreciated the boldness of flavors presented.The desserts were incredibly smart.  The soy based ice cream in particular opened my eyes and changed all preconceived notions I've had about soy products. Ko is a different type of experience. Fortune really does favor the bold and Ko is a restaurant that embodies this mentality.  If you're looking for a totally new experience, something that will try to go above and beyond the tried and true foundations of food, Ko is definitely one of the first places I would recommend.  Go with an open mind and I promise you won't leave disappointed.","This review is for Bar only. Small menu that changes daily but the usuals will always be there - fried chicken, hamburger with foie gras, pickle sandwich, rice dishes, cheesecake, etc. I stuck to the known commodities and hoe stay some of the cheaper items to see how the fare is on a budget. Ko excelled in every level possible. $6 for a huge piece of fried chicken that was chilled. Best price of fried chicken I've ever had. Just a smooth skin with a light coating of sweetness to add a hint of Korean. Side of pickles can't complain. Hamburger was fine. Cool idea with the added foie gras for $19 total. Bread is Hawaiian and makes the dish. Foie gras eh as a bit creamy and not the Pete I expected. Burger fine in this dish but the bread steals the show. Honestly I'd stick to the pickle sandwich for $5 which has same bread. Basic pickles but the bread is what you come for. Beer list small but some real rarities. The bottles aren't affordable such as Cantillon for $90, but I do like the fact that it's there, meaning the bar manager is aware of the good stuff. But I had a fantastic IPA for $13 that is honestly completely fair for the quality and considering it was a pint, almost a steal. Ko blew me away. Small bar area but I snuck in as a one fairly easily at 8pm on a weekday. Guest WiFi available and food comes out quick. Easily a place where you could get out for under $60 full and content or indulge a bit and drink up. The booze will get you here but the food is finger food and small plates of Japanese, at its very best.","Came here with super high expectations and.. maybe Its personal preference, the fried chicken, and pork was on the greasier side for me, and I could eat 1 or 2 pieces of everything. However! Everything else about this place is awesome.Staff: super nice, friendly, didn't give me hard time for being late :p Burger: freaking amazing. The foie gras was definitely not necessary to make it good, but it does bring in more flavor and... sin? It's SUCH A HUGE piece, I'm not complaining, just .. still blown away. Cheese cake: not the traditional Japanese cheese cake I imagined, not the American kind either.. kind of like a cheese cake and angel cake topped with sea salt .. it is also a giant piece .. I feel full just thinking about it now",Momofuku Ko
634,"While I was visiting New York, a friend suggested we check out The Horny Ram for brunch! I arrived at about 10 til and the doors open at 11am (per the chalkboard outside). I waited outside till about 11:05am and I enters the establishment. It was a ghost town, no host, no bartender, no one. I walked in and sat down at the bar to wait. Meanwhile, a dozen other people lined up in front of the hosts booth, waiting to be seated. Finally someone comes down and asks me how I got inside, ""the door was unlocked"" I replied. He says ""we are not open yet, the door was not open. "" The rest of the staff comes downstairs also with the look of disappointment that work must now commence. ""I can leave"" I said - as he walked by and ignored me. The bartender that server us with a smile saved the review to be honest. She assured me it was their bad, not mine for walking into a restaurant. We ordered the avocado toast and we were out of there. The avocado toast was delicious. I was a little mad so I didn't get a picture. Worth going to check out. Tip: arrive around 11:15am and wait for the door to be propped open so that you don't feel like you're being accused of picking the lock.",Started at the bar here with an excellent round of bloody marys while we waited for our table. About 15 min later we were ready to be seated as the rest of our group arrived. Our waitress informed us they had bottomless drinks for brunch. An hour and a half time limit I believe. We asked if we could apply our $30 bill from the bar towards the bottomless and just start the clock from there. No. Seems a reasonable concession given the fact that a) the drink prices are high and b) the bartender should have mentioned we could get the bottomless when we sat down we weren't asking for a freebie - rather a courtesy for the lack of information. Nope. Not a chance. The food was good. But we won't be back. A couple drinks could have made for life long customers. Some restaurants understand the little things that make raving fans. Some don't.,"Come for the name, stay for the ribald stories the place lends itself to, return for the burgers.","Amazing brunch in the city.Was in town for the weekend and wanted to meet a friend from college. Was looking for a place with a vibe but not so much of a vibe that I wouldn't be able to catch up over the music blaring. This place was a hit.Conveniently located within walking distance of all the ""action"", this place also offers a bottomless brunch option which -- as a Miami girl -- what's a brunch without that? Service was exceptional as was the food. We went with popular yelp recommendations and my fellow yelpers were right: the buffalo nachos were out of this world. I'm a buffalo fan and I can't remember the last time I've had buffalo like that. Didn't feel like the sauce came from a bottle 2 mins before they brought me my order (and I could be wrong but if I am someone share the intel, PLEASE) and it was the perfect meal choice to snack on between good convo and drinks.","This is definitely one of my favorite brunch places in nyc (along with its sister store, flying cock)! I've had a seamless experience every time, from brunch to drinks after work. Reservations are honored and timely. The atmosphere is exciting and fun, but not too loud. To top it off the brunch food is amazing. I've had everything from salad to bec donut here, and I've never been disappointed! Their bottomless drinks are truly bottomless, with the waiters/waitresses paying great attention to the diners. You can also switch drinks (mimosa, Bellini, Bloody Mary) throughout the 90 minutes. Bellinis are great here!","While I've heard this is a good place to try for a boozy brunch, I decided to have my bookclub here on a Thursday evening because they burgers are supposed to be very good.Let me start by saying I arrived early and sat at the bar while waiting for my girlfriends.  I was not happy with their happy hour menu selections.  It's basically beer (which I don't drink unless it's a Heinekein) or a red or white wine.  No well drinks - I was highly disappointed.So onto the food......yes the burgers are delicious.  There was four of us - three ordered a burger and one the steak meal.  The food there is really good, the service was good as well.  I had my burger with fixins, cooked a perfect medium well and with a salad instead of fries.  We didn't have too long of a wait and it was hot and fresh.  Our server was also good too as he checked on us constantly and made sure everything was to our liking. I would like to try their brunch and if I'm ever in the area on a Sunday I will definitely do just that.",The Horny Ram
635,One of the best restaurant I visited. Have been passing by this place all the time but never got a chance to try. Now I will come all the time.,"Wonderful service and environment!The plates are very pretty, but I don't recommend coming hungry, as they are very small portions.","It was a total disappointment, both for food and service.A group of 5 went after Sunday matinee.  The waitress was not attentive even though there were few tables there.  We had to flag her a few times to come to our table while she was busy staring into emptiness or on her cell phone... The food was very mediocre.  We had some oysters and and the trio seafood as appetizers.  The trio was better, but oysters were mere an okay.  We also order a whole fish, pasta, seafood with coconut rice and dinner salad.  The salad was absolutely horrendous and sad.  The added shrimp was more like barely being microwaved.  Dessert was also unimpressive with churros.  Drinks was mixed.  We ordered a variety of different drinks, but some of the drinks (white sangria) was so unimpressive that we only finished half... Overall, I think it's totally overrated.  There are better choices in Hell's Kitchen (come on, it's Hell's Kitchen after all!)","Amazing place with great food, cozy atmosphere and amazing service!

636,My wife and I were seated next to the bar this evening when suddenly there were so many people clustered waiting to be seated our dinner was disrupted and their butts were literally in our faces. When I complained to the manager he offered to move us to another table also next to the crowded bar. I suggested he should not allow so many people to cluster over our table and he should ask them to move.  Then he became extremely nasty. I reminded him we were regular customers and I wanted to know who he reported to he finally moved the disrupters and compted our dinner. This is one of the most popular restaurants on the UWS but the quality of food and service is in steep decline. And I don't appreciate being treated so shabbily.,"We ordered dozen of mixed oysters and one of it was metamorphic. We talked to the server and all she said was ""ok"" with nothing else. The result was I thrown up when I got home :((( it does not worth that price","Although the food was good, I must say that it seemed as though everyone who works there is doing us a favor. Really unfriendly attitudes, from the person who answered the phone, to the hosts up front, to the waitress who didn't make eye contact throughout the whole meal. It's almost like the staff is trained to be just slightly nasty -- nothing that they could get in trouble for, because the service was competent - but really just an overall attitude.For that reason, I will not return. A warm smile goes a long way, and the manager or owner should mention that to the staff.",The lobster roll is the highlight of this meal!It's probably the best lobster roll I've ever had yetThe tuna in the salad is very freshRecommend this placeThey also have a good happy hour menu,"Quite enjoyed Mermaid. Tables are tight and we were placed near server station. There you have my one star reduction.But happy hour prices are great. We loved our oysters and HH mini fish tacos. Tacos were small but great flavor and crunch. We stayed for regular priced items too. Octopus dish, Brussels with maple and nuts, were A plus. Great salad with frisée greens. We enjoyed our HH regular lime margarita followed by a nice Chardonnay.It's a cute institution with some decent price points and tasty food.Pleasant server gave us the excellent tip on octopus.Nice little freeby at end--little demitasse of a dark chocolate pudding. For that last little comfort food send-off.Even the butter and bread they start you off with (with logo of course) is very good. Overall, a fun food excursion.Mermaids rule. Will be back.","Always delicious and service always impeccable.I brought some family who were in town and they loved it. We caught the happy hour and tried almost everything.Fried Oysters were the best!!! Snap Peas were amazing. Would get both again.We also had calamari, salmon tartar, crab dip. They were all good. But the only thing I'd get again from that list is the salmon tartar.We also had lobster knuckle which was good. Served like escargot in little wells. Good but I didn't love.Kale Salad the entire table loved. Except me. It was good but I don't like kale.Dollar Oysters and Clams were ok... The oysters I did not love and the clams tasted funny. I wouldn't get the dollar raw bar again.I've since been back and the non dollar Oysters were wonderful. West Coast are always my faves. And had the lobster roll. Also wonderful. Would get both again.Our servers, the hosts, were also so gracious and wonderful. My entire party was late yet they let me sit and order.

637,"Food decent but ordering is a nightmareDidn't bring bbq sauce, called and spoke with the manager for 20 minutes as she tried to ""find my order"". She couldn't send over bbq sauce without contacting a delivery person....I live 4 blocks away I had to walk to the store to get bbq sauce AFTER I ORDERED FOOD AND THEY DIDNT BRING IT!! supposed to come with every order. the manager literally could have walked to my apartment, ate with us, and walked back in the time it took her to NOT ""find my order.can't make this stuff up!","First of all the staff is rude and doesn't acknowledge you. I was hyped after seeing the reviews on yelp but was so disappointed when I tried my food. The wings lacked flavor and just didn't meet my expectations while the Mac and cheese tasted old. The only good thing was the broccoli salad, safe to say I will not be returning and don't get what the hype is about. Maybe I should have tried the ribs guess I'll never know lol They should hire a better staff.","Like the rustic feel with the wooden tables and the wooden backdrop.As a vegetarian usually only eat sides at bbq places. This one was no different. Prices are reasonable. Also liked the fact that the menu specified which items where vegetarian.I ordered the kale salad, mac and cheese and a ginger ale.The kale salad was decent- the pumpkin seeds provided a nice crunch to the salad. Dressing also was good- not too over powering. The mac and cheese was inedible. The cheese was too much! The whole dish was oily and greasy. The pasta itself was undercooked. Was very disappointed with the mac and cheese. Overall was vegetarian friendly but the mac and cheese really was a bummer.","Please name another BBQ spot better than Mighty Quinn. Don't think too hard because there's none - Overall 5/5 experience everything I visit - Fries are not great (only improvement they need to make) - Ribs are amazing - Cole slaw is amazing- Staff is really friendly & would have a conversation with you for like 5 mins- Tends to get EXTREMELY CROWDED in the summer/weekends (~25 min wait) ** Highly recommend checking Mighty Quinn, they will not disappoint","The beef brisket and chicken wings are my favorites to order.  The brisket is super tender. I also LOVE the broccoli salad - it's mouthwatering. It's a great side for a heavy meal.The baked beans are not bad - a bit too salty.Overall, the flavors are always on point. Highly recommend.","I'm going to go ahead and say it: ""Mighty Quinn's is just okay."" I feel like I've had better bbq. I can't even justify this or back this up with from what place and most likely it came out of one of those brisket king or pork festivals I went to years ago. But hey, I appreciate you still Mighty Quinn's. Look what you have going for you: If San Marzano next door has a 45 minute wait like it did last night, probably a good chunk of those folks will end up here. They do have happy hour of $5 drafts until 7pm. Missed it by like twenty minutes but I also didn't feel like drinking and the selection was of all beers I've had before. My food choice was made mostly based off of economic decisions. What is the most I can get for my value here? What is a rice bowl? Meats and vegetables and sides from Mighty Quinn's thrown on top of rice. Interesting. What's this option of 3 sides for basically $10? Okay, I can ride with that. Getting a small portion of meat here alone costs about $9-10. The portion is tiny unless you go for the full pound. Meat costs money. I did try my friend's brisket and it was pretty good. But not the best I've ever had. So for my sides I went with their macaroni and cheese, sweet potato casserole, and baked beans with burnt ends. Mac and cheese - I've apparently tried this before at a food festival my friend told me. I was disappointed. It's cheesy and has a bread crumb topping and its shells which is the perfect vesicle. But its so mushy and bland. Actually, I'm not sure it was even shells anymore because it was so compressed and mushed down into a congealed mess. I enjoyed it still. It became a lead brick of cheese in my stomach later but I wouldn't go out of my way to seek this out again.Sweet potatoes - This was where they shined. I really like the candied pecans. I'm getting up on all those vitamins and orange colored vegetables I'm supposed to be consuming right now. Yeah. It tasted like a savory comforting desert pile of goo. Would come back for.Baked beans with burnt ends - The burnt ends mixed up inside was heaven. I wish there were more. They just kept giving me beans and I maybe got one or two chunks. Sigh. This tasted even better with their cherry chicory tasting hot sauce. This also gave me an ungodly amount of gas last night. Enjoyed.Overall thoughts, the three sides in the rice bowl were almost too much for me to eat. I should have gone with only 2 sides. I noticed after the fact that pickled accompaniment things are free with your order. Sadface. I also noticed after the fact they also have sandwiches here. Maybe that's the route to go but it was only a fried chicken sandwich right now. I enjoyed the outdoor seating. I guess after hearing this hyped up from so many people over the years I was expecting so much more and I was like 'ehhh, kay, next.'",Mighty Quinn's Barbeque
638,"Most brunch places with so-called bottomless mimosas will employ all kinds of corner-cutting strategies to keep you from enjoying your booze. There's the classic absentee waiter. Then there's the mostly-juice-and-increasingly-less-booze technique. And of course, there's the atomic precision time stickling.Rest assured, you won't encounter any of that at Ragtrader. I probably have significant, irreparable liver damage from the generous, heavy-handed, frequent pours of booze during my last visit for a Sunday brunch. To be sure, this is no fault of Ragtrader.The service was impeccable. The server was attentive, never allowing my glass to go empty. But the mimosas were just the prelude to the symphony that was the bowl. Shortly after, our petite server heroically lugged to our table an enormous Swarovski heirloom, filled to the brim with booze. A Herculean task. I started to cry. My liver whimpered.For $25/person for 2 hours, you can do no better than Ragtrader for bottomless mimosas and brunch.","The bartender and server made some of the most inappropriate comments after paying the bill. As someone in the service industry and in Hell's Kitchen, I wish I could have taken every penny of my generous tip back and that's saying a lot. As a female feeling uncomfortable with how a man was approaching me, touching me and groping me all night...I just didn't want to make a scene to stop it...  the bartender's unsolicited chauvinistic commentary and the servers gross ""you're meant for each other"" jokes were disgusting. I was clearly not ok. Go somewhere else where the drinks are better, cheaper and the servers don't join the drump movement. Yuck. I will steer everyone I know away from this place. Date rape and assault...  these are real issues for women and feeling like your bartender and server are there to at the least not blame you but help if needed... that should be a given. I've never felt so left out to hang and blamed for causing my own hanging at any bar before. As my friend and I left, the server's comment toward me was so sad and angry. What world do we live in where the paying customer is crapped on for protecting themselves and where a woman isn't heard at all?  Women and brown ppl... beware. The options are too vast in this neighborhood... move on.","The vibe of this place is wonderful! Made up to look like an old garment factory, you'll find the glass pained windows of yester year dividing the spaces and remnants of fabric spools and thread around. It has a sleek urban feel mixed with by gone day vibes.We only stopped in for a beer on a Saturday afternoon, but the bartender was cheerful (the gal who replaced her wasn't so - in fact, she spent more time looking at her phone then interacting with her customers. We were just sad that the Bo peep portion (downstairs) didn't open until 5pm. We had other plans so weren't able to make it back.","Ambience - 10/10 Drinks - 10/10 Food - 6/10 The decorations are so lit, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Been here a couple of times, love this place","On the surface there is much to intrigue a Yelper about this establishment; a coveted seat in the converted van, the speakeasy-like bar downstairs, & even the name sparks nostalgia of yesteryear. However, the bar lacked the gaiety I hoped it would have & there wasn't an option to sit in the cool van the evening we dined here (they weren't busy enough to open that section.) I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that weekends are totally fun here, but my rating remains a moderate 3 stars for the food, especially compared to other NY restaurants. My companions shared a few seafood dishes: branzino ($34), octopus ($20), & dayboat scallops ($21, they thought there should be one more for the price.) Generous portion on the sriracha deviled eggs ($8), on the other hand, but were shy of incredible. Sweet & sticky pomegranate molasses bbq coated baby back ribs ($15.) Interesting spice in the glaze on the still-crunchy honey roasted carrots ($11.) A fiery stream of rum poured onto sticky toffee pudding finished off the dessert deliciously. But, for the amount paid, I wish we had enjoyed dinner more.","Review for downstairs bar only:I. EFFING. LOVE. THIS. PLACE.First off, it's as gorgeous as Anne Hathaway post-makeover in the Princess Diaries (or The Devil Wears Prada). I want to make it my trophy wife so I can monetize its beauty as an Instagram ""beauty influencer"".Second, the drinks are phenomenal. Some of the most creative concoctions I've found in the city. Try the following: - Black Ink - Pisco, mango, lemon, Moroccan spices, egg white- Dillinger Escape Plan - Rye, lemon, ginger, cinnamon, chamomile, mint- Birds of a Feather - Mezcal, rum, sweet vermouth, cinnamon, and vanillaThird, no one knows about this place. I start saying, ""The Rag Trader and Bo Peep..."" and, people's eyes glaze over because the name's too long and no one likes the Garment District and so many other reasons, which is why coming here at around 5-6pm on any weeknight practically guarantees you any seat of your choice (though it will fill up by 8pm).",The Rag Trader & Bo Peep Cocktail and Highball Store
639,"I don't understand the good reviews of this place.Here's what we ordered:- octopus: this was cooked pretty well and the inside was quite tender, but the sauce was way too sour- crab cakes: good but tiny- duck: not great- burger: also not great and it was super raw although my mom ordered it medium; she had to return it; also it didn't come with enough cheese or toppings- crispy pork shoulder: nothing special- hanger steak: also nothing specialThe best thing that we ate was the fries that came with the burger and the pork shoulder. They were very crispy.The staff is nice and accommodating (my family asked to switch tables twice and they were really nice about it) but they are very understaffed and everything is quite slow. The restaurant is also EXTREMELY noisy. Lastly I told them it was my birthday and they also confirmed this with me upon seating us, but they didn't do anything special at all.Bill was $140 for four people before tax and tip. I would not recommend this place at all.",It is new and drinks were fantastic but food was hit or miss.  They need to work out the food and this could be a stellar place by Times Square.,"I had the crab cakes & my boyfriend had a burger. It was ok, not bad. I liked the ambiance more than the food","The Harrow is outstanding. ..each cocktail and every single dish. Our server thoroughly explained the menu and made perfect recommendations. The House Made Lobster Pierogies have permanently set unrealistic expectations for pierogies moving forward. .. lbvs.Located near the Theater District. ..so find a random show to have an excuse to dine at The Harrow. I personally vouch for each dish pictured (assuming Yelp links my pics, if not find them lol). Worth making a special trip. Can't wait to go back!","One of the best new places in the city. The location is a little off the beaten path in Hell's Kitchen. It's not far away from the rest of bars/restaurants in HK, but it's not that close. 10th Ave has a few sporadic spots, but this is by far the best. The decor is beautiful and the staff is very welcoming and attentive. This place I think has one of the best happy hours in HK. The drinks are strong, the bar menu taste delicious and if my memory serves me correct, happy hour is until 8pm? It's a perfect spot to get a drink with your date or meet with a few friends. If you're in HK or just in the city, The Harrow is worth taking a walk to.","Great spot for a nice relaxing dinner with quality wine selection. We decided to order things to share since there were too many tasty things to share. The server accommodated all our courses. We had the shrimp ceviche- needed some lime but great texture combination,Grilled octopus- too much salt,Dumpling- Pretty good,Tuna tartare- fresh and the avocado on the side was great. Needed more of the tortilla chips, Crab cakes- very good. The dessert was pecan ice cream- pretty tasty.",The Harrow New York
640,"Cafe Himalaya is a neighborhood standby offering up traditional momos (dumplings) and curries. I imagined Nepali food as being somewhat between Chinese and Indian food, which seems to be accurate from my visit here.We had chicken momos, which were way over-fried. Pretty dry and uninteresting. The curry we got was just fine.They were previously BYOB but now serve wine and beer at admittedly cheap prices. The atmosphere is hole-in-the-wall but clean. Service is brusque but quick.I'm not quite sure what I'm missing here as they seem to be beloved, but struck me as average food at average prices.","We were here on a Saturday evening. Ordered a chasha shamdey (chicken curry) and 2 orders of chasha momo (chicken momo). The chicken curry was really good, the spices in the curry was very flavorful. However,we were not the fan of the momo. The wrap of the momo was thick and the aachar was just a red spicy sauce. If I am back here I will surely try their other dishes but will not be back for the momos. Overall,Service - 5/5Price - 4/5Chicken curry - 5/5Chicken momo - 2.5/5","What great food here! We went on a weeknight and this place was packed and had a waiting! We tried the Chili Dofu (#19) and the pan fried chicken dumplings (#27) and the steamed veg dumplings (#12) and they were all on point with the right flavors. Will definitely be going here again. Expect a wait for your check - not sure why it took them time, but it did.","Awesome Nepali and Tibetan food. I came here on my last visit to New York because I really wanted to try the Sherpa tea after watching all the Everest documentaries talk about it. Small place that's a byob I think. It looked family owned. We ordered the Tibetan tea with two plates of momos, one steamed and one pan fried. Tibetan tea was very very interesting. I liked the steamed momos better than the pan fried ones. Momos were very very close to the ones I've eaten in eastern India. Definitely visit if you want to have the food from Himalayas and feel closer to nature, even if it's just in spirit.","Alright, so I came into this culinary experience hoping for something like Lhasa Fast Food in Queens, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. Let's dive in ...Vegetable Momo (4/5): Nice mix of veggies and fairly flavorful. Minus one because the dumpling skin was just so thick to get through. Chicken Momo (3/5): The meat was somewhat dry and the only flavor I could taste was turmeric. Similar to above, the dumpling skin was just too damn thick. Beef Momo (2/5): Worst of the 3. The beef was dry and I didn't taste any other flavors. Did you guess the skin was too thick here? Yup. Pan Fried Noodles with Chicken (3/5): These noodles were crispy which really threw me off. Mixing the sauce (of which there was barely any) made the noodles soggy so I couldn't really win. The veggies were a nice blend of flavors but yet again -- real shocker here -- the chicken was dry. TL;DR: Looks like I'll have to schlep out to Jackson Heights for good quality momos (or keep looking for something palatable in Manhattan).","This spot has been on my list for years. Finally stopped in for lunch on a weekday and shared a few things with a friend. We had the avocado salad, 26 Sha momo - fried and 27 Chasha momo - steamed, plus a side of paratha. Everything was delicious. The bread in particular was incredible, I could have eaten 5 orders!",Cafe Himalaya
641,asked for tadeeg and got the most basic flavorless stale rice you can imagine. The chicken kabob and bargs are fine..,"Authentic salads, bread, yogurt dip, lamb and barg kebobs over light Persian rice!  Will be back for shish!","Update: three years later, I finally made it back to try the beef koobideh, as my initial review had promised. It was great! The meat is nice and tender/flavorful. Instead of the rice, I opted for the grilled vegetables since I'm currently on a low-carb diet. This unfortunately means that I couldn't enjoy any of that warm pita bread.Also, I guess my taste buds have changed this time around because I really loved that green ""chutney"" sauce. And I use quotes because I still don't know exactly what it is. I just know that I smeared it on everything, along with that yogurt sauce.To finish off the meal, I tried the Persian ice cream (pistachio, saffron, and rose water). Lots of flavor, but if you don't like rose, you won't like this.Can't wait to come back and try some other dishes. Hopefully next time, it'll be less than three years.","(This review is based on the catering/take out only.)Woah. My office has ordered food from here on two separate occasions and each time it is very delicious.I wish I had written down the names of everything I've been able to try, but I can definitely recommend the tomato based eggplant (dip?) it is absolutely splendid. I must say I've never really had Persian food before, but this restaurant definitely makes me want to try more!Definitely give this place a try if it is on your radar. 4/5","Delicious Persian food! While the restaurant was under scaffolding, the inside of the restaurant had an intimate ambience, with dim lights. The service was great. We always had our waters filled, were served complimentary flatbread with tzatziki and a green chutney immediately after sitting, and didn't have to wait long for our food to be ready.We ended up ordering the Sultani Kebab (which came with skewers of both the Barg and Koobideh), Khoresh Gheymeh, and Ghourmeh Sabzi. While everything was delicious, my favorite was the Khoresh Gheymeh - the stew had a flavorful tomato and lemony taste. I also really enjoyed the Barg skewer - the meat was cooked very well. While the prices seemed a bit high, the portions are pretty big, so I'd recommend eating family style.",This place was delicious. They have this eggplant tomato appetizer that made me want to lick my plate -- not embarrassed to admit it. We shared a whole bunch of dishes and there wasn't one miss. The arugula salad was simple and fresh and the dips that came with the bread were tangy and fresh.,Ravagh Persian Grill
642,"I enjoyed Pippali the first time I ate there (hence the two stars) but have found in subsequent visits that the food is very hit or miss. It's too expensive for that sort of quality. Also, the service leaves a lot to be desired. Their servers - except one whose name I unfortunately don't know - are curt and rushed, even when the restaurant isn't bustling. There's no shortage of Indian restaurants in NY so I likely won't return here.","It's funny when I see my other friends comments right below mine because we were all equally frustrated and it's also sad that the restaurant didn't understand the power of customer satisfaction.It was my birthday and all my friends talked about this place so much, so we thought that we do our boozy brunch here. Once we got here, after a round of champagne, they said that they are out of it. And when we said that we already signed up for the bottomless deal for $10.. then they were like at Max, they can offer us two drinks each and that's it. That was so bizarre that they changed the rules after we already said that we were gonna take that deal. Also, we were 8 of us. This is plain horrible and some poor customer service- should I call it stupid instead? Then they made us talk to the manager who said that we could have more if we wanted to but they already ruined our mood!!! Plus the food is only tasty here coz of all the oil they use. Food is too oily. 8 of us will never ever step here again. Their loss!!","Bad service! Bad cocktails! tasteless/sweet food! We booked the table online at 2pm for 6:30 pm arrival. We were made to sit in the corner where walls were chipped and moist. I don't understand why they take reservations when they treat customers like this.Total disappointment! We had high expectations!Waitress was uninformed of the menu, had no idea of their menu. Bathrooms were ill maintained. Not a class of the restaurant that it boldly boasts of. Overrated. Thankful that it's over.","We hired pippali to cater my wedding reception in NYC. It was an unconventional set up because the reception was actually a boat cruise around NYC for 4 hours. The food was delicious and Pippali team did an outstanding job. All of our guests were raving about the food. My father (who is not easily impressed) was very happy with how hot (temperature) the food was and all of our guests could not stop eating.I would recommend Pippali not only for dining, which is a great experience in itself, but also for catering. Excellent job!","Recently went back to Pippali, after not having been there for years.  The restaurant looks pretty much the same as it did the last time I was there.  Service was good.The menu was definitely really expanded since the last time I went, which I definitely appreciated.We tried the following dishes:Samosa (4/5): I don't typically order samosas, but these were really good.  The filling was nice, and there was a good ratio of filling to breading.Dahi Papdi Chaat (4/5): A very tasty chaat dish.  The crackers were all crispy and fresh, and the yogurt was tart and creamy.Baghare Baingan (4/5): A very nice baingan dish.  Definitely worth ordering.Paneer Makhanwala (4.5/5): A really nice paneer dish.  The sauce was creamy, rich, and had a great tomato flavor.  The paneer was well cooked - not too soft and not too firm.  I really liked this dish.I really like Pippali and would definitely return.","Living within walking distance of Curry Hill has got to be one of the best parts of living in New York, and I was so happy to try Pippali when it opened.  They have an excellent version of the Bhel Puri, and I loved their Palak Paneer.  They have an amazing bread pudding (Double Ka Meetha) as well.  Also, they deliver!",Pippali
643,"This cafe has a cute, unpretentious vibe, and wasn't too busy at 8p on a Tuesday, when we stopped by. I can see it as a nice place to have some casual weekday drinks and snacks, when they're not too swamped. That said, I really can't recommend this restaurant for dinner, unless you aren't very hungry. Had the quinoa salad last night, which was pretty good, albeit needed some salt/pepper. But I really wasn't expecting it to be so cold... more of a personal preference, but I was looking forward to a warmer dish (not HOT but at least room temperature -- the quinoa tasted like it had just come out of the fridge). My boyfriend got the pomegranate salmon, which was bland, unseasoned, and really tiny. And it's literally just a chunk of salmon -- no rice, no veggies, or anything on the side. Which I guess is what you would expect when paying $16 for a piece of fish in this neighborhood. The service here was also not great. Our waitress didn't appear to know any of the items on the menu, and it took a while to flag down the check.",We had a really bad experience. We love this place and decided to come back. Unfortunately the waitres wasn't really paying attention to us. She got half of our order wrong and waited another 15 min for the other half to be done right. When it did make it to your table the plate was dirty and way too greasy then when we had it the first time.,I ordered a salad - both the salad and the chicken tasted old and spoiled.  I could not eat it.  They would not take it back & still charged for it,"Such a cute lil spot for breakfast. They have the best avocado toast. Add a egg and tomatoes and it's pure heaven. Lattes and coffee are great as well. Deff worth a stop in, very nostalgic vibe as well","Cool, dimly lit, Moroccan cafe-esk eatery with lots of creative food options. I got the couscous, which they recommended, and it was OK but not amazing. My girlfriend got the eggplant, which was very good however.The staff is kind of odd, and not the best.  My girlfriend and I went on a Friday night around 9 PM and asked how long of a wait it was, they told us they could see this right away. However, it took them 15 minutes to clear a table and have us seated because the staff wasn't communicating. We also had to call them over to take our order because we've been sitting there for a long time without any server asking us. They also never refilled our water for the entire meal. Overall, it was a cool concept but the execution could've been better. 8.25/10","Restaurants like Cafe Gitane are why I love NYC so much. I've literally never had Moroccan food and am fortunate to have been able to try some of the city's best here.They don't take reservations, and waits can be long if you come at the wrong time. The restaurant is small and smokey with an open kitchen - you will walk out smelling delicious. The wait staff was really friendly.Food is delicious. The couscous with grilled chicken rocks and the hummus was really flavorful. The presentation is solid and the portions are massive. Prices are reasonable as well.I definitely will be back.",Café Gitane
644,"Everything was phenomenal, especially the dish with sweetbread and the cabbage wrap with foamy broth. These 2 dishes were spectacular. Balanced and delicate. Hope they are still on the menu.","After having a dinner here, I tried again for the breakfast, sadly found the centerpiece rose was almost dead so I asked my waiter to move it away. The breakfast avocado toast was fine, egg was boiled not poached, I prefer poached eggs as the egg white will be thinner. The vegetables was dressed with too much vinegar but overall a good breakfast.","It's okay and not okay.   The food is very good and somewhat creative, but not excellent.  The wait staff is excellent.  The  sommelier was an extremely knowledgeable woman  who paired the right wine with my food.  She did a great job.The bad part started with with the male host (maybe floor manager?).  He was rude and dismissive.  There was a busboy (older male from France) who shared the same rude attitude.  Between the two of them the night could have been ruined.   We almost walked out after our initial interaction with the host.  Really bad pick to have him at the front.Also, the pistachio flambé desert was lousy.  It had too much booze in it and the consistency of the ice cream was icy as though it had melted and was refrozen.I will not be rushing back.","I had dinner here back in July, and my god, was it wonderful. The restaurant is beautiful, intimate, and romantic (too bad I went with a friend). Everyone, from the host to our server to the sommelier, was very knowledgable, friendly, and helpful. When we asked for recommendations, they provided the perfect responses. Every single dish we ordered was perfection. The chef was able to take classic French dishes and put a modern spin on them. Do be mindful that the sauces are still classically done, and everything was super rich and creamy. Definitely do not come here if you don't eat dairy - everything was cooked with either butter or cream!!!Wine list was extensive. Dessert list was sophisticated. If you want to seal the deal, definitely take the person you're wooing (whether business- or personal-related) to Le CouCou. Just make sure you can afford it.","Typical French fare, what's impressive was the duck and the foie. Prepared multiple ways - either seared (my favourite) or in a parfait. All à la carte. Service was just ok - not too talkative nor rude: seemed they had a mission to get through as many customers as possible. I wouldn't go here and splurge but it is a one star Michelin restaurant so prepare to pay at least $150-200 per person with drinks.I liked the rabbit. That was delicious.","CAUTION: RICH SAUCES AHEAD! Decadent French delicacies and romantic ambiance! We did a celebration dinner here for my husband. The food was genuinely amazing and the service spotless, without the pretentiousness. The menu was simple and to the point with great variety for adventurous and reserve eaters alike. Again, sauces are so rich I don't know why they don't have a medic onsite for potential sudden cardiac arrest. Must get the sweetbread and grilled chop!",Le Coucou

The only thing I would say this trip was the borscht could have had a bit more flavoring or filling, but was still good.",Over and over again I go there to have one and only -Korzo burger (Sinfully delicious) - organic juicy fresh meat deep fried burger ! Can't get the same anywhere else..,"Beet salad delicious with nuts goat cheese pepitos , the chef burgermade of grass fed beef organic . My fish and chips not traditional with sauces yellow squash veg side grilled with chips . Dessert a beet carrot pie with vanilla bean ice cream",This place is a Bay Ridge gem. The service is exquisite and the backyard patio is perfect for a sunny day. I choose a different item off of the menu every time I dine here. The presentation of each plate is an art form in itself full of a variety of beautiful colored vegetables. The food is always fresh and delicious.Not to mention beets on everything!,"Have to be honest about this place... and I don't mean to be disrespectful or insulting to the other positive reviews, as I'm sure they've garnered respect and were created honesty, but to start off with the negative - the burger - it was really not that great. It wasn't awful, but it was certainly not ""the best tasting burger in NY,"" which is a damn bold claim.So that out of the way, the atmosphere is nice, the menu is well put together, and the beet-based food/theme is very cool. Personally I'm a big fan of beet-driven food. For instance, the beet ketchup here is great.Service is so-so, borderline uncomfortable though, as the people waiting on our table were a bit sloppy and disgruntled, which threw off the whole experience a bit.Yes, going full circle with the review. The biggest problem for me with the burger was the deep fried dough/bun, which tasted like an uncooked greasy doughnut surrounding a hunk of meat that just tasted like salt. On top of that, the dough was actually sweet like they had previously deep fried doughnuts or some dessert, and that old oil musk just permeated the whole thing. Really off-putting to be completely upfront, and I hope that's not been the experience for everyone else.Ultimately though, beyond my burger griping, after some time I'll be back to try another burger and see if I just happened to be there on a bad day.","The praise this place gets for its burgers is not unearned.I don't normally gush about a place after a single visit; but this place has without a doubt the best burger I've had, dethroning even an old favorite of mine, BK Jani.I walked into this place on a rainy Wednesday night. Despite the off peak hours, the cramped space was still packed with well to do yuppies. Still, despite it's size, there was a certain comfort to the space... Like a rustic living rooom.I ordered the korzo burger, and at 19 dollars I can say it's a good value. You get a masterfully made burger, fries, a small side of vegetables and coleslaw and each item on the plate was crafted with a special care, not one of them being treated as an afterthought as one would expect.Should the day ever come, I'll be sure to bring dates here.",Brooklyn Beet Company

I went at about 6:30pm and they said I could only do take out. Another group came in a few minutes later and complained that there was still time left to dine in.Ok. So I ordered take out. I got the curry chicken and curry beef. It wasn't that good. The beef cuts were cheap and the chicken had a weird smell. I pretty much only ate the rice.The workers there looked like they hated their job, so I can't imagine how customers would enjoy that kind of service.","This place has my entire heart, except that they only serve curry starting from 3pm on weekdays.The best thing they have here is the stuffed noodle soup combo. Their rice and other curries are also very good and one of the best Malaysian curries I've ever had. It's family owned and operated, which makes me a little sad that they're never too busy, especially at night. They're very nice, but very strict on having people leave by exactly 7pm, so do not expect to sit too long if you arrive at 6:30pm, because they might turn you away or give you a warning.I refrained from writing a review for this place for years now, but I really love this place and hope more people can try their curry.","Came here to try the Asian Spicy Curry Pop-up since I was craving for some Malaysian style curry. Saw great pictures on yelp and the food did not disappoint. I had the Curry Seafood Noddle Soup and soup was very flavorful and hit the spot. There was a good amount of fish cakes, shrimp, and squid for $9.75. Very fair ratio and I love the different options of noodles to choose from. I went with the ho fun and it complimented my dish perfectly. My co-workers also really enjoyed their dishes as well. They got the Curry Mixed Veggie Noodle Soup and Curry Special Stuffed Combo. The food was very filling and I would definitely come back for more.","First time eating here. Came to try Asian curry pop-up. I ordered the curry special combo stuffed with fish paste. Order taker told me they didn't have tofu. I was fine with that and ordered it. But when I got home, I wished they'd offer another eggplant stuffed or bean curd stuffed one. I planned to ask to exchange the chili pepper stuffed with another eggplant stuffed, but forgot too. I gave the chili pepper stuffed to my friend to try.That chili pepper stuffed was hot. As it cooked, the chili pepper essence seeps into the fish paste.The curry soup has a nice curry flavor and the chili oil gives it a slight kick. I couldn't stop drinking that broth, but I did. Soup gets grainy at the bottom of the bowl. Also, I ordered a lychee bubble tea. The bubbles are smaller and softer than other vendors. Lychee flavor is like other vendors. The single bathroom is modern and spacious.",Asian Spicy Curry Pop-up
647,There looks like glue or some goo in my steak. This looks chewed up when I cut into it. I was confused since it didn't look the same as other filet cuts. I then googled what a cut should look like and I learned about meat glues and how affordable meats of this cut usually are glued. The meat looks like ground meat when I cut into it. It maybe was just too raw? I've had rare before though.I ordered medium rare so this seemed a bit more gooey that expected for even a rare. It kinda fell apart when I cut it.Everything else was grt though. Lots of condiments and Service and experience are great. The issue is wonky meat. I've come to this spot before too and got a different cut and it was fine. Remind be to not get a filet next time!I can't say for sure but it seemed odd to me.,This place is trash. Rude customer service. Black guy that took our order was rude. And the steak was ok. Honestly save your money and cook your own ribeye at home. All the videos and reviews are bs.

I wish you could order more...but those are the rules, and matcha mochi- my back up order, if they're out of rangiri is the ribeye, 16+ oz- my ideal steak is always medium rare which can be tricky when getting the rangiri since it's a blend of different sizes and pieces of steak- I prefer the sauce in the glass container over the pitcher, sweet v. salty - reasonably priced steak but I wouldn't go as far as to call it cheap, I come here when I'm feeling too lazy to go to whole foods and pick up a bone-in rib eye and cook it myself","I found Ikinari through a Yelp search and made a same day reservation for 2 for an early dinner.

Choose your sides that will come on the hot plate with your steak (corn-default but can be subbed, onions, broccoli, potatoes or green beans). I chose a 10oz ribeye (Rare-as suggested by the restaurant) with corn, onions and added broccoli. My husband chose a 14oz Filet (Rare) with corn and onions. Go back to your table to order your drinks and other sides and dessert.  We ordered 2 sides of Garlic Pepper Rice, due to the other reviews I've read. We agree. Definitely a must. All steaks come on a sizzling (REALLY HOT) platter, so the steaks continue to cook after it's brought to your table. I usually order my steaks Medium Rare, but ordered it Rare. It was perfectly cooked, even after sitting on the platter. When done, just walk up to the cashier to pay. The service was very good too. They were all very attentive. Looking forward to coming back again on our next NYC visit.","CATFISH LEVEL: 3/5: Looks good, tastes good, would get againCame here on a weekday in between lunch and dinner, so it was pretty empty. We went to the counter and ordered our steak, then sat down and they brought it to us. There wasn't really much service, but we still had to pay tip, so keep that in mind!! The flavor was great, and both steaks were cooked well, just the way we asked. The sides were a bit boring, but the steak itself was worth the money. The sauce in the silver tea kettle is really salty, so beware before pouring it onto your steak. The sweeter sauce is a lot better and compliments the steak well. The miso soup is also really salty, so make sure you have water with you if you drink it. As I said, the place was pretty empty, so the workers got together and were chatting pretty loudly. Of course, I would probably do that too, but they were cursing and being pretty unprofessional which made us a bit uncomfortable. If I had a child with me I would not be okay with that at all. Overall, I would definitely come back here. It's a shame I had to pay tip but even with tip the price still was decent for the quality of the food.","After work, my fiance picked me up and just wanted to roam the city and try something new.  We like to do that together.  We were driving around to places we rarely go to and we decided just to park and walk into a restaurant we both agreed on.We parked across the street from this restaurant and decided to give it a shot.  I'm glad we did because it's probably the best steak I've had in a really long time.  Usually, Ikinaris are where you stand to eat the steak quickly right after it's been made.  Here, though, they have high chairs and tables.  We came on a weekday after I got out of work so it wasn't busy.  That was nice.  Here's what we ordered:-  (2x) Ribeye 10oz - one medium with onions and corn, one rare with onions and broccoli-  Garlic Pepper Rice-  Amabuki Strawberry - you get to keep the glass-  Amabuki Sunflower - you get to keep the glassIt may not seem like a lot, but this was enough food for 2 people.  It was delicious and hope to try this again real soon!",Ikinari Steak East Village
648,"Not my cup of tea. Went in on a Saturday. The place smelled very good. However, even upon seeing my food, I was disappointed. The presentation of the yakisoba was underwhelming. I got the sweet beef yakisoba and chicken Takoyaki and both fell flat for me. I didn't finish either. The over cooked, mushy texture tasted very cheap to me. Won't be coming back. The ratings were so high, which is what brought me in. I was very disappointed in my food. The customer service was good. But that couldn't save my experience here. Wasted about 20 bucks on the these two items.","it was our first time and it was actually good.there was no wait during lunch on Saturday. decent portion.we ordered okonomiyaki, takoyaki and yakisoba (soy).okonomiyaki 4/5 - wish they put more veggiestakoyaki 4/5 - crispy outside and mushy inside. yummmm. wish they put more flaky stuff on topyakisoba 3/5 - was too salty and greasyperfact place to gran and go. price is reasonable compare to portion.","Came in on a Friday night as my girlfriend and I were craving takoyaki. It was pretty empty with onlyOne other party. We got the takoyaki and beef yakisoba. The yakisoba came out very soggy, greasy, and the sauce was not mixed in well. Takoyaki was soggy and had large chunks ginger that were overpowering. The squid was also very chewy. Also, the other party had the food brought to them while I had to walk up to counter; just thought it was odd to treat customers different. Had high expectations, but left disappointed.","DokoDemo is one of my favorite places to get authentic Japanese street food in the city. When you walk in, watch your step, as you enter a place that might look a bit like Japan. On your left, you see the staff working hard at the grills, making delectable Japanese dishes, ranging from familiar ones like yakisoba (stir-fried ramen dish) and fried rice to more obscure ones like okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake) and takoyaki (octopus balls). On your right, there are tables and stools where you can enjoy your meal. There is definitely plenty of seating, but be warned that if you come in a big party, you'll most likely be huddling around a table together, so get nice and cozy!As for the food, I have had the yakisoba, okonomiyaki, and the takoyaki. As for the yakisoba, I found the noodles quite chewy, just the way I like it, and filled with flavor from the seasonings used. To put it simply, it is Japanese comfort food for me. The big hitters though are definitely the okonomiyaki and the takoyaki. I'm sure both dishes are what captivates people when they see them in photos. First, I'll talk about the okonomiyaki. I believe that the restaurant makes Osaka-style okonomiyaki, which is done by mixing all of the ingredients together, as opposed to Hiroshima-style, where the ingredients are layered on top of each other. In this case, the pancake usually consists of a batter mixed with vegetables and whatever you want in it, including meats like pork, chicken, or beef. The top is then glazed with Japanese mayo. You can even get cheese in it! As for the taste, the pancake is savory and filled with umami. The combination of flavors complement each other greatly and it's not really heavy, so one can easily finish the whole thing.The takoyaki was really good as well and packed with flavor. Takoyaki are these batter-filled balls with pieces of octopus inside and then glazed with some Japanese mayo and Takoyaki sauce (which I believe is similar to Worchestershire sauce) while being topped with bonito (fish) flakes. P.S. that's the stuff that's moving on top of the takoyaki. The different flavors work together in harmony, making the takoyaki rich and savory.Overall, DokoDemo does its best in showcasing the many wonders of Japanese street food, as its okonomiyaki and takoyaki are as appetizing as they look. It's definitely worth a try for those who may have never had these Japanese delicacies.","The takoyaki (octopus pancake balls) and the okonomiyaki (kind of like a savory pancake with meat, egg and cabbage) here taste just like they do in Japan! The food is excellent and affordable and it's counter service with a small drinks fridge to choose beer, sake or soda from. That's why this place is our no-frills weekend late night dinner spot. If I had to choose, I'd say the okonomiyaki with pork is their best dish, though we usually order two dishes and split. Try it, you won't be disappointed.","This is a Japanese restaurant that specializes in street food. At first thought, ""I'm like alright. Street food. My arteries are as hollow as a unfilled cannoli. They can handle this."" So I look around and I see a few items that are recognizable based on appearance: noodles, kimchi fried rice, etc. But one thing stuck out, it was the okonomiyaki, a Japanese savory pancake (there should be a better word to describe a savory pancake).It piqued my interest so I ordered it with chicken. I prepared my stomach for an internal World War 3. I received it and took a bite, and after a few chews I realized this whole thing is straight up cabbage and meat. I'm like wait, ""this ain't the street food I'm used to."" This is way too healthy, but surprisingly delicious. Like we Americans just got on this fad of gluten free diets and replacing wheat with cabbage. The Japanese have been doing it for way longer. If this qualifies for ""unhealthy"" street food in Japan then it is absolutely no surprise as to why they live so long.",DokoDemo
649,"Meh, it's ok, if the service was better it would get another star however the three times I have been there the service in the bar area has been poor and a number of employees just kind of lazily look around for something to do other than serve customers. Pizza is ok, I think I went there due to proximity of the park and accessibility, I will end up waiting until I get back in the city next time for pie.","I came here on August 31st 2019 for the second time. We ordered the antipasto salad and a large pizza half cheese and half sausage with mushrooms.The line outside side was long and hard.  We were taken to the third floor buy stairs no elevator. Our antipasto salad came out and it was horrible. The tomatoes were not riped, they were green and hard. The mozzarella cheese tasted store-bought and the salami slices which where four of them, were okay. We  informed our waiter that the tomatoes were hard and unchewable. Once the pizza came out the cheese side was horrible. Tomato sauce tasted like can tomato sauce. And the cheese tasted store-bought with no flavor whatsoever. I gave them two stars because the sausage on the pizza was good sausage. I would never go back and I would never stay in a line to  eat there again.","Let me start by saying, Dumbo Brooklyn is a very quaint place to visit especially when its with my daughter.  Now for the pizza.  Get ready to wait on line outside.  I have been here before and there is always a line.  Once we were inside we were taken to the second floor to share a table with another family.  We decided to wait longer to have our own table.  So the wait was about an hour. Finally got a table in a very cramped area.  We a ordered the anti pasta, one large regular pie and one large mushroom and sausage.  Both pies where good but were lacking salt.  Very bland on seasonings.  The anti pasta was small but ok.","My wife and I, being from the Chicago area, recently visited NYC and wanted to try out a NY slice/pizza while there so we could compare it to Chicago's pizza.  After searching on the internet I chose Grimaldi's in Brooklyn based on its reviews.We arrived via taxi around 1:30PM and found a long line outside the door extending about 40 feet.  We decided to wait and after about 30 minutes or so we were seated at a table close to the brick oven where they were making the pizzas.  We ordered a small pizza with pepperoni, onions, mushrooms, sausage and extra cheese.  They don't serve wine so we opted for two soft drinks.Watching them make the pizza was great.  They applied fresh low moisture mozzarella slices all over the dough, then added the mushrooms, onions, pepperoni and sausage, and adding small scoops of tomato sauce around the top of the pizza (rather than brushing the tomato sauce all over the dough as most places do).  They then put 3-4 fresh basil slices on top and placed it in the oven.The fresh mozzarella was so different than most pizzas.  Sausage and pepperoni had a great taste.  Crust was done perfectly.  We told the manager that we were from Chicago and that this was one of the best, if not the best, thin crust pizza that we've had.  He chuckled and said that Michelle Obama was in here about 10 years ago and said the exact thing.Now if we could just duplicate that at home!!!","CATFISH LEVEL: 3.5/5: looks good, tastes good, wouldn't get againAfter trying Juliana's not too long ago, I had to try out Grimaldi's too! Keep in mind this place is CASH ONLY.We ordered the Margherita, the pesto, and the chicken BBQ special pie. The Margherita was good, nice and crispy and thin, with just the right amount of sauce to not overpower it. It was nicely cheesy, but a bit bland. After adding garlic powder it was a lot better!The chicken bbq was a bit soggy (expected given how much was on it), but the BBQ sauce wasn't overpowering like I expected it to be. It was the most flavorful out of all three. The cheese was a bit too much, it was very heavy and chewy. Compared to the cheese on the other pies, it tasted like the pie was made before and re-heated rather than fresh. The pesto pie was a huge disappointment...it was pretty oily, which is expected from pesto, but not to this extent. The pesto flavor was missing as well. Although we saw the green sauce, we couldn't taste it at all. Overall, the pizza was okay. It was definitely overpriced and not exactly memorable, but this place is a tourist trap so it makes sense. If I'm craving pizza in the area, I probably wouldn't go back since it wasn't necessarily worth the money.","This review is not about the pizza, because I wasn't able to try it (although all the pizza around me looked burnt). My friend and I came here after hearing it's the best pizza in Brooklyn . We got to the restaurant at 1:20 and there was no line, walked right in and had our pick of several tables on the first floor. We ordered our pizza around 1:25 and begin talking. As the time went by the restaurant begin to get busy and all the tables around us were occupied. As my friend and I talked about what we would do for the rest of the day we noticed the tables around us begin to get their pizza and we still hadn't. Our waiter noticed us looking around confused about where our pizza was. He came over and informed us that there was a mistake and they had remade the pizza and it was in the oven.  20 minutes after the waiter letting us know that it was in the oven we saw at least 10 pizzas get delivered upstairs. At that point I told my friend that if the people who just ordered next to us got their pizza before ours we would be leaving. Sure enough they got their pizza which was the last straw. I'm not sure if the pizza ever got in the oven, but that is unexceptionable! A 50 min wait without getting a pizza while everyone else around us waited 10-15 minutes. My advice would be to go to Juliana's. We left Grimaldi and went next door to be seated immediately and receive our non burnt pizza in 10 minutes.",Grimaldi's Pizzeria
650,"Those views though.Food is basic simple bar food, but in no means is it bad. Veggie burger available. Has alcohol. Dog friendly. Hidden local LIC gem with summer sunset views to die for.","Far end of LIC, this gem by the water was semi-hidden in an area that looked abandon. Low-key outdoor bar and great burgers.","Stopped by for beers on a Sunday afternoon on a holiday weekend.  I think a lot of people were away for the weekend because it was not nearly as crowded as we expected.  No line for drinks or food and no wait for bathrooms (which isn't typical, based on other reviews).  Anyway, we counted our blessings and enjoyed a picnic table by the water with a couple beers from their decent selection.  I was afraid to try the food, not knowing their health rating, but this was definitely a great choice for some day-drinking.  As everyone has mentioned, very much off the beaten path and I only knew it was there because I saw it from the ferry.  Lots of doggies (yay!) and quite a few kiddos (meh).  Laid-back spot to forget your troubles and the hustle bustle.","Such a beautiful view! If you are looking to have a relaxing summer evening this is the place for it. Nice beer selection, fun staff, fresh air and good energy. It gets very packed on the weekends so we came after work on a Wednesday and had a nice spot to sit. I will recommend this place to my friends.","Come here for the beautiful views. Stay here for the beautiful views. Dealer's choice whether you'll find the food and drink a worthwhile part of making the trip. Nestled at the end of a dead end street that's filled with trucks and industrial looking things, you'd never know it's right there on the waterfront. Having used to run along the Gantries, I'm still surprised I never knew it was there. It seems you'd have to crane your head from the corner where'd you stand near the Pepsi sign, just to try and catch a glimpse.For that reason, it makes a lovely secluded outdoor patio space if you wanted to through a private event, informal or formal. And supposedly worrying about noise levels isn't an issue either nor bringing pets because of the purely outdoor nature of this place (read: also means, come on a fair weather day).I lean on the 3.5 star spectrum of this review simply because I wasn't wowed by their dish of fame, the çevapi. I guess I was running a little protein deficient that day, cause I was craving a massive burger or something despite having already eaten a very healthy dinner at home. I ordered the Balkan sausage and just found it to lack oomph in flavor, which made me more liable to balk (!) at the near entree price I paid. Others around me seemed to like the dish, though, so perhaps I'm an outlier. Customer subjectivity is simply the forever curveball in the delicate balance of the good food-good setting-good value trifecta. But, it IS irrefutable that the views from here are 10 out of 10, so definitely still visit for that and knock back a plain 'ol cold one while you're at it!","Since my initial visit this place has become a nice place to check out during the nice warmer, less cold months of the year since they are open a little into the fall months. Usually I come here for drinks & to just hang out & enjoy a nice day, my last visit I finally gave some of the food a try, very simple menu. Drinks I generally stick to beer, can't go wrong. Food I gave the Hamburger a try very simple nicely grilled comes with a small salad, the burger was good great taste to the meat. My company had some Chorizo comes with pita bread, really good chorizo. We also had an order of the Corn so simple sprinkled with salt it was very tasty. This place is nicely tucked away in an area where unless u know about the place u are not likely to just run into it, nice open space , amazing city views, nice laid back vibes here, decent music playing, also pet friendly. Only thing I can ""complain"" about is that the place is still cash only a bit of a nuisance now a days but I guess u can manage they do have an ATM available. Overall nice place to enjoy a nice day, I will for sure continue to visit from time to time.",Anable Basin Sailing Bar & Grill
651,Tried JoJu and their bread was disappointing. It seemed like they used an Italian hero bread (taste and texture wise) and made Viet sandwich with it. I tried it twice thinking it might be off just that day but it was the same. Will not be coming back.,"Joju was my favorite banh mi place but not anymore because today I found a hair in my food. I immediately stopped eating, showed it to employees there but they didnt give me my refund so I just asked for a milkshake and went home. I swear I'll never return","The girl on the phone who took our order literally told us the order of chicken comes with 4 pieces when we asked and we asked for one order with green sauce. We ended up with a double order of the over dried nasty looking fried chicken and NO GREEN SAUCE even though it was in the order. We called and told them and the same girl on the phone only offered ""sorry"". You have ruined our dinner that we were looking forward to and travelled 50 minutes for","From the busy tables and long line when I first came in, I knew that JoJu was gonna be good. I ordered the JoJu bowl (BBQ pork and caramelized pork) with cabbage salad, added spring rolls, and green sauce. The bowl was bigger than I expected and it definitely made me rlly full. I thought the BBQ pork was a little too dry for me but the caramelized pork tasted as good as it looked - savory and a little bit of sweetness combined. Spring rolls were a nice addition and the green sauce gave a little kick to the bowl. However, I do recommend getting it with rice instead of cabbage salad since I started to lose taste of the meat after a while because there was a lot of sliced cabbage as the base. My less sweetened Thai iced tea was honestly the perfect amount of sweetness so that was rlly satisfying.Our order was to go so I didn't get to try the banh mi fries at its finest first seconds of crispiness but the radishes on top mix well, giving the fries a light and crunchy accompaniment.","came here on a Sunday afternoon for a quick to-go sandwich. the place was packed - there was a line and the seats were full. order at the counter and there's a number at your receipt. the line to order move fast but they took some time to prepare your food. totally understandable though looking at how packed the place was. affordable price. pretty good value for the quality and portion sizei ordered the Lemongrass chicken bahn mi with runny egg. the sandwich come in big portion which I find very satisfactory because sandwich usually hardly fills me up. the fillings were uber generous. bread was crispy and chewy, huge pieces of well-seasoned flavorful chicken, nice and fresh acidity from the pickled carrots, fragrant kick from the cilantro. it was almost perfect except that it seemed to lack the runny egg!!! there's only egg whites in it! i could be very disappointed but since otherwise it tastes great I still give 4 stars. seriously if only there was runny egg in it could hve been an easy 5 stars","I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't like Joju?I find the sandwiches too filled, so it's hard for me to get a good balanced bite. Sometimes it's all pickled veggies or all meat. The sandwiches all lean toward sweetness too, it seems? Ive tried their original, the joju and the bulgogi one. The best best thing on the menu, and the only reason i ever go back are he bahn mi fries!",JoJu
652,"Hidden behind a market, the restaurant offers Italian inspired sandwiches and bites. The minute you walk in, you can smell the meats and baked Italian breads. We ordered the meat and cheese board ($25), porchetta broccoli rabe sandwich ($15), wagyu roast beef sandwich ($16), and the slab bacon salt baked potato. The porchetta sandwich was my favorite. It comes hot with fatty and crispy pieces of pork - dripping like a hot mess. The bitterness of the broccoli rabe offsets how heavy the sandwich really is. Did not love the cold wagyu sandwich as it was a bit dry. The meat and cheese board comes with fig jam, dried apricots, olives, almonds, and mustard seeds. While waiting for my food, I browsed the market and bought an olive tapenade spread - can't wait to try it.","I am a really big fan of Mekelburg's for both their amazing food and drink selections, as well as their no-BS vibe and service. Mekelburg's looks like and is an actual grocery store up until you hit the bar in the back. The rustic modern bar also features an amazing outdoor spot with picnic tables for drinking outdoors in the warmer months. The draft craft beer selection is always changing and awesome. There are many mouth watering dishes here including the baked potato, Porchetta, BBQ Shrimp Po Boy, and Chicken liver crostini. The cheese and meat plates also never fail to disappoint. The vibe here is chill but very on the hipster side. Cons: The Tuesday trivia night is pretty packed, so you probably can't get a seat unless you arrive very early. The night we went a bunch of frat boys were drunk and cheating on their cell phones so it totally ruined the night. We also had to wait 35 minutes and write on a wall before finding actual seats. Bloody Marys are far too clumpy: skip them.People tend to bring a ton of small kids here on weekends which is a huge turn off for anti kid people like me.","location is kind of hidden since it is in the lower level of a building. It is bigger in there than it looks but I did not have time to sit and eat.Seems like everyone in here is going half speed... I called 20 min ahead of time for the meatloaf sandwich and it still wasnt ready when I walked in. I read the reviews on the meatloaf so I was very excited to try it. Unfortunately the sandwich was underwhelming. First off, The bread to ratio is not good. The bread is quality but too much of it compared to the other ingredients.  The meatloaf lacked any sort of seasoning and tasted like mush. The tomato sauce was also bland and added no value to the sandwich. The picture looks good but it was extremely underwhelming.Hopefully I get the opportunity to try something else from this place but based off my first experience this place is VERY OVERRATED.","This is my new favorite place! Tucked behind a market is a bar that serves great food and has a vast selection of craft beer. They have a deal where any can plus a shot is $10. The oysters are delicious. Even though the order only comes with 4 they are huge! The friend that took us was also raving about the veggie sandwich, spicy chicken sandwich and the bone marrow. If we had not just had dinner I would have ordered it all. They also have a backyard you can sit in(closes at midnight) and at the bar there is a tv that you can request whatever channel you want. Great experience overall. Bring a group of friends here for a night of snacks, beer and games (they have board games too)!","This place is definitely in an ideal location, but the food was okay. The chocolate babka was really good, the chai latte was good, but the sandwich was below average, I thought. For what you get, I think this place is overpriced, but hey, the view is nice. We came here while on vacation. Probably wouldn't come back while visiting Brooklyn. If I lived in the neighborhood, I might swing by for chocolate babka if I had a craving for it.","Came here for lunch and a snack and had the BBQ Shrimp Po Boy with the Babka Bites. The po boy was pretty good; the baguette was really fresh and the sauce around the shrimp was pretty tasty. My gripe is that it shouldn't cost $16 for this item -- very pricy in my opinion given the size and complexity. It's smaller than a bahn mi at any given Vietnamese sandwich shop (usually around $6).  Same with the Babka Bites. I liked them; they were crunchy and served with icing. However, I wish they weren't so expensive. It's $8 just for 3, which are slightly bigger than Dunkin Donuts donut holes. Also, we waited about 45 minutes just for these two items when it wasn't even crowded. This place would have a somewhat higher rating, but it was dragged down by the price and wait times.Price: 1/5Quality: 4/5Quantity: 2/5Service: 2/5Atmosphere: 3/5",Mekelburg's
653,"Came here and happen to be in the area with friends. Cool spot but the bar tender was a DICK! Seemed like he was having a bad day and took it out on us.  He was extremely short with us and rude.  First time in NYC and this dude ruined the experience... If you're in the restaurant/ bar industry, customer service is key.  I was a former server myself so I  understand.  If you see a bartender with a man bun and glasses, AVOID at alll cost!!!!!","Ehh..Idk. I found this place on Yelp and decided to come here for brunch with my fiancé and my dad because of the 4 star average Yelp rating. I made a reservation through Yelp as we were walking up to the restaurant just in case but when we walked in there was only one table taken. (This was on Sunday at around 12-1 PM.)We ordered the chicken liver pâté, deviled eggs, Mediterranean tuna salad, bacon egg & cheese sandwich, and the roast beef panini. All of the items were okay, but nothing special in flavor. The cocktail I ordered (Bees Knees) was pretty good and I would stop by again for a drink if in the area again.",Large beer selection. Sad to say very limited wine selection. The limited food menu was absolutely amazing.,"Had some great beers on a Saturday at around noon.Charlie [behind the bar] was working the entire room, and still made the time to be engaging. His stories comparing MSG audiences were hilarious. I wish all bartenders were as magnificent as he.Went there a 2nd time later in the evening, after the concert and the crowded experience [different bartender] was not as great. Haymaker may want to staff a couple more bartenders post-concert(s).","Made a reservation here for three people on a Sunday afternoon. As it's not in a busy area, there weren't too many people inside, making for a relaxed brunch time experience.Surprisingly extensive beer list ranging anywhere from $7-12 depending on type and pour size. This is contrary to the brunch-time food menu which is quite small in comparison. Settled on the Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich ($?) - a nice layering thick bacon, eggs, cheddar cheese and a tangy sauce. Good flavor, served with a nominal side salad (in lieu of fries). Service here is good, and they quickly mention the items they are out of. Solid all around bar if you're looking for a quiet lunch.","Always a pleasure to happen upon a good cocktail bar. This is one. Very creative cocktails. I had the Old Seville, which was kind of a modern day old-fashioned. The menu had something for everyone. Starters to small plates to entrees, and each one included suggested combinations. For example, a burger with bacon, cheddar, and avocado. I often judge a new pub I visit, after their cocktails, on whether they can pull off a decent burger and fries. Haymaker nailed it! Granted, I wanted it rare, and they only do medium and above, but it was a juicy beast. And the fries were delicious! So many pubs screw up the fries. Not the haymaker. The only thing I would recommend is making some malted vinegar available for those of us trying to cut back on sugary ketchup. And the menu had so much more than burgers. The bar has a nice layout. Plenty of seats, and I especially liked the drink rails for the standing crowd. They give people a place to put their drinks down, and keep the standing bar crowd from spilling into the tables. This is well thought out. We came for dinner before a concert at the Garden. Looks like a good place to enjoy a game as well. We'll come again.",Haymaker Bar and Kitchen
654,"The waitress had us waiting for 30 minutes, in spite of many tables being clean and available before us and having checked on the waiting list before coming. Rude service. If you manage to be seated though, the place appeared lively with good music.","I've been a supporter of Bareburger for years but tonight was a complete disappointment at this location.It took 20 minutes for us to get a bottle of water and the food took twice as long.  My burger was ice cold and so were the french fries which we sent back for fresh ones.  Along with other annoying things like items missing from our orders, the wrong size drinks, etc... When the bill came it was wrong.  Double charged for things and charged for things we didn't order.  It took our waiter a very very long time to correct the bill and finally come with the credit card iPad machine. Not going back.","I am usually a fan of Bareburger but this location is going downhill real fast. Service has been extremely slow on last few occasions I have been here, and food quality seems to be slipping too.Hopefully the management notices the wave of all the recent negative reviews and tries to fix things up otherwise it is definitely affecting the brand as a whole too.","I love this joint. I've been to the one downtown and two in Brooklyn. I usually get the turkey burger. But most recently I had the impossible burger and it was really good too. I love that they have so many options for burger and I usually build it myself. Secondly, I love the pickles dill and sweet. Thirdly, the French fries. Fourthly, the ketchup. I love ketchup and I love hand cut fries. The turkey burger is pretty good, although I've yet to have one that's as good as my homemade one. I think the night I went to this specific location the cook was cooking the burgers a little too hard. My husbands Turkey burger was dry and so was my impossible burger. Love the beer selection too.","Tried Bareburger for the first time. This location has a nice outdoor dining deck. And it's several feet from the street. Pet dogs are allowed in the outdoor area. I ordered the Buckaroo burger, medium temperature/doneness. The beef patty was a decent thickness. But it was cooked to well done. Completely gray and not even a hint of pink. So it was sadly very dry. I took the top bun off and still left a quarter of the patty on my tray. Very disappointed at $14.95 which doesn't come with fries or a side. My friend's burger was also over cooked despite asking for medium rare. I looked at a neighboring table, and their burgers also looked well done. Waffle fries were ok. The special sauce & garlic aoili were ok. Our waitress asked if we wanted the fries first or at the same time as our burgers; we said with our burgers. The fries were brought out first instead.Staff was friendly. But we didn't see our waitress after taking our order. She didn't check in when we got our food. We saw her after we were finished and it was only because she went to take orders of new customers at other tables. She also didn't offer to bring water for our dogs. Other tables had disposable bowls of water for their pups.For beef burgers, the J.G. Melon franchise on MacDougal is a better choice. Two stars is for the outdoor dining, large menu selection, and dog-friendliness.","I ordered a delectable Buttermilk Buffalo sandwich with a buffalo sauce-soaked chicken breast and a sweet soft brioche bun. The chicken is real crispy and the white innards are warm. Buns are typically so-so, but Bareburger buns are high quality.The atmosphere is warm and the service is friendly.",Bareburger
655,"A lot of options here. The sides were decent. I liked the potato croquettes with curry. They were crispy on the outside while fluffy on the inside. I also did not detect any hint of stinky fry oil.  Pork belly had a nice crust while remaining juicy on the inside. Okonomiyaki was a little soggy.  The eel don wasnt that great. There wasnt much taste. There wasnt much eel. It was mostly tofu and rice.  The karaage while crispy, also lacked seasoning.  All i could taste was the breading and fry oil.","Came here with my girlfriend on a Friday night. Nice interior. Atmosphere felt Izakaya-like. The food was decent - not the best. We tried the sauce katsudon and the ribeye stone pot.The sauce katsudon came way late. I thought they forgot about it - the other dish was finished before they brought it out. The katsu was flavorful and crisp. It sat next to an egg/onion omelette dish and on top of a bed of cabbage and rice. Overall, quite decent, though not the best and not riveting.The ribeye was a bit disappointing. Small portion size, dry nontender meat, and the corn was cold. The sauce was good though.Overall, come for the ambiance of a small Japanese joint, but the food is so-so. By the way, this place has NO TIPPING, so keep that in mind.","This place was very disappointing. Even though the prices were all fairly cheap, the dishes were all extremely salty. I ordered a beef udon and it was impossible to eat it without continuously chugging water. My friend who ordered a crab egg dish was told that they use real crabs. However, we all tasted and confirmed that it is fake. Overall, I would avoid this place unless there is nowhere else to go.","Great neigborhood izakaya with friendly staff who know regulars by nam - and there are plenty of them here, too!  The food is solid and the portions generous.  No tipping here either!1. Tan Tan Ramen: Solid with a rich, flavorful broth and a thicker wavy ramen noodle.  The portion is huge as well!2. Neopolitan spaghetti: This was decent with plenty of thick-cut bacon in a sweet and spicy tomato sauce.3. Eggplant and okra: Sweet and savory braised eggplant.  Very solidOverall, it's a great hidden gem by Columbus Circle - plus it's open until 4 am on weekends too!","*This is a no-tipping establishment*I came here with two other people. I got the Shake Ikura Don ($16), friend got Yakiniku Don ($14.25), and my other friend got Tan Tan Men ($15.50). We also got Yakisoba ($12) for the table. Shake Ikura Don consists of salmon sashimi, grilled fillet roe over rice. I wish they were more generous with the salmon sashimi. The ratio of sashimi to rice was quite underwhelming. I just had too much leftover rice which also lacked flavor. I tried to fill my stomach with the Yakisoba that we ordered to share, but it was way too salty because it had way too much sauce. Service was good though! We came right when they opened for dinner and were promptly seated. Our waitress checked up on us throughout our meal and refilled our waters whenever it was needed.",I felt like I was in Japan here :) great humble vibes and great dinner I had & spend time.There are yakitori & yakiniku (BBQ) izakaya style restaurant a in the same building. It's great place visit when you miss/crave Japanese food while you are visiting from Japan or anytime when you want to sit down and have great food!,Donburiya
656,"We happened to stumble upon this hidden jewel off of Flatbush Ave after another restaurant that we were interested in wasn't open for business yet. There is outdoor seating available for those who may be interested in soaking up Vitamin D while enjoying their meal. I believe there were about four tables available for outside dining.My friend and I decided to try the chicken breast sandwich which consisted of a grilled chicken breast, turkey bacon, mashed avocado, lettuce, tomato and Mayo on a tasty soft toasted brioche roll and the PurBird mac n' cheese. I told our server to omit the avocado dressing on my sandwich but somehow it was on my order when it arrived. Rather than wait for another sandwich or the cook choosing to wipe the dressing off himself in place of making a new sandwich , I did it myself instead. However, the small mishap wasn't enough for me to not write a good review because the food was really good.The decor is simple, nothing outstanding which is okay because the focus should be on that good chicken coming out of the kitchen. If you sign up on their website, they will email you specials and coupons. Hey, who doesn't like specials and coupons especially when good food is involved? I know that I do! I can't wait until my next visit to PurBird!",They removed whole and half chicken from the menu to squeeze out more money. Lost a customer.,"Really legit! Sandwich is packed with flavor, mac is very cheesy, chicken marinade is good.","I love grilled chicken sandwiches and whenever I can find a place that makes them well, I take note.  With the beautiful pics from Purbird, I had to try it out and they did not disappoint!My friend had the regular chicken thigh wrap and of course I went for the sandwich. Layered with lettuce, tomatoes, turkey bacon and crushed avocado, I added raw red onions for an extra kick. It was delicious. Everything was fresh and crisp, the bread, like a brioche cloud The employees are personable and provided quick service.The wrap also looked great and heard it was tasty. A group of regulars came and ordered chicken breat cutlets with some type of green leafy veggies in a bowl and that, too, looked great. Definitely worth another visit.","This is a cute little chicken at the corner of flatbush and 6ave. Can't miss it as you can see the blue color and big sign from a mile away lol. The chicken is grilled, flavorful and very moist. It's not your regular size chicken but the little hen. It's flatten and grilled to perfection. We have 2 sides: jalapeno mac and cheese, it was very spicy and pretty greasy, and sweet potato fries, which were pretty soggy, but the chicken was the total bomb. It's self serve but the guy was nice to bring us water and our food. Even though the chicken was delicious, I found it very expensive $31 for 1/2 chicken and 2 sides, and the half chicken is a very small portion. I saw the board and it's $10.50 for a lettuce salad and extra $5 if you want chicken in it. Food took a while to come out. Place seemed empty but they had lots of to go orders.","This was my first visit to Purbird. It was 11:45am on a Sunday. I ordered the spicy half chicken and the jalapeno mac and cheese. I paid, gathered my utensils and napkin, then took my seat at the window. I enjoyed my meal while listening to alternative and classic rock on 92.3 FM including Green Day. The chicken was great. I highly appreciated the Purebird sauce which I dipped my bread into. It's their version of barbecue sauce. The mac and cheese was fine. It's great food but too expensive for the serving size to make it a regular thing.",Purbird
657,"We were there before and it was packed, didnt want to wait so we left. This time we are lucky, seated right away. Food was nice but nothing wow. Decent food i would say. 3 entree and 2 soft drinks for over $120. Pretty pricy","Steak was on our minds and we decided to satiate that craving on Saturday and it was a disappointment.  We have our usual spot and decided to venture off the path by visiting El Almacen.  I don't know I read somewhere that this place was dark and sexy, but it was more dated and made me feel slightly uneasy.  When we approached the door it looked Victorian.  When my bf and I had to walk to  our table, he tripped because of plank possibly or step that was difficult to see in the dark.  The water glass wasn't the cleanest.  I ordered the entrana and it was tasty, but not mind blowing.  My bf ordered the Churassco and he wasn't too happy with it either.  My rose wine was fine.  Our sides were poblano mash and truffle fries.  The poblano mash was decent, but fell below expectations.",This restaurant is over priced. I order the Paella and it was very salty and it had to many red pepper.,"Hmmmmm... The appetizers were ok but the 14oz Ribeye Steak I had  was F!@#$k¡G awesome !!!!! Great place for date night ... I can skip the appetizer but you should try it anywayz... next time, I go straight to the steak and drinks ...","El Almacen is definitely one of the best Argentinian places I've been to. It's decor is. Quaint and the setting is very intimate , perfect for dinner with friends or that special someone. My girlfriends and I went for dinner after work one day and spent maybe three hours there. Amazing ambiance ! Their guacamole with hot chips is amazing - flavored beautifully and pairs well with the warm lightly salted chips, the steak was super juicy and cooked a perfect medium and paired well with the house red. The lemon chicken was also well seasoned, super flavorful and juicy. It is definitely one of our favorites and we will be back.",I came here expecting some amazing steak because of the reviews and the prices but the steak I got was really chewy and didn't have a lot of flavor. Maybe it's my fault for getting a skirt steak? The empanadas were good though. Inside it's like a long dark corridor so I didn't love the atmosphere. Service was good though. My friend liked his food.,El Almacen
658,"Ok, over several yrs now, I've pretty much only used Yelp to shout out great places. But just FYI I want to share a lousy experience with Voula. I made a reservation for 8pm 7/3. Was looking forward to it. At 6pm I get call from guy saying that the restaurant kitchen is closing early for the holiday. I was confused. Like, are you still serving dinner? Yes. So, what time would we need to get there? He said, sort of reluctantly, ""I guess 7pm would be ok."" No sense of apology or explanation or anything. I said that we'd go somewhere else. But how WEIRD is that? I mean, serve dinner or don't serve dinner, but isn't a 7pm deadline is a strange way to run a kitchen? I called back to complain and the man just said ok and hung up; he couldn't get it together to say ""We're sorry"" or any other professional fucking response. So lame. it felt like some kind of management/ customer service breakdown. Too bad.","Meh. I really wanted to like this place but it didn't live up to expectations.Food was mediocre. I ordered the beef souvlaki and it was served lukewarm. One entree was delivered 20 minutes late. No acknowledgement from the server that the dish had been forgotten - we had to bring it to her attention. When we asked to remove that dish from the bill at the end of the dinner, the manager resisted and was reluctant to take responsibility.Several redeeming qualities: Eventually the forgotten dish was comp'd (thank you), and the desserts were very good.Bottom line: Food quality and service not comparable with the price point. Approach with caution!","My girlfriend and I came here hoping for a new authentic greek restaurant and we were disappointed. We will not be coming back for the reasons below:- First they brought us the wrong drinks and then our actual drinks came out 30 minutes later. - The restaurant is so loud that you can't hear anything- it was difficult to hold a conversation without shouting (the people next to us were complaining as well).  - the food was sub par and one of the dishes came out cold- bad service. They forgot to bring us our main dish, but still had it on the final bill. We really wanted to like this place but won't be coming back. Hope they can turn it around!","Excellent food Excellent cocktails Excellent service!Thank you for the amazing dinner,I will back soon!","Can't say enough about this delightful spot smack dab in the middle of the West Village, currently leading the pack on my 'can't miss' list. Loud, hustling and bustling, it's not, and they could actually benefit from a bit more attention to the lighting in the back, but it is warm, welcoming, and perfect for groups. (**Extra kudos for taking - and seating - large parties easily, splitting the check without hesitation, etc. It goes a long way!)Portions are healthy and the value can't be beat - which is oh so refreshing, as I could probably name a dozen other Greek spots that break the bank with sub-par fare.Start the night off with one of their craft cocktails (Karpouzi and Dirty Greek are two of my faves) or a glass of wine from their hyper-curated wine list, and dig into the warm bread basket - overflowing with soft pretzels (pro tip, don't be afraid to ask for more!)Menu musts include the Greek Trilogy, Karpouzi Salata (yes, I'm a watermelon fan :-), pan-seared feta, grilled octopus and the greek meatballs. I think I could've solely polished off all of these in one sitting - look away!!Entrees really show off their Greek-American vibe as standouts from each side of the coin include the Moussaka (one of the best), seafood grill and the simple yet delicious organic chicken with seasoned fries (don't miss!) and feta.The service can be a bit slow at times, but maybe we should take that as a hint to relax and enjoy life's little pleasures like sharing a great meal with friends, loved ones, family.....**Great for a casual date night, girls night, large groups with no fuss, dinner with the parents**","We were a party of four last night, decided we needed something new and decided to have Greek Mediterranean cuisine.We arrived, pleasantly surprised of how classy and beautiful this welcoming restaurant is. We had fresh summer cocktails ordered throughout with the suggestions and help of Ms Voula herself providing personal attention. The selection of appetizers included the most tender squid, tasty homemade dolmades and zucchini slices with txatziki. Dinner was fresh branzino, a lamb wrapped in filo with lemon flavor and delicious moussaka. We had amazing service personal treatment. This is our new favorite place.We will certainly return.",Voula
659,Zero star... Worst brunch ever! The waiters and waitresses have million pounds of egos with no accountability and actually got angry when I asked for water and hot sauce.Everything in here has changed for worst not our old happy spot anymore.,"Honestly I am so disappointed with this visit (Saturday brunch) that I can't remember if there was anything good about this brunch.First of all, what's up with asking for the tip before we get the food and received the actual service? Wait for it...I ordered the wild salmon salad (16$) which was suppose to come with baby spinach and grape tomatoes. To my surprise baby spinach looks a lot like giant old spinach (picture reference). ALL of grape tomatoes were spoiled. Each and everyone of them! In a few minutes, I find a piece of chicken in it. W*f! Let's just hope I wasn't finishing someone else's salad. It is more then just disappointing for the most expensive item from their menu.The toasts came with weird frozen/spoiled strawberries and blueberries. First time in my life I see a cafe/restaurant use not fresh berries during summer season when the prices are at the lowest in Brooklyn.The plates are carried with waiter's fingertips in your food. Yumm!Ordered some ice tea. Received it with no ice. Asked for some ice. Were told to go to the corner of the cafe and get ice ourselves from some pitcher.Asked for some napkins. Were told to go and get it ourselves. You see... I might be ok with all that ""go, get it yourself"" if they were busy, but everywhere I would look around, the staff would be just standing around and talking. And just 4 tables, including ours, were occupied. So remember how they ask to pay for the meal and give tip in advance? Tad-aam! That's why!","I've always had a great time here and really appreciated the way the restaurant was run before. Now with the new changes and new staff--I didn't feel welcome. Our waiter didn't look interested and had a terrible attitude when we wanted to order. I also didn't like the fact that we had to pay tip before the service to see how much of a tip the waiter actually deserved. I have tip but I regret it because honestly, the service wasn't worth any tip. We had ordered and waited over an hour for our order whereas other people that came and ordered after received their food earlier. On top of it when the food arrived, the waiter didn't even get it right. The waitress that served us the food to ""tell the waiter next time,"" which we did when we ordered.. unbelievable. We didn't get utensils until we asked for it. My husband had to go up to the kitchen area to get his own utensils. I usually don't write reviews or complain but I've been coming here for ages and I've never had a problem. I don't think I'll be coming back anymore.","Love love love this place. Come here at least once a week! Avocado and egg option heaven. The hot egg skillet dishes are my fave. During the week it's a self-serve type of place, but they do waiter service on weekends. It's usually busy even mid-day weekdays but tables free up quickly.I highly recommend","No Milk and Definitely No Honey.  We arrived for an evening cup of coffee and ordered two cappuccinos and a large cup of coffee.  I was told that there wasn't enough for a large coffee that I ordered.  They poured the bottom of the pot and told me there was only enough for a small.  Who would give a customer the bottom of the barrel and not make a new pot of coffee?  Strike one and two no thank you.  I don't want your small cup of old coffee at the bottom of the barrel.  Then my mother in law asked if she could get a little bit of extra milk as her's was to strong.  I went and asked for a squirt of milk... That's a latte sir from the two year old making the coffee.  We will have to charge you extra.  For what, a shot of milk.  Seriously???  We have come here several times before and have enjoyed the experience... Never again... Rude to say the least.Furthermore, the staff including the manager were picking veggies out of the salad cold tasty and eating then right in front of customers with their bare hands.  If your hungry, I'm sure you can make yourself something to eat and either sit in the front or go to the back and eat, but please don't pick food that will be used to make customers food with your bare hands.","Tl;dr up front because this will be long: Too much effort into being trendy, not enough into great food and service.At first sight, everything about Milk & Honey appears aesthetically pleasing. However, the warm, modern farmhouse decor and (trying too hard to be) trendy menu is juxtaposed by mediocre service and painfully disappointing food.Our party of 4 arrived on a Sunday, around 1 pm. While we waited for a table, a couple arrived behind us and were pointed to a table. As they turned to head over, the host taps the man with menus and says, ""don't forget these."" Maybe I'm not milennial enough to not take note of that, but I digress.We were seated after a short wait and given menus. And then waited longer. The restaurant was busy, but not overly so, and even with staff constantly walking by no one came over to greet us. After flagging someone down, we were able to order, but had to ask twice for water. I don't recall seeing any member of the staff ever smile.You pay and tip right after ordering, they take your card at the table, with the ipad used to place the orders. I guess no one ever adds on to their meal.We ordered the steak panini, pastrami stack, chicken flatbread, poached eggs with corn fritters, and a mango tango and Cosmo to drink. After receiving the food, I'm convinced that they don't know what culinary terms actually mean and are just using them to sound trendy. The cocktails are non-alcoholic, which it says on the menu but still means it's not a cocktail. The Cosmo for what it was, was good, but the mango tango, which was described as a mango punch, tasted like watered down mango juice from concentrate.The panini used sliced bread and was not grilled, i.e., not a panini. The corn fritters weren't fried... I think you know where I'm going with this*... and the ""hollandaise"" was just not. Also, the pastrami stack was ambitious but executed poorly. The sandwich was so uneven- some spots had the slaw, some had pickles, some onion ring, but never had a bite that had everything. Mysteriously, the stack was served a la carte while the steak panini came with a modest serving of roasted potatoes. The flatbread was very one note, that note being chipotle mayonnaise (it says aioli but couldn't taste any garlic).All of that being said, the food wasn't necessarily bad overall, at best just inconsistent and not what it was supposed to be.*side note: sauteeing fritter batter how it was done here doesn't fully cook it and leaves it quite sticky.",Milk & Honey Cafe
660,"Meh.... So not Taiwanese flavor noodle soup.We tried the beef noodle, tasted like random sauces put together that I made at home myself. Meat was tender.Sausage savory crepe - it's not sausage but hot dog spam.... fraud...Gwa bao was also just okay...","I came here on a weekend night and it was empty when I arrived but full when I left. I went inside, looked at the menu, and ordered the intestine noodles with rice noodles (instead of the normal noodles). The food came out quite quickly and I mixed it all together. I appreciated that there were some green vegetables in the soup. My food wasn't hot so I suspect the food wasn't really fresh. The noodles were really not that great because they were too soft. I suspect the noodles were cooked long ago and then dipped into water to reheat them. The intestines weren't fresh either but I did appreciate that they had cleaned the insides out. Anyway, this was a really mediocre noodles spot, and the soup was only and not flavorful at all. It was $8.80 including tax, and the portions were quite average too. I'm not a fan, there are definitely better noodle soup than this!",Food was okay. I paid right after I ordered and the guy worked there asked me to give tips upon leaving while my uber was waiting on me. Reason he gave me was that I asked for some water. Would never visit again.,"This review is for the jian bing.At first bite, the flavor made my taste buds sing! I got the duck and it's sooo juicy. The bing came fresh and piping hot, and also with a thin crispy layer inside.Although the signs did not say duck as an option, I saw some reviews of the duck jian bing so I asked if they still had them, and they do!The lady behind the register was super nice. She speaks English and Mandarin (maybe even Cantonese). She had a very cheery attitude.","we were greeted with such enthusiasm and smiles the moment we walked into this tiny place. probably seats about 12 people MAX. soybean jajiangmian was hot and warm with noodles cooked to the perfect chew. add an egg (lu dan) the egg itself is cold but the yolk inside is parboiled; adds great flavor!the chongqing beef noodle soup was also deep and flavorful; not my favorite in the city but its such a great value.their cucumber appetizer was also refreshing and crunchy. all three items  totalled to about $20, something which would probably only get you one bowl of noodles in more buzzy parts of town.they also serve jian bing, a beloved chinese crepe snack. will be sure to try some next time.","This restaurant was recommended by a local buddy. And I must say: I like it. I took my wife (who is from mainland China) and she gave her approval.  The food and the restaurant ""A"" rating put a smile on her face. Yiwanmen had an Asian banner in front which mean bowl of noodle (thanks honey). It's their speciality and the taste proved it. I've had most of their bowls. My favorites are the pork belly, wonton noodle soup and seafood noodle soup. Their crepes and small dishes are delicious as well.For quick and great food, this is the place. Fantastic value. Given the four stars giving five to uptrend the aggregate.",Yiwanmen

Feel like i just took a sip of piss!","The food and ambience were excellent. Service wasn't the best. We went during week night on Wednesday and it was packed. About 25 minute wait for table of 4. Maybe that's why the service wasn't great but it wasn't awful either. Both Chilean Sea Bass and Mock Duck were excellent. Definitely give this restaurant a try. I personally don't like it repeat restaurants as I'm always looking for new places to dine but if you've never been there, definitely make reservations on open table.","Run, don't walk to Sala Thai! I recommend trying items from the 2 right-side menu panels. Had these 3 dishes and they were superb!MIENG MAMUANG (Mango Compote Wrapped in Betel Leaves); OVER RICE THAI STREET FOOD-KRAPRAW GAI SUB (Minced Chicken, Chili, Long Chili, String Bean, Thai Basil topped w Fried Egg); KAENG RAWANG NEUR BAI CHA POO (Braised Jarret Beef, Lemongrass, House Made Thai Chili Paste, Betel Leaves) served in a brass metal bowl.","This has become one of my favorite Thai restaurants! I love that the menu has many, many selections and that it's split into ""traditional"" and ""Americanized"" dishes. It brings the best of both worlds together. I also love the interior design of the restaurant. It feels like you're entering a temple. The staff are very respectful, kind, and great with recommendations and explaining the different dishes.So far, I have tried the Thai crepe dumplings, Krapraw Gai Sub (street food style minced chicken with rice), and Pad Thai Bolan. All have been beautifully presented and delicious. The dumplings are an amazing blue/purple color. The Krapraw Gai Sub is simple but tasty. And the Pad Thai Bolan is nestled inside an egg nest with prawns which is very cool! The Thai iced tea complements all the dishes well!I recommend this place highly to everyone and have been bringing family and friends whenever I can!","We visited Sala for dinner. We're out looking for a restaurant around the neighborhood and felt attracted by its decor while walking by.We were actually looking for food we could accompany with red wine since it was Cabernet world day.We decided to leave red wine for other occasion and give this place a try.We were greeted and sat promptly.Server was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.Ordered two classics: pad Thai with chicken and red curry with tofu. Both were delicious.To pair these dishes we ordered a bottle of sparkling wine which was ok...For dessert we had the trio of sorbets. Two of the three were icy, like there're left out of the cold for a while in other occasion.Overall the experience was great, with the dessert being a slight bump on the road.Also the wine list could be improved to make the experience even better.We definitely are going back soon to try other dishes!","Terrible. I don't usually leave reviews but this time I had to. Because I've never been treated like this before and I'm not even a difficult customer. Ordered a to-go pad see ew and my food was way spicier than the spicy level i ordered. I can't even eat it (and I love spicy food and have this order all the time) I took couple bites and gave up, stomach had been burning since - coming from someone loves spicy food. Called them back to ask to remake it. the lady talked to her manager, the answer was ""you chose the order and there's nothing we can do about it"". I said it's my first time ordering here can you pls help? Also i know what a normal spicy level tastes like. Can i speak to the manager? All answers i got was no. Never been treated like this before. So I said I'm not leaving a good review and hung up. IMMEDIATELY they called back and said will remake one ONLY because ""it's your first time and you didn't know how we cook here so we remake it but one time only"" - well thanks for your great customer service, you only cared about your review. you are losing a customer and maybe more",SalaThai Restaurant
662,"My parents and i came to New York for one day and were really excited to try some Korean BBQ and, even though it was a 30 min walk from our hotel, we walked the entire way only for it to be closed by 9:30/9:45pm, even though I searched online and on apps and it said it closed at midnight. I made a reservation through this app, I even called twice and no one would pick up. I thought they were just busy and everything would be fine. Next thing I know, we show up and they tell us we have to leave bc they closed the kitchen early for Labor Day Weekend... They were barely sympathetic to the fact that we walked all that way. Mentioned my reservation and they seemed completely dumbfounded...They should have posted that early closing time or at least picked up the phone when I called. Ruined our whole entire plan for the night and experience... if you're gonna accept reservations through Yelp, at least make sure that you'll be able to confirm it. Very disappointed with this (barely an) experience.",Horrible service on a Saturday evening at the bar.  Couldn't get an order in with two servers and there were hardly any guests. Eunjin was a specifically bad server.,"Meal is ok. However, we found 2 sharp pieces of plastics in just one meal. First one was in seafood pancake. People who eat fast would not found it. We told the waitress right away wishing to have an explanation but the waitress grabbed it from us and hid it away so that we couldn't take a picture or have any form of evidence to argue. They did bring us a new order of pancake but just regular ones, no seafood. I attached the second piece of plastic photo to this comment. I found it in the soup which is really scary if people just drink it. I would give this place a 0 or negative stars if possible. Risking my life eating an expensive dinner here. Super pissed, not happy.","I came here on a Sunday night and the restaurant was relatively empty. An interesting location for a kbbq joint, however the restaurant quickly filled up with families and (not that I see colour) but all non-Koreans. It got busy very quickly out of nowhere. The front has high tops, bar seating and feels like a lounge, whereas the back is meant for the grilling. I ordered the pork belly and the pork belly was thiccc. Usually don't see pork belly that thiccc unless you're in Korea. Upon further inspection, I noticed that the pork belly was primarily fat, maybe 50% of it. Everyone has their own opinions on how much fat should be on meat, generally lower the fat the better obviously, but the pork belly was still good. I tried to pinpoint what the main difference between this pork belly had vs. Jongro and I think it's the fat/thiccc ratio. The pork belly came with cheese corn, egg and grilled kimchi; also came with dwenjang jigae which is often difficult these days to get with your kbbq (for free). I ended up leaving a lot of the fat on a plate since it was getting a bit too glutinous for me, but otherwise, the place The standout here was the service. Our waitress was super attentive and refilled ban chan, etc. as needed without us even asking. She was cordial and helped make the overall experience much more enjoyable. The rest of the staff was very pleasant as well. Even after things got really busy (every kbbq table was filled), still no issues even though they looked pretty short staffed. After second thought, the location isn't as weird as I thought, considering it's right in between Penn & PABT, and likely attracts a lot of the tourists (a lot of hotels in the area). All in all, a pretty solid KBBQ spot that's outside of ktown. The service and overall attentiveness was the real winner at this place. I can see how many would be turned off by the fat to meat ratio, and how thicccc the pork belly is. I can see myself coming here again - looks like it's a great location for larger parties/reservations as well, which ktown does not offer at top spots.Came here a second time and it was just as good as the first time - consistent food, consistent service, recommend","Cute spot, great happy hour! Though the barbecue looked AMAZING and clean as I walked by the tables for the bathroom, my girlfriend and I just came for happy hour. We got the large order of Korean fried chicken. Unexpectedly spicy but mild and really crisp. I enjoyed it a lot. Plus, they pushed the meat forward so that you can hold just the drumstick part and it was easy to eat. For happy hour, the drinks were around $5 so we got a Pinot grigio and a rose. Not quite sure how to describe these drinks but I loved them. They weren't dry nor too sweet. I would come back if I was in the area. It can get quite loud but what atmosphere would it be if it was super quiet??","This gem is located on the west side slightly removed from the main Korean street on 32nd. The decor is modern and spacious and is a definite departure from many Korean establishments, but the food is traditional at its core. We stopped in for lunch and did not have bbq, so keep that in mind as you read this review. The food we did have was delicious. The banchan was flavorful and varied. We started with the fried beef mandoo and they were amazing! Great filling and chewy wrappers with spicy dipping sauce. One of us ordered the fried rice with pork. I would have liked a little more seasoning, either more spice or more savory. It just looked a little bland. My kimchi stew was great though. There were chunks of pork and glass noodles throughout. This place is a great find and we'll be back to try the bbq on another visit!",GOGI 37
663,"Sigh. I love Shake Shack and can't find it in me to give a negative review, but unfortunately the Battery Park location frequently has problems with quality consistency.I live in Battery Park so this is my neighborhood Shack; I basically come here at least once a month. However, each month I come, the food can be normal (comparable to other Shacks) or they can be totally off. Case in point: just two days ago, I picked up my mobile order and noticed that the fries are severely over salted! The amount of salt in there is simply ridiculous; there's no way anyone can eat this without getting a stomachache! I had to throw 90% of it out. Unfortunately, this isn't the first time this has happened. In fact, this has happened so frequently that I'm very disappointed as a Shack fan and feel compelled to write this review. I noticed the Battery Park location often has new staff working; it seems like they do a lot of training here for new staff and therefore the quality of food is really inconsistent. I can't help but feel that situations like these keep happening at this location because there isn't a good quality check system in place, or the new trainees simply don't realize/can't tell. Quality consistently is so important; you don't want to drive away any loyal fans! And as a fan, it's just frustrating. Please double, triple check all orders/food before releasing them!","The burger was good but the restaurant is so chaotic, I understand that it's nyc but I think they need better order.  The restaurant was not clean the bathroom was dirty and it took 25 minutes for me to get my cheeseburger and fries","I am not a BIG fan of shake shack near my office. The only reason is the line is ridiculously LOOOONNNGGG. It makes no sense that they only had two cashiers and a line outside the door. It's quite frustrating. I was a little disappointed in the Shrom burger (veggie). It's usually very good, but this time it was not hot and was missing its usual flavor. They can't mess up the fries, but I really wish they would change their fries basket. This one is too small for the dollar. If it weren't for the line to the cashier and the slow service they would definitely get 4 or 5 stars, but this time I was not pleased with the service or food.","I LOOOOVE the Smroom Burger, the best item on the menu. Excellent quality and flavor overall, but a tad on the pricy side.For a regular burger and fries, comparing In-n-Out vs Shake Shack at par, in the same content configuration, In-n-Out tastes much better in my opinion. Primarily due to the difference and taste of the lettuce and spread.What I can't keep my mind off on is the mushroom burger (Smroom Burger) so delicious and well made! Had me craving for more when I returned to the West Coast. Now I'm gonna have to hunt down the Shake Shacks in the LA area and give them a try. Hands down the best Mushroom Burger I've ever had so far. Crispy and crunchy on the outside and soft and juicy on the inside. Simply Irresistible.","I'm a burger guy and have been hearing about this place for a while now. We don't have this establishment in Indiana and now I know what we are missing. Simply AMAZING. The double cheese burger was cooked perfectly with a little pink in the middle. The only reason they don't get 5 stars, is the fries are ""middle of the road"" but the burger more than makes up for it. The orange shake was one of the best I've ever had. On a side note after this review, Shake Shack reaches out to me with a gift card hoping I make it back. I will definitely seek out this place where ever I go until they make their way to Indiana.","I'm a burger guy and have been hearing about this place for a while now.

664,"My drinks were good. My food was excellent. The bartender is weird and rude. He makes faces at everyone and he is awkward. For him to even bring a coffee to my table for my waitress put such a bad vibe in the air. He really needs to go. I am so perplexed as to why have someone work there that makes people uncomfie. Other reviews mentioned it and the table next to me also did. I did not like how 3 quarters of the dining room was empty yet 2 bus boys were lingering next to me trying to clear food I was still eating. Annoying. For toast and jam ($6) I got 4 triangles of bread. When finished I had more than half of my jam left. I asked for a piece of bread or 2 to finish my jam but I was told I can only order the dish again. They refused to sell me a piece of bread. I woulda paid $2-$3 for bread but nope they brought out the whole jam dish again. Lol. Anyway, even with all that the food and my waitress made up for all of it and I would still go back.","Similar to some other reviews, I really wanted to like this place but there were some serious communication issues with the staff. Our party of 4 was forgotten.  We sat at the bar while we waited and the bartender was extremely rude and not accommodating at all. We tried to be patient and did enjoy our food when we finally got sat but I don't think it's worth it.","We ate dinner last night there and the food was delicious.  With 5 people we ordered a majority of the menu and each dish was devoured.  I took away 2 stars because of the service.  Our waiter was nice and knowledgeable but SLOW.  We sat for a while without ordering and was only given an opportunity to order our 2nd drink as our entree plates were being removed, which was after two courses.  In addition, before we sat we waited at the bar for a brief time for our table to get ready.  While at the bar I asked the bartender about making me a drink.  He was utterly rude.  I was interested in  tequila drink as the one on the menu wasn't to my liking.  I asked him if he knew of another mix that he has made, looking for suggestions and he gave me a flat and annoyed NO.  The exchange was soo uncomfortable that when I sat I switched to vodka hoping he wouldn't know it was me ordering.  The bartender shouldn't be in the service industry talking to patrons.","This place is known for its sourdough pancakes and yes they do live up to the hype. The pancake is thick with a slightly gooey center, which I'm a big fan of, but the best part is that it's completely soaked in maple syrup. And if you think that's not decadent enough, they also add two knobs of chilled butter at the top which slowly melts as you eat the pancake. Service was friendly and attentive. Decor is rustic barnyard chic (so hot right now). They have a decent drinks selection at brunch, including a delicious aperol spritz.","So I'd like to give this a better review.  Overall the food was really well done, and on par with what I had hoped it would be.Then came the octopus.We were there for my friend's birthday, and the three of us were sharing all the dishes.  The octopus arrived, a sad tentacle on the plate.  It seemed kind of like a joke -- $20 for that?  It wasn't a tasting menu, this wasn't le Bernardin.  I asked the waiter if that was actually all it was meant to be and he sort of bristled as if I was being rude to ask.I spend a lotttt of money eating out in New York, but there is a reality that restaurants cut corners all the time.  It's at times egregious given when they're asking you to pay.  If they'd wanted to be gracious they could have replaced the plate.  Even if they're short changing people who won't mention it they could have saved face with me.  But they didn't.","Brunch review: A pioneer in a very remote & interesting  area next to Dumbo. The restaurant is charming and I've been here twice for brunch with different experiences. Their brunch menu is very very limited and first time was less than impressed. This trip was long overdue and enjoyed their food at 55 Water St especially the roast chicken.Ate:Shrimp and grits""the pancake""GreensThe shrimp and grits are tiny sized yet tasty. No bread or greens unless you pay $13 for some salad greens so value- eh. Now on to the PANCAKE - a superstar made from a sourdough starter and cooked in a cast iron skillet. It arrives bubbling with butter and syrup and baked with tart apples. I got the small size which is perfect for one or two.This is pancake pleasure at its finest and a top pancake, which redeems alot of misses.",Vinegar Hill House
665,"I was walking around the area and decided to stop by honestly based on the decor. It's a cute cafe with a long communal table (along with smaller tables on the side) and 2 hanging chairs. Got the BLT & a side of original fries. The fries were cold, hard, dry and extremely chewy. The BLT wasn't that great either - the bread was rock hard and actually cut up the roof of my mouth. Did not realize that this was a vegan spot until I left the cafe so maybe my review is a bit skewed (I'm definitely not a vegan and have never had vegan meals before). I'd probably come here to use the space to do work but would not come back for the food.",Gone WAY downhill. The Greek is supposed to have shredded lettuce but I've been getting barely cut and old lettuce the past 5-6 times I've visited (and I go multiple times a week usually). The staff is sloppy and slow now too.Someone needs to quality check this location and retrain their staff!,"All of my food was undercooked, and my fries were not even cooked?? they were just still hard cold potatoes cut up. I am super disappointed, I used to go here to treat myself. Speaking with co-workers apparently the food quality has drastically dropped off and they too have been served under/uncooked food. (I heard the head Chef left some time ago, maybe that's why?) This is unacceptable because the prices are so high, I wasted way too much money on uncooked inedible food. I tried reaching the restaurant  but was not able to get through.","THE FOOD AT BY CHLOE IS AMAZING! The only thing I wouldn't get again is the fries because I'm a very healthy manner they are baked and not fried..,, I like my fries ... fried.. The juices are delicious and you can taste the freshness in all of their ingredients. I took my mom here for Mother's Day and she loved it (she hates eating out)! So much so that she took a group of friends from work.All in all ... 9/10 would recommend!",Every time I'm in NY I make sure to make my way to by Chloe for vegan sweets. The pastries are absolutely delightful and melt in your mouth. I've purchased an assortment of treats for a business meeting for my clients - they finished it off completely! Chlostess Cupcake definitely lives up to the hype. It's moist with a hint of bourbon that adds the perfect balance to the sweetness. It's overwhelmingly sweet or chocolate-y. My palate is satiated!!!,"Oh man, I have passed by Chloe dozens of times and finally had the opportunity to eat here. I had a taco salad and the air fried sweet potato fries. Amazing. It's a hefty portion and the flavors all come together so nicely. Food is fresh, the establishment is clean and cute and they have organic wines in cans! Yes, please. Will definitely be back here to try the burgers.",by CHLOE. West Village
666,"Otto burger, I had when I first moved to this area, was fantastic. I saw ""deep fried"" and thought what the what...idk about that. But it was awesome.The next thing I tried was the Fish N Chips and it was incredible. I was craving it tonight, so I ordered it.Absolutely awful. Just completely terrible. I was craving THEIR version of the dish and spent $20 to eat two wet bites and offer it to my roommates before tossing it. Had to order wings from Bonnie's.This is upsetting because they've been so delicious but the fish doesn't even LOOK like it used to. The 4 tenders that they used to make.No seasoning, no flavor and super wet when cutting into it. Almost just like watery fish. The sauces, however, are incredible! Saved those for something else. But disappointed I had to give this up and order from an entirely different restaurant at 9:18pm.","My husband and I went there for brunch, and were pretty let down by the quality of food. He ordered pancakes and I ordered vegan entree, both of which were below average. Wouldn't go back.","The ambience was very nice, hip decor, quiet music. The food was good. However, the water was undrinkable, the wait staff was completely inattentive (never came over to ask how things were) and very difficult to get her attention. Since I couldn't drink the water, I spent a good time trying to get her attention, then ordered a beer but by the time it came, I was almost done with my meal. It was not very busy either. Therefore, I gave a small tip, then saw that they had charged me more than what I wrote as tip. So I called the restaurant to correct this, the server argued with me and once I said that the service was bad the server very rudely hung up on me before I could finish speaking. I had to call back to ensure I was indeed getting my money sent back on my card. Who changes what you write as tip? This is scary.","Saw them on Burgers, Brew & Que.  A deep fried burger?!  Had to check it out.Got here later on a Saturday night around 9:30 after the dinner rush.  A couple of tables had guests with some at the bar also.  Started with the Korzo Ale which is brewed for them by a local brewer so had to try it.  Wasn't too hoppy and had an Amber color. Ordered the Original Korzo Burger.  First, I wouldn't have known it was deep fried as it wasn't greasy.  I ordered it medium and they got it right.  The Langos dough was light and balanced with the meat nicely.  Meat came out medium as ordered and their blend was tasty.  Bacon, cheese, pickles,  and the rest of toppings were perfect. The side Salad was also excellent!I took my time as I didn't want this meal to end.  Looking forward to returning and trying other items but it will be difficult to not order the Original.  My server was friendly and attentive.  Lives up to the ""Best Burger in NYC"" billing and hype!","Interesting menu and food. I would have never gone to this place but since it was suggested, I gave it a shot. I ordered the plate the Trout Quinoa Salad. It was interesting to say the least. It has mesclun greens with quinoa and a their restaurant vinaigrette and with half a trout perfectly pan fried. It was delicious but extra delicious maybe cos' I was starving. I also had a little bit of ale with it. Just a few sips.The reason for the three stars is because the service was really slow even on a non busy Friday night. There were three servers and the kitchen had 2-3 cooks but it took forever to get anything from getting seated to getting a drink. I'm not saying I would never come back here but I wouldn't choose to come here if I had to suggest a place.","Stopped here with a friend while in Brooklyn. It was the first time for both of us. It was pretty empty as it was a early Friday afternoon. Nice decor, cool bar set up, the bartender was really cool and offered us some really cool draft beers. I ordered the fried duck sandwich and my friend got the wrap. I loved the whole smashed potatoes with the skin on and the coleslaw was great! My sandwich was cooked perfectly and the jam that was on it was a perfect accent.",Korzo
667,"3.5 starsOther people seemed to like this place as it was pretty busy for a Tuesday at 8pm. But I thought it was just okay, not the best I've had. I got the minca sio ramen with thin noodles and my bf got the shoyu ramen with thick noodles. Both of us thought the broth was too salty and both of our noodles tasted a little chewier than we've had in the past as well. I think I prefer mine cooked a little longer. The egg, being that it was a salted egg, was cooked very done and was way too salty for me. I couldn't eat it. Overall kind of disappointed, since this place got so many good reviews.",Small cash-only ramen shop in Alphabet City. I would not recommend it. The broth is salty but also bland at the same time with very little umami. Their noodles also tasted reheated. There are tons of ramen places in the city; don't waste a meal on Minca.,"Minca is a small cash-only ramen shop located in Alphabet City. However, the menu is as large as the restaurant is small. With six different broths and five different noodles, there is a seemingly unlimited number of ways to customize your bowl.Curious about the namesake Minca broth and its half pork and half chicken broth composition, I had to order it. Thankfully the menu includes a suggested noodle for each broth, in this case a thin or wavy - I chose thin noodles. The noodles were very good, though in retrospect I think wavy noodles would have collected more broth per mouthful. The broth was solid, but not quite deep enough in umami. I am a pork broth purist in a sense, so the chicken broth probably lightened the taste as well. Lastly, the chashu pork was quite lean, which also posed a drawback to the bowl overall.While I was not completely satisfied with my Minca experience, I often find myself in the area looking to eat. So, there is a high likelihood I will be back to adjust my order and perhaps update my review in the near future.","Such flavor many noodzIn all seriousness, cute quaint spot in alphabet city. Cash only so had to walk around the block to an atm but worth it. 6 person bar seating and about 4 small tables on the side. Noodles were cooked perfectly! The chef times it to the second and his cooking his pretty memorizing","I want to like these guys more cuz I think there's a lot of things they're doing fantastic: deeply flavorful chasu, handmade soy sauce (!!), a variety of noodles that aren't just the same noodles everyone has. The eggs are always a bit green and overcooked, and the light broth seemed really soy-heavy in their Minca offering. I had some of the other broths and they were better though; mixing the spicy into mine helped with the flavor.Local friends seem to love it though, and I've been told that it takes a few trips to develop a deep craving for it.","Small ramen shop in Lower East Side with friendly server and chefs. They have a variety of ramen for a reasonable price. I ordered the Minca Shio for $13 and a side of gyoza (6) for $6.50. The ramen comes with a bunch of toppings including bamboo shoots, mushrooms, Cha Siew, half an egg and scallions. One order is enough to fill one person. The soup is very flavorful and the noodle texture was just right! The gyoza was crispy and tastes delicious dipped in the vinegar soy sauce. The restaurant is a bit small, but the wait is usually pretty quick for a single or party of 2.",Minca
668,"Wow, I have not been this disappointed in a meal in a long time. I've visited this staple in the past and it was consistently good. I cannot believe the major changes. I got the foie gras and it was tasteless with an overly salty cream on the side. I sent the appetizer back and got the yellowtail instead hoping it would be better but it was also tasteless with a lack of flavor. The flavor of the green cream was flat. I got the lamb and the flavor of that was also odd.... not sure why the vegetable and sauce is sour. The flavors did not mesh. This is the first I was unable to finish any of my dishes. Even the chocolate desert was disappointing with an odd mix of flavors. The chefs needs to work on seasoning. Everything looked nice but just not good. Would not recommend this place to anyone for near future.","Major disappointment. Have been coming here for 10 years, they changed chefs and the menu this summer. Not very many choices, very chichi food. My steak( which I ordered  only because there 5 choice 3 which were fish and one lamb collar) I had to send it back toughest piece of meat and sliced in chunks.  It had a stale taste . My appetizer was yellowtail with none of things it was supposed to have. Tasteless. All in all very disappointing, it was always our go to place .. will not return anytime soon.  if you love the Gotham Bar and grill from the past, this is not it trying to be something they are not.  I saw hamburgers being served at the bar, was told I could not have one... Really so disappointed !!",Came here for our ten year wedding anniversary seated in an awful table -worst in the restaurant- after indicating on the reservation that it was a special event Maybe because we were dressed smart casual but why advertise that dress code policy if you use it to discriminate. My view at Gotham,"Gotham Bar and Grill is quite the ""Uptown"" by appearance and ambiance but conveniently located more downtown and without the pretentiousness, just over on Union Square West.  Not too far from the hustle and bustle of Union Square.  Walking in - you take in all the vibes of what a classic American dining experience should be:  romantic / sophisticated / great for a business lunch / and a 'ladies who lunch' vibe.  This place satisfies all.  It is spacious and welcoming.  The tables are aptly spaced apart so there is a sense of cozy and private but without the partitions.  Very open and airy.  Great lighting and the volume is perfect - not too loud and not too quiet.Service is above par, on both visits - the Management and staff takes pride in their cleanliness score both in the dining rooms and facilities I must say.  They were all smiles and very knowledgeable of both  their wines and menu selections.  This was a total white glove service without the stuffiness. I was very glad to hear that our company holiday lunch was here again (Dec. 2018) -- I started this review in Dec. believe it or not!  LOL We came here for our holiday lunch as well back in Dec. 2017.  This time, I have pictures to prove it!  (We had a no cell phones policy at the table which prevented me from taking photos during our lunch).  However, now that my office knows what a serious Yelper I am, this year they graciously  allowed me to have my cell phone out to take photos.  The only rule was no reading emails/doing work on my phone.  I will not name every dish as it was plenty (see pics) - we had a group of 9!  And I can't tell you what wine / cocktails / and champagne I drank...it was plenty and it was all delicious.  All great selections the boss man made.  He who pays gets to choose.  ;-)  In general - must try dishes -- any seafood.  I was not disappointed in both visits.  And the appetizers are not to be skipped.  Their selection can be seasonal but in the off chance it's not, try the Miso Cod and the tuna tartare.  Also notable, the prix fixe menu is fantastic overall.  Great value and selection.  The food was fantastic and the desserts didn't disappoint either.  I'm not even a big fan of sweet desserts (I prefer salty/cheese) but their chocolate cake was incredible. This is the spot for a great leisurely lunch - you do not come here if you're in a rush.  This is also an excellent place for a business lunch or for groups.  The whole atmosphere is just pleasant.","4 stars for food and ambiance (very upscale looking and no pretentiousness).  However, the service was standard (hence I can't give them 5 stars), nothing memorable.  I do not recall them adding ""more"" to the whole dining experience.  My party size of 9 - as we were here for our Office Holiday Lunch, were serviced at the minimum.  I know we saw our server once when we sat down with our menu's, another time for our Champagne toast, and then to order.  We didn't see her again until it was time for dessert.  In between, we were assisted by other table staff (for clearing plates and water refills).  Any how, they do get the 4 stars as we all enjoyed our food from start to finish.  Sadly, I have no photos of the food (could not Yelp pics, no cell phone policy at the table because it was an office event).  Was so bummed because the presentation of a few dishes were drool-worthy.Skipping to the good stuff - why you should try this place - besides it being well priced for the quality, the variety makes it pleasing to all tastes.  Must try appetizers:  the Muscovy Duck and Foie Gras Terrine (which I had as my first plate), the Chicory Salad (think squash, apples, parmesan and candied walnuts), and the Yellowfin Tar Tar (presentation is quite different from others, you'll be pleasantly surprised).  I wish I could suggest more but it seems great minds think alike as half my crew ordered the same plates!Must try entrees:  I thoroughly enjoyed the Pan Roasted Branzino.  Reading my other reviews, I am a carnivore at heart but when I can, I try to order fish.  Many make it mediocre and a few earn ravs.  This is one of those that I liked - a lot!  The branzino was hearty and perfectly roasted.  The top was slightly crispy and the flesh was soft and flaky - just as Branzino should be.  Normally a summer favorite given it's light texture, but I personally just love this fish all year round.  The best part was the blood orange emulsion.  The other stand-out entrees from what I sampled, the Miso Marinated Black Cod (served with sticky rice and bok choy - perfectly balanced flavors), and the Braised Beef Short Ribs, the red wine reduction and potato puree made it all complete.  Note: they have a great ""prix fixe"" lunch - totally worth the price and a great way to give this place a try before committing to the full lunch or dinner menu.  Plus, it's like dining in a fancy place for like half the price.  I would totally come back here again - even if it's just to Yelp the food.  Gorgeous plating on some and very creative I might add.  They score high just for that.  The portions were good to generous too.  Another reason to eat here again.","I had a wonderful lunch at this restaurant.  For starters I had the yellowtail crudo which was flavored gently with the white soy, some peppers and pink rock salt.  A very nice and subtle flavor.  For my entree I had the spicy octopus ragu.  It came with a black pasta.  While it really was not that spicy and there were some longer tentacles, the dish tasted great as there was a variety of seafood mixed into it.  Really nice. For dessert, I had the Dulcey Caramel Mousse which was a great way to end the meal.The dining room is very nice and service was excellent.",Gotham Bar and Grill
669,"We didn't really know what we were getting into here. We were on our way elsewhere but with a sore foot I saw Ume so we went in. After sitting down they explained our only option was the $65 pp menu. We weren't allowed to just order from the ala cart menu. There were pieces we dont eat on the set menu so they made substitutions but one substitution was meat (we don't eat meat). My husband accidentally ate his and I spit mine out when I realized. Told them we don't eat squid, they substituted octopus (even worse). Ended up costing $200 and we went to get pizza after! We were not stoked to have spent $200 on a dinner neither of us liked very much and we were left hungry. (Wish we had gone to Salt and Charcoal and spent $200 there) I think if your goal is an Instagram dinner it's more worth it.We would have enjoyed it more if we could have just ordered what we wanted from the ala Carter menu options. Still cannot believe how much we spent at this place. I guess it's partly my fault because I kinda knew we should have left when they said we had to stick with the prix fixe menu but at that point we had already taken our shoes off, washed our hands in the little sinks, sat down been served water the whole bit so I felt like it would have been rude to leave. So spent $200 left unhappy and hungry and am leaving this review.",Very pretty display! It is overpriced though for what it is and I don't like the fact that we have to leave our shoes by the door where I cannot see them. I asked for a plastic bag so I can carry my shoes inside with me but they told me they had no plastic bags...They also make a big deal about cancellations but they themselves do not call or text the day before like they said they would.,"This was incredibly disappointing for me :( I was really looking forward to Ume, as I thought the experience of creating and mixing/matching your own sushi was super unique and worth it. We made a reservation at 8:30pm, arrived early, and then had to wait a further 15 minutes until we could be seated. Okay, this happens all the time - no problem. Once we seated however, and received our sushi ingredients, my boyfriend and I were both surprised at the small amounts of fish/nori/rice that we were given to create our sushi. At $55 per person, I expected to get a more substantial amount of ingredients, and the amount we received was unacceptable to me. Our total bill came up to $146 dollars for two sushi sets and two orders of nori. Bf still had to get a burger from the shake shack nearby since he was starving!In addition, when it was time to get the check, we waited for over 25 minutes before being able to catch someone's eye to receive the bill, even though we were clearly ready to leave.Overall, unique experience but poor execution - I don't think I'll be coming back until things (and portions) improve.",First time here and I really was blown away by the atmosphere and taste of this place. We ordered 2 of the Sushi platters given to us by the chef and we were in love. Came at 2pm and there was literally only 1 person there. Staff was very friendly and nice and gave us lots of guidence. Will definitely be back!P.S. I think we forgot to give tips since we used a card and thought tips were included already. Sorry!,"Very unique way to enjoy sushiAnd how they display the dish was amazing!All the flavor of each sushi is delicious and fresh. But the compare to the portion, it's bit over price.","I came here because I saw that the omakase was pretty, but I didn't look into the concept of the restaurant before going and was disappointed. Firstly, I want to say that the venue and decor are beautiful. I loved the floor to ceiling windows and the fact that we were sitting on the floor. The atmosphere was very calming.As for the food, I felt that the omakase was a bit confused/confusing. There was a guide on which pieces to dip in what sauces (which were given to us on another plate), but multiple pieces were paired with the same sauces and we were left with unused sauces. I thought that the sauces were a bit gimmicky as well as the whole DIY concept. We were to put the rice on the nori ourselves. I found this to be difficult and reductive of the idea of the traditional omakase. I would much rather be served each piece individually by a trained chef. The nori would get soggy as I tried to put the rice, fish and finally the neta. There also was not enough nori for the amount of fish given to us. When I got to the uni, which is my favorite piece usually, I saw that it was paired with snowcrab. I tried a bit of uni and snowcrab together but the textures and flavors just clashed too much because the snowcrab's fishiness overpowered the uni. I paid around $80 for the omakase (including tax) which is on the cheaper side so I can't complain, but I don't think I will be returning here again. I would recommend if you're looking for a DIY non-traditional experience, but if you're looking for an innovative twist on tradition, I wouldn't recommend, as Ume deviates far from tradition.",Ume Williamsburg

Who looked completely bewildered. He had forgotten our 7 year anniversary...But he never will forget it now. Miss Korea made it that special and so I had to tell the story and say thanks!","Have you ever watched a train wreck waiting to happen? This establishment gets worse with each visit:( Let me give you a chronology of what's happened this year alone:- 1st visit of the year... they tried to usher me to the 2nd floor, possibly thinking I was new there and wouldn't figure out what they were trying to do. Thanks to yelpers on this page I had a come back prepped. In addition to that, the meats were not fresh. There's nothing like seeing darkened meat on your bbq hot plate. Your brain begins to rack... like should you preorder your Uber... should you take a quick break to buy tum tums... should you excuse yourself and never come back... should you say something and risk the server avoiding your table the whole night?? I mean what to do!- 2nd visit... the server was barely there. I think they were working half the tables. Poor girl I felt so bad for her but the experience was so poor! Meanwhile there were some guys just making their rounds... you know... busy bodies. They reminded me of BoA where the managers ask if they can help only to tell you that you have to wait for a cashier. Like why are you on the floor, manager? To act busy? (Don't worry... review of my local Bank of America coming soon).- 3rd visit... Main theme ""the food on the menu isn't the food you get. Forget the cute picture you see. In place of corn or vegetables we'll give you some egg -something, custard?"" Oh and the best part, they don't even tell you in advance. It's a surprise! Whoa!","In the heart of KTown, Miss Korea BBQ is a not a bad place to get your Korean BBQ craving satisfied, but in my opinion there are definitely better spots along the block.I will say the food to get here is the actual Korean BBQ, as it is good quality here.  However, I feel when comparing their prices and quality with others in the immediate area, they are more expensive and cater to that ""touristy"" price.  The interior here is nice.  I have had my share of good and bad service here, so it is really a mixed bag based on who is working and serving you.  Sometimes this is the best option available in terms of wait at peak dining times, so if you are just that hungry, then yes I would say as long as you are okay with the higher prices here, give it a try and see for yourself!",Miss KOREA BBQ
671,"My experience with Old Xi'an is very disappointing. The poor packaging damaged one block away after I left the store. The food and juice are all over my shoes, pants and jacket. I have to clean the food on the street.","Greasy, flavorless and over-rated are the few words that come to mind when describing the experience at Old Xi'an. Ordered the beef noodle soup. The noodles seemed over cooked and lacked a bite. Soup was bland, only flavor was the excessive oil from the hot oil container. The menu seems like it's been ripped off from Xi'an Famous Foods. Unfortunately, that's where the comparison stops. Very disappointed.","Really bad experience here! The staff wasn't familiar with the menu. The food was missing flavors, far worse than XiAn Famous Foods!","Came here about a week ago for the first time. I never had hand ripped noodles before and now I am obsessed! I ordered the spicy beef hand ripped noodles (no soup). The noodles were thick and chewy, like how a fresh noodle should be. The beef honestly did not look that appetizing in their cube form, but it was sooo tender.. I also asked for the mild level, but it was still had a little spice to it. I also ordered the mini cucumber salad, in my opinion, it needed more vinegar or some type of acidity to cut through the fattiness of the noodles. But still refreshing. The wait was really short, I waited less than 10 minutes after I ordered. My total was $16.22, which is a little steep for lunch, but it is worth a try. Highly recommend on pay days!","Pretty on par with the fast food hand-pulled/hand-ripped noodle restaurants in NYC.The small restaurant is sort of hidden on a quiet street in the FiDi. I think most people probably come upon it when walking to another destination, but don't underestimate this little noodle shop. Like many hand-pulled noodle shops, the menu will look familiar to those who have frequented similar restaurants - noodle soups, hand-ripped noodles, cold noodles, a few rice dishes and small ""burgers"" or Chinese meat sandwiches, which look like pitas.I ordered the Spicy Beef Hand-Ripped Noodle, medium spice. The great thing about the restaurant was that they offered different spice levels for the dishes. The order was a reasonable size and what really surprised me was the amount of beef cubes in the dish. I loved that with every bite of noodle, I had a fair amount of beef with it. The beef was very tender, well-seasoned and flavorful. Since it was medium spice, the order had a good kick to it, but it was easily bearable for someone like me who loves medium spicy food. My philosophy has always been that too spicy and it'll take away from the dish, but not enough spice will result in lack of flavor. Like the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, the medium spice was jussssst right. The noodle was also very good too and when drowned in the spicy oils with cilantro mixed in it was noodle bliss.I have yet to try anything else from Old Xi'an, but it wouldn't surprise me if everything else was just as tasty.","We were craving for Chinese food. This happened to be the first one on the list. The place here was so clean and spacious. The wait for the food wasn't long.The down side of this place was that there was no baby changing table nor barely a space to accommodate for baby changing.The food was spicy even when it's mild. Regardless, it was still good. The soup was also perfect, not too strong nor salty. We will definitely come back to try other noodle.",Old Xi'an
672,"How would you even dare to put your restaurant under southern restaurant category if you can't even make decent bbq? And when I order 'Rhapsody in cue', I don't think I sign up for COLD meat. At least microwave that shit. The owner, or the cook, has no respect for the food and the customer.","This restaurant was extremely RACIST! I was there for a birthday dinner last night and the service I received was extremely unacceptable. The waitress was rude, and inattentive. She barely spoke to us, never asked if our food was ok, late on drinks, and when I mentioned it was my birthday and I was here for dinner she never even acknowledged it. The other waitress walking by had to ask us if we wanted straws for our drinks and napkins. For such great food, the service is extremely poor. I am more than disappointed by this. It was clear as the only brown couple in the restaurant the type of service we received. The waitress was ""McKenna D"". The only reason why I am giving 1 star is due to the food, that was actually good. Otherwise I will never return. What a terrible experience.","This place sucks. We had to wait for 30 mins just for a indoor table. I can't believe it has changed so much over the years.  the lady we knew is not there anymore after so long. The person who we talked to was extremely rude about the fact we knew someone there. Blue smoke more like blue NOPE.Do not go here long wait even if weekdays. I wish I could only give half a star if I could that is what I would rate this place.Also if you are wondering they have PLASTIC straws. I mean it's 2019 people, shouldn't we know by now that plastic straws kill turtles worldwide!   Anyway even shake shack has compostable straws. I mean please PLEASE get paper,compostable,metal,stainless steal.ANYTHING other than plastic.Ok so the bottom line is DON'T eat here unless you want to wait for half an hour and also kill turtles while you're at it.","Stopped by Blue Smoke battery park on a random rainy night as we were looking for a quick bite before a movie. Place was very packed (it was around HH) but luckily we scored bar seats. Service was pretty good...not very friendly but efficient.We got a few drinks and burgers for dinner. I asked for medium rare and was told isn't possible since their patty is very thin, ok at least I got a heads up. Food was good enough for the occasion nothing extraordinary just good.","Been here so many time both midtown and fidi locations. Best BBQ I've ever had, best part is their HH hours menu.Awesome food, service, and atmosphere.Will stop by when I'm in the area.","Always passed this place going to the movie theatre around the corner, so decided to go in. I wanted lunch but it was a few minutes left on brunch and I didn't want to wait for the menu to turnover. I ordered the ""breakfast"" on the brunch menu. I'm a bit of picky eater so that sounded more appetizing than pork, brisket or ribs. My plate was simple; scrambled eggs, bacon, grits and a biscuit. It came relatively quickly. The bacon was perfect. Your probably wondering why I have to comment on bacon, but I have a certain relationship with bacon, ok?  Lol I've had burnt bacon and I've had the pink ""pig is still moving"" bacon. The eggs were tasty, but the grits were way too milky. It wasn't bad; its more of a preference for me because I don't like milk. The biscuit was maple syrup heaven. I wish I had two of them. I also had a strawberry margarita which was $14. A bit on the pricy side, but on a hot summer day; very refreshing! I will be back soon for lunch/dinner.",Blue Smoke
673,"We are a party of 5, first time here.1. Food took really long to come2. Requested for medium steak and eggs, came in well done and very dry. Even the sunny side up is well done. No apology!3. My leftover bolognese was packed upside down and the lid was not closely properly, which made a huge mess. Again, no apology!4. The whole time there, we couldn't find our waiter and always hard to get attention to order food or asked for check.Overall experience was horrible, Service was awful! Will never go back again!","Went here for drinks with a friend on a Thursday night. We had the whipped feta and a few dirty martinis. The martinis were meh, the olives were old, and the whipped feta was definitely not the best I've had recently. Overall not bad but not somewhere I'm stoked to go back to on my next trip to NYC","The garmigna is good and on its own would be a 4 star meal. The issue is that they're not capable of managing their order flow. In restaurant the service is friendly, if overwhelmed. For delivery... well I just waited 2 hours to find out they delivered it to the wrong place. Very disappointing for a place that otherwise would have promise","When in flatiron, I was looking for a last minute restaurant for dinner. There weren't any open table reservations available, which can be a sign of a great place! It was only about 6:15 so I thought I might be able to walk in. The hostess told us we could sit at the chef's bar which was fine with us.We started with the whipped ricotta and the heirloom tomatoes. BOTH were incredible! The ricotta was so creamy and I loved the addition of the honey. The tomatoes were also super yummy - loved all the flavors here! Only problem was I wish there was more bread to scoop up all this deliciousness. For the main, we ordered the roasted sasso chicken. The farro risotto was awesome! The chicken was flavorful and I also enjoyed this, although it was pretty standard. We also ordered a pasta. We were torn about which one to order so we took the waiter's suggestion of the mushroom Campanella. He told us it was his favorite and I'm glad we listened because it was SO good! Seriously all of the food was excellent, I would recommend this restaurant wholeheartedly! The service was also quick and attentive. We would absolutely return.","I'm an avid endurance athlete, so I consume carbs by the truck load :)Delicious and fresh pastas - great wine for those who imbibe. Big bar seating too if you can't get an online booking. Has some cute outdoor space too.",Great Italian spot in Chelsea ! Went during lunch and the place was slammed. Enjoyed the burrata appetizer which was creamy and smooth. It went great on the toasted bread served with it. It had a pesto drizzle which really brought it all together . I enjoyed the rigatoni pasta which had a ball of ricotta on top with sopresseta and onions cooked in. It was amazing! The handmade pasta really makes the difference . Can't wait to come back!,La Pecora Bianca
674,"The food is of the highest quality. Flavors are extraordinary. Is it worth ~$300 pp? I guess that depends on your own judgment. Watch out though - service says included on the website, but theres still a place to tip and it's not clear that tip is included from the bill.","I've eaten more than once at Eleven Madison Park, Per Se, Le Bernadin, Daniel, Masa and every other 2 and 3 Michelene Star restaurant in NYC...this is easily my favorite.The burrito dessert is out of this world!","I have been at Atera twice and the two expericences were at odds.First time visit a couple of years ago. Food and wine pairing blew my mind off. On par with Alinea and Chef's table. Had become my favorite place in Manhattan. My second visit in 2018 was less impressive. Less food to eat across the meal, rythm not as perfect. Still excellent cooking but not sure about the price point. Most disappointing was the interaction with the somelier: presentation of wine pairing was underwhelming so we skipped, sub-par advice on bottle, first bottle ordered not available, second bottle corked, meaning no drinks for the first few dishes. Bad luck I am sure, but bad impression on guests as well.Might come back for a final review. Still unsure !",A popular molecular gastronomy spot in NYC! Worth checking out.The place is small - with a few counter seats and a separate table for four. That's why so difficult to make a reservation :P Creative cuisine with michelin star level service. Modern decoration. Open kitchen. Good for couples. Worth the price ($600+ for two w/o drink).,"Super tiny spot that whips up a fantastic tasting menu. It may not be the best meal you'll ever have, but it's a great balance between traditional dishes and foods with a modern standpoint.The toasted rye, king crab, and crispy skin wafer was divine. What I love about it was the chicken skin comes in first, and then melts downward to coalesce with the king crab. The rye played a supportive role in structure as well as taste to uphold the meats. I wish I could have ate a barrel of these things!The egg custard uni truffle mushroom soup was rich comfort food that packed a mighty umami punch. Creamy uni, creamy eggs, and creamy soup provide a velvety mouthfeel, but the truffles and mushrooms add that dimension of texture that was much needed. Possibly my only complaint is that it's a heavy-handed on the truffles, but not to the point that it washes over the rest of the ingredients. The waffle with foil grass, raspberries, and balsamic glaze is a prime example of the chef's layering skills. Starts off with the high tone sweetness of the raspberries and tang of the balsamic, but then the foil gras roars like a winter fire, all collapsing upon a toasted bread taste form the waffle. Simple in its approach,  but well thought out in its layout. A people pleaser of a dish for sure. The kaluga caviar, Sicilian pistachios, and IPA foam may have been my favorite dish, due to the extremely simple yet eclectic combo of these ingredients. The plating made me feel like some Daoist who has found balance and harmony along the creekside. This dish couldn't have been plated any other way. Why didn't I think of the hoppiness of the IPA and that distinct pistachio taste pairing together! So fun eating this, especially with the completely different textures of all three. As if a banjo player, a Theremin player , and didgeridoo player all came together to create a beautiful song. The rest of the entrees now bridge into what I consider home-cooked meals. Up until the duck, we will see fairly conservative dishes in their approach, but quite tasty none the less. The halibut has quite the Asian influence, but comes off as a European tasting dish! The tapioca pearls and dashi clearly come from the east but get snuck through European customs by the parsley purée. The halibut was so tender, I pressed my fork on top, and the filet fanned out like a deck of cards. It's amazing parsley can tie such global elements together. The potato purée felt especially like a home cooked meal, with its generous serving of ""mashed  potatoes."" The alpine cheese is the only thing offsets a fairly British tasting meal. I personally didn't feel the hydroponic garden flowers were that beneficial to the overall taste, but I think I get the idea that the chef wanted us to feel like I was outside.The veal tenderloin was another dish where the parts are only as good as the whole. I was surprised by the more toned down taste of the veal, but it interlocked with the pesto like a key in the keyhole. The radish shaving folded into a triangle was quite interesting although I felt it was kinda pointless. The duck felt like a self service assembly line for a fine dining meal. There were at least four separate aspects that you followed in order to actually taste everything. The duck was also not mind blowing by itself,  but this was on purpose with everything else that was going on in the three ring circus of a plating. I ate the duck, then the poached pear, then the black garlic, and then the mushroom. Perhaps this was a micro four course meal, like courses within the course (similar to a nested polyrhythm). The pine and pear were a pretty good combo. The mushrooms in brown butter of course were pure pleasure. The black garlic was the only item I figured could have been dialed in more with the rest,  but sometimes it hard keeping a wild dog on a leash.The lemon sherbet sphere was quite fun, especially once you discovered there was a filled center. The lemon sorrel dulce de leche trio were quite unexpected but played nice together. The different textures were layered vertically in a beautiful geometric fashion. I felt like taking it home and resting it upon my fireplace mantle.I think the chef's philosophical approach is ""The whole is greater than the individual parts."" The majority of the dishes served here, would have been underwhelming if I ate each item individually. There were even dishes like the kaluga caviar, veal, and duck that I feel were purposely constructed to fit into a larger picture. Its quite amazing on reflection how a few simple ingredients can ultimately create skyscrapers of flavor. If you've never been to a Michelin, then this is a beautiful introduction that wont challenge your comfort zone or analytical skills. They do thinks just slightly different enough to have flair but more as a suit handkerchief rather than a Dr. Seuss hat.","Atera's setting, a chef's counter tucked into a classic TriBeCA building, sets the tone for the entire experience. It's innately warm and personal, with seemingly as many staff as diners. There were no more than say a two dozen patrons. While the prices may not lead to such a conclusion ($285 per person), the experience takes a more welcoming, modern and relaxed approach to the tasting menu concept. It's luxe, but there are no white tablecloths, nor any grim formality. From start to finish, you are made to feel right at home.FoodThe food at atera takes a similar tact - it's innovative, but thankfully is based on a solid foundation of flavors and execution over molecular gimmickry. The attention to detail is unreal, even a simple, classic dish such as pommes puree becomes a dreamy highlight. You are treated to 14 courses, all of which are pure magic. The quality of ingredients is apparent, and I certainly felt as though experience delivered an appropriate value for the prices paid. Presentation was also excellent throughout. Really appreciate their willingness to accommodate dietary restrictions and preferences, something they seem to embrace as a challenge rather than inconvenience. In my case, the request to avoid shellfish was handled adroitly. BeverageWe opted for one each of the 'reserve' wine pairing ($365) and regular wine pairing ($175). Both are very solid choices. Though the wines are more expensive and generally more aged in the premium pairing, the standard pairing was very well-selected, good choices that paired very nicely. As a party of two, it was a lot of fun to try two different wines with each course, having a mini wine tasting along the way. However even as a wine week, returning, I wouldn't hesitate to just go with the standard pairing. Also nice to note, they offer a 'temperance' (i.e. non-alcoholic) pairing for $105.One nit that irked me: service is included, and is denoted in small print at the bottom of the receipt, but they still provide the standard tipping area on the bill. This seems disingenuous. Be careful when it comes time to pull out your wallet.All in all, in my book atera is one of the quintessential New York fine dining experiences. Highly recommend and look forward to returning!",Atera
675,The oranges are molto freschi.Best and freshest Oranges in town. They are also decent soccer players,"The food was above par but overpriced and the portions are very small. The music is exceptionally loud and heavy metal so I would not go here for the ambience. Trendy, overpriced, and full of hipsters.",Square plates. Effing square plates. Overpriced nonsense. Crap service. Full of nerds. I hate this place.,"Absolute favorite place in the neighborhood and I've lived here for 3 years and have tried them all. Calaca's elote might just be the best I've ever had in my life; their tostadas are the perfect balance of spice, vinegar and flavor. My favorites are the tuna and shrimp tostadas. Even better this week than when I first came by in February 2016. Get yourself a mezcalrita, and if you know what's good for you, move to the neighborhood and become a regular.We miss Calaca each winter when they go south for the warm weather. Do not miss out!","First off. CASH ONLY.secondly: tiny spot, but hella cute.Now let's get into the menu. It's simple. Tacos, tostadas, quesadillas, and some tapas (chips and guac, corn, the staples ya know?). I was a little sad to see how small the menus was, but damn was it banging. We ordered the sampler ($20), three tostadas. And it's worth it. Decent serving size. A quesadilla (Goner-something on the menu) and chips and guac, which is chunky and just the right amount of salt and lime y'all. It's SO rare to find in New York City. And I am a snob when it comes to Mexican food. Especially chips and guac (I do not play with my Mexican and Vietnamese food). I love they had a tasteful presentation approach, but also so much flavor in their food. The fish and shrimp in the dishes were fresh AF.The gentleman who assisted us, assuming the owner, was so kind and making recommendations. Not to mention friendly and interactive with us! We also sat at the bar so saw the kitchen and bartender hustle. I will be coming back. Glad I was able to dine here on a casual Thursday night. Oh, because it is small, there may be a wait. We sat outside for a bit for 5-10 minutes before our bar seating.","So dang good. I love everything about this place from the divey inside bar to the tasty taco truck out back. We grabbed an assortment of tacos (all delicious) as well as some tortas and tostadas. The tostada was good once you removed the mile-high pile of shredded lettuce, but the torts was SO wonderful. The bar also has tons of options and pitchers to choose from. The margs are a little out there and sweet, but overall good and cheap.",Calaca
676,"They have a lot of tasty things on menu.  I like the shumai, the kale salad (best I've had), and their ramen.",Came here with a group of 5 on Sunday night around 9pm and ordered Tonkotsu Ramen and Spicy Pork Belly Ramen. Their broths were very tasty and the pork was fat and juicy!!!! Will def come back for a quick ramen fix!,"Both good, but nothing amazing: Kale salad,Thong-lor Ramen: was so thirsty afterward, might've been too salty.","Proong Noodle bar is my favorite Thai shop to grab a nourishing meal when I am not in the mood to cook and looking for good taste with multiple options.We have tried and enjoyed:- Proong Shu Mai, Gyoza, Pork Buns, Extra Crispy Fried Chicken w Sriracha mayo (all yummy and good!)- Kale Salad (I don't usually order salad, but this came highly recommended, and I am very satisfied!) the dressing is lovely. -  Sa-Thorn Spicy Seafood noodles w egg noodles, mussel, shrimp, crispy wonton, bean sprout, scallion in creamy spicy broth. (excellent!) - New Grilled Chicken Ramen w egg bamboo mushrooms, scallion, sesame shoyu broth. (very good!) - Crispy Chicken Rice Bowl (yummy!) The noodles are prepared just right, with a chewy texture. The flavors are all delicious. Delivery service is quite fast at 15 - 20 minutes.  Everyone who works there is delightful, friendly and efficient. :) Proong Noodle Bar is consistently reliable for a fresh delicious comfort food fix!************************************",Walked right in for lunch and we were seated immediately. It is very small in the front. I believe there is a back areas but it was right before they closed for their dinner rush preparations and it was closed off.The Thai Iced tea with milk was awesome. The house sale had a light lemony gingery dressing and Bang Rak Ba Mee was great!!!!,"I am a noodle fanatic, and I'd say this place has some of the best Thai noodles in Manhattan! We came here on a Saturday night, and it was pretty empty. We were seated promptly and ordered the tomyum pork noodles and the si lom chicken noodles.Positives: The noodles were very chewy; not overdone at all. Texture was just fantastic. The si lom chicken had a clean, refreshing broth full of that umami flavor. I definitely preferred the broth of the si lom. Service was also impeccable. They gave us a discount because we were students. Ambience was great as well.Negatives: The tom yum was a bit too sweet for my tastes, but that's just my personal preference. The noodles were spot on tho in terms of texture and bounciness.Conclusion: Definitely check out this place for chewy noodles done right!",Proong Noodle Bar
677,"Bottom line: nice small cafe, good food but uncoordinated service really draws from the experience. Bit pricey to not have good service. Gluten line: nice clearly labeled menu with lots of options. Halloumi fries were delicious!Long line: we'd been wanting to come here for a while but the experience fell short of our expectations. We missed the brunch, but still wanted to enjoy a drink and some appetizers. Service was terrible uncoordinated, with 3 people randomly coming at odd, spaced out intervals and at times seeming like they were all hiding in the back. A bit disappointing to be sitting for so long with empty drinks and plates.","This is my go to spot, I am a frequent patron of the Thirsty Koala... What went wrong today lets start shall we;Our waitress ISA really didn't want to be there today! Never once checked on our table to even take away dirty plates, till I had to physically call her over to hand her the finished plates to take away. This girl had that I hate my job face & work ethic to match, she prefers to just hang out in the back and do whatever else. Appetizers:The Calamari has always been one of my favs here & today it was good as usual. The Grilled Octopus was banging also! Entrees:The Arugula Salad w/ Salmon was served with avocados that had patches of BLACK & that is a no no to serve! The salmon was dry & nothing to brag about. The same goes for the Beef Burger, the beef was bland & even more BLAND. I use to swear by there Burger *NOT NO MORE*! The Lamb Lollies were off the hook Fatty & Cooked perfectly! It was heaven in every fatty bite. Just like how I remembered them.Thirsty Koala was my no question go to spot. In my book FOOD & SERVICE goes hand in hand, in a establishment such as the Thirsty Koala & today was just a disappointment.",Please add the koala chocolate truffles back to the menu so that I can eat here again,The Koala gets a solid 5 stars. We just moved to the neighborhood and decided to walk down Ditmars to find somewhere to eat. We were immediately drawn to this place when we walked by. We sat outside around 8 o'clock and were seated immediately. They were even pup friendly outdoors which is huge for us as we often don't go out without our fur baby!!!! We got the quinoa burger and the Ned Kelly (cooked medium) - both were fantastic!!! Quinoa burger side was the garlic mashed potatoes and they perfect. Got the shoestring fries with the Ned Kelly. Shoestring fries were cooked to perfection. So delicious. The inside was packed and it wasn't loud at all. Everyone was having a great time. The music selection atthis place is on point as well. Such a great vibe. We will be regulars at this place for sure.,"This was listed on a website for gluten free restaurants and is nearby my apartment which was the main reason we chose this for a quick and casual dinner. I was completely amazed by the entire experience and will definitely be making this a regular date night spot! The entree list is entirely gluten free and the waiter shared with us that all of the fryer baskets are dedicated gluten free as well. Between the peace of mind knowing my celiac date wouldn't have to worry about getting ill from his meal and the wide variety of vegetarian options for me that weren't just pasta and salad, I could not believe how perfect this place was. I had the roasted acorn squash which was outstanding and came in such a large portion I was able to make three meals out of it. My date was so excited about the GF beer battered fried cod that he asked the waiter a few times just to be sure it really was celiac friendly! It meant a lot to be able to see him thoroughly enjoy his dinner without concern. The wait staff were very busy but friendly and personable so we truly didn't mind waiting for the check or for a drink refill. I really loved that our waiter made recommendations about his personal favorites from the menu, it means a lot more to hear that from someone who works there and encouraged me to try something different. The music was extremely loud when we first arrived, almost like they were trying to drown out the sound of people trying to talk to each other but it was lowered to a reasonable volume after the rush started to slow down a bit. The overall ambiance was cute and modern, I liked the decor and the multiple seating options (high tops, bench seats, backed chairs, bar stools)Overall, a really great find in a really accessible location. I will definitely be returning again soon and plan on introducing many friends and family members who come to visit as well!","Highly accommodating establishment. Our server, Caleb was amazing! We got there 45 min after our reservation time (totally underestimated the commute to Astoria) and they still seated us right away. Their brunch special is probably one of the better ones - $25 for unlimited drinks with a purchase of one entreè. The drink list is extensive. They offered really good cocktails on top of your usual mimosas and bellinis. The food was also good, huge portions, we felt like our omelette were made with ten eggs. The halloumi fries here were out of this world! Would come back to try their lamb chops, I've heard great things!",The Thirsty Koala
678,The perfect looking egg but maybe reduce 10 second of cooking time it would taste softer as it looks like!Few mushroom costs $4 .. #nyscene,"Dishes are overpriced and the food is mediocre. But what really bothered me was when I ordered, the server sat down in an empty chair next to me to take down the order. He did that to every table and it was very unprofessional.",Stopped here in NY for a quick bite to eat. It was okay. Nothing super special but it's a very cute spot.,"You might have to wait a bit, but there's a waitlist system that texts you so you can shop/go elsewhere and return when you're close to the top of the waitlist.the restaurant is excellent. Service is friendly and vibe is cozy on a rainy day. Coffee is really good, and the portions aren't huge but reasonable for the prices which are below 15. Would highly recommend the banana bread with honey butter and the açaí bowl doesn't have yogurt which is different than most places (only small critique is that the açaí seems like it was frozen and then blended so it's a bit icy but still good). Avocado toast serving is large compared to the usual brunch Probably around $22-25 with tip and tax if you get a coffee and entree.","So I think this is a testament to hit-or-miss locations. I originally had a 5-star review drafted and was going to post it after a second try as I do like to give most places more than one chance before writing the review to avoid one-off experiences. Here's my take: The food is phenomenal. I've had the blue bowl, the green bowl, and their eggs over toast. First, the bowls are amazing. I'm a big meat eater, and I'm a savory breakfast lover. I eat eggs very often and prefer a meaty breakfast to go with it. However, their bowls are fresh, flavorful, and the most delicious and healthy breakfast I've eaten in a while. It's a great pick me up after a night of drinking or when you've had too much take out. Their eggs are also super delicious. How they make them is a mystery to me. Honestly, I've tried to recreate them at home but it's very hard to do. They're light, fluffy, designed well, and not burned in the slightest.Their coffee is also fairly good. $3 for a drip coffee is a great deal, just keep in mind that they go against the grain here and charge you $1 per refill which isn't typically the case in NYC. Again, though, this doesn't warrant any star decreases.What does warrant the decrease is the service. There's a big dude in there who just seems like he hates being there. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. We arrived an hour after they first opened on this most recent visit after walking summer streets. One girl was in there, half done with her meal, and it seemed like he just wanted her out. Food was still on her plate, the place was empty, and he was trying to take it. Okay, I thought - maybe it's just early or maybe something happened. She looked upset. He came to our table, slammed the water bottle down. Again, maybe it was an accident. He barely says anything to my girlfriend or me, takes our orders and walks away. The entire time we're there he says nothing to us. We finished that water bottle and he slams another down. We're being extra polite, saying our thank you's and smiling and he doesn't respond at all. Again, I thought maybe it was me looking too into it. Maybe he's just not a friendly dude. I can get that. Then a family walked in, which, coincidentally was here last time we came as well. This guy is talking and laughing with them. On our previous experience, he was not our waiter, and I remembered him interacting the same way with them but ignoring others (we were sat closer to the kitchen).I ask him for a refill, please, and thank you. Slams it down. By this point, my girlfriend is noticing how aggressive he is. We finish our meal and ask him for the check. She insists on paying since I bought dinner last night, and tries to get the check as he's coming over but he slams it down in front of me while her hand was out for it. Even while handing us the check, not a word was being spoken to us. What gives?Look, being a good server is tough. I've done it, my friends have done it. Some still do it. We make excuses for people having bad days and often overlook it. However, when it's clear my dude just didn't like us (or that girl who was there in the beginning, or a smaller group who came in) it becomes something we can't overlook. Good thanks: Your food is good, but the service we received left such a bad taste in our mouth we doubt we'll return. There are many other cafes with similar eggs and menus and styles. It is because of this service that if I'm asked if I'll return, I'll probably say ""Nah, I'm good... thanks"". Let us know if you make any changes to the service because we really did like your food.","3pm boozie brunches are hard. I usually eat pretty early so I wanted a pre-brunch snack. My friend hit me up and we decided to come to Good Thanks for a light meal. This review is solely based on the one thing I ordered, which is their banana bread. It's gluten free and comes with their burnt honey buttercream. The buttercream was amazing. The banana bread was extremely moist too.The space is really cute inside but it get's loud. The tables are closely positioned next to each other so don't expect much privacy here. The dishes were are moderately priced but I thought my bread was pricey at $8 for 2 slices.Overall, I really enjoyed my banana bread. I'll be back to try their scrambled eggs which look so freaking fluffy and cooked perfectly.",Good Thanks NYC
679,"Visited this restaurant on a road trip and me and my bestie were going crazy looking for a open puerto rican place to eat at on Christmas Day. Luckily, this place was open and OMG I would go back to this place any day! Service was amazing and the food was delicious! The cost of food is very affordable for the huge plate you get. The place is small but it honestly makes you feel like your at home!! Finding parking is a pain but that's NY for you! This place does not accept credit cards but who cares, food was BOMB!","I will no longer be coming here, unfortunately, because the customer service is really bad.  I feel like if you do not speak Spanish they are through with you.  Even worse if you are Latin and do not speak Spanish-not my fault my parents never taught me, lol.  Anyways, their sanitation grade went from an A to a B (last time I saw), something that I judge before even eating at a restaurant.  I'll be finding a new authentic Puerto Rican restaurant.  If you know of one, please let me know!  Thanks!",I have never giving a bad review before but this no way! The food is garbage. Overly pricey. Unsanitary. The place is disgusting. I left there wanted to barf! I want my money back!,"Casa Adela, a mainstay of East village and Nuyorican culture, is a non-assuming but a delicious place to eat. Dating a Puerto Rican, I hear my boyfriend waxing poetic about the crispy skin of pernil and how delicious mofongo is, and after doing some research I was convinced I needed to eat what the food of this small but great island could offer. After doing extensive research into where in the big city I could find authentic Puerto Rican food, I came across Casa adela and we watched the culture fade from Chinatown over to the Hispanic part of East Village with a hungry stomach and a yearning cultural immersion. I wasn't disappointed. Make no mistake, this is not a dressed-up place, but it's more approachable this way. Walk in, you'll find a restaurant with maybe 5 or 6 tables, pictures of big families, a cuatro hung up on the wall, Raggaeton music playing from the TV, and little reminders of the Puerto Rican flag everywhere. The menus cover the staples: sancocho, pernil, mofongo, tostones, bacalao - I also believe that they sell pasteles by the half dozen or dozen if you order. We ordered the escebeche to split, my boyfriend ordered the bacalao, and I had the pernil. Each main dish comes with rice (yellow or white) and can come with beans (black, pink, etc). The food was amazing - the pork was so tender and had really crispy skin - everyone was so well seasoned, from the beans to the rice. My boyfriend's bacalao was also delicious - the fish was incredibly soft and had a really great taste. The esebeche was interesting and kind of tastes like a potato salad but with a more acidic dressing and no mayo - it was pretty good though and we finished it in no time. My friends were really happy with the cafe con leche that they got. There is one small drawback that I've been conflicted about writing, and that is service. Don't get me wrong - for the food and cultural value alone, Casa Adela is amazing. As a minority myself, I've seen Chinese restaurants with great food get dinged because their decor was ""too flashy"" or service was rude - and it's not fair because the cultural environment is just different and doesn't conform to western manners. I admit as well that we didn't have our full party and our friends arrived 30 minutes late. But, the entire time we did not really feel welcome, and it was very difficult to get service - even after our friends arrived, it took about 20 minutes to flag down someone to take orders even though other tables also had friends who arrived later and still got their check/food earlier than ours. I think my expectations may have been badly aligned to the service we received. However, don't let this deter you - I've also received bad service at other places but the food was so worth it that I would still come back. This is one of those places, and the food is really a slice of Puerto Rican culture that's treasured in New York.","Came across this no-frills, cash-only BYOB Puerto Rican restaurant in an online list of cheap eats in the city. This part of alphabet city is clearly predominantly Hispanic, with Latin music blasting from a boombox and neighborhood conversations conducted in Spanish only.Of course, the deep fried carbs were great. I've never had alcapurias before, and I am now a convert... and they are only $2.50 for the plate! The oxtail stew was probably my favorite of the entrees, with a hearty flavor profile, but lighter than the beef stew which I would have appreciated better in winter. Overall, a very satisfying meal; I might have eaten too much.",Loved this place. Great service and prices. The steak and onions were amazing. I definitely recommend this spot to anyone.,Casa Adela
680,"Ruby's has decent food overall but definitely not worth the price tag. I recommend you go for brunch given the dinner isn't that great; for example, I ordered the crispy rice bowl for dinner which ended up cracking one of my fillings due to the rice being undercooked/so hard. They noticed that I didn't eat my meal but didn't ask if I wanted to try something else or if anything was wrong. Another thing folks must be aware of is the poor ventilation: if it's a hot day, prepare to sweat because the restaurant only has a few fans but no central AC.Long story short, go for brunch on a cool day but avoid for dinners or whenever there is hot weather.",You are an idiot if you come to New York City and don't eat here.  The Bronte Burger is so good it makes you want to slap the last person that served you a hamburger.  Don't waste time brunching or eating breakfast/ lunch anywhere else.  The ricotta pancakes are ridiculously good.  Also the Bloody Mary is a must.,"I'm in a sticky situation here. My partner really likes Ruby's and I don't. It's not because their food isn't good - because it's good (again, not great, just good). To me, Ruby's is just - okay - because of the service, the crowding, and the sometimes rubbery feeling food that pumps out. Now, I do have to say that the number one reason Ruby's gets a 3 star rating from me is because of one experience in particular. I visited Ruby's one fine day when it wasn't too crowded. I ordered a burger, which didn't have mushrooms on it, but asked the waiter to just please make sure there aren't mushrooms anywhere near it. You see, I asked this because I have a strange food allergy - I'm allergic to mushrooms. If I eat a mushroom, or parts of a mushroom, or sometimes food was cooked with (but not including) mushrooms, I get violently ill. This is uncommon, and when I see mushrooms are on the menu, I make it clear to the wait staff that this is an allergy. My waiter, as nice as he was, said this would not be a problem and he'd make sure of it. I had done this my first time as well. A long wait passes and our food comes out. Here comes this burger with the biggest freaking mushroom of all time sitting in there. Folks, it looked like another burger patty. Maybe my mind is dramatizing events here, but this thing was thick, but not in the good way with two c's. I of course had to send it back, and got the burger back suspiciously quickly and with an egg that looked over done and not runny. Also, why was my burger bouncy? So now I remember Ruby's, whose food was iffy in my book to begin with, as the place where I told the waiter of a food allergy and he came back with the very thing I was allergic to. Like, ""hey, I heard you were allergic to mushrooms so here's a freaking mushroom!"" I know this was a mistake, and probably not one that they do often, but I really wish restaurants took food allergies seriously. Since this event my partner has gone back but I flat out refuse. We don't eat separately often, but this is the exception. Go and decide for yourself if you like it, though. My experiences seem to be the exception, not the rule.","You want comfort food that is interesting and high-quality? Look no further. Ruby's got it. Go to this clean, hip and perfectly run restaurant in busy Murray Hill - they have another (smaller) location in the LES - and you won't regret it. Come early or be prepared to wait, especially on weekend evenings. Service is efficient and food comes fast... so fast you may want to order only a couple of dishes at the time (or you'll find yourself devouring everything quickly to avoid food getting cold).  Bronte: their signature burger is more a giant meatball sandwich... not really a burger, but VERY yummy nonetheless. Classic Cheeseburger: 2 tasty patties with all the classic ingredients you'd expect in a cheeseburger... but better quality. Good choice. Blueys grilled chicken sandwich: well cooked and juicy. Fried chicken sandwich: a bit dry. I think they should have marinated the chicken before frying it to give more flavor to it. My least favorite dish of the meal. Lamb ragú pappardelle: very good. The pasta is fresh and they sure know how to make ragú, here. Fries with truffle aioli: beyond crispy... outstanding. Crispy brussel sprouts: a bit too vinegary, but still ok. Overall, this is a solid spot if you're craving this type of food. They keep the quality high without charging too much. Recommended.","Came here with friends on a busy Friday night. We put our names down then went to a nearby bar to wait. Wasn't long before they called us!Atmosphere is cool -- we sat half in / half outside. I ordered the creamy chicken pasta and was pretty disappointed. I had to add a ton of salt to taste anything -- and after I did all I tasted was salt, it didn't bring out any hidden flavor. I couldn't even finish it.Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals.","I had an ""eggcellent"" brunch here one Sunday afternoon! The menu had a wide variety of appealing options to choose from so it was a tough decision to make. I went with the scrambled eggs and kale with smoked salmon. It was quite good except I would have preferred the kale to be more sautéed. It was only lightly wilted in the dish. I also had a very tasty watermelon cooler to drink. The service was very good although it was quite busy. This location is rather small although I don't know how big the downtown one is either. So we did have to wait for over 30 min but at least the hostess will take your name and number and text you when a table is ready. We actually ended up sitting at the communal table which helps them save space.I would definitely recommend this place for brunch or other meals as their menu also features dinner items. Hope to come back soon!",Ruby's - Murray Hill
681,"Dined here on Jul 29 Evening. Had a reservation by the sushi bar. Ordered a couple pieces of Nigiri Sushi and the Box of Dreams.Issue 1: Rice was DRY both on the nigiri and box of dreams. The wait staff came by and asked if everything was OK - I delivered the news, hoping for change or explanation. Now, I know sushi rice takes practice to perfect, but this place is NOT NEW and I definitely had higher expectations and/or consistency. Waiter understood and took the feedback to the sushi chef behind the counter, who then called out a kitchen hand after checking his rice. They were right in front of me so I could hear the chef talk about the vinegar and mixing. No one bothered to come back to me to apologise or explain what had actually happened. What a disappointing experience. I had to deal and continue with the dried rice. I was looking forward to this dining experience and high reviews. Technically speaking the rice was... at least 70% of the food I ate that night. So 70% of my meal were dried and worse than I had expected, and I had no explanation or reprieve despite the fact that the chef had acknowledged that this was a problem.Issue 2: One of the waitress who had a very similar name to me, was blaming a fellow customer when the chef behind the counter had let her know to clarify her order - she had asked for the wrong item from the chef, and the chef had let her know to be careful with her order clarity. She blamed the customer for making her confused in front of the other customers by the sushi bar. It was not a pleasant experience as a customer for a wait staff to blame a fellow customer for mispronouncing dish names. Not everyone speaks Japanese the way it's intended to. The wait staff was not even Japanese. Now, I understand that customers can be demanding and undeserving, but please don't talk about other customers in front of customers still dining in the restaurant within the same area.1 star for fish freshness. 1 star for a waitress who came with wet hand towels when she saw me eating my Nigiri Sushi by hand. Thank you. Service was mixed, but with the right wait staffs, chefs and rice your experience might be better than mine. Don't expect consistency here.","I came here with my clients for lunch meeting. We all had Box of dream.($48/par box).It sounds expensive, bu I think this is good deal. Looks like this is Sashimi box, but sushi rice is under the each sashimi. So your stomach is completely full after you finish this.","Got the boxes of dream because it looks cute and yummy. But looks can be deceiving and this is the case. Nothing tastes amazing, just mediocre. For $48 I guess price is reasonable for tasting different kind of sashimi. Note that they put sushi rice underneath so it can be filling.",I love a good sushi spot. This place makes me feel like I'm in Japan.The sushi was very good and tasted very fresh. I love the presentation. The service was very good.Definitely on my list of a go-to sushi spot restaurant.,"Hatsuhana--my favorite, favorite sushi spot in NYC. Right when you step inside, you'll feel like you're in Japan. Made reservations (which is highly recommended) on Yelp and our party of 4 were seated immediately. After being seated, they give you hot towels to clean your hands before eating which is always neat. I come here at least twice a month for their Box of Dreams which is their popular signature entree ($48). I wish I can come more often since I crave sushi quite often--I mean very often, but it isn't cheap. That's because they use top quality ingredients and the food presentation is always excellent. My other three buddies ordered box of dreams, avocado lovers maki ($22), and sushi dinner ($28). We all had a great time and enjoyed our respective dishes. Service is always excellent. We weren't being rushed which is pleasant especially in NYC. Our waiter checked up on us throughout our meal and our hot green teas were always being refilled. I'll be back--in 2 weeks!","Hatsuhana's signature Box of Dreams gives us a bite of everything. Food: 3.6 /5Very fresh ingredients. We like the quality of sashimi and we can try everything in this Box of Dreams includes 9 different miniature bowls. Great presentation and details. Overall experience is good, nothing too surprising for us considering the price is on a higher side. Service: 4/5 The waiters are nice and very helpful Environment: Casual with clean modern design incorporated lots of light wood. A comfortable and cozy environment. They have 2 floors, but we still recommend a small ground due to the tight seating situation. Price: $$$The portion is decent, and the price as well. They have a lunch menu for the box of dreams which is slightly cheaper but doesn't make a big difference.",Hatsuhana Sushi Restaurant
682,"Came here with family again and was VERY let down by the service here, quite lousy coming during the afternoon.  They have a ""Sunday slump"" problem where they don't have enough staff paying attention to the customers during the weekend and are too busy running around trying to set up for dinner. When I asked after half an hour they said it was coming soon. Another 40 minutes went by, and we had enough, and decided to leave, the drinks and bread on table were subpar and watered down, they need to put more chefs in the kitchen in the weekend because I think the whole restaurant was playing the waiting game too, definitely not coming back!","I walked for nearly 20 minutes to come have a meal with a friend. I had called before hand and they told me they close at 11, so I was excited. When I got there at 9:55pm the owner told me that they were about to close in five minutes, despite having a full house and the website and yelp site stating otherwise ( the site says they close at 11 - instead they told me 10 o'clock ).The management actually opened the door for me and told me to go across the street if I wanted Italian ??? Seriously .....I don't use the RACE card but  Granted I am a person of COLOR, and everyone in the store was white so that really upset me. Sooo angry, wish I could give a ZERO review and I could have said something to the management when I was there.","This was a nice restaurant. I think. I honestly don't know because I am tired. I think this was a nice restaurant because I am still full, and I finished eating there about 2.5 hours ago! The only thing I did not like was a fly kept buzzing around my entrée and my head. I tried to swat this stupid idiot away with my hands multiple times, yet it still came back to fly around my entrée. Not cool! Basically the bug that flew near my entrée is the reason why I am not giving this restaurant a better rating.","After having an awful experience at another local restaurant, I went to Acqua and their service was great,  with amazing food. I had their lobster pasta, Aperol spritz and cannoli. The atmosphere is very quiet and their outside space was pleasant. I recommend this restaurant for a relaxed meal in the area.",Bathroom rating: 1 Star Why is there a giant garbage bin right in front of the toilet? The clearance space is surely not enough for... anyone. Came here for an impromptu weeknight dinner. In order of good to mediocre: - Polpo - 4 stars Very fresh and delightful - seafood stew (one of their signature dishes?) - 2.5 stars Heavy on the mussels and not much else. Could've just been called mussels in a tomato based sauce. The fish in the pot was mushy. Shrimp was decent. - pappardelle with lamb ragu - 2.5 stars One of the specials. Pappardelle was tough rather than al dente. The lamb was tough too and overly gamey. Probably not a spot you'll go again but the intrigue of trying it isn't entirely wrong.,"We were looking for good seafood in the area and really hit a homerun. We sat at one of the outdoor tables,the view of the freedom tower was brilliant. The octopus and squid ink pasta were delicious. Washed it down with a refreshing basil martini (or three lol). Bus boy noticed our table was a bit wobbly and fixed it immediately which was nice. The server and Danilo the manager was very attentive to us throughout the night. We will be back to try the rest of the menu! Bon appetito!",Acqua Restaurant NYC
683,"Food was ok, not great not bad.  We had the calamari appetizer and pasta.  We are giving 2 stars for the main dishes and the appetizers, and 4 stars for the service and the molten lava dessert.  Therefore average of 3 stars.","I was looking forward to eating here for my birthday. During dinner a roach crawled across our table. I did not make a scene...my sister in law killed it with her napkin and I took it discreetly to our waitress and Explained what happened. I didn't even get an ""I'm sorry""...nothing was done to compensate us...I know they are in every establishment...but you certainly don't want them crawling on your table. Unfortunately because of their lack of sympathy I will not be back.","Have never come across such miserable or apathetic wait staff. Told the owner, but she really did not seem to care either.  Shame, because I wanted to like this place. The food was OK, but I shan't be coming back.","I came here last Friday night with family for dinner. We were lucky enough to snatch the wine cellar last minute which was absolutely perfect for the 13 of us! What a hidden gem! We loved how it was tucked away downstairs - you'd never guess it was down there from the outside of this charming little restaurant! We all really enjoyed our dinner, we tried close to everything on the menu being as we were a big party and everyone ordered different items. I really enjoyed the grilled zucchini parmigiana which I ate aw my dinner instead of an appetizer. The chocolate molten cake is a must try for desert, so delicious! The service was wonderful - highly recommend for a private dinner.","The food was ok, but not great.  We started with a few appetizers and then had the black linguine with seafood and the ricotta cavatelli.  They were both bland and missing much of the flavor we expected based on the description in the menu and the very positive online reviews of the restaurant.Each pasta dish cost well over $20 and it's possible to find better food at that price point.  On a positive note, the hostess and bartender were both very nice.",Amazing experience. Everything was perfect from the ambience to the dessert. Definitely one of our new favorite restaurants. We will recommend it to all our family and friends.,Misirizzi
684,"Such a disappointment. I would be maybe fine it was tasteless, but no it was tasting terrible and ended up paying $18 for supposedly special lunch menu. It was my first time and sure will be my last one. I could only eat the little pieces of chicken in it. Why are not there any good restuarants in this neighborhood?","Excited to try this place from all the buzz when it first opened, but left disappointed. Food was only okay - small portions and didn't find any dishes that stood out. Delivery of the pho was unique, as they first give you the bowl with the noodles/beef. Then they pour your broth on top with . Thought $16 was overpriced with a relatively small portion of pho. Also tried the laksa and Khao Soi noodles - all only okay!","I gave it one star because I was still hungry after ordering my noodles. It was seafood noodles in a huge bowl. Half of a small lobster 2 clams and 2 PCs of squid. I complained to the waitress that noodles are not expensive n there should be more noodles or even throw 20 cents worth of bean spouts would had help a little. Really not much seafood for $21. It was gone before I realized ""that's it?"" I could of have 2 bowls of noodles at my regular thai or Vietnam restaurant at that price n have a doggy bag and be full and content. I thought maybe they might comp me for lack of noodles. Fat chance. Not coming back. Save ur money n go else where. At least You'll be full. Btw the noodle  soup was just ok nothing to miss.","I have walked past Mi noodle so many times and have always wanted to check it out because it looks so cute inside. So when my friend said it was on her list of places to try out, I was pretty excited. The restaurant is pretty cool and has some separate tables as well as some communal tables. The tables themselves are a cool/irregular shaped wood giving it a hip rustic vibe. We order the summer rolls to start and then I got the pho and my friend got the phat see ew noodles. The summer rolls come in three. They were really fresh with shrimp and mango, and because it was so good we ended up splitting the third piece! The pho came in a big bowl with meat raw still and the server poured in soup broth. Although the broth was a bit on the salty side, the flavor was very savory and on point. The noodles are a bit thicker than the pho noodles I usually have but were booked well. The pho is def better than Luu's baguette's pho. I tried a bit of my friend's noodles and they were also really delicious. Both of us were really satisfied and the portion was large enough that we both had leftovers. In terms of price, Mi noodle bar is definitely a bit pricier than most Asian restaurants. However it's still reasonably well priced compared to other restaurants in the neighborhood. Will definitely be back.","As someone who was born and raised in Asia around Asian food in an Asian household, I was generally impressed with Mi Noodle Bar: specifically their appetizers. The roti canai dip was delicious and being half Malaysian, I was pleasantly surprised by their ability to cook such a tasteful curry dip for the roti. One of my personal favorites is also the Crunchy Roll - it's a delicious take on the crispy Vietnamese spring roll and is tasty. The summer fresh rolls are also great! As for the mains, in my opinion the pho broth was average, not bad, but not amazing. The quality of meat was above average and that was a pleasant surprise. Their fried chicken dish was also not bad and they were generous with their portion. Overall, I highly recommend their appetizers, those are my true favorites on the menu!","Mi Noodle Bar takes a unique spin on southeast Asian food. While it's a little overpriced for what it is, on the whole I really enjoyed all the food there. My parents and I came here, and decided to split four dishes (two appetizers and two entrees). The service was speedy and the servers were respectful and kept a distance for most of our dinner.FOOD:Thai Sausage Dumplings (3/5) - This plate wasn't particularly flavorful or special, and the sausage didn't have too much complexity besides being a little spicy. I liked the mango salad on the side as well as the sauce but didn't think these dumplings were worth the $8.Mi-gan Dumplings (4/5) - These dumplings were vegetarian and I definitely enjoyed them more but the filling was super mild. The sauce and side salad once again paired quite well with the dumplings.Bun Rieu Chai (5/5) - I loved this dish a lot. It's quite sour, so if you're not into that flavor profile I definitely wouldn't recommend ordering this, but I loved the chewy and soft rice noodles in the soup with lots of tomato flavor. I'd venture to say this was even my favorite dish of the night. Phat See Ew (5/5) - The flat noodles were perfectly sautéed with ample veggies in this dish. The one thing that surprised me was just how spicy the noodles were - definitely don't underestimate the punch it packs.",Mi Noodle Bar
685,"Can't believe I've missed out on this place for so long. There's nothing better than picking your own seafood to be cooked your way and delivered to your table. Head to the back and bag your variety of seafood: lots of fish variety, clams, squid, crab, scallops, octopus, shrimp. Then when you pay you can choose how they cook your order: basically fried or grilled. Pick your sides of Greek salad, garlic bread, lemon potatoes, etc, to finish the ordering.Highly recommend the grilled scallops and fried calamari; I could eat those everyday. The grilled seasoning and predominant olive oil they use to cook things is basic, but absolutely delicious.We showed up at opening lunch on a weekday with no table wait. Peak times (weekend dinner) I've heard are the worst so avoid if you are starving and don't want to wait. You're not coming to this place for ambiance, its plastic utensils, or rowdiness at times (seem some videos from friends); just get your seafood and chow down.","It's always a little bit chaotic here, but the past few visits, it's been downright awful; I mean disastrous; I can deal with chaos & gridlock, but this is insanity. Sadly, from employees much more than customers.","Excited for the entire experience prior to getting seated, but left this market extremely underwhelmed and did not live to the hype or expectations. Came here on a Thurs night around 7pm. There was a small crowd outside but we were told it was not considered busy, and our wait would be about 30 mins for a party of 2. We felt lucky as other reviews mentioned that the wait on a busy night could exceed 2hrs. When we were finally seated, the female server wiped down the table except the left over food particles landed all over the seats. Ok whatever, grabbed some tissue and wiped down the chairs. This way I don't stand up later on with a piece of octopus stuck to my behind. Looked down at our plates and there's olive oil on the edges. No big deal, I switched the plates out for a clean set. My plastic fork had some dirty specks, and the female server sees me wiping it down. She gives me a dirty stare as if I had offended her and snatches the fork out of my hand, and switches it out for a new one. No smile, no apologies, just a pissed off look. While I couldn't tell whether she was jokingly upset or really upset, I was already having a not so pleasant experience. Food-Grilled red snapper was the best item amongst all our dishes. Calamari was fried so can't really go wrong. Had to ask for lemons and sauce (tarter only). Clams were grilled which was probably not the right cooking method. It had an over grilled burnt smell and the clams were very chewy. Some of our shells didn't even open up fully. We gave up after eating 2 clams b/c the plastic fork experience was not doing it. Grilled scallops was nothing special. Grilled jumbo shrimp was tough which was a waste b/c they're $22.50/lb. Grilled octopus came out cold. We ordered a lot for 2 ppl. We were sharing a table with 2 other ppl so table space was limited. We had empty plates and instead of clearing it off the table, our server just piled the other dishes on top of it like it was a game of jenga. I don't know if she just didn't like us after I wiped down my fork or she was overwhelmed from the chaos, but we asked another server to help clear the dishes. While I understand that this is a no frills/ market type of experience and I was not expecting any fine dining treatment, but the terrible service exceeded my expectations for mediocre food. If the place wasn't as chaotic, perhaps the cooks would've been able to add a pinch more garlic and salt to our dishes. If I were to ever come back, it would only be during lunch hours on a weekday where most ppl are at work and I so happen to be in the area. For the time being, I have no intention of coming back.",Had 1 of the best seafood experiences in NY ever... I picked fresh what I wanted and Had them cook it  #Grilled #Snapper #Prawn #octopus ...A+ Dont let the decor of the location  fool  you its simple prepared food cooked with  Mediterranean flavors#foodieadventure #Foodie #foodporn  #seafood,"Astoria Seafood is a unique dining experience.  You wait on line to pick your seafood from a reasonably fresh selection of seafood, including a wide variety of fishes, squid, octopus, clams, shrimp, lobster and other shellfish.  You then wait on line to pay for the seafood & request the way you want your seafood cooked (boiled, grilled, etc.) &  then wait on another line to wait for a table.  Once you are seated, you need to wait for your food to be ready.  The seafood is definitely fresh and they definitely know how to cook it well.  The food itself is worth 4 stars but the overall is experience is a mediocre 3 star experience (I would actually give 2.5 star if I could) and I would not go back.First, as you can see from my description of how you get your food, you will be waiting...a lot...on multiple lines...  It took me about an hour and a half from the moment I arrived until my food was served.Second, many tables were missing basic condiments and people in different tables had to share them or they were just out of luck and couldn't get them at all:  hot sauce, salt, pepper, butter, etc.Third, wait staff was clearly stretched thin and none of them was willing to help people on tables they were not covering.  Multiple times, we try to get help from a waiter or waitress who was not our own (when she was being overwhelmed by other tables she was covering) and each of them pointed to our waitress and told me we needed to talk to her.Fourth, and this was the most unforgivable oversight, there was a single working seafood shell cracker for the entire restaurant.  This meant that, when we received our barely cracked lobsters claws, we had to wait for several minutes for our waitress to locate and bring the cracker to us.  This meant that the lobster got lukewarm and borderline cold during this wait.Overall, this place is worthwhile to try once but it's not a repeater.","The pros: Affordable, casual & unpretentious, delicious and fresh seafood made to order, you pick what you want to eatThe cons: Long wait time, loud, no frillsWhen DH and I first walked into the restaurant, we had no idea what was going on.  A small crowd of people were waiting in the front and we didn't know that they had already picked their seafood, stood in line to hand over their pickings and place their orders on how they'd like said seafood prepared (fried, sauteed in butter, steamed?)  We thought they were waiting for a table where you first sit and then order.  We wasted quite a bit of time figuring out what we should do but after browsing the selection at the back, we finally settled on a small white fish (no idea which one), calamari, shrimp, Greek salad and seafood rice.  We then waited for an hour for our food to be cooked and for us to be seated.  This was a weekday around 7pm so we didn't start eating until 8.  In the hour we had to kill, we walked to a liquor store and back to buy a bottle of sake since it's BYOB (no corkage fee) and then stood outside chatting and checking in every 5-10 minutes or so because we were hungry and the food looked and smelled divine at this point.  Finally we were seated and the food did not disappoint!  We loved everything and wow, it was a lot of food.  DH had wanted to order more and I'm glad I stopped him.  TBH, the Greek salad was my favorite part of the meal as my diet is primarily plant based.  I did really enjoy the shrimp though and the complimentary bread was perfect for dipping in the buttery garlic sauce that they sauteed it in.  Delicious!  Only complaints I had:Although we ordered the seafood rice (it was available at the time we ordered), it never came out and when we asked about it, we were told there wasn't anymore.  They refunded us so no big deal.  And although we ordered and paid for a water and soda, we had to remind them to bring it to us.  So just keep track of what you ordered as they don't seem to. Overall, we really enjoyed our dinner at Astoria Seafood and would definitely come back.  It isn't going to be the best dining experience you've ever had but if you have time to kill with someone you don't mind spending hours with, it will be worth the wait.  This is THE restaurant to come to if you want a casual, affordable seafood meal.  Be forewarned, manage your expectations.",Astoria Seafood
686,I have been to their east village location a couple of time before finding this on the UWS.My favorite Sichuan spot .The dan dan noodles are the best.The food here never disappoints.And very reasonably priced.,The food is good but if you walk around and look closely the place is very dirty and needs a paint job. Inches of dust on all the picture frames.,"Hard to describe the depths of disappointment we felt. For a second I thought maybe they outsourced the order to another restaurant. Felt I was a victim of a bait and switch. Szechuan? In the UWS? 4 stars with hundreds of ratings? It was too good to be true. The salt pepper shrimp ($21) did not have a crunchy texture, or the delicious fried bits of garlic and chilies that usually accompanies this dish. Instead, it was soggy and bland -- imagine sweet and sour shrimp minus the sweet and sour sauce.People were raving about the Dan Dan noodles. Unlike pictures showing dry noodles, we got a dish made with lo mein noodles. The level of numbing spice was correct, but could not make up for all the soft noodles. Very sparse on the mix-ins. Tried a few appetizers (spicy wontons and scallion pancakes) -- similar story. Not sure if the cook was out for the night, or something went horribly wrong, but the food made us sad. A lot of the reviews on here might be Russian bots or something.","I had lunch and almost good. They served lunch menu. Price was really good.Dan dan noodle was tasty and well chewey noodle. It smell like real chinese food! Pepper chicken was little hot to me. When you eat foods, you need to check hot quantity. They already put all hot quantity on the menu. Dumpling with chili oil also great. steamed dumplng and chili oil was very well balanced favor.I will come back!","Probably my favorites Chinese place in NYC. The portions are good, prices are reasonable ($12-16 per dish), and the East Village location has a great vibe. The dumplings in chili oil are amazing, the dry pepper chicken is great, and the fried rice is the best I've had in the city. Unlike most Chinese places in NYC that are sketchy and relatively dirty, Han Dynasty is clean and feels like a more ""upscale"" version of Chinese food.","I adore Han Dynasty! I've been going for the past couple of years and it's one of my go to's for a large group gathering in the Upper West Side Not only is it consistently delicious but it's easy to get reservations mainly because they have so much space. I love everything on their menu. However, their fried chicken and their dan dan noodles are my absolute favorite. Their dan dan noodles are the best in New York. I dare you to find a better dan dan noodle place.",Han Dynasty
687,"Disappointed. Although service was excellent as usual, the Black Label Burger, ordered medium rare, seemed stale, not juicy as expected. Could it have been precooked? Maybe the chef on 9/18 was having a bad day. The steak tartare was certainly exciting to try and the Caesar salad fresh. This is my 5th dining experience at Minetta but probably not my last.","The atmosphere truly takes you back in time and has a sort of regal, olt-time New York feel. Perfect for a date or with family.Waitstaff was professional and prompt.Mussels entree in tomato broth was decent. Fries thin, crispy and plentiful.Infamous Black Label burger simply did not live up to the hype, in my opinion. When you ask for medium well, they give you medium rare. The flavor was good, but nothing outstanding, especially for $33.00 a pop.","Had a really horrible experience here last night. Got the burger and asked for it to cooked medium. It came completely rare. The same happen with two of the other burgers at the table. We waited for the burgers for over 45 min so I was starving by the time it came to the table and decided to eat it anyway. BIG mistake, I felt sick all night and actually had to call out of work for it today. The other friend at the table sent his burger back to be cooked more, and they came back with the same burger he had cut previously. For such a hefty price for a burger, the experience and aftermath was just by far the most disappointing dining experience I've had in the city. Will never be back. My advice, if you get the burger DO NOT eat it if it's not cooked throughly.","I love this place.I've only been to NYC twice, but I've made sure that I always make a stop at Minetta Tavern for their Black Label Burger. I believe I first heard about this place and their burger from an episode of Anthony Bourdain, and we all know that man knows his food. The burger is perfectly medium rare and very simplistic with only the patty, bun, and caramelized onions. If you're a fan of burgers with the kitchen sink thrown in, then this is definitely not something you'll enjoy. If you're a fan of being able to 'taste' what the beef flavours are like then this burger is great. There's always an inherent risk with eating any meat that isn't fully cooked all the way through, but the reputation of Minetta Tavern should be enough to know that they ensure that food safe quality is top notch.We've been there during the busy dinner rush hour, as well as when they first opened on a Sunday morning. It appears it doesn't matter when you go because it's always busy inside, so I HIGHLY recommend making reservations ahead of time instead of showing up as a walk in.I think it goes without saying that this is always a must have whenever I'm in NYC, and a place that I always highly recommend for all my friends. Get the Black Label Burger and know that you're going to have one of the most delicious burgers in your life.","4.5 stars Keith McNally eateries are ever the mainstay on  New York City's restaurant landscape, & in the memories I make in this fair city (Pastis welcomed me to Manhattan many moons ago & I couldn't fathom hosting my graduation brunch anywhere but Balthazar.) Recently I brought two guests to old-school cool Minetta Tavern for brunch, & service shined so bright for us; from the kind hostess to the upbeat waitstaff who happily snapped our photo to the manager who checked on us after our meal -- they made us feel our patronage was truly appreciated.I ordered Agnolotti ($22) because I'm a sucker for any pasta with cherry tomatoes & breadcrumbs. One of my companions ordered the incredible & traditional Croque-Monsieur ($23, plus $3 to top it with a fried egg) -- possibly one of the best I've tasted. Though I didn't try my other companion's Lobster Roll ($24), she offered up her extra crisp & salty fries (as if she had a choice, I'm a fry bandit supreme.) Happy taste buds all around! Making beautiful memories at Minetta Tavern (& at their sister restaurants) -- put that on your NYC bucket list, if it isn't there already.","Black Label Burger Shmack Label Shmurger lol. I came here with friends because we were all craving burgers and apparently this was rated one of the top (if not the top?) burgers in NYC, and also didn't realize that this was a Michelin star restaurant until I did? Anyway, from the outside this place is super unassuming, and even when you walk in, it just seems like a typical upscale pub, nothing too fancy. We came without a reservation and waited about an hour and a half at a sweet speakeasy-esque bar across the street called Up & Up - it's definitely a good option if you don't have a reservation.Anyway, pretty much just got the burger here lol. It was good! But was it worth $33? I dunno. There must be something about the innate *quality* of the meat that I don't truly appreciate because I've had burgers that are bigger elsewhere for cheaper, burgers just as juicy elsewhere for cheaper, burgers that are more flavorful elsewhere for cheaper. So while it was a real solid burger, I definitely wasn't like *wow best burger of my LIFE*. Generous portion of fries though.I would definitely come back here to try the rest of the food! But probably wouldn't get the burger again, haha. Good burger but the price tag didn't match for me.",Minetta Tavern
688,"- Mostly delicious food- Inappropriate, unprofessional, and discriminatory staffMy partner and I dined here recently. The food was delicious and our dining experience was going well until the Shio Saba was served. The smell of the fish was pungent and nauseating, and the fish itself was leathery all the way through. We didn't feel comfortable eating it because we were worried it was bad and we were concerned about getting sick. Regardless, we were willing to stay and try other options. After speaking to our server, he kindly removed the dish and went to speak to the chef. When he came back to our table, he informed us that the chef no longer wanted to serve us. My partner and I paid out without objection, and even tipped our server 20% for his brief service. On my way out, I stopped by the food window out of respect to apologize to the chef. As a server, I understand how frustrating the business can be, especially when it's a small, locally-owned establishment, with a hands-on chef showcasing his craft. He immediately began yelling at me through the window in front of everyone dining in, and told me to never come back. He proceeded to raise his voice even further, and insinuate that my partner doesn't deserve to call himself Japanese (he's Japanese). His anger was explosive and volatile; clearly lacking in self-control. I cannot begin to imagine what it's like working for such a miserable, poor excuse of a man as a server--or what really goes on behind the scenes of that restaurant--if my experience as a customer was this terrible. As promised, I will never come back; but do everyone else around you a favor: Quit your job. You are clearly very unhappy there.",Rude staff and veeeeerrrryy looooong waiiiiiiiit tiiiiimmmes,"No phone number. Walked 30 mins to dine here. Arrived at 9:30, they're suppose to close at 10:30. The restaurant was full. They told me they were closed. No explanation given, just closed.No A/C","My first visit was for my business with them. We, 4 men had tasted almost all menus, and were awestruck. It was a month ago. Now I came back with my wife, who is very picky for any type of cuisine. I and she experienced the excellent food. Eating one and expecting another was pure joy. My favorite was Vegetable Agedashi. It produces so called 'Umami' in its genuine way. You must try Karaage(Japanese style fried chicken) too. My Japanese colleagues found it superb even by their higher standards. Go check this hidden pearl. It deserves more delightful eaters.","750 Myrtle Diner is truly unique. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but you walk in and the decor is amazing, the kitchen basically takes up half the restaurant up against the wall, leaving only room for a handful of tables. Oh, it's most definitely not a diner, so don't get confused by the name. It's a Japanese bistro, with some other Asian influences.The chicken karaage was basically perfect. Giant chunks of perfectly fried chicken. The lettuce wrap with crab was weird. I expected a... lettuce wrap, but it was more akin to a sushi roll with lettuce inside. It was good though, and the portion size was nuts.For our mains, we got the duck soba and the duck with mushrooms and lotus root. The duck dish was really good. Lots of flavors intermingling together.They also have a bunch of Japanese beers and sake on their menu, including sparkling sake!Definitely recommend stopping by.","Came here for a 1 on 1 date with my S.O. According to the waiter, their menu changes everyday. It's a nice little place with shared plates. For 2 of us, we ordered like 4 plates to share, which was a decent amount of food for me to be satisfied but not too full. Original fried chicken- yummm. I absolutely love fried chicken and this does not disappoint. Crispy outside, moist inside. It's flavorful. It also comes with a side of citrus dipping sauce and that complimented the chicken very well.Chicken gizzards- i also love gizzards. I love the crunchy texture and this place makes it pretty well. I really enjoyed dipping it in the citrus sauce (part of fried chicken order). I don't know if they will give u the citrus sauce if u just ordered the gizzards. Keep in mind, my plate of gizzards wasn't 100% gizzard. They mixed it with chicken heart and some other unrecognizable parts as well.Tuna tartar- this had an interesting flavor which I can't say I loved, but it was decent. It's basically a paste, or pate, and u put it on a toast and eat it. Can taste the hint of Wasabi, the raw eggs. Texture had some getting used to.Chicken liver in butter- this was a mixed bag for me. I can't deny, the butter garlic parsley sauce was delicious. Everything I love. The liver itself takes Alot of getting used to. For those of u who have not tried liver before, it is VERY gamey, and has a very strong distinct after taste. I hated it when I was a kid....thought I got used to it as an adult already but apparently not. My first piece was not too bad. I actually kinda enjoyed it. But I think I ate my second piece too fast. The overwhelming after taste made me want to throw up. Luckily I didn't. I rested my stomach a couple minutes and drank some soju to mask the after taste. I was able to eat 1 more small piece afterwards but my fiance had to finish everything lol.Overall, this is a nice little place with some interesting dishes. I would come back again if I was around the area.",750 Myrtle Diner
689,"Our experience with lunch at The Modern was unpleasant. There are 3 classes of seating. The upper class dimes on white linen tablecloths in a quiet area with a view of the garden and can have a $138 per person 3-course lunch or a $178/pp 6-course lunch. The middle class eats at bare tables in a noisy area. And the rest eat st low tables with uncomfortable swivel chairs and very uncomfortable, too-wide benches. The $24 white asparagus soup was served lukewarm and was just flavored cream served over some chopped red peppers. The $43 herb-stuffed chicken breast was undercooked (still pink) and served lukewarm. It was accompanied by a few slices of cooked endive and a few royal trumpet mushrooms. The best part of the meal were the two warm cube-shaped rolls. Not recommended.","This place is stupid. I get it's for wealthy gray haired wall streeters but the portions sizes are obnoxiously small. I get it's fine dining, but serving 2 thin pieces of lamb saddle smaller than the size of my pinky shouldn't be an entree. Same with the beef tenderloin. Took a client last night and left hungry and embarrassed.","Very sad at how downhill my past few experiences have been. Communication between staff has been poor, they served me food with gluten despite me making clear my allergy both in my reservation, verbally, and with a printed card. The front desk also failed to acknowledge me for my seating for so long that they literally stopped serving lunch by the time I was sat which was infuriating. A real shame as I have so enjoyed the past few years here.","Excellent atmosphere, very attentive service, and amazing food! My friends and I came here for their summer boozy brunch menu: fried chicken bucket and bubbly. But we started with some cocktails and I was surprised at how good they were. We also got some appetizers and truffle pasta and risotto which were also amazing. The quality of the ingredients, creative menu, and taste of each plate were all top notch. The fried chicken was drizzled with delicious sauce and the thinly cut french fries on the bottom were perfect. It also came with some flatbread on the side. Lastly, we ordered 4 different desserts and I must say I was blown away. Each of them was delicious, not too sweet, and very pretty! I highly recommend here for fine dining, special occasion, or for getting a drink or two. I would definitely want to come back here again if there's an occasion!","I've been the The Modern twice and both experiences were excellent. In regards to my most recent visit, I came with my boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary. They acknowledged my request and sat us at the booth which was nice. I knew I had to take him here because the ambiance, food, and service was amazing when I came here the first time. *6-course menu* is $188 per person with tip included, which is reasonably priced as it holds two Michelin stars.Dishes we tasted: -Buckwheat Tartelette -Eggs on Eggs on Eggs* -Pretzel Croissant with Mustard Butter -Hamachi Tartare* -Sauteed Halibut*-Comte Crusted Beef*-Mirabelle Plum Sorbet* -Sweet Corn Custard*-Coconut & Mango Shumai -Bluberry and Jasmine Ice Cream I liked that they were able to gladly substitute green tomato caprese to a different flavored sorbet. The only complaint was that their eggs on eggs on eggs dish was overly salty--my boyfriend and I couldn't finish it. However everything else was delicious. We loved the personal touches on the dishes. Everything was handled professionally and timing of each dishes were consistent. My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time here and left satisfied. We'll definitely be back!","I had the pleasure of having dinner here for my girlfriend's birthday. I was between another restaurant (2 Michelin Stars) but the did one thing that I appreciated more than the other. Something as small as asking for her name to wish her a happy birthday. So many places forget the small details but that's what made me pick this spot. The experience is very chill. We got there early and had some drinks at the bar. They're pricey af, but strong. The bar room was my kind of casual. Sneakers and button downs. (I dig it)But, we sat in the dining room. The menu is straightforward and has a couple of hits. My girlfriend loved the steak entree and the eggs on eggs on eggs. The caviar in the latter was so, so good. And the eggs in it were literally like butter. I honestly thought it was soft butter until I really tasted it. That was one of the best dishes I've ever had. The creativeness in each dish was amazing. On another note, the dry aged duck was impeccable, and aside from that the mango shumai was an amazing end to the meal. I could go on and on about this place but I'll let the food and experience do the talking. I will say, this place does not live up to Gramercy tavern. Bread makes meals. The bread served was interesting but did not compare to the whole wheat rolls at Gramercy. I saw these rolls on my way out at the bar, though! The service also lacked in terms of pace and attentiveness. Gramercy is my go-to, but this was still a special treat. Ps: the printed menus of your meal was the cherry on the sundae. It made it all unforgettable.",The Modern
690,"Visited from CA for the wife's bday and unfortunately had a poor experience, specific only to the execution of their specialty 32oz, 45 day dry aged ""double eagle"" ribeye ($140). Everything else about the experience, including John the waiter and Eric (the manager?) who did what he could to remedy the situation, was great.Ordered the double eagle medium-rare, which John said the house recommended. John described medium-rare to our table as ""pink and hot all the way through."" I order all my steaks medium rare and found that description suitable. When it arrived, Eric began carving it and asked how the color was. In the dimly lit restaurant, the color itself didn't look too bad, so he cut it all and served it to me. Long story short, I touched the center of the meat and it was refrigerator cold and some of the fat hadn't rendered. My room temp wine was warmer. Eric was quick to re-fire the dish, but we can all imagine how that went...it killed the steak and ruined their own specialty. Eric comped our wine and dessert, and apologized a bunch. Three stars for their service, efforts to make it right and the rest of the food was fantastic.","First, when we called to make the reservation, weeks in advance, we asked for a corner table or booth, not in the middle of the restaurant. We were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant. I ordered a ""prime"" ribeye, medium. So did one of my guests. His steak was twice the size of mine, and cooked perfectly. Mine was thin, full of gristle, and well done. I complained, the general manager came out and apologized, was great about it, and said he'd have another one right out. By the time my replacement came out, everyone else was finished eating. It was cooked medium, but it was also thin, and half the size of the  one served to my guest. Disappointing considering the price we paid.","My global steakhouse tour continues! Having already tried Keen's and Luger in NYC, this spot was next up.Ordered the signature Double Eagle cut and definitely did not disappoint. Well marbled, cook to perfection, and bursting with flavor at every bite.The only markdown was that some of the oysters were exceedingly salty. Sure they're oysters, but when you feel tempted to spit them out because the salt is too overwhelming, it's not a good experience","I cannot give this location anything less than five stars. From the moment you walk in the service is incredible. Although it's always busy the service is friendly and they take care of you, making you feel special every time. I have been to this location several times and it never disappoints. This time I took two guests that had never dying to there before. We ordered dirty martinis, which were perfect.  We ordered oysters, fois gras, lobster bisque, the branzino which was a special for the day accompanied by asparagus and mushrooms. We also ordered the crabcakes and the fillet medallions with mashed potatoes. Everything came out on time, cooked to perfection and the server couldn't have been more on point knowing that we were going to a show afterward. It's also important to mention that they were serving stone crabs and I happened to notice and inquired with our server. He did confirm that they were stone crabs and not ""Jonah claws"". He also made sure to get three jumbo claws for myself and my two guests to try. If you're looking for a great meal I definitely recommend this place is one of my favorite spots in New York City. If you are a meat-eater  make sure to put it on your list!","Had an a fantastic birthday celebration at Del Frisco's! Our steak meal was delicious and we left stuffed beyond belief. The complimentary birthday dessert was also a wonderful surprise. Things to note: your bill can easily turn out to more than you expected with additions such as the truffle butter with crab meat ($22), or if you ask the waiter to recommend you a glass of Merlot ($35). What I should've said instead is ""Truthfully I cant tell the difference so please bring me the cheapest glass you have."" For two people we spent exactly $400 after tip. It was a very satisfying meal, but just prepared to spend two arms and a leg!!","Hands down, best steakhouse with best vibes in NYC. They accommodated me with the booth seating. Bone in rib eye medium rare was perfection. Lobster Mac and cheese, lobster mash potato, and wild mushroom is a must! Crab cake was fantastic too.Service was on point, I didn't get a chance to take a picture of all the dishes because they were just serving us which I also appreciated. They left a birthday card on the table with all the staff signatures which I thought was a neat touch. They comped the dessert which was also very generous of them. The dessert was a delicious chocolate fudge and a warm hazelnut cake with ice cream. Can't wait to come back!!",Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse
691,"Order the Ravioli, a bottle of wine, some salad, and avoid the vodka penne. I was really disappointed by the quality of the Italian food here because it has such a home-cooked style feel. I went here on a date and found myself disappointed by the food and the massive portion sizes for two... we were given two gigantic server platters of pasta for two people. The chairs and tables feel pretty cheap and not in an old school Italian kind of way. The servers feel friendly and like their families have worked there for generations, which was nice, but I will not return because the vodka penne was so incredibly generic tasting. Recommend coming here on a cold fall or winter night because there is no air conditioning (vs the summer where you will 100% guaranteed start sweating through your clothes).",Food may be good - never got to find out -waited a really long time for service - and then discovered that the jets fans from Alabama at the table next to us had received no attention either. Decided to leave so the jets fans could get some food - our good deed for the day - who says New Yorkers aren't nice. Go jets Ps - Peter's wife the hostess could do with an attitude adjustment. She had a permanent scowl and got testy when we asked if we could order. Very unappetizing.,We arrived at 640 for a 7 pm reservation and the place was almost empty. We were told to come back at 7.  Horrible customer service. The lady who seats people should never deal with customers. So we went to another restaurant that was happy to seat us.,Amazing place! Everyone is so friendly and like family!LOBSTER CANNELLONI! So much lobsterits ridiculous! So goodGARLIC BREAD: phenomenal. Wish I had more. Chicken parmesan was good as expected!Gnocchi (stuffed with cheese) was so pillowy and chewy and delicious. You can DEF tell that the pasta is handmade. Cute little place and would definitely return. Thank you for the great experience!,"We really enjoyed this place. Everyone is so so friendly.  Started with some nice loafs of warm bread, one sesame and one plain.Had a couple of recommendations. Started with a baby arugula salad which was decent and a pretty big size.  For me the dressing was a tad sweet, but everyone else enjoyed.  Counterbalanced by the spiciness of the arugula.Also had the meatballs which were a hit. The sauce was really good.  I had the lobster cannelloni, which I really enjoyed. Nice chunks of lobster and a nice pasta shell.  A little rich, but my favorite dish.  My wife had the shrimp fa'diavolo. I tried the sauce which was great, save some bread if you can to dip into it.  Not overly spicy.The kids' favorite dish was the pasta aglio olio which was a nice linguini in an olive oil sauce with tons of sliced garlic.",GREAT date night atmosphere. Piccolo Angolo is a tiny little spot in Chelsea that doesn't disappoint. The food here is authentic and delicious and the chef really cares about what he serves. I would recommend making a reservation since it is a very small location and I would imagine it filling up fast. This was my first time here and I could honestly say that I would happily travel here from Long Island again for this delicious food.,Piccolo Angolo Restaurant
692,"Ok. I own a restaurant and have worked in them for the better part of my life. I know good service, I know bad service, and I know when someone just doesn't give a single eff.  I have been to the Wayland about 15 times, and consistently get AMAZING attention (I always sit at the bar).  However, the utter disdain my bartender had for life today was beyond palpable, and translated to someone who did nothing but snip at my group, make annoyed faces, deliver food without silverware, all without uttering a single word to us.  To have any interaction, in fact, we had to get up to get get her attention for every single thing we needed. No water was offered, not even the most basic of needs were met. She was purely rude and disconnected.I have a service dog, and she immediately snipped before I got 3 feet in the door to tell me he was not allowed.  Once I could process what was happening, I let her know it was a service dog to which she snarkily replied, ""Does it have papers?"", to which I of course said yes.I'm really, for a lack of better words, gutted, by the disrespectful and shameful behavior this employee (receipt says Meg), showed to my group.We recommend The Wayland to anyone we get the chance to, but that stops now.","Reuben was a total jerk. One of my friends knocked over a glass by accident and low and behold, it broke. Shocking! He was so mean after that and treated my girl friends and I like shit the rest of the night. Not cool. 2 stars because the drinks were average. Still, don't be nasty like that - not the way to make money for your bar, not the way to earn tips, or and definitely not a way to gain customer appreciation. See ya.","Had a terrible experience, due to the lack of hospitality and respect from the staff. Walked in with no greetings from the waitress or staff, when asked if we could sit at a particular table, was brutally rebuffed with a no, instead of, well people at the bar are waiting for that table but let me see what I can do. When I looked pass this, I decided to order a drink and not let the nastiness of what just transpired ruin my experience, so i ordered a cocktail. When I ordered a drink from the bartender, and asked to exclude pineapple from the drink (due to a food allergy) I straight up got the side eye and look of repugnance. It's not like I was asked if I have an allergy, but also as a customer, I do not deserve that attitude for ordering something I'm drinking. While still willing to stay there and swallow the bitterness of this place, nothing got better.We had to get the bartenders attention to order, we had to get her to attention to get utensils and water, we had to get her attention again to get the bill.I'm just so surprised a staff could act like that and think it's acceptable service. Never again will I go back there!","Super super solid bar.Cocktails are great, server is great, vibe is fun. Was brought here by friends when visiting NYC and this is one of their favorite bars.","The kind of place where when you're sitting at the bar enjoying your MUSHROOM SANDWICH and HONEY & MILK two blondes will force their way into your personal space one really pushing her elbow into your side as if you arent there at all. At All. The AMBIANCE is great, perfect date spot or place for a couple drinks or their food! OMG the food! Which are all on point! But the MUSIC is WAY TOO LOUD! Funny the atmosphere is so perfect for a date spot, but then you have music blasting.Ambiance 2/5 5/5 look, but the music is too loud. Dont bring a first date here.Service 4/5 SolidFood 4/5 really good, but is alil pricey for what you getOverall 4/5","I will start by saying that The Wayland is the bar that I judge most other bars against whether I find them in the US, or in other parts of World. It's just made that much of an impression on me over the years. I've been coming to The Wayland for at least the last 4 years or so and just can't get enough. Being from New York originally, I'm back for work and friends quite often and I almost always end up here or even find a hotel nearby so I can find time for a drink.They just have some of the best cocktails, and small bites/food I've ever had at a bar. The Wayland starts are a chill spot to grab some food and drinks during the day and gets more and more wild as the night goes on. Only in the best way though! The staff is crazy talented and the music playing is usually some of the best you are going to hear all evening. Speaking of staff and bartenders, there is one that I have been going to here since the beginning and that is Moe. Super talented, and can come up with a cocktail for anyone if you don't see something on the menu that you want (I'd find that very very hard to believe). The selection and execution is just that good. For a place like this to get as busy as it does at night, while still having that intimate feel and delivering top-notch cocktails and service is a marvel. Keep it up team and I plan to continue coming here as often as I can. Probably my favorite bar!",The Wayland
693,1，well taste meat2，can pay by visa3，If you guys want a table，need to wait all people arrived 4，service is just soso,"This is probably just single event due to the specific server, but it was really ridiculous. The server actually burned out the mushroom(see photo 1) and we asked him to change the net and maybe redo the mushroom (the table next to us ordered the same thing and it should look like photo 2), the server refused to change the net firmly or redo anything and shouted to us the net is like brand new why need to change......and more ridiculous the manager initially replied that's their regular protocol and defended that the server didn't do anything wrong......I never experienced such a weird attitude for both the server and the manager. This is my first time visiting this branch and very disappointed for the service! This is one of my favorite Korean BBQ place and visited them a lot in both fort lee and flushing locations. I hope the NYC one to pay more attention to their staff quality in order to qualify for the name of Kang Ho Dong.",Sub par bbq.. Skimpy on veggie wraps and the quality of the meat didnt live up to my expectation.,"Out of the Korean BBQs I've tried so far, I've enjoyed this one a lot. If you come during the week later at night the wait isn't so bad and you'll get seated right away. Still always crowded. Last time I went they had a combined beef and pork special for $80 which was the best of both worlds for a great price.I love all the sides it comes with. The sauce you make that goes with the meats is also good. We got the kimchi stew and also delicious. I'm not a fan of corn but loved the warm corn and cheese on the side of the grill. It comes with A LOT of meat and you will stuff your face. One combo is good for two very hungry people. The waiters will cook everything for you on the grill. Great experiences every time!","I have eaten a lot of Korean BBQ, from multiple states, in all time zones. I still don't get the hype. Sure, it's ""fun"" (not really) in the sense that it's interactive, casual and rare to dine in this way. I just don't get the process. For the amount of green one spends on this experience, it's just not worth it to me. I'd rather have a real chef make my food, not a waiter. Or, me for that matter. Food: 3Food options: 3 $ to portion: 3Service: 5 Date Spot: 4Wait: 1 - the pits Reservations: big parties Why am I tipping a server (who's juggling multiple tables) to overcook my steak? I once went to one of those ""high end"" KBBQ spots that served dry aged beef & has a star from that Euro tire company that I could care less about. The server there still overcooked all the meat. KBBQ spots, all of them, are the definition of insanity. I guess I should cook it myself, right? Remember that Seinfeld episode where Kramer has the ""make your own pizza"" restaurant idea? This is equally as stupid, minus the urine soaked hands from the owner.  Look, I don't come to these things voluntarily. My core group of basics drag me to KBBQ spots and I go, because I'm a team player, play'ah. I found their little plates of bahn chan's to be just ok. They don't give you a lot. There's scrambled eggs that are cooking around the ""fire"", as well as corn and random chopped veggies. I have only seen this in LA and Hawaii, but there's something brilliant about this. I've never had a good experience at a joint that has mediocre bahn chans.The service was the best thing about this whole experience. So, there's that. Leave your number with the receptionist & he/she will text you when your table is ready. Expect excruciating wait times during the usual rush hour zones. The three of us dished out about $50+ (per person), w/tip & shared a pitcher of shitty beer. But who only drinks a pitcher of overpriced beer at a KBBQ? The usual rounds of shots will bump this to the $80/$100 range, if you come here w/your douche squad. The smell of cooked meat on your clothes and hair is free, doe.","I had a decent lunch at this spot last week. During Ritual's $1 lunch week, I decided to order my lunch here. (The price is not a part of the review). As I ordered takeout, I can't comment on ambience/service but it seemed clean and nice upon popping in and out of the restaurant lol.I ordered the Kalbi Lunch Box ( braised short rib, with white rice, two pork dumplings, and some different vegetables) The meal was OK, the meat was tender but there were many bones in the entree and too much fat, it felt like I was cutting off a lot of fat and cutting a lot of meat of bones and it took away from the pleasure of the meal. I'm not uncultured I know it should be a little fatty and obviously short ribs often come on the bone but something was lacking in this meal. I'm not sure I would return",Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong
694,"Came here for happy hour oysters, was not disappointed on that end (drinks are not included in HH specials). Everything else pretty much fell short from there. Waitress took our oyster order and completely forgot about us thereafter. 45 minutes into sitting at an empty table after finishing our oysters, we finally flagged down a busser who got us water (our cups were empty the entire time) and took our food order. We ordered duck confit (which was actually delish), poached calamari (meh), and chickpea fries (quite good). The place was uncomfortably hot inside on a summer evening, and it got reaaaal loud and packed real fast. It was hot and the noise level was seriously deafening. I had never wanted to get out of a restaurant so fast in my life. We got our food packed up and after another grueling round of trying to get the check (service is apparently terrible here), got outta there with sad disappointment and regret.","Good food, awful service. Our waiter was so rude he made one of the members of our party cry. The only good workers are the bus staff who appear to be doing majority of the work.",Was excited to try it but the attitude we received from the hostess was really disheartening and upsetting. She was rude rolled her eyes and sucked her teeth even when we thanked her for seating. It was then and only then decided to get up and leave that she changed her entire demeanor. To make matters worse she went around to tables stating we were rude to her when we were unhappy with how rude she was from the beginning. She's the first and last face you see. Maybe better training is needed. Really disheartening as we were excited to try it out.,"Sel Rrose is one of my three staple cocktail bars in NY!! Here it is:Ambience: 8/10 Rustic, candle lit, doors open in the summer, I love it and so should you. Only loses two points because if you're sitting at a table after 7:30pm, you won't be able to hear your friend or date. It's loud and you'll need lip reading skills. Some of you don't have this, so it'll be tough. Drinks: 10/10 These bartenders are more like cocktail craftsmen/craftswomen. They know how to make mean cocktails and if you want something special, just ask. They smoke my Brooklyn Gin and soda with lavender like it's a walk in the park- no questions asked. Which other $$ bar doesn't go, ""uhm sorry we don't have that...""?Food: 10/10 $1 oysters (fresh as can be) before 7pm. For oysters, THIS IS THE PLACE. I normally order at least two dozens with some shrimp cocktail and lobster tail (both of which are not included in happy hour). It's really good guys, probably one of the best seafood towers you can get in the area. Check for yourself below in the pics.   And the Parmesan fries? ...I've had friends tell me they're the best they've ever had- no exaggeration.  Verdict: Just do it. No regrets here","If you love happy hour oysters and fun cocktails, you must come here. The oyster selection here is decent. If you're not sure what type of oysters you should go for, just try them all! I personally prefer the fanny bay oysters. If you're not an oyster person, Sel Rrose offers a variety of small dishes that are worth the visit alone. My favorite would be the calamari salad with chickpeas! The portion sizes are surprisingly very big, so that a plus! The truffle fries here are excellent as well if you're not super hungry and there just for the cocktails. My friend really liked the risotto balls but I think they're just okay. Spring and Delancey has to be my favorite cocktail here. I probably had about three or four of them while I was there hahah. My friend really likes the Pisco Sour. The cocktails here will run you $15/16 even during happy hour but they're really good! I think you pay for what you get here and for Manhattan, the prices are pretty standard. Stop by during happy hour (4-7), for a fun time! This is a great spot for a date. It's best to get there before 6 because the seats fill up fast.",We were staying in a hotel nearby and my girlfriend gets a random craving for oysters. Consult yelp and look at that - a block away and it's happy hour. We walk over and were seated quickly. We just wanted a little snack so we got a dozen oysters and truffle fries. The oysters were fresh and delicious. The fries were also valid - they didn't skimp on the truffle oil like most places. The dipping sauce was good too. We ended up getting another half dozen oysters cause TREAT YO'SELF. No regrets.,Sel Rrose
695,"Have been here many times for brunch, pastries, coffee, etc. but won't be returning. Arrived at 4:01pm to an open door but was refused a coffee to go because the shop closed at 4. I asked if the shop had coffee left - the barista said yes but he was unable to serve me after 4pm. I explained that he was currently pouring someone else a coffee and it was after 4pm, and asked if he could simply make another. He said he had to get going right after and the if he poured me a coffee after 4, a never ending line of people would continue to stream in. There was nobody on the street or outside the cafe. What a ridiculous way to run a business - pour one more coffee and make a sale (and don't lose a regular customer) then lock the door. And save your bad logic.",I will be back. I went in for a fried chicken to go. Not disappointed but not satisfied as well. It need some sort of acidity. And some bits only had the crumbs of the flour. Not a good indication for a perfect fried chicken that just tell me there was excess flour on the chicken before it got fried. Flavor was good. Love the red cabbage but needed something to cut the fat.,"I was excited to try this place but after checking it out,I've decided it was over-hyped. My sweet tahini oat milk latte, one of their specialties, was boring. I tasted no cardamom and any tahini flavor was lost to the oat milk...a waste of SIX DOLLARS. The brew Parlor coffee, whose retail shop  I enjoy going into when it's open to customers, their coffeess never wow me. Golda serves the same pastries as Konditori and the made to order food I saw was lackluster in presentation...we can all take half an avocado slice it and sprinkle chili flakes on top. One and done. Back to the unpretentious and reliably good, Daily Press across the street.",Amazing friend chicken sandwich Perfect amount of crispy with ideal softness from the everything bun. The sauce on the bun gave the experience a zing to the crunch that will one having coming back again and again!,"Have been a number of times and am only now getting around to writing a review. Golda features delicious, made-to-order food with heavy Middle Eastern/Eastern European flair. From the fantastic coffees to the flavorful mains, Golda is the type of place where you can't go wrong with what you order. Just came back from having breakfast with a friend and we both commented on how good our meals were. I had the eggplant menemen (pan-fried? eggplant, crisply egg, saffron yogurt, Jerusalem artichoke chips, etc.) and my friend had the egg sandwich and each was prepared perfectly. The only downside to Golda is the space/layout. Real estate in NYC is obscene, so it's not Golda's fault that the seating is limited, but it's not a comfortable place to sit and no matter which seat you have you feel cramped and slightly uncomfortable...which probably helps ensure quick turnover. That said, the food is the star and the seating is something you can overlook while you devour your food.","This niche cafe is tiny with a few equally tiny tables but as my friend pointed out, it's quite photogenic. Very nice decor details. You order your items and pay for everything at the counter and then find a table. That being said, while the dishes were very prettily presented, they lacked seasoning. This, especially for a bunch of Middle Eastern brunch items. I just wanted some more tinge and spice in the cauliflower since it was so beautifully colourful.",Golda
696,"They charge $2.50 for a cup of hot water.  Just hot water... no lemon, no tea.  Food was good, nothing special.  Not good enough to make up for the fact that they charge $2.50 for a cup of hot water. It was neither on the menu nor was it disclosed by the waiter.  We have never been charged for hot water at any other restaurant before.","Tried  getting  a  table  at  this  place on  July  4th  at  8:30  pm  and  even  with  empty  tables  inside,  hostess  offered  us  the  one  lone  empty table outside.  It  was  scorching  hot  that  day.  Asked  if  one  of  the  empty  tables  were  available  and  hostess  didn't really answered.  I  live  right  around  the  corner  and  what  kind  of  bs was  that.  Needless  to  say,  I  walked  out.",Came in with 4 of my coworkers and was able to get a last minute reservation for 7pmAll our food was delicious.I ordered the squid ink pasta. The pasta was flavorful and cooked al dente. The sauce was spicy but not overwhelming.,Had a really great lunch today at this restaurant-- Food terrific- Atmosphere Great,"CATFISH LEVEL: 1/5: Looks good, tastes amazing I really enjoyed this place! From the moment we walked in the staff was very nice. I was very indecisive on what drink I wanted to try (they had a few special cocktails), and the server was super patient with me and recommended the watermelon margarita, which was absolutely delicious. It had fresh watermelon juice and really blew my mind. We ordered the chicken parm and fried calamari.The fried calamari was nicely fried and had a nice squid flavor without being too fishy. The chicken parm was amazing! The chicken was nicely deep fried and wasn't dry at all. The sauce had fresh tomatoes in it which added to the texture and flavor of the pasta. It was also a really big portion, and I had enough to take home and enjoy a second meal the next day. Overall, this is a great place to try in the Fidi area. I'm not here often, but I definitely would be seeking this place out again.","Made a 6 pm reservation for a party of 4 on a Wednesday. I arrived a bit early but they were still able to seat me first. I was going to wait for the rest of the party to arrive before ordering drinks, but then the waiter mentioned they had an all day Wednesday special for a $5 pilsner, so I went with that and it was light and refreshing. We all skipped apps and decided to go straight to the mains. I went with the classic spaghetti and meatballs, which I really enjoyed. However, I don't think it was worth $24 for a basic pasta dish like this. I tried my friend's spicy vodka rigatoni, and really liked that as well. Again, not sure it was worth $22. Another person had the squid ink tagliarini, which tasted super fishy. Service was great - everything came out timely, and  both the hostess and the waiter were super nice. I think this might be a spot intended for tourists and Wall Street business people, and that's why they can charge such high prices for pasta. Even their happy hour ends at 6, so who can make that call time besides people who work nearby, and/or people who are on vacation? Don't get me wrong, most of the pastas taste great but you can definitely find the same great quality elsewhere in NYC for much cheaper. That being said, I'm glad I got to try Sauce and Barrel but I probably won't be back.",Sauce & Barrel
697,"Good quality of food. Plates are too small for what you pay for similar restaurants in the area and similar Spanish restaurants. Their menu lacks churros as a dessert.They include a mandatory 18% tip (N), and we were only a group of 4. They didn't tell this ahead neither the waiter gave us a heads-up when handing the bill.I'd not come back again, and the trick of the tip was sneaky, trying to get double tipping on top of the already included one.","Good quality of food.

Our server kept taking the plates out from the table even though there's still food in it without asking. We feel like we were rushed because they were busy. Disappointing!","God damn, fucking amazing. Croquetas were legit, clams, shrimp, deviled eggs, and skirt steak, was amazing... artichoke salad- artichokes were great, the greens for the base wasn't to pleasing- vegetarians would probably love it.Dessert was amazing.Setting, is laid back, casual, and candle lit. I enjoyed.Sangria, was also great. Nice tiny spot.","Cute, narrow tapas bar in Chelsea. The front room is very charming but can't sit many people - I came here for dinner with my family (party of 4), and they sat us in the spacious back room. We eat a lot and ordered quite a few things on the menu: Very good: crispy artichoke salad (even my teenage little brother, who barely eats a vegetable, admitted this was good),  patatas bravas, shishito peppers, ham croquettes, grilled octopus, chorizo, gambas al ajilloOkay: serrano ham, pan con tomate, lamb skewersNo: crispy fish with lemon [this is a bunch of tiny little fish, which tasted dry and over-fried]Service was okay, although there was a long gap (like... 35 minutes) towards the end of our meal where no food came out, and then we suddenly got the last few items we ordered all at once. Would be a fun date spot!","Adorable little tapas spot on the west side. Not many seats available so I would probably consider making reservations for busier times. We got the gambas al ajillo, torrijas, patatas bravas and bocata de lomo adobado. These were all delicious, especially the bocata! They had this frozen watermelon drink with tequila that was also pretty tasty. Service was quick too. All in all, good vibes here. Will come back again!",Tia Pol
698,"I tried a few items at The Quarter, each with a varying but never super positive degree of enjoyment:Oysters: several options ranging from $1.50 (Blue Points) and up on a Saturday night, which is definitely not a bad bargain. Exactly like you would expect oysters to be served.BBQ Lamb Tacos: thought these were just ok. The flavor was good but they were super soggy and messy to eat. Calamari: ouch. They were so incredibly chewy and the breading way too salty. Some of the least satisfying calamari I have ever had. The smoked paprika yoghurt on the side added nothing to the experience, but then again it was already doomed. Had high hopes for The Quarter but the food didn't deliver. Nice staff and pleasant garden, but highly doubt I'll return.","Came here for Sunday brunch. Ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and a smoky mezcal bloody Maria.  Having just arrived home to Brooklyn after a week in Utah, this combo warmed the soul and healed a palette dulled by ultra bland Zion food. Definitely will be back.","I used to love the wine bar in this space so I was excited to try a new restaurant. Our general chicken in steamed buns came in cold buns.  The mushroom toast was ok but needed salt.  The fish and chips was really disappointing. The fish was chewy. I'm not sure how you make that happen. Now I love fries as much as the next white Irish descendant and these were not edible. They were steak fries that were lukewarm. The service was spotty.  We had to ask for water, plates, check. Overall it was a disappointment.","My husband  and I quiet satisfied with our dining experience in The Quarter that we accidentally found on our way we back home from BAM (Brooklyn Academy of Music.  We were seated  at the back yard where the table surrounded with beautiful plants and  ivies on the wall with a retractable roof that can be useful for every seasons. I gues they only need more and better lighting to keep the beauty of the atmosphere   The menu wasn't that complicated and I guess everyone can find what they like for their taste. We have told about specials and tried fish cake served with a special mustard lemon sauce. It was very crispy outside and soft inside. Flavorful and fresh which is important when you eat seafood. Mussels and frites fairly filled full with good size of mussels. They used to serve it with pesto and thank to God they had it still. Manager was super kind and helpful as well as the rest of the staff. Great place , worthy for every penny.","I was so excited to try this restaurant but was not allowed in because I had my service dog with me, and the owner insisted I show ""ID"" for her. I explained to him that, by law, service dogs are not required to have identification - in fact, the only service dog identification cards available are from for-profit online businesses that are not in any way affiliated with a government agency. He kept insisting on seeing an ID, but when I asked him what license he actually wanted to see, he just said he was busy, ""didn't have time for this"" and went back inside. So unfortunately we had to leave... but fortunately Mullanes was right nearby and happy to have us! :)","This place takes reservations on opentable. You have to walk downstairs from the street to go inside so it's a bit in the basement of the building. They have a large outdoor area in the back that seems to be great for reserving for an event. I came here on a very hot day and the AC wasn't strong enough. For brunch I ordered eggs and fried oysters. I usually don't see this on the menu so it was refreshing to have this option. The eggs and toast were all very mediocre. I think the toast was literally white sliced bread. The fried oysters were very good and they gave you a good portion of it, not just one or two. It's near the C train in Fort Greene and in a convenient location. The waitress was very nice.",The Quarter Brooklyn
699,Unfortunately not even nearly the same quality compared to the the best of its days. Unfortunate.,Came back for another go of this iconic pizzeria. It was a lengthy wait for another disappointing slices. Both slices were nothing special and overly greasy and heavy. The staff however are amazing and kind. It's good pizza but not worth waiting 1.5hr for 2 slices,"Do you like BURNT crust pizza? Well this is the place for you. You pay five dollars for a burnt pizza. I ordered 2 slices and it was a total of 15 dollars, are you kidding me? I asked the guy why it was so expensive for just two slices and all he did was shrug his shoulders and say I dont know. There were rats crawling around the place (thats disgusting). The tables and floors were filthy like it was never cleaned for months. The food was way below standards, there was no quailty to the food. All i could taste was burnt bits. Everything was burnt to ash.The staff has no respect for their customers, and treats them like garbage. I love eating pizza but this place is THE worst place to eat at.","Many have trekked to Midwood, Brooklyn for this pizza, and much has been said about this pizza. I had it for the first time tonight and boy, is it perfect. It's light, crunchy, and thick enough, all at the same time. The crust is reminiscent of a cracker, but also crunchy fried bread that feels as if this is the standard by which all pizza should follow.Once you've got the crust down, the other ingredients, the cheese, the sauce and basil, are all perfect. It's $5 a slice, and worth it. Place has been around forever, and it's worth trying.","Di Fara is well known for its slices and line. Its the most well known written and spoken about pizza in Brooklyn. The pizza artist is an older gentleman by the name of Dom but when I found my way it seemed the younger generation has taken over. I had two very expensive slices of pie.One topped with cheese and the other with dried cherry tomatoes.  The cheese slice is the "" New York"" style hand tossed bendy slice,crispy crust. Very travel friendly. The square slice was deep dish the thick crusty,zesty sauce and cherry tomatoes and not so travel friendly. Two slices cost me $12.  And let the beautiful letdown began....Was it the best slice ever? No. Have I had better locally? Yes. Thankfully it was a rainy day in Brooklyn and I didn't deal with a line. 10 minute wait at the most. Go to DiFara for the experience, the journey and walk or drive in Brooklyn. Please don't go hangry because you may have a wait.","Came here after a trip to Coney Island. Got here around 4:30pm and thought the wait time wasn't going to that bad. Boy was I wrong!The restaurant bit was closed for a private event so we ordered through the little window in the corner. The process was straightforward until they told us it was going to be a 40 minutes wait. We decided to go ahead and wait anyway. They took down our name and order. No payment required at this time. We were told to come back within 40 mins.We came back at 40 mins wait and was told it was almost ready. 15 minutes later we were still waiting. We eventually got our pipping hot pie after 1 hour and 15 minutes of waiting. Luckily there are three seats right at front which I sat on and waited and waited.  Excitedly we picked up the pizza and was told there was a cafe two doors down where we could eat the pizza which was pretty convenient. The pizza was definitely fresh and delicious. It does taste different to all other pizzas I have tasted. The base seems crunchier and the actual pizza itself seems saucier - in a good way. I definitely enjoyed the pizza and devoured every single bite.Bottom line is:Would I have it again? Absolutely YESWould I make a special trip out to buy it? No, not unless I am in the area Would I wait over 1 hour for it? Absolutely NOTHalf and half pizza was $34. Individual slices start at $5. The restaurant is cash only.",Di Fara Pizza
700,"The food wasn't bad at all and pretty authentic! Genuine rating 5 stars for the food. But negative -4 stars for the service. I had no complains about the dish I ordered: Shrimp basil which is on the lunch special menu. But instead I was served green curry. It was fixed right away after I told the server they brought me the wrong food. My friends were almost done with their plates by the time I got my food. I decided not to leave a tip because I wasn't content with the service: besides getting the wrong offer, another female server took away my fork I put aside but still using...... though she gave me a new fork from the adjacent table...... it still felt weird. Furthermore, when I was leaving as I didn't want to get in an argument with the guy server, he was being mad confrontational and wanted to know why I was ""upset"" aka didn't leave a tip?

Bamboo sprouts are also great!Don't really like the Pad Thai.... but my boyfriend said that it tasted good....,"Thai Market has awesome lunch specials from 11:45-3:30 pm. For $9.95, you get an appetizer and a main course. I'm glad this place is nearby.For lunch, I opted for their Curry Puff and Pad Thai Noodle. Curry puff was really good! The sauce that came with it was full of flavor; it complemented really well with the curry puff. Pad Thai Noodle was just okay. It wasn't anything to rave about. I thought something was missing as it was a little bland. Maybe it was just an off day since my bf who had it before said it tasted a little different this time.However, for the price and portions, it's definitely worth it. You won't leave hungry. Food wasn't terrible and service was fast. I'll be back to try other dishes.","Straight up the best Thai food in NYC. We had some Thai friends in town. I was nervous to take them to a Thai restaurant, knowing that they have really high standards. They LOVED IT and raved about it. They were surprised at at some of the dishes, which are very authentic Thai, and hard to find in the US. We ordered about seven dishes. All amazing. The skirt steak is a must. Perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked. Thai Market is a gem.","I needed a place to grab a quick lunch. Thai Market popped up, so I decided to give it a try. I showed up right at 12pm. It took a few minutes to have someone take my order. I got one of the lunch specials - gra prow kai dow. It's got chicken, rice, pepper with a fried eggs on top. I also got a side of steamed Thai dumplings. I waited about 15-20 minutes for the food to come out. Portion sizes are large and the food is very good, especially the dumplings! They have this slight sweetness to them - sooo good. Solid spot for take out - I'd come back.",Thai Market

All of their amazing Japanese sushi selection (grilled squid, sushi Saba) are not available past 11pm.   There was a lack of transparency about that.  .  .

It's not like it's some dingy place in Chinatown, so imagine how many customers they lose because they only accept cash. I was just lucky that I had enough cash in my wallet because I almost never carry cash on me. The waitress recommended me their most popular udon, which was the shrimp tempura udon. The reviews for this place aren't bad, so I wasn't expecting a lot, but they managed to completely disappoint me. The shrimp tempura was, quite frankly, disgusting. I'm not sure what batter they use or where the shrimp even was, but I basically got a plate full of fried batter. Shrimp nowhere to be seen. The udon broth itself was way too salty. The noodles were overcooked and mushy. I ate two bites, paid, and left. I do not recommend this place. I will not be coming back again.","I got the karage udon and I thought that the udon was good (if you like soft udon noodles this is the place to go). The broth was good but a little salty and the karage was okay only; I wouldn't recommend it as a topping. If you like your toppings crispy I would ask for it on the side bc they put it in the soup. I would recommend the nabeyaki udon, which is what my dad got. My mom complained that her soup wasn't hot but she thinks it is because she got kimchi in hers.",Can here again! Ironically got the same dish without realizing haha. The kimchi udon is still bomb and agree with my previous review. Just wanted to add some new tips I learned this time around: - They accept most credit cards but do not accept Discover - The whole party must be present or they won't seat you,"Great soup place for a those cold rainy days. Can here for lunch with some coworkers. It's surprisingly larger than it appears on the outside. We didn't have much of a wait even though we came at prime lunch time. It's good for small parties of 4 or less. I wouldn't recommend bringing more than that unless you want to split up. In addition to udon, they also have curry and and rice bowls. I got the kimchi udon because I LOVE kimchi. The udon had the right amount of chewiness. The broth was relatively clear but still had good flavor. Great place to heat yourself up as winter comes around the corner. Price wise the average bowl I'd say ranges from $12 to $15 depending on what you get. The bowls in my opinion and small to medium size so if you're super hungry you can get a combo which comes with a small bowl of rice with meat/veggies for an extra couple of bucks.","I've been frequenting Udon West for many years now, and must say it never lets you down. It's the perfect place for a warm bowl of udon or curry. While all their dishes are simple, clean, and straight to the point, I recommend their classic nabeyaki which has shrimp tempura, some chicken thighs, veg...spinach/mushrooms, perfectly runny egg, and bouncy udon noodles. The dashi broth is homemade and incredibly comforting. Whether it's a cold day, not feeling well, or you just need a hug from the inside - it will certainly hit the spot! Note: can get very busy during peak hours so go early/late or be prepared to wait",Udon West Midtown
702,"You'd think at 2:30pm on a Wednesday you would be able to sit at a 4 top with your 5 year old when the place is over half empty.   Not,  reserved for the possible 4 individuals who arent anywhere to be found.  Bad service always Trump good food.","worst experience ever. horrible service and not care about to provide (at least) a good experience. i used to go there, but after the way me and my friends were treated, i have no intention to come back, at all. if you are looking to have a good time eating in new york, be aware where to go. just, dont go there!","Food is great but they DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE!!!! Where is the manager or owner of this PLACE???? Do you know your girls choose to NOT ANSWER CALLS IN THE EVENING? Very annoying, as they just let it ring and ring and then place on HOLD and never pick up. AS for the food...It is amazing!!!!!!","Cheap, delicious, easy! Pio Pio's food is always on point and doesn't break the bank. There are several locations and I've been to two of them, the one in Murray Hill being my go-to. The actual restaurant for this location is small and if you go at prime time you can expect a wait, but if you order pickup it'll probably be ready before then.Whenever we go, we usually get the Matador Combo. It's a great about of food and can easily feed 4 people. The sangria is delicious too!","I usually order from the ones in Queens, this was my first time of trying this location. Overall the food tasted good. However, I find the ones in Queens to be better. I ordered a large Jalea which was good. The calamari and squid was delicious. The fried yuca it came with was delicious as well. I also ordered a whole chicken meal and it came with rice, beans, salchipapas, and tostones. The tostones were flavorless. Everything else was good. We also ordered a spicy ceviche. I always order ceviche whenever it is available at any restaurant, but this one was a disappointment. The ceviche was LOADED with fish. There was only 3 shrimp in there. For $22 the portion was a small container and half of it not seafood, the rest was basically fish which really sucked. The side sauces were good and delivery was quick.","It's chicken. You can get a rotisserie for $5 at the supermarket. This place sells it for $42. Yeah, this has got flavor, so it's not the same thing, and the table sauce (jalapenos, pepper, etc.) was good, but Yelpers are sometimes too dramatic.I got the lunch special, $12.50 for a quarter-chicken (breast or leg), plus $1 avocado, $1 soda. It comes with one side (rice and beans was a bit spicy, yucca good too), and a fresh tomato/lettuce plate that I boxed for dinner with the other remainders (put Italian dressing on it and it was delicious).Service was friendly and the decor pleasant enough. The tables are small but not unmanageable. I don't want to mark it down to 3 stars, but this isn't food you can't find elsewhere. The portion size was definitely enough for me.",Pio Pio 7
703,"Review time kids!When in NYC what does one do when they're hungry? Refer to our fellow yelpers!  The bride and I with the boy are here for a college visit. After that, time to explore! Being we are off our home turf,We decided to get a little lost and try try something out of the ordinary. Man I love a good expedition too!  We hit this place on review stars alone, I am glad we did. This place is pretty cool, although a little dark. Decor is old warehouse crossed with record shop.  On to the chow! We ordered wings,ribs,shrimp prawns, glass noodles, and street corn...yeah we are taking a cab back to the hotel! Star of the show? The wings! Absolutely amazing,super crispy but not over cooked in their house sauce. The rest of our meal was killer too! Service was nothing short of spectacular also. Our overall experience is what earns this place a coveted 5 stars! Pro tip: cash or American Express only, but there is an ATM on sight.","Nice vibe and has great music. Menu: Asian Fusion - Korean fried chicken and galbi (pricey). Service not so great. We weren't greeted when we came in, waited for a while and they weren't very busy. The server got our order wrong. We ordered hot&spicy chicken but got the soy chicken. We told the server and instead of saying taking accountability of giving us the wrong order, she shrugged it off. She left went to the kitchen and instead of bringing us the correct order brought us the spicy sauce to put it on our soy chicken ourselves. That to me is unacceptable.","DO YOURSELF A FAVOR & JUST GO.Ambiance, service, drinks, decorations.... just endless list of things they do right.I didn't get to try the food, but the two drinks I ordered (and the two I tried that my friend ordered) were not only beautiful but also delicious.On my way out, I was holding the little flowers that came with the drink... and the guy near the flowers/flower shop section stopped me and made it into a small bouquet for me. SO TOUCHING.FYI they only take AMEX & cash, but they do have an ATM. They're also open as a cafe during the day.","My friends and I showed up to Monomono at 715 last night, and the place was basically empty. By the end of our absolutely delicious dinner, it was packed to the gills. We definitely did take our sweet time, though. Oddly, they only take amex or cash, so beware of that. There's an atm but don't know about fees. Honestly, a really, really beautiful space. Decked out with plants everywhere--allergy prone folk beware--and it really looks amazing. Behind the bar there are a ton of jars of soju. Had a beautiful affect. So the food. Get the wings. Just get them. They're expensive. It's worth it. Crispiest wings I've ever had, and I have had a decent amount of Korean fried chicken. This rivals the best, and the sauce was awesome. We also got shishito peppers, which were, ya know, shishito peppers. They were good. The Kalbi was excellent, as was the fried rice with bulgogi and CHEESE. Pricy but the food was really good and it was quiet enough for us to all hear each other which is pretty tough on the LES.","Cool interiors.  I thought the service was great, but our bartender ignored my male friend. They serve Soju, beer and wine.  Loved my drink and they surprised us with a nice chaser.When it came time to pay they only wanted to accept Amex or Cash.  I asked if we could pay someone with Zelle and eventually they let us pay with whatever brand of credit card we had on us.  The person sitting at the bar next to us became really upset that he couldn't do the same.Last I checked AMEX merchant fees or more than Visa.  Based on the payment drama, I won't be back nor would I recommend it.  It's NYC, I'm 2019, stop trying to only take cash to avoid paying taxes.","Some mixed feelings here but I'll start with the food:*The food comes as its ready which in theory isn't all that bad, but we had a particularly bad experience with it, which I'll detail down in service*Grilled Octopus: This was delicious, I really loved the gochujang inspired sauce.  My biggest problem was that there was SO little. It was one tentacle for $22 dollars. No other food on the plate*Bulgogi fried rice:  A clump of fried rice topped with generous amounts of mozzarella cheese and not all that much bulgogi. The flavor was a bit blander than I expected and honestly again just not enough protein for the price*My friend got the grilled chicken salad. This is worth noting because the 'salad' was just lettuce and maybe one or two pieces of tomato with the chicken. no veggie variety at allAmbiance:* The space is to die for.  Some of the tables are inside of picture frames of a record library. Some people are eating on a grand piano.  I'd *definitely* recommend popping in for a drink just to appreciate the decor. That said, we were right under a speaker and it was way too loud.  When I walked back to the rest rooms, the noise level was much more reasonable so just bad luck on our part.Service:*This was the zero stars part.  We were seated right away and asked to eat quickly bc they were seating us before a reservation, which I totally appreciated, but nothing about the service helped us achieve that goal. My issues: - we sat and ordered drinks.  My wine came right away, my friends beer did not. We reminded him twice about the beer, friend finally got it 30 minutes later. The beer was still on the tab at the end of the night-After our drinks it was a real challenge to flag the waiter down to order our food. -We also couldn't flag anyone down to get more water, I ended up getting up from the table and grabbing it ourselves-my food came out reasonably quickly. one friends food came probably about a half hour later, i was done eating at this point.  but the real cherry on top was the salad order.  when all of our food came out but the salad, we asked and were told 5 minutes.  25 minutes later, we finally got the chicken salad.  obviously the waiter forgot to put the order in, but even the 'rush' order took forever.  So from order to salad receipt it was about 90 minutes, and guess what was still on the bill?! The salad! They didn't fight me when I asked for them to take it off, but come on guys.-Last issue is that they only take cash or amex. There is an ATM in the back but still total lame sauce.So to recap - beautiful space! overpriced food - TERRIBLE service.",MONOMONO
704,"A 3 is average right?  It wasn't great, it wasn't terrible, it was fine.  That is how I would describe my meal at Chez Moi.I ordered the steak and frites and my partner order the skate.  What made each dish fine and not delicious?  Everything was one noted, I guess you could say.  The one note was salt and luckily it wasn't over salted but a second note of herbs or fat or something to make it more than a boring piece of steak would have really made this a 4+ star dining experience.  My partners dish was more or less a piece of fish and potatoes.  There was no magic on the plate.  No wonderful layers of acid and fat and fun dancing together, just fish and mashed potatoes.I think simple dishes run the risk of being uncared for because they don't take much concentration to prepare, unfortunately,  doing that, you end up with boring, uninspired food.","Reservations for four people were made for 9 o'clock.  After 40 minutes of waiting for service and repeatedly asking the hostess for a waiter, we got up and left.  As we exited, the hostess and all the ""staff"" just shook their heads with a mumbled ""sorry.""  Never ever had we had such a shameful experience in a New York restaurant.  I sincerely hope the owner of the establishment is reading this review.","Service is non existent. Hosts seem indifferent and their job stops at getting you seated. Clear that no manager or owner is present and it's sad that staff absolutely does not care whether or not you get serviced.  Service at a restaurant can make or break your dining experience and unfortunately this restaurant disappoints.  How difficult can it be to get a waiter take your order on a busy Saturday night? Sad to say we never got to find out. After over 30mins of waiting and asking several staff members for a waiter, I along with the group I was with had no choice but to leave the establishment with a few ""sorry's"" from the host being thrown our way. Shame as this place looked promising upon initial entry.","Our favorite spot when we're in Brooklyn. Great salad and risotto. Friendly staff, nice ambience. Definitely recommend.","I'm on the fence about this place between 3 and 4 stars.We shared a brunch at the bar with the chicken sandwich and fries.The fries were some of the cleanest and best I've ever had.  So good in fact, I had almost finished them by the time the ketchup arrived that I asked for 10 minutes ago. I like it when the order comes, already cut and split on separate plates when you tell them you're sharing.   The chicken sandwich was pretty darn good too, but the portion was just ok. (even if whole)I love the ambiance but wife isn't a fan of French wooden bar stools.  I say they cradle my butt nicely.  To each his/her own.It's those drink prices that kick the bill into high gear.  If you're having 2 drinks each, and sharing, you're still looking at $80+ tip.  In the world of sustainability, I don't find that sustainable.  If you're rolling in it...or bypass the booze, I'd recommend it in a minute.   Otherwise, keep strolling Atlantic avenue.","A lovely Bistro in the heart of Brooklyn heights with delish food and good Service. We shared several appetizers which were all yummy my favorite was Smoked Salmon with Creme Fraîche, Capers. The smoke salmon as this gal from Brooklyn would call lox was excellent cultivated perfectly with a nice soft oily texture. The oysters where my second favorite starter very creamy just awesome. My main dish Skate fish over purée lima Beans, with veggies. The fish tender flaky and the veggies medley was flavored perfectly. My favorite phrase To describe my feeing I had a fun party in my mouth.  My dessert was incredible, cream Brulé  perfecto yes another grand party in my mouth. I will for sure go back to restaurant bravo my friends. Oui oui.",Chez Moi
705,"I haven't written a review for this place because I don't want you all to know about it, but alas there's always a wait so I guess what harm could it do now.1- Cash ONLY.  BUT it really is shockingly cheap so if you forget this you might still be ok with whatever you happen to carry in your wallet lol2- ALL VEGETARIAN- Thank you!!!!! 3- Very cool vibe. The place is big enough to be intimate but also have a group come in. The decor is all Ethiopian themed and the wait staff are always niceI could literally eat Ethiopian food all day every day- probably don't go alone bc its a more interactive type of cuisine as you eat with your hands and the injera, but damn its soooo good.",Came for my cousin 26 Birthday to try something new. She been her numerous of times. I enjoyed the Ethiopian food for the first time. It's always good to try new things and be open to new food. We didn't make it in time for the coffee ceremony but everyone speaking very highly of the coffee ceremony.,"Incredible food and organic wine, incredible atmosphere, incredible staff. Just go here!","As someone with embarrassingly little knowledge about Ethiopian food and culture, I can only say that the food here is incredible, the ambience is divine, and it's cash only. Bunna (aka coffee) ceremony every Wed and Fri at 6pm, Sat and Sun at 5pm. If you participate you get free bunna! Any coffee shop should definitely try the origin of their favorite drink.  They offer both Ethiopian beers and a handful of domestic craft beers.If you're alone, try the Meal-size Beyaynetu $14, your choice of 5 entrees in small portions over injera.  If you've ever eaten Indian food with naan, you'll get the hang of nomming on this delicious cuisine.","A happy, energetic environment to enjoy an Ethiopian feast on a Wednesday night. There was a 20-min wait at 8:00PM for 3 eaters. A live band and music playing were an added bonus to our meal - maybe every Wednesday is live music?Our trio had the two orders of sambusas, 'feast for 3', a bottle of pinotage, and finished off with baklava. Recommend 'feasting' so you're able to try all the dishes they whip up, with some rotating out seasonally. The rolls of injera flatbread were a perfect vehicle for picking up the nine dishes (they come in little mountains on a MASSIVE feast platter) - bouncy, tart sourdough to net the rich savoriness. Shared piece of baklava was a sweet ending to the meal.","K.C. and N.S. and I came here after a foray into the Bushwick climbing gym Metrorock. K.C. had been here a few times before and thus recommended the platter for two. Apparently the platter for three was more than enough food for a group of 5. So, we got the full combination of nine different sides made up of all sorts of things, collard greens, ground lentils, beans, pickled veggies, etc. The platter itself was served all at once and had a repeat of the sides on each side of the plate. It helped save us from having to rotate the dish. The fermented flatbread to pick up the sides was, as you'd expect, a little sour (I believe its actually sourdough based) but not so sour as to upset your stomach. We did end up needing an extra side of bread but it was well worth it. So why 4 stars? Ethiopian isnt my favorite cuisine but it was well seasoned and had a nice balance of flavors. Additionally, when I've had the flatbread in the past, I've gotten upset stomachs quite quickly afterwards. The bread here has a nice balance of flavor and fermentation which added to the dishes and made it easier on my stomach. Will give it a try again in a few months!",Bunna Cafe
706,"I mean this is my favorite new place in NYC. I just recently went for dinner and everything was incredible. Every dish, the atmosphere, transported my bf and I back to Paris. The steak tartare, the salad, and the octopus are incredible. We also had the hanger steak for an entree and it did not disappoint. Highly recommend if you're in LES !","I am sorry, but this place is not Zucco and I didn't realize this wasn't Zucco anymore.I have eaten here several times before when it was still Zucco and now it Le French Diner.If I would have known this before I decided, I wouldn't haven chose to come here for dinner with W and F.I got escargot and F and W never tried it and this place is the second time I had really bad escargot. It was super bitter and had a weird aftertaste. I was disappointed, because this made F and W wary about trying escargot ever again. Grilled Octopus - Are you freaking kidding me, the price of this was like $20 bucks I believe and they gave you two tiny little tentacles and it wasn't good.Grilled Mussels - they were served cold, this was actually decent.The hanger steak was better than the other stuff, but that's not even saying much and W ordered Medium and got rare.The only thing that I really couldn't stop eating were the potatoes that came with hanger steak, which I believe were potato au gratin.Really disappointed that this place is no longer Zucco, didn't know this until yelping this right now.But I knew something was different after trying their food, but now it has been confirmed.",Exceptional in every way.Great food - freshly prepared in front of you.Atmosphere - small cosy restaurant run by a French couple.Wine - small selection but all 3 bottles we had was great.Service - second to none.Favourite restaurant in NYC to date!,"This place is just perfect - great food, great wine, super hip. Hate to let out the secret, but I want them to survive, so yes: you should go here.","This place is amazing and one of the best French restaurants I've been to. It's extremely cozy upon entering (looks like it sits maybe 15-20ish people max?) and they don't take reservations. They also don't have paper menus but rather write it on the wall. This place offers fewer but is extremely focused on each dish making it that I don't think you can go wrong ordering any of them.We ordered the squid and the duck confit and grilled squid which were both amazing. The duck confit was my favorite as it was so tender and just melted in your mouth. It wasn't too salty and was cooked perfectly. The squid was also excellent and the sauce was the perfect complement. Although, I thought this dish was a little less filling and little saltier. Overall I would highly recommend trying this restaurant. It seems like it might be newer but I can see it getting pretty popular. The cozy and dim ambiance makes it great for a date night. The wait is worth it and honestly will probably be less than an hour unless you go at super peak times.","3 stars. 3.5 for food, 2.5 for service. Came here on Valentines Day with some friends and I think the man at the bar was a bit overwhelmed by the impending rush because he was a bit on the rude side to my group. It was hard to get his attention to order a drink when I first walked in and there was barely anyone sitting down yet. We ordered the escargot, octopus and duck confit to share. Escargot tasted a bit fishy if that is possible.. a hard pass for me. Wasn't a fan of the bread they provided either. The octopus was better but my friend got a piece that was tough and she didn't like. Duck confit was definitely the best dish of the night..  close to a 4.5 dish but the other food brings my rating down.I don't think I would be back after my experience but the steak looked good and I would probably get that instead of my first two dishes if I had to go back.",Le French Diner
707,"Got it delivered as room service, so greasy and it smelled funky !!!  What was that smell ?Really bad, so disappointing cause the hotel is awesome !!!Stay at the Ludlow just don't order room service.","Disappointing.We came here for brunch and were thoroughly unimpressed. The service was good and we loved the 80's soundtrack playing in the background but we came for the food.We had:- Charcuterie -  practically​ inedible. The pate was horrible. The meats were greasy. - Pancakes - basic- Omelet​ - average- Granola parfait - my daughter wouldn't eat it after the first bite.For the price, I expected more.","Well it is snowing and sleeting out- awful weather - and the lobby and bar of the Ludlow Hotel is filled. So, wet and cold we (4 of us) make our way to the bar at Dirty French for a bar stool and a drink. (The dirty French is just beyond glass and metal doors off the lobby.)BUT. alas, the snooty manager ushers us out ( He's annoyed.) because the restaurant is closed and opens in 10 minutes! Not 30 minutes or an hour but in 10 minutes. BTW The staff is flurrying around and the bartender is behind the bar twiddling his thumbs. So, cold, wet and being guests at the Ludlow Hotel, we get kicked out because we don't want to break the rules do we?  Whatever you do, don't break the rules at this restaurant! No exceptions------- even if you are freezing!!!!!","Decided to check this place out for brunch after hearing many good things. I was pleasantly surprised that we were able to get a last minute reservation on Opentable on a beautiful Sunday. Here goes: Service was a 10/10. Hostess and waitress was friendly from the get go. Everyone also gets a free pastry platter to share and I really enjoyed it. It tasted like heaven, especially if it's the first thing you're eating after an evening out.Food: check my attached photos. If I had to rate it overall, it'd be a 7.5/10. My avocado toast and croissant was just aiight. Pancake was good!Ambience: nice looking place with spacious seating, attached to a hotel with more seating in the back. Just so happened that there was a live band playing when we were there. It was so loud, I nearly ripped my ears out. We had nowhere to move, and I was too hungry to leave. I like that they have the windows open to the street when the weather is warmer. Gives a nice Sunday breeze vibe to it. I'm all about the vibez. Verdict: Pretty solid brunch spot good for last minute reservations. Just call ahead to see if there's live music or else your hangover headache might begin at brunch.","Came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary dinner, probably had a 4.5 star experience. Loved the ambiance, lots of chandeliers and flowers. The back wall was lined with white skulls/sculptures of sorts. While it was a more upscale restaurant, it was also more casual than I would have imagined. Wasn't a huge fan of the cocktail menu, I don't like dark liquor and there were only two drinks with clear liquor. I asked our waitress if it would be possible to substitute the alcohol in one of the drinks and she came back and said the bartender wouldn't be able to do that without any explanation, which seemed strange to me. No ""it wouldn't taste good with the substitution"". The complimentary house bread was phenomenal. Kind of tasted like a scallion pancake/buttery naan. We were huge fans. For appetizer we started with the tuna tartare, it has lots of fresh herbs like mint and maybe lemongrass, served in a crepe which also kind of tasted like a scallion pancake. The crepe itself was crispy and flavorful, but a little on the oily side. The tuna was fresh and the sauce was great. My boyfriend had the steak frites which I loved. Steak was juicy and tender, fries were thick and delicious and the peppercorn sauce had a great kick. We thought it was a little weird that there wasn't a great sear on either side of the steak. I had the duck which was a super generous serving (probably the biggest I've had). The skin was crispy with a nice layer of fat underneath, and the actual meat cooked to perfection. I did find the sauce a little too sweet but my boyfriend was obsessed with the duck and said it was the best he's ever had. The little chive plants on top helped cut the fat/sweetness a little. I thought it was really interesting that a lot of the dishes seemed to have an Asian flair to it. Overall it was quite a delicious meal. However, while the restaurant seemed very over staffed (tons of servers, hosts, etc) our service was not super fast. With the price of the duck, I would have liked to see some side with it rather than a al carte as well. But we still had a great night and if you're looking to eat somewhere a little on the fancier side, dirty French isn't a bad choice.","Very cozy spot, fireplace included. Fun people watching in this extremely decor-ed lobby lounge/bar. The IG influencer-mountain lodge-hipster Colorado chic decor fills every last inch. It does all go together and it makes for a lot of fun conversation starters. There's just a lot of it. The outdoor patio seemed really gorg and also had a signature jasmine-like scent; yet another thing I would usually make fun of but that works here. The patio was closing when we rolled in around 11pm on Sat FYI though.Drinks were good and strong at a standard price for the area of between $15-20. Server was very attentive and friendly.",Dirty French
708,"The food was bad, not compared to an Iranian dish. Very low quality. We tried four stews: Gheimeh, Fesenjan, Karafs and Alou-Spinach, non of them tasted like the Iranian version. The rice was low quality too and the guy poured yellow colored liquid on he rice which wasnt Safran nor Turmeric. The Ash was OK. The place was dirty and felt so bad to eat. Not recommended.","Inside the restaurant is disgusting. For the sake of your own health avoid using the restroom it is extremely dirty. The Ash-reshte soup was ok, however the stews were really bad. One of the stews smelled really awful, it appeared that the stews were cooked few days before. The rice was not good. The owner put some color to rice which is suppose to be saffron but it wasn't!!!! It is very pricey for what you get! I am amazed why authorities let this restaurant stay open! It has serious health safety violations!!!!!!!!!!!!",The place wasn't clean! The clothes of people who worked there were super dirty as well! I'm Persian and none of the food that I ate there tasted in the way that they suppose to! The rice didn't have a taste at all!! I'm surprised how the reviews of this place are so high! And it was so pricey! It was by far the worst Iranian restaurant that I tried in the US.,"If not being dragged by a friend, I probably would never notice and try this gem. This spot is hidden inside of a Pizzeria and who would think of go to a pizza place for Iranian food?I barely have any knowledge about Persian food, nor the geopolitics of the region. But after eating this delicious meal, my mind started spinning. Why does Iranian food look and taste so different from the food of other countries around? Why does Iranian food remind me Indian food among Asian cuisines?  The whole culture and country are so interesting and I want to travel there one day, simply because the food is so delicious! Here is my lunch box with both Kabab and shrimp with vege. Everything on my plate tastes great and so favorable.","A really great place that tucked away. They have a very limited menu and the decor is not fancy at all, however it's your classic hole in the wall spot. You can tell the food is an authentic take on Persian Cuisine because you don't see any mainstream dishes. For instance, we have chicken with Pomegranate and Walnuts, this was literally my first time NOT having Pomegranate as a stand-alone fruit. The dish tasted unique and I enjoyed it as it was unlike anything I've had before. The dish was a little sweet but tangy at the same time.That being said, the cost is super cheap and you get the decor you pay for. The server worked hard to ensure we had a great time but you could tell they needed more help staff. This place reminds me of a classic establishment that is sadly past its golden age, probably because of the age of the owner, and no one there to pick up the mantle. It is reminiscent of something withering away with time and lack of continued investment. All this means is I feel the need to go again while it lasts.",The food was ok!! It wasn't THAT great. Restaurant is not too clean. The person serving us was super super slow. Took 15 mins to pour 3 plates and 2 soups from the pots for us. One of us got the food and waited for the rest of the group. 15 mins later we paid and all of the food was cold. Our Kabob was all oil and salty. None of us in the group ate it. Full of oil.  Extremely expensive for what you get (a 2-3 star food) 3 combos and 2 soups came up to $70 dollars. I was shocked. I don't know why so much hype!! Definitely not worth $70 for 3 people.,Taste of Persia
709,"To preface this review, I want to say I had really high expectations for this place, because it had over a thousand reviews and almost five stars!! Walking in, the restaurant was extremely dark--it was hard for me to see where I was walking. The space was literally lit by a couple of dimly lit ceiling light fixtures & also tiny candles on the table. Not exaggerating when I say this is the darkest restaurant I've ever been in.Service was a little weird, it took almost 10 minutes for us to receive a greeting & another 15 minutes to take our order. By the end of our meal, the water jar on our table was empty and no one had come to refill it (probably cause she couldn't see it was empty bc it was so dark lol). We decided to order the Hell boy & the Neffy's Porkpie white. I expected a stronger honey taste from the Mike's Hot Honey, but they definitely could've added more of that sauce! There's another place in dallas that makes a similar pie & that one is sooo much more flavorful. On the Neffy's Porkpie, the sausage was really bland and did not have a spicy, salty flavor. Would recommend the Hell boy over the Neffy's Porkpie if I had to choose again. Overall, the flavors weren't very strong and didn't mesh well together--it felt like something was missing. My neffy's porkpie was also a little too burnt for my liking. The dough, however was delicious!Overall, this place is a lil over hyped & would not recommend the trek all the way to greenpoint. There are many places in Manhattan that are a lot better!","I got the neffy pork pie white. It was tasty. The hot honey was a great touch although I didn't get much spice from it. I don't want to show my own ignorance but the ""point"" of the slice was so thin, I had to flip it up to eat it. It was also very wet. I'm not sure if that is normal. It was an extremely tasty pizza but I could have easily put down two pies with little difficulty. Expect a pie per person if you come here.","Went here recently with a party of 4 close to closing time on a Saturday night. The waitress was rude and rushed us out despite taking out order before the kitchen closed. Of course the pizza didn't come out until after the restaurant was technically closed. The waitress carelessly put the pizzas on the table, rushed us with the check and took away our plates before we were even finished. We understood they were closed but why take our order if you're plan is to just rush us out? The pizza was definitely mediocre for NY standards, overrated and overpriced. There are better places in the area and in Williamsburg that wouldn't be so rude. Not sure it's worth the trip to Greenpoint.","Hands down, right up there with some of the best pizzas we had ever tried in the city.My wife and I came by at around 6pm on a recent Sunday afternoon and we had heard that waits here can get pretty long since no reservations were allowed, so we immediately went inside and put our name down on the wait list. In addition, besides the no reservations policy is that they don't take down phone numbers, so you have to present when your name is called or you will lose your spot in the line. In other words, be back before you think your name will be called or either just sit tight and wait it out.Luckily, we only were told that our wait for 2 would be 30 minutes and low and behold, it was almost spot on. We had already done our homework ahead of time on what we wanted to order so we were ready to rock and roll. However, for the newbies out there, they don't do much else other than pizza. They serve a few salads and soups for appetizers, but seriously if you're going to wet your beak with a salad, you might as well order one of the vegan/vegetable pizzas because they will come loaded with the highlighted toppings. But like I was saying, besides the soups and salads, all they do is straight up pizza - non-vegan or vegan - and they don't allow for any substitutes on the pies so they come as they are listed on the menu. Honestly, that was music to our ears because it took a whole lot of thinking out of the equation for us.Don't judge us .... but we ordered 3 pies between us 2.To be frank, we weren't starving, but there were so many choices on the menu and so little of us, so we decided to go all out here. Also, there was so much hype behind their pizza we couldn't just try 2! To add to it all, the table next to us looked at us like we were crazy when 3 pies arrived, but it was all good because we thoroughly enjoyed them.Here's what we ordered and my quick thoughts:HELLBOY (Fresh mozzarella, Italian tomatoes, Berkshire soppressata picante, Parmigiano Reggiano, and Mike's Hot Honey)- Their most popular pie, according to reviews, and we can definitely see why. The soppressata picante (not pepperoni) was amazingly delicious. The oils from them soaked into the pizza, which made for a incredible soft crust. Overall, the crust for all of the pizzas were super thin and enjoyable and I'm typically not a crust lover. However, what really put this pizza over the top and, in our eyes was one of the best we ever had, was the Mike's Hot Honey. That little bit of sweetness to the pie was a unique touch and an excellent addition to it because just when it felt like we knew the pie after the first bite, BOOM, it took my taste buds in a different direction.CHOP'T 'TIL YOU DROP (Sliced cremini mushrooms, NUMU vegan mozzarella and nut-free kale pesto from the kitchen of Chop't Creative Salad Company)- We never tried any of the other vegan pies before, but the Chop't 'til you Drop was heavenly. If this is what vegan taste like, sign me up. The kale pesto mixed in with the mozzarella and mushrooms was amazing. There was so much flavor in this pizza from all of the ingredients and everything really meshed well. Although the Hellboy is the fan favorite, don't sleep on this pizza because it was ridiculously delicious.NEFFY'S PORKPIE WHITE (Fresh mozzarella, Berkshire soppressata picante, sweet Italian fennel sausage, fresh basil, post oven ricotta dollops and Mike's Hot Honey)- This pie was probably our least favorite of the 3 and that's not to say it was bad, but it sort of reminded us of the Hellboy mainly because of the soppressata picante and hot honey. If we had tried this one first, yeah we might have had a different impression. With all of this being said, it was solid, but I would have preferred more of the sweet Italian fennel sausages on it and less of the ricotta dollops, which there was too much of. In addition, I felt that the ricotta dollops sort of got in the way with its ""mushy"" texture.To veer away from the pizza, the service here from our waitress was a little blah. Everything was a bit rushed in terms of how she served us and she didn't exude much friendliness, especially when we received our food. I don't recall a simple ""Enjoy"", which is customary nowadays. Call me sensitive, but things like that matter in the dining experience. However, I'll still award 5 stars for the food because the pizza was just that damn good, especially the Hellboy and Chop't 'til you Drop, and the lack of amicable service in no way was damaging to the point it warranted any less of a stellar review.","Great NYC pizza joint! Pizza enthusiasts speak of this place amongst the best in New York and it doesn't disappoint. The wait list for two was about 1.5 hour on a Friday around dinner time, but we were able to snag two seats at the bar almost immediately. Great service and food but I took one star away for the drink. I ordered the Manhattan which was served on the rocks and strong but lacking in balance and a bit ""watery"". We shared the ""Ricky Ricotta"" composed of Italian tomatoes, sweet Italian (VEGAN) fennel sausage, Pecorino Romano, fresh ricotta dollops, baby arugula, spicy honey (added), and extra virgin olive oil. The crust is divine- chewy, charred, and flavorful with just the right amount crunch. The vegan fennel sausage is killer (light and delicious, the texture and flavor are perfect). I didn't care too much for the spicy honey and wouldn't choose to add it again. Overall a great NYC pizza establishment with awesome service, I can't wait to return!","Highly regarded by pizza enthusiasts as some of the best pizza in New York and we were fortunate enough to come try it this past weekend. My expectations were sky-high for this place and after we left, we determined it was about 85-90% as good as we thought it would be. We ordered the famous Hellboy pizza with spicy honey and soppressata and a ricotta pie; with the latter getting the edge as my favorite of the two. The hellboy pizza with the honey, was a tad spicy for my palette. I wish i could give this place 4.5 but alas, yelp doesn't yet have that function. Truly quality pizza establishment in Brooklyn, and some of the best you''ll have the good fortune of eating in NY.",Paulie Gee's
710,"The 3 star rating is an average broken down into 2 experiences. 5 stars for my first two times here. José was an EXCEPTIONAL waiter! My bottomless mimosa glasses were never less than halfway filled he kept them coming, gave us great suggestions for the menu, provided a great, fun atmosphere and even let us pick a few songs lol! This was about last year.I decided to visit my beloved place once more with 3 other friends and for lack of a better the experience THIS time was.. embarrassing. To be fair, this time I came at about 3:15 PM instead of my traditional brunch hours, so it was a bit dead (very low music/ really nobody else in there). No worries, we'll make our own fun! My goodness... had to repeat our drink orders 3 times to the waitress, and her suggestion for the lamb burger (we ordered 2, along with fried calamari and a pizza which weren't bad) SUCKED! The burgers were burnt, we had to get McDonalds afterwards because it was that bad, and we're not a picky bunch. We didn't say anything - fine, this is out of her control. Now the part that sent me over the top was she failed to mention her shift was over at 4 PM, and as soon as she took our orders provided us with the first of our ""bottomless mimosas"", that was the end of her waitressing skills. I had to go up to her THREE SEPARATE TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF 45 MINUTES TO GET A REFILL. And when I did, no ""I'm sorry! Let me get that for you!"" No hustle, nothing. She had the audacity to seem annoyed, finished sending her text, and slowly waltzed Over to the bar to ask the bartender to make me another one. And to add insult to injury, at about 4:05, she walks right out the restaurant! Lol as if she doesn't have an active table?? Why wouldn't you say ""I'm passing you over to so-and-so, have a great day"" so I atleast know not to have bothered you? I understand everyone has bad days, but this was flat out disrespect. It was HORRIBLE from start to finish and my final experience at Mezetto, which is a shame because I really used to love it here/ talked it up to my friend group and made a fool of myself bringing us here. I left $60 poorer and 100x more pissed off.Also side note - the red sangria someone from the table ordered tasted awful. It literally was red wine with 2 pieces of fruit.","Didn't even eat here. Or drink here. Tried ordering a flavored mimosa and the bartender/server was soooo rude! Apparently he told us which flavors they had available, however I couldn't hear him over the blaring music, so I tried ordering a flavor that was listed (passionfruit) on the menu (that I was provided). His response: ""We don't have that.""Me: ""Oh, ok. What flavors did you have?""Him: ""The ones I just told you!""And he laughed nervously while I got him told. Oh I was livid! I explained to him that A. I couldn't hear him over the music and B. that the flavor was listed on the menu -- you know, the one that he gave me! What a complete a$$.Walked out immediately after that. Never to return again!","The worst ever! Food sucks and service is a joke. How could you mess up eggs and potatoes? Since when we have to clean the table to help the waitstaff! Especially with auto gratuity at 20%...My advice, change for another industry because food and hospitality is not for you. Disgusting time. I should give my money to an homeless instead to this thing called "" restaurant ""..","COME HERE FOR BRUNCH! Make sure Jose is your waiter!!! If you do, you are sure to have a great time. My friends and I were looking for a bottomless brunch on a Thursday. We found Mezetto who offers brunch and bottomless mimosas daily! Jose greeted us warmly and from the time we sat down to when we left our champagne glasses were NEVER empty. We were there for a bachelorette party and even got some tequila shots. I got the Mezetto breakfast which had eggs, hummus, pita, quinoa and some other yummy trimmings. Food was very good. Do yourself a favor and do not drive to this brunch (not that many people do in the city?) bc drinks are flowwwinngg. Also, the lighting here is bomb for pics.","I'm VERY generous with reviews... I honestly don't know how this place got four stars.I'm honestly being super generous w/ one star.One, they're EXTREMELY overpriced- THREE ricotta jalapeño ""poppers"" were $19. It was fried ricotta over jalapeño skin- with a sauce.They were TASTELESS- even the sauce! There was NO spiciness.It was a MONDAY AFTERNOON- Rosh Hashanah to be exact.THEY WERE OUT OF THE LAMB BURGER! WHAT IS THAT!!! A Mediterranean restaurant w NO lamb? I should've known to leave then.I got the ""Beef Kebab Shakshuka"" but replaced the beef w/ chicken.My partner got the mushroom omelette.EVERYTHING WAS BLAND. Flavorless! Eggs were overcooked, my plate was tomato sauce with no spice, the chicken and ricotta had the same texture... just horrible.Even the hot sauce I asked for was bland!The only thing that saved my meal was the tahini sauce. The mimosas were also very strong (passion fruit was my favorite). The pomegranate had NO TASTE!You can obviously tell the type of crowd this spot pulls in.This is the first Mediterranean restaurant whose food had NO TASTE.Our server Marco never asked how our food was nor did he check up on us.He was on point with the refills, though. Not to mention that the kitchen staff had staring problems.For $114 for two people (before tip), I was extremely disappointed. I'll never be back. Don't waste your time or money at this place.",Came here for bottomless with some friends and we were seated right away even tho it was a Saturday !! The atmosphere was great and our drinks were always topped ! Everyone working at Mezetto was really nice and they were even pouring drinks for us after our time was over. The food was great too I had the grilled cheese. Unfortunately I thought it would come with tomato soup or tomatoes ... but overall it was delicious.,Mezetto
711,"HEARTBROKEN to learn the Gorgonzola sandwich is no longer on the menu, this was always a go to favorite of mine, nothing else like it anywhere and there aren't really any mains for me here anymore :( The callabro moz sandwich is great if you're into a tangier flavor but it's just not really my bag.","I was really delighted to discover this spot hoping it'd become a regular watering hole, and I was perfectly willing to pay a little extra for what are legitimately overpriced but decent craft beers. But there is no way I'm returning to an establishment that continues to employ bad staff. Patrons beware of the curly haired female ""bartender"" - this chick will very sullenly ignore you in a nearly empty bar and then screw you over on change when she finally serves you. I politely called her out on it and she had the balls to refuse me the proper change and claimed she withheld extra cash for ""tax."" What the f*ck? I've lived in NYC for a decade and even this was a new one. Other people on Yelp have complained about this chick but this place continues to employ her. Cool! Say goodbye to what would've been a new regular, as well as the dozen or so people I was planning to bring here on a weekly basis. In a city with so many options, this petty BS is not worth a return visit.","Mediocre craft beers and thick breads with salty, decadent cheeses, this place is a nice concept at a decent price point which makes it all the more disappointing to have to dock a couple stars for the indifferent if not mildly hostile service experience that I encountered this week. An unexpected concept for the neighborhood as one walks in and can almost imagine that they've teleported to a dive in Williamsburg or the East Village, almost. The annoying part was that on Wednesday afternoon, the server saw me waiting for many minutes before she took any new orders and then proceeded promptly to ask someone who had just sidled up for their order without acknowledging me. . . . It gave me the impression that she didn't want my ... kind of person patronizing the place. Luckily, the other gentleman notified her politely that I had been waiting first and she sullenly took the order and eventually delivered it to our table.","I found this review in my drafts, but I definitely intend on leaving the review!I lived on the UES for a summer a couple years ago and really loved this place and I have fond memories of Earl's! Both the beer and the food was good, and people (the staff and the patrons) were always fun and friendly which was nice for someone who had just moved to NYC and didn't know anyone yet. Definitely worth checking out!","You may wonder why there are two cloves of peeled garlic in your savory Beer Cheese (New York State cheddar cheese spread with toasted bread). Yup, those are for rubbing your toast. I accidentally took a bite of it, and nobody would want to talk to me that night because of my breath. Lol. Great starter!Bread Pudding was pretty amazing too -- a must try besides their craft beers. They also offer a lot of IPA in cans. I kept hearing Finback while I sat at the bar.","Pretty good hole in the wall place not too far from Mt. Sinai hospital main campus. I went during the day and it was very slow but apparently it gets crowded later in the day. Beers on tap, games like Jenga to bring to your table. The food was not overly greasy like what you would normally expect sandwiches like these to be. My fav was the Calabro Mozzarella sandwich, which was cheesy and surprisingly sweet.",Earl's Beer & Cheese
712,I was able to book a reservation the day of and I have absolutely no regrets. The omakase was incredible and the anikame was incredibly buttery. I recommend sitting at the sushi bar so that you can see the chefs prepare everything. Definitely would come back the next time I come back to New York (I'm from San Francisco),"Was very disappointed in my experience after reading all the rave reviews.The prices were fair enough, as many other Yelp elite members can attest. Same with the food- it wasn't the best sushi I've ever had but it was decently fresh and tasty.My main problem was the service. Not one person working there cracked a smile, from the hostess to my waitress to the bus boy. I usually try to give everyone benefit of the doubt but when I tried to politely ask a few questions regarding the menu and the food I was met with a huffy replies and eye rolls of annoyance. Would have given this place one star, but the food warranted an extra star.","B team working tonight. We've eaten at Yasaka over 100 times and it has historically been great. Tonight's dinner was terrible- the lettuce was old and rotting, the jalapeño in the yellowtail jalapeño hand roll was half an inch thick making the roll so spicy it was inedible, the shrimp head from the botan ebi was cold clearly having been fried hours ago, the spicy tuna had too much mayo and roe seemingly trying to mask old fish (it did not taste fresh). We complained to multiple people who did nothing. Terrible food and terrible service- they've lost a long time customer!","My favorite sushi in NYC so far! We fell in love with their lunch section and have already been there twice in the same week! Their Miyabi lunch has an impressive selection of items and includes salad or soup as appetizer, rolls, and sashimi including tuna, salmon and yellowtail. A random musing but their sushi rice is my personal favorite out of all the sushi places we have tried around the country Everything was very fresh and For the price and quality this spot was incredibly tasty and affordable. Aside from the above They also have other lunch combinations with sashimi or sushi rolls only. We have brought our friends here and recommend it highly!","I'm a big fan of Sushi Yasaka. I've always been able to make a day of reservation, the food is great, and the price point is excellent for what you get. My SO usually gets some variation of sashimi, and I always get the lunch tray with the 'tofu steak' (it comes with a roll, three dumplings, a spring roll, and either miso soup or salad) which is excellent and only $16. It's quite a but of food so I generally have enough left over for another small lunch. I haven't tried their fish but my SO thinks it's good quality. He says there's better sashimi in the city, but for the price you pay here it's excellent. Service, noise level, ambiance, etc. are all good as well. Overall a great spot for Japanese food on the upper west side.","Honestly, just look at the picture and then realize that is only $26.50. Such quality fish. Everything was perfect. Next time I go i want to try some of their hot food and entrees. We got the Ika Yaki as an appetizer and it was very good. So many things i can not wait to eat next!",Sushi Yasaka
713,Chicken and waffles - Burger with egg -Catfish and grits- .... (do not eat that biscuit) Drinks - does the job  Recommend spot for brunch !!,"Giving this 4 stars due to the vibe of the restaurant. Came here on a Saturday and the dj was pretty good. I wouldn't recommend this place for a large brunch as ITS VERY SMALL. I will day that the unlimited mimosas and bellinis get the JOB DONE. So if you're looking for a place with mediocre food but a way to get a little drunk, this is it.","Was pumped to come to this restaurant. It's been on my list for quite some time. I'll keep this review short, mirroring the service that was provided; rushed and unwelcoming. Our waiter seemed to be annoyed by the questions I had regarding the menu options. I'm assuming it was the end of his shift. Since it was my first time, I wanted some kind of direction; failed to receive that. Waiter had also billed me for an extra drink that I didn't order and made it seem as if I wasn't telling the truth. My food was okay. I chose the chicken and waffles. The chicken had a nice crisp and seasoning to it. I believe my review and experience would have been a bit different if we didn't have this waiter.UPDATE: owner had reached out to me in response to this review which meant a lot. I'm going to ""re-do"" my experience the next time I'm in Brooklyn!",I love this spot! The bartender is always cheerful & smiling. The food is on point & I have yet to be disappointed. The drinks are pretty & potent. And the music is on point with different events going on all the time. You gotta love it.Nice bar all wooded out to boot. Diverse & fun & that's what's up! Come thru!,"My first experience wasn't good one thoughtful Sunday, but was recommended to attend on a Saturday night by a DJ. Glad I did & had a ball! Drank beer & whiskey, so not versed on the mixed drinks. It can get crowded but not overwhelming. Near transportation if you've had too many.","Came here as a group in mid July. It was great! The catfish was delicious but what really got us were the shrimp & grits! The sauce on the shrimp was perfect and the grits were 100%. Organization/seating could be way better. Patrons standing throughout the restaurant. Be prepared to sacrifice any breathing space. I'm not joking... you gonna be so close that it's gonna be inevitable that people's spit unintentionally lands all up in your food and water. I know ya know exactly what I'm talking about too smh. They try to squeeze in as many people as possible not taking into account that they don't have enough seats. The DJ's are amazing, the best music selection. Only issue is the spot is loud af because they have the music blasting to the point where you might start wondering about premature deafness. Don't you dare try to have an actual conversation during brunch. One of us ordered a drink at the bar where we were sitting. The Bartender gave us something entirely different but we assume it was because she couldn't hear us clearly over the music. Who knows. Regardless, my boyfriend and I left the place yelling that we found our new spot! For days we were tryna come up with excuses to come back ASAP.Fast forward abt 1 month: We went back at the end of August excited to order the shrimp & grits again and try the Endless Mimosas. Everything was terrible. The Mimosas left an aftertaste and might as well have been virgin Mimosas. The real disappointment was that they seemed to have changed up the shrimp & grits recipe or they got a new cook, who knows, but they were both NASTY. They changed up the shrimp sauce so it was milky and thick. All of our shrimp was over cooked. The grits were chalky and pasty. Hellll noooo.The waitress came over started cleaning off our table and grabbed our plates without asking if we were finished or saying anything--my boyfriend was still eating. There was clearly still food in both of his bowls, but she just grabbed them away. He tried to tell her he wasn't finished but the music was so loud that he literally had to scream it her even though she was standing right next to him. She apologized.Now on to paying for our bill... Meanwhile the waitress really tried to overcharge us by saying ""didn't y'all order a Riesling too?"" After that entire 20 minute meal we both looked at her like ""Really bih? You gotta be kidding yourself."" Yeah right, not after that nasty mimosa. They misleadingly say that they do a mandatory 20% gratuity for groups. But the truth is they do it no matter if it's 1 person or 2 person. We understand why now. The place is so relaxed to a fault when it comes to cleanliness and service. The hostess we had in August was leaning her elbows and arms on the tables while she was helping people.  Both times we went on a Sunday. They seemed understaffed based on how the staff was hurrying everywhere and they all seemed stressed out even the hostess. I can't even front we would've given this place a solid 4 stars and disregarded everything else if the food quality was the same as it was in July. July it was 4 stars, August it was a forced 1 star. Never in our life have we been in and out of a restaurant  so fast, let alone a Sunday brunch.",Sweet Brooklyn Bar And Grill
714,"It was ok. It's a quaint establishment that seats 18. Their ramen is just ok. We did come at 11pm, so maybe they were scraping the bottom of the barrel. I got the Tontoro. The pork belly was dry. I didn't even know such a thing could happen. Our waiter wasn't friendly at all, but I guess he goes along with the NY aesthetic. My husband got the spicy ramen and he barely put a dent in it. I don't have to come back.","Ordered the tontoro pork broth ramen. The broth was way too thick, or as they call it ""creamy.""  The noodles were soggy and took in way too much liquid already, or as they call it ""chewy.""  The gyoza was okay, but nothing special. We were told that there was a 30 minute wait when a table was clearing up and not a single other person standing and waiting. We took a walk and came back 15 minutes later only to see the exact spot was still empty since we went in the first time. Other than a very friendly waiter, there's nothing great about this place. I wouldn't call it authentic ramen.","Dang, I ordered the wrong ramen. Got the Shaki Shaki Spicy Ramen. Would not recommend. OVERLOADED with bean sprouts, as you can see from the picture. What I didn't realize was that it didn't come with any meat at all. It was just noodles and vegetables with some strange non-ramen-like broth. Very below average and definitely not worth the $20 I spent. Water tasted like tap water and wasn't even cold.Service was kinda bad. Super small place with limited seating on a Saturday evening ~7:30 pm. I waited almost 30 minutes for a seat for 1.Overall, I should've listened to the other reviews and gotten the Torigara ramen. Or even the Tontoro Pork would've been better. Ruined my dinner with the Shaki Shaki.","I recently re-discovered the joys of mazemen at this diminutive ramen joint.  Mazemen is generally overlooked by most ramen joints and it's difficult to find, compared to the more popular soupy tonkotsu ramen bowl.  But this brothless ramen, when done right, is every bit as satisfying, and even revelatory, especially on hot and sultry evenings. Nakamura, and its casual mazemen specialty outpost situated next to it, definitely does mazemen  right.  I ordered a jidori mazemen, which featured generous cubes of smoky, tender chicken thigh, batons of menma (bamboo shoots), spinach, handful of sprouts, some tare (sauce) and a very softly poached egg. Once mixed vigorously, the sauce resembled the texture of carbonara, and coated the noodle strands perfectly.  And on this hot and sticky evening, this mazemen bowl was the perfect meal for me.The chicken wings are also highly recommended.  Salty, sticky, a little garlicky, they are highly addictive, and a perfect companion for your frosty beer.",Let me start by saying that I love this place from jump. Nakamura is a ramen spot that must be enjoyed by all ramen lovers in New York and beyond. The spot is small but many of the restaurants in the area are small. The size of the restaurant is perfect for date night or perhaps a group of four. I enjoyed my delicious bowl of  ramen solo and that's ok too. The decor of the restaurant is pretty basic but bright and inviting. The staff is very friendly and from the very beginning they made sure to inform me of their specials and additions.  I'm one of those people who like spice and they delivered. My bowl of ramen had me sweating bullets by the end. I truly enjoyed my meal and I'm so looking forward to return in the next few days. Do yourself a favor and head over to Nakamura for what I promise will be a guaranteed treat.,"To start off, I was excited to come try this restaurant with my folks. We had lunch here on a weekday around 1pm. It wasn't crowded. There were tables so we were seated promptly. Our waiter came to take our order within a minute but my parents were still looking at the menu. Whoa..slow your roll boy! We ordered after a few minutes and while we were waiting for our ramen, the waiter was on his phone the entire time. Not very professional. Our food came and in all honesty it was nothing to write home about. Jidori chicken ramenChicken was dry and overcooked. Too much bean sprouts in the noodle and not much else. Flavor was average at best. Noodle was not al dente bordering on the mushy side. I paid an extra $2 for the egg which was not that tasty. Tontoro ramen My parents had that. Mom said it was too salty. I tried it and indeed it was. They weren't didn't particularly enjoy the paper thin slice of pork either. For what they charge, I would expect something better. Disappointing..but not as appalling as what I saw next...While we were still waiting for our food, the couple next to us asked for the check. The waiter gave it to them and they charged it with their credit card. They must have been japanese customers from out of town because the entire time they were speaking japanese. When they got up to leave, the waiter rudely said YOU DIDN'T TIP ME in front of all the patrons.!!! Not acceptable on any level! If you didn't get tipped, you should speak with them in private perhaps outside NOT IN FRONT OF ALL THE CUSTOMERS. My folks and I clearly heard him say it. The Japanese customers were clearly taken aback and didn't really understand what he was saying so he said it again and then they finally realized that he wanted a tip. Ok I get it..maybe the out of towners forgot but the waiter totally EMBARRASSED them and made them look a fool in front of everyone in the restaurant. Not cool at all. And then the customer tipped him and hurriedly left. The waiter looks at me in disbelief and I say well they don't tip in Asia..and he said well this is AMERICA. I get it. But there's really no need to be so rude about it. Maybe they didn't like your service or lack of service. And then he proceeds to tell me that the Asians and Europeans tend to do this. HELLO! I'm Asian and frankly speaking I'm thinking about whether or not I should tip you now that you're so outright rude!!**a quick scan of the space and there was not one japanese staff there whether it was front of house or in the kitchen and often times when a Japanese ramen shop or restaurant hires non japanese staff ya get the bad attitudes. Usually japanese staff are taught a certain way and the level of service is much better. Hmmm maybe that's why! One done. None shoulda gone.",Nakamura
715,"Butler is an upscale cafe. Killer food - my favorites being the breakfast empanada, avocado toast and anything sweet (they switch it up but have a few ""staples"" so you can't go wrong). The drinks stack up - iced green tea and coffee done well. The ambiance is airy and light. Weekday afternoons are a bit more quaint, come Saturday/Sunday it's bustling.","Just a quick update to recommend some more of their always-delicious pastries including:the peach crumb cakethe three cheese scrollthe morning glory muffin (really a cake)They also have non-baked goods like granola parfaits and even a salad on the menu I believe, but you would be remiss not to enjoy at least one baked goodie when you're there. There's now lots more outdoor seating, so go and enjoy before it gets too cold!",Meeting with a client and I yelped a quick coffee spot near me. The morning carrot muffin was amazing. The iced coffee not so great but doable. The service was not to good considering there was only one person in front of me and two people working but I still had to wait. I would definitely go back for the muffin.,"Such a cute cafe! We passed by thinking nothing of it until a second time cruising around Domino Park. And yes, if you want to stop by for a drink or a bite to eat, Butler is the perfect spot for you whether dining alone or with friends. It's quaint, cozy, and aesthetically beautiful. The colors and low-key vibes of this cafe is a plus for me. It can get quite busy, even on off hours because locals come here to work and chill.The drink selection is great, non-alcoholic and alcoholic. From baked goods to actual sandwiches, they have it all. The prices are a bit steep for a coffeeshop but the quality of the coffee was excellent. Not sure if there are outlets for electronics but there were quite a few customers on laptops using the wifi. The bathroom is well kempt and has a beautiful tropical wallpaper. There's a good amount of seating and table space as well. If you have your fur baby, you can order from the side window and sit out by the benches.Accepts card and cash. No Apple pay.Bathroom available.WiFi available.Outdoor seating available with places to lock up your bike. Drink up!","Lovely little bakery near Domino Park. I came by after a long afternoon of reading in the sun, and after some deliberation, got the sticky date muffin. I wasn't that hungry and wanted something smaller, but I also appreciate that a lot of their pastries are pretty big (like, bigger than my hand). The really nice girl at the register heated up my muffin and I ate it at one of the outdoor tables - the muffin was amazing. Really rich and buttery, but not overwhelmingly sweet. I really want to come back here and try their brunch or sandwiches!","Cool little place with a variety of tasty breakfast choices. Went with the oatmeal (v). A fantastic mix of raisin, coconut, walnut and apple (probably missing some additional ingredients) on a warm bed of oatmeal. Fantastic!Finished off with a fresh orange juice. Just enough for a light, healthy, refreshing start to the day.",Butler
716,"Excelent place to get the real feel for NYC ..  First time here, but the people, the feel, all the pathches make me feel right at home","I am staying across the street at the Marriott and walked over this evening for dinner with a co-worker.  Spent 30 minutes being ignored by the incredibly rude bar maid and staff - place was NOT busy.They get one star because minus ten isn't an option.Take a huge pass on this rude, unprofessional dump.","Just a basic, crowded pub. No issues, but nothing too impressive. I stuck with Not Your Father's Root Beer and sat at our uncomfortably high table and didn't order food, so it was just kind of an unremarkable experience. It was fine. Didn't spark much of an opinion for me either way.","This pub have seen its fair share of different emotions post 9/11. It used to be a hub for professionals who worked around WTC for cheap drinks after work hours. They closed when 9/11 happened as the crumbling of the towers shattered their windows. This place is literally down the street from where the twin towers used to stand. They closed for 7 months and re-opened to be that hub for workers digging around ground zero since then.Patches, badges, anything who have spent their time around ground zero covered their walls. This pub has turned into Ground Zero Pub of memories. Great selections of beer and they even have Guinness on tap. Locals have bragged about their burgers too. As you can see, I was swayed into ordering one even though I wasn't hungry at all. :| Visit them if in the area, get a cold beer and asked for their scrapbook detailing the events of 9/11",Great over all experiencegreat food great drinks AMAZING SERVICE! the staff is super friendly and makes sure everyone is taken care of! highly recommend!,"This place was right next to our hotel. Great place and amazing feel to the pub. Bartender was courteous and knowledgeable about the menu, history of the bar, and NYC in general. I got a burger and fries with my beer. The burger was delicious and fresh. My wife had the chicken fingers, just for a quick appetizer, but found out the portions are a lot bigger than an app. No complaints about that. The police/fire/military patches tacked to the walls really gives you a feeling of being so close to the 9/11 memorial. They also have a large book to see what happened in and around the pub when the attacks happened. Amazing",O'Hara's Restaurant and Pub
717,"What a disappointment! Wow. They asked my sister and I if we weren't their 'bottomless brunch' when we said no, they sat us in the front of the restaurant on high top tables.. rather in the back with everyone else. Cool. To start we ordered their bacon guacamole, which was not so bad. Probably the best thing we ordered. What we ordered: Short rib empanadas- OK. The outside of the empanada was soggy but the short rib was flavorful. Carnitas tacos- SADDEST TACOS I HAVE EVER SEEN. I wanted to cry. It was so blain, no color, they didn't add a lime to the side! It was the saddest tacos I have ever seen. For being a Mexican restaurant, you really destroyed these tacos. The carnitas wasn't even flavorful. The taco truck has better ones. Maya Benedict- let's talk about how ALL THREE eggs were NOT RUNNY, what an egg Benedict is suppose to be. My sister couldn't even eat it all because at that point it is so unsatisfying. Their bottomless brunch is worth the price, I get it. But that's if you are looking to just get drunk and not really care about that food. Thankfully, I care about the food.The service was alright, our waiter not once came to our table asking if everything was ok. The guy picking up our table was the only one who came over. It is hard to impress me with Mexican food, and Maya destroys everything about Mexican.","The food is bad, we waited 20 minutes for our bill, it's really loud, expensive, and it was really hot. McDonalds is a more respectable establishment than this","Placed an order from caviar and indicated that I was lactose intolerant and specifically indicated that my food could not have cheese. First they sent me an order loaded with cheese and then when I reordered they hid cheese between the sauce and tortilla. For those with dietary restrictions or allergies, I would avoid this restaurant like the plague.","We had a fabulous time at Maya. We got in just before the after work rush, which gifted us with window bar seating. Maya has a great cocktail hour, margaritas, and some house specials. We ordered small appetizers, queso fundido- con chorizo, y chips and guac. Very delicious. The ambience is a soft juxtaposition of moderna, casita glam, the front is the party and in the back is more intimate family style seating. They have a large selection of tequila and an amazingly attentive staff. Will definitely be back - I suggest go during happy hour and get the lounge seating up front, as they fill up fast !","Parking is complicated in this area but on sunday the chances of parking are better. They have bottomless drinks and small plates for brunch. That is super cool in my opinion. However keep in mind that the 2 hour bottomless starts at the reservation time, soooo u waste time arriving, getting seated and the time the waiter takes to come take orders and such, so we didn't start drinking for the 11 minutes.... soooo is not truly 2 hours. The decor is nice and rustic. Seems like they are running out of space tough.  It is all very cramped . None the less nice tables and legit decor. As this is a all you can eat and drink, they just keep bringing small plates with menu items and you can ask for extra or repeats as you go. CORN ON THE COB-cant mess this one up, so good,with cheese yummm, u could not have enough of those.CHICKEN TAMAL- pretty good and not spicy, it is good to try but not an impressive item. VEGETABLE EMPANADA- thisbe is deep fried with vegetables stuffed in, the empanadas are pretty nice, with to eat an extra batchPLANTAINS- nice and sweet, they come with cilantro and sour cream on top, pretty amazing. CHICKEN ENCHILADA- The tomatillo sauce is legit! Spice to perfection but I wish they had cheese instead of the chicken.CHILAQUILES- with a pouched egg and red sauce, black beans, the perfect amount of spicy these were by far the best dish I had here. Pretty awesome.  PORK TAQUITOS- this is the first time ever I could say I can feel and taste the SMOKE flavor in a piece of meat, they nailed it! I would just add some sour cream and this would be heaven.HUEVOS RANCHEROS- I was not really that impressed, it was kind of cold when it came to the table and the sauce was a bit bland. DESSERT- they provided a cute little platter of something I think it was French toasts with Nutella and banana as well as some pastries, that was a delicious finish.  Give it up to these waitresses and waiters and the entire staff, I have no idea how they keep up with this brunch service that is plate by plate rather than a huge buffet, I also give it to the owners cause this style of service keeps their staff employed.  I am very impressed.HOWEVER, overall this is a very busy and because if it, the food quality was a bit on the colder and blend side, the service was ok and I could understand that it would not be perfect as they were very busy, I wish they had more staff since their service style is very complex.I would not come back here only cause I am not impressed with the food.","Mediocre Mexican food at best. I came for brunch with my sister and to say we were not impressed was an understatement. Starting at the hostess table- we were immediately asked if we would be partaking in bottomless brunch and when we said no we were sat at the front of the restaurant that was separate from the crowd of people in the back. Without seeing the menu how can you ask people so early on whether they want bottomless or not. Also was disturbed that she was on her phone and not a good impression. They do a good job fooling the average American looking for Mexican food on 1st ave, but if you have any sense of what real Mexican food is supposed to taste like you would not enjoy. We started our meal with bacon guacamole with bits of chicharon. This was our first plate of food that came out with our drinks, margarita and aqua Fresca. Off to a good start because you can't go wrong with alcohol or guacamole. We then ordered a three small plates: empanadas, carnitas tacos, and maya Benedict.What was good: the empanadas. They were coated in a nice pico de Gallo and green sauce that was complimentary to each other and actually nice. What was bad: tacos and Benedict. Yes we were ordering off the menu al a carte and these were ""small plates"". I've never seen a taco smaller in my life. The taste was OK.  It was finger food size that can be consumed in two bites- if that. The maya Benedict was also OK. The poached egg was beyond over cooked. It was basically a boiled egg and for that it loses points for me. An egg is deceivingly hard to cook and this place can't ace it. Maybe this place is meant for you to enjoy and overly priced bottomless brunch and drinks so you get too drunk to have any thoughts of the food. The waiters and busboys were very nice and attentive. Would not want to blame them for the lack of taste in the food.",Maya
718,One star for ambiance. Mediocre food that's way too pricey for what it is. No clue how this joint thinks it can charge the price it can for basic food that doesn't even fill you up. Highly disappointing experience,I want to love this place because the food is fresh and the beverages are great but it's drastically overpriced (EVEN by Tribeca standards) and the service is horrendous. I've been twice now and both times waitstaff was rude and acted annoyed at the smallest requests for things like more water and a side of hot sauce. It took almost an hour to get our food (a salad and egg toast) and the restaurant wasn't full. I've been twice now and the experience was the same both times. I won't go back which is unfortunate since it's so close to my office.,"ordered breakfast roll , about 17 bucks (+tips).scramble egg was soft n smooth, not greasy at all, the spicy ketchep enhanced the flavor , take to the next level. mushroom was chosen instead of bacon, juicy as good as expected. the bun was average good.**a sat morning not so crowded, but no grass fed beef burger. n it takes 20mins to wait for my food.","Super cute and aesthetic little restaurant but it's packed and loud. The food was good, but not great.  The banana bread also isn't worth the hype. Good coffee though.","Before I start, if you eat here do not order the Bloody Mary. They dump in a ton of cumin and add no horseradish or anything bright to the drink. It tastes like a cup of chili! With the soggiest olives I've ever had. We sat outside and it was fine for a while, but then this lady sat next to us with a dog that SCREACHED at any dogs that came by. We kept moving the table to avoid the sun, but it took an hour and a half to receive our food, so the sun was behind a building by the time we could eat. I've heard jokes about $14 avocado toast but didn't believe they were true. A lady at our table ordered it and while it was good... it was a single piece of extremely hard bread with avocado spread on it. In what world is that worth $14? I ordered the Market Bowl with beef. It was a decent portion of food but it was so extremely bland that I had to add hot sauce to it. I will say the sweet potatoes are really delicious. That was $23.The 4 of us spent a total of $150 for an hour and a half wait. Bland over priced food. At a hot table. Don't waste your time with this place. It was our waitress's second day there and she was excellent, but she left and I had to walk in for someone to finally take my money for us to leave.","Another cute, healthy, sadly overpriced spot in the city.  However, the nicest gal was our server and the overall experience was enjoyable!! I got the pulled chicken sammy and it was good! I subbed the ciabatta bread for sourdough (because sometimes ciabatta is too hard for me) but the sourdough was super thick w a very hard crust so that wasn't the best move. I ordered the sandwich w avocado (an additional charge, ofc) and they forgot it so I was hoping I wouldn't be charged but i was. Overall, the food was good but not worth $20. But I guess eating well in the city will always burn holes in your pockets.",Two Hands
719,"I dined here for a friend's birthday only to find excessive hidden charges on my bill including an ""administrative fee"" that was taxed.... The food was mediocre at best with the corn gnocci bumping my rating to two stars. Additionally, I was upcharged for steak, but didn't eat or see a single steak entree on my side of the table. Further, I called management to inquire about these hidden charges, and the Event Sales Manager, Alex Jackson, picked up my call and was extremely rude in answering my questions. After spending $3,000+ at Simon and the Whale and an additional few hundred at their rooftop bar, Broken Shaker, I was extremely disappointed with the level of customer service I received when I had questions about my bill that were reasonable. I regret dining at this restaurant and hope that my review will encourage others to dine elsewhere especially for large groups.",If I could give this sh't hole zero stars I would. They told my friends pregnant wife she needs to sit down after they refused to serve her table because only 3 of the 4 were there. I've never experience service this bad.,"ROACHES! I typically don't write any reviews on restaurants, however this experience was so poor that I wanted to inform anyone planning on attending this establishment about my experience. While finishing up our meal we had a roach run across my desert plate. The busboy came over and  killed it right away but our waiter  did not apologize, and still made us pay for the meal minus drinks and desert. We left feeling disgusted! So surprised to get treated like this in a supposed ""quality"" restaurant like Simon & Whale.",One of the most delicious and beautiful beet salads I've had. The service was great and so was the food. Highly recommend this place. @traveleen_gurl,"Wow. I just had the most delicious experience in quite awhile. I came here for dinner last night with my hubby and we were blown away by both the food, the ambiance and the service. The scene reminded me almost of a hip, library type den with trendy music playing in the background. My husband ordered the smoked mussels to start, and for our entrees, I got the heirloom eggplant dish and he ordered the squid tagliatelle. Both dishes were impeccable (I didnt try the mussels, but he loved them). The heirloom dish had a unique sauce and was surprisingly very filling.  I wish I could eat it every night for dinner; it was seriously that good. The tagliatelle was also tasty, but was a bit richer; definitely a dish that you'd need a full appetite for. We also ordered the black bread...we tried it because most reviewers seemed to love it, so we thought we'd give it a try. Note: it was mehhhh... I would skip it if I were you... it's not really worth the $6 and extra carbs. All in all...my dinner was amazing. I will of course return. The desserts looked divine!","I've been here three times now and the food here is just okay. The service is good but the smoked mussels are what keeps me coming back. The fish sandwich is probably the best entree on the menu. It's not outstanding but definitely tasty. I also enjoyed the red snapper crudo but it did taste a little fishy after a few bites. I've tried a couple of the pasta dishes too...I don't remember the names but one had seafood and the other had chicken, both were extremely salty so I would steer clear of them. I think this place is worth trying once because the smoked mussels are that good but you can find better seafood at this price point at other restaurants in NYC. Also, don't order any of the cocktails here. They were so bad I had to dilute the two that I had with water. If they weren't so pricey, I wouldn't have bothered drinking them at all!",Simon & The Whale
720,"I've been here long ago and their food has remained consistently good. Upon my latest visit, the restaurant ran out of bread. Went for the Vegan Paella instead, and I wasn't disappointed. (Very large portion too). Service was fair. My biggest gripe was the restaurant smelling like vomit! I noticed the smell when I walked in, but it kind of subsided as I walked to the back. I soon realized the smell was due to the nasty rag they are wiping down the tables with. Holy sh*t, when they cleaned the table next to me, I wanted to throw up!","This review would have been five stars because of the good food but I gave it a three because of the poor service! I visited for the first time this weekend based off a friend's recommendation. The water glasses were extremely dirty and had lipstick stains on them. After we asked to have our glasses replaced, the waiter seemed to forget about us and we didn't get a glass of water until 20 mins after. Then we noticed one of the knives on the table had jelly on it. So either they are not washing the dishes properly or the table wasn't properly inspected before we sat but either way we were over it at this point. We were served our food (which was good) but our waiter did not check on us not once while there. For a first experience, the service was poor. Don't know if I would return again.","IN THE BEGINNINGI used to Love this place they had very good food, cheep prices and delicious frozen Sangria. I was a recurring customer for a while I would be in there every other 2 weeks, which is nuts because I live in Staten Island so making that drive just for food means that I really like it. My first couple experiences here were great! The food tasted fresh and the staff was so friendly and outgoing and that's what I normally look for in a restaurant. I would always go in and have the skirt steak dish and my fiancé would have the Lomo slatado.WHEN IT STOPPED BEING A GOOD EXPERIENCE So I would say about my 5th time here things weren't as good. At this point my fiancé and I had a routine where we would order our favorite dishes. This time the meal was Okay, it didn't taste as as good for some reason not sure why we just remembered we weren't as satisfied. We just wrote off this experience because we know that every restaurant has its bad days. We would continue returning and the experience just kept getting worst, the food wasn't as good and the staff weren't as friendly. I have a 3 strike system where after 3 strikes I just never come back and don't recommend the place.THE 3RD STRIKE AND MY LAST NIGHT AT BLENDBack in May, my fiancé decided to bring me here for my birthday because she know I love frozen sangrias. I was a little skeptical at first because the last couple of times but they hadn't received my last strike so I agreed. We were served by the server that took our table the last four times. He isn't very social and kinda just walks up to your table to take your order and that's it. That made the experience less enjoyable. So we went on and did our routine and order our normal dishes. The chicharones de pollo had a weird flavor this time, I couldn't put my finger on it. It just didn't taste right. Next came out our Lomo Saltado which came out pretty cold, i remember taking my first bite and the steak was pretty cold almost as if they just defrost it. The dish wasn't hot at all and the steak tasted old. It was just gross and I couldn't being myself to eat the whole dish. Next my fiancé ordered the chocolate cake with a birthday candle which was supposed to come warm, but it wasn't. The server literally grabbed the plate and plopped it right in front of me, didn't say ""happy birthday"", didn't play a birthday song and just walked away. It was the worst birthday dinner I've ever had in my life!!!My fiancé and I own a restaurant by the way so we always leave a good tip because we know server struggles. I've brought my family here so many time so the fact that they can't even remember who you are is sad. This place lost my business, my respect, and my recommendations. I don't recommend for anyone to bother with this place it's lost its touch and the service is horrible.",Got there with five couples no reservations because the other blend on the water frontMessed up our reservationThe service the drinks the food everything was great give them-five stars will recommend all my friends,"I took my boyfriend here for the first time and I have never seen him eat so fast! I think he's hooked on the well seasoned chicken!  We both had the pollo a la plancha (I think I'm spelling it correctly). The best food and service! Rico was very professional, attentive and friendly. He took the time to chat with us and stopped by our table to make sure we were good. I come to Blend at least 3-5x per year and always have great service and food!","We got there a little late, but they were accommodating since it wasn't packed. The hostess said after ten minutes they do give away the table usually so FYI. This restaurant is small compared to Blend on the Water. I accidentally made reservations here even though I wanted Blend on the Water. Oops. However, The decor was cool, light up menus and looks like event space or something since there was a big screen. To drink my husband had the frozen Sangria. He loved it and he said it was strong. Since I couldn't drink, They made me a virgin coconut mojito which was yummy. For appetizers we had the mofongo with beef and chicken and beef empanadas. My husband was ok with the mofongo but I didn't like it. Nothing like authentic Puerto Rican mofongo. If you know the difference, pass. If you don't try it and see what you think. The empanadas were good. I'd get those again. For entrees we ordered the churrasco and the ropa vieja both were good,We recommend. They both come with white rice and black beans. My husband ordered tostones, he liked them; said they were thin. He just said he preferred the garlic oil they give was on the side rather than poured on top. The presentation of the dishes were pretty. We are married so this is a good date spot for us with Latin music playing and ppl talking. If your looking forQuiet romantic setting this won't work lol",Blend
721,"We've been to other Westville locations and wanted to try this one that's closer to home. It's a bit off the path, but it's a nice large spot that's family friendly. The food was tasty and large portions. The hearty servings extended to the mimosa carafe - we felt bad that we couldn't finish it. Would go back again for a lazy weekend morning.","Not the best brunch ever. Mimosas were $11 each (?!?) and they put hot sauce all over my friend's and my avocado toast without asking, effectively ruining it. Our waitress never really checked on us and the inside is overall just dive-y.Skip.","This place is subpar at most. The best thing I had was the Mac and cheese. The burger was very bland. Ingredients didn't taste fresh. Worst of all was the salad. It was terrible. I thought maybe it was just a bad batch but the waiter brought me another and it was just as bad. The lettuce looked ""retired"". Service was not so good either. Don't expect the waiter to keep filling your glass with water. There are better options in the area at the same price point. I do not recommend this place.","Came here to grab an early evening bite and a beer before jumping on the night commute. The place was hopping which created a pretty cool noisy buzz, and the music was decent. The quinoa and artichoke burger came heavily recommended by the waitstaff, but unfortunately did not deliver as expected. The whole thing falls apart which makes it challenging to eat and it is sort of on the bland side, so you have to add mustard to make it tasty which is not ideal. The dish was saved by the amazing sweet potato fries which are pretty darn good. All this washed down with a good cold IPA beer and consumed in good company; that's what I call, a good afternoon.","So disappointed in myself every time I order this place. I need to remember that it's really not that good and it gives you bad indigestion within like 5 bites. Also, what kind of restaurant that has three different types of fries but doesn't have ranch?!? Weird. If you want a stomach ache from eating grilled chicken be my guest. Photos look better than the real deal. You're welcome for my honest post.","Yum!! Westville has earned a spot in my NYC food list. I visited last Saturday night after a long day biking and walking all over the city. I was exhausted, hungry, and not in the mood or dressed for a fancy NYC meal. Per my usual, I went to Yelp for food options and found Westville.I ordered a special appetizer of brussel sprouts, cranberries, and sweet potatoes with a balsamic drizzle. The portion size was very generous and the dish was absolutely delicious! I liked it so much, in fact, that I tried to order this dish again the very next day at another Westville location, but sadly they were only serving brunch at that time/no appetizers. I intend to try and make this at home soon.I added a piece of grilled salmon to the appetizer and for $8 I received a perfectly grilled piece of salmon. It was served medium rare, which is my fave preparation despite me having forgot to request it cooked any particular way.My fellow diners ordered the quinoa burger and cobb salad and enjoyed both dishes. The only gripe we could find to mention was the sad little amount of fries received, especially given the upcharge for sweet potatoe fries.Service was sweet, helpful, and attentive.Outdoor seating was available. Grea pricing, fresh food, and an emphasis on healthy options makes Westville a solid choice.",Westville - Wall St
722,"We came here with a reservation, as a party of three around peak brunch time during the summer. Service was prompt and efficient, and the food was excellent. Prices were about the same as other brunch places in NYC. I would recommend this place, but it wasn't so amazing that I am running back the first chance I get.",Iced matcha which is $6 had clumps of powder in every sip I took. My avocado toast was barely even toasted. What kind of toast is not toasted???,"The waitstaff are really friendly during Saturday brunch. Portions tend to run small. Presentation is good. Service is leisurely, sometimes crawling along. I ordered the shakshooka, left (less) hungry but not too interesting when compared to the dozens of other brunch spots, cafes in the area.","Great spot for a weekend brunch!Came here on a really hot day and it was pretty busy inside, so we were going back and forth on either waiting for a seat indoors or just take the heat outside. BUT the staff here were so nice they informed us that if we sat outside (there were umbrellas for shade) they'd be more than happy to throw in some free Frose! Couldn't turn that down so we went with outdoor seating. Once seated our server was the just awesome. She constantly checked on us to make sure we were okay in the heat and even got us extra ice for our waters. The owner/manager of Reunion was great as well. He would come out to constantly check on us and asking if were were doing well out side in the heat, he even brought us lemonade! I gotta say, service and staff here really made this a great great great experience and we haven't even started on the food yet!For our brunch my SO and I got the classic hummus: very smooth, clean/fresh taste, well seasoned and the pita that came with it was perfect. We also got the Lah'maajun: I really enjoy the lamb, very slight gamey taste, crumbled salty feta, a nice runny egg sitting on top laffa which was this really nice yeasty, chewy flat bread. So good! We got the Shakshooka as well, clean tart tomato taste mixed with a runny egg, and we opted the challah bread for pita, this dish was my favorite. And if that wasn't enough, we then wanted something sweet so we got the pancakes: light fluffy with fresh bananas and strawberry, topped withe syrup. Great finisher.Overall, amazing service, staff, and really delicious food. This is one of my favorite brunch spots!","Good vibes, live music, friendly service, and very tasty food. The presentation was great and the vegetarian options were able to be made vegan (all the ""in betweens"" and one entree). The portions were somewhat small, but that's what you pay for in New York. The live music was a little too loud for a small space, but otherwise it was great. Pictured below is the Egg-Plant, made vegan, which was excellent. After the food arrived, the server asked if we'd like pita or anything for two of the dishes, so we said yes. When we got the bill, they had charged us for it. While it was only $2, we didn't expect to be charged based on the way and timing she asked us. It should've been clearer that it cost extra, so more communication on that would be helpful in the future.","I came here somewhat randomly with a girlfriend after a different restaurant refused to honour our reservation. The staff was very attentive and we got seated without an issue. Overall the food was decent. It's definitely not worth venturing to for its own sake, but if you are in the area and having an issue finding a table somewhere (as you can in that area) then it is definitely a good option!Also, as an FYI I don't think they have a full liquor license.",Reunion
723,Food was good and filling. The highlights were the Brussels sprouts and the desserts. I found the KFB bites to be pretty greasy but tasty. Service was incredibly slow and it took several minutes for us to be seated even with an existing reservation.,Food was good and filling. The highlights were the Brussels sprouts and the desserts. I found the KFB bites to be pretty greasy but tasty.,"This is a very bacon-themed bar and restaurant, and pretty much all their dishes feature bacon in some shape or form. Some dishes on their menu are well made while others seem to be trying a bit too hard to incorporate this themed ingredient. Once you get past the gimmick, it's like any other sports bar with its many TVs and casual ambiance. They have a good selection of beer - one of the few places outside India I've seen that has Bira 91 on tap. Service here is friendly though a tad slow at times.If you believe that ""Bacon makes everything better"" then definitely come here and give them a try. But if like me you don't share the same over-the-top obsession with bacon that this place has, there's nothing especially fantastic about Bar Bacon. I'm neutral - three stars.","This place delivers!!I try to come once a month now because the food is so savory if i eat there more often i will look like a little pig. Staff if friendly, we often eat at the bar. I've had the Bacon & Beer Flight which is fantastic. The mac n cheese is delicious and can be had for 2 ppl because its sooo filling. Everything is just good overall. Only snag of this location is that there is only one bathroom and it's one of those sink is outside of the bathroom itself which is odd. Could use another bathroom. Everything else is great. Neighborhood is nice & doesn't get too crowded. Highly recommend.",I almost fell asleep after.

Both times we've been, the food's been disappointing, the service has been disappointing, and I find myself, on both occasions asking myself, what made you come here to begin with.The first time we came was back in January. And, I can blame that entirely on my husband. His BFF was in for a few days. They are both foodies, so Jayson lined up a series of places he spent time seeking out, that he thought would be fun, and a little bit on the gourmet side. How he landed on Juniper, I still don't know.We came for dinner on a Friday night before the theater, which if you've ever been to Juniper, is not the thing to do. They get a pretty loud and boisterous after work crowd (maybe it was happy hour, I don't know. We don't drink.) The place was packed. And not like a busy packed, but a really uncomfortable, loud and drunk people are bumping into me, and can you find our waiter, kind of packed, at 6 p.m.We ordered a half a dozen appetizers. They're all kind of forgettable. The food was good-ish, I think. Jayson seems to remember us all hating it. But, it wasn't really how it was described on here or their site. They're one of those trendy places that tries to make themselves seem worthy of three $$$, with trendy-ish sounding options, but then you get it and think, ""Is this Applebees?"" It wasn't that good. What really kind of annoyed me is that this huge restaurant/bar, which clearly gets packed, has ONE bathroom for hundreds of people. Anyway, a couple of weeks ago, I was trying to find a brunch spot. The previous two Sundays were epic fails, and I was determined to get Jayson a good Lobster Benedict. Now, I should say, I take the blame here. Because when we got there, and I looked at the menu, and that at noon on a Sunday, they are completely dead, I had us leave and go elsewhere. But, half way down the block, we somehow rationalized going back.For starters. There were two tables. One was pretty much midway through. Our waitress, for the most part, just stayed down by the bar talking to the hostess and the bar guy. We waited 15 minutes to order. It was pretty much consistent like that the entire time. We could see our waitress 150 feet away, but she didn't seem all that interested in waitressing. Seriously, I""m not sure what was going on, but she was disinterested and didn't check on us or anything. It was really irksome.The food was okay. It's not the worst, but not the best. Jayson described his Lobster Benedict, which he's been craving, as bland and tasteless. My burger was okay. But she brought me fries, when I asked for a salad. Then she brought the salad when we were done. But, she then charged us for it, even though it was supposed to come with it. Jayson asked to take it off. She did.Again, by the time we left, a third table was sat. A couple. The other table had gone. So there was only two, two tops. And still, she was preoccupied and not up where any of us were.I can't see going back. If I did drink, I don't see going back. I don't think I could get drunk enough to forget all the other stuff.","Terribly rude employees. I dine & drink at five star top rated establishments and was excited to tryJuniper as a nice place for drinks close by... the first time I went was with my boyfriend and the (female) bartender named corina denied me a drink.... I've never been denied a drink in my life, I am classier than this places potential and have never been denied anything let alone a drink. To sum it u chea","I went here for a work lunch. We were going to go to Asura, which has a vegan menu, but Asura had a Closed sign on their window for some reason (this was on January 3rd).I was worried because I googled Juniper and didn't see any reviews mentioning vegan options. I agreed to go, however, because I didn't want to be an inconvenience to my coworkers. They have a veggie burger that mentions feta cheese. I asked if the cheese could be kept off and was told yes, then we sat down.The waitress came by and said that, actually, the cheese is baked into the patty and so it can't be removed. I appreciate that my waitress checked and then let me know the dish could not be modified.In the end, I was able to make things work. I ordered a hummus appetizer that I shared with my colleagues. Then, for my meal, I ate the Baby Kale Salad without the yogurt. If you are vegan, you won't have the best selection, but there are a couple of options.It's a bit pricey for what you get IMO. The salad was $14 and didn't even come with bread. The hummus appetizer was $13.All in all, I'm giving 4 stars because it was a decent experience. Not somewhere I'd choose to go on a regular basis, but it worked for the occasion.","Affordable Happy Hour, the specials were for wine, and spirits all gin. I'm not a big gin drinker, but the drinks were good. The food was good. The friendly was staff. The restrooms were clean. No complaints, I would definitely stop by again.","Met a friend here for a couple of Happy Hour drinks before he jumped on a train at Penn station. I had a house made infused gin cocktail. (They has another which had beets in it which looked a fun color but I couldn't bring myself to try it !) Handy location, hope they add a couple more drinks to their Happy Hour menu.","Bar aspect looked fine- it's definitely a large space. The food is not very good and the portions are tiny. I had the chicken breast dinner and I consumed it in 3 bites. The poor chicken must have been about 6 days old. We also had hummus (not bad, but mediocre) and flatbread (gross). Overall many better options in NYC for food and I would not recommend this place. The waitress was very nice and perhaps it's a decent place for happy hour.",Juniper Bar
725,"Cull & Pistol Oyster Bar is located right next to The Lobster Place inside of Chelsea Market. We came in on a Friday night. The place was full. Wait time ~10 minutes. They have a regular menu and a separate fresh seafood menu where you can choose from a variety of oysters, clams, shrimp, crab, lobster, caviar, etc.I asked for a 1/2 pound of king crab legs (~$26) with a side of butter. The waiter rudely said ""we don't have butter here."" He didn't suggest any other dipping sauces that they may have either. All of this seafood and you don't have something as simple as butter? I was angry.For an appetizer, I ordered shrimp and lobster dumplings (~$15). They were bland. The outsides of the dumplings were thick and tough. They definitely needed to be steamed longer.For my entree, I got the cavatelli pasta (~$24) which had king crab, spinach, and jalapeño cream. My pasta was completely raw. You couldn't taste any jalapeño and there were about 2 tiny pieces of crab in the entire plate. I honestly don't know how this place has such great reviews. The food was horrible. Complete waste of time and money!","Very disappointing.  We've had great lobster here before but we went here for our anniversary last week and were really disappointed.  First, it was so cold in the place that we decided to have our meals wrapped up so we could eat at home and not freeze to death.  Second, the lobster was not good at all -- it seemed overcooked, dry, and - frankly - not very fresh.  I've had nice fresh lobster before, but this was not it.","Huzzah, I hereby declare Cull & Oyster as my favorite oyster joint in NYC! The clam chowder and calamari are no joke either; they're both equally as delicious but cmon, they ain't no oystahs!","This is still the absolute BEST oyster and seafood bar I have ever been to.  Do you have such a large selection of the most delicious oysters ever had and it's absolutely mind-blowing!  Literally every oyster that I tried was delicious and I can't decide which ones I like better.  They also have a happy hour from 4-6 where all the oysters are $1.50!!If you have never had langoustine, fresh urchin, or diver scallop please give it a shot when you visit!",Tucked away in the eclectic Chelsea Market this place is exceptionally good!  Large selection of oysters and other seafood fair.  Courteous staff and very well informed.,"Everything about this place was A+. Some of the best oysters I've ever ate in my life . Can't remember which ones were ordered but downed 24 Between three ppl. The lobster and shrimp dumplings were . I had the catch of the day which was a halibut and was flaky and perfect. Had some amazing shaved mushrooms on the side. I'll be back next time . So I came back again and it was just as good as I remembered ! Got more oysters , lobster tail , crab claws . Old bay fries are amazing ! The scallop entree was divine!",Cull & Pistol Oyster Bar
726,Fun place full of cool young people. But it's way too packed at lunchtime. The food suffers a bit because the demand is so intense.,This place is so crowded. It has a lot of variety but not many of the places are good. I went to the lobster booth and ordered shrimp roll with a side of mashed potatoes which were both terrible. The shrimp roll was literally on a hotdog & the mashed potatoes were dry. Never ordering from here again,"This space is great. I call it a Foodie Food Court. No reason to compromise when picking a place to meet up. Sushi, tacos, lobster rolls, burgers, pizza, hummus, that's just one-quarter​ of it! Everyone can find something they like...other than a seat since they ain't got enough of those.","I love this food hall! I strongly recommend Black Iron Burger (their burgers and loaded sweet potato fries are really good!)I also love Roberta's pizza!! The crust is crispy, and there is just the right amount of toppings. The flavor combos (subtle spiciness+cheese) are also spot on.","A solid food hall with at least a dozen vendors running the gamut from Asian to pizza to seafood.It's a bit hidden in plain sight at the moment as there's scaffolding all around, but once you venture inside you'll remark at how open, airy, and spacious it is. There's a good amount of communal seating at benches and along the walls, and most of the options here are reasonably priced given that this is a busy, prime area atop the Grand Central train tracks and amidst tons of office buildings. In particular, it's a good place to bring a modestly sized group as you can mix and match among different options or have pickier people find their own choices. Thanks Yelpers for a great find!","Fun place full of cool young people. But it's way too packed at lunchtime. The food suffers a bit because the demand is so high but there are still a few great spots here. Urbanspace has honestly saved me a couple of times when someone is visiting and I have little time to have a meal with them. I have several friends who happen to be commercial pilots and at some point or another, all pilots land in New York for a few hours at least. Then, I get the infamous text: ""I'm in the city, bro. Let's have lunch!"". When I really don't have time for a full-blown lunch, I say ""let's meet at Grand Central"" and then I rush them into Urbanspace, give them a taste of our eclectic city and send them off to run their NYC chores. My favorite places here are: Korilla: creative Korean street food. Try the Kimchi mac & cheese egg roll (need I say more?), the pork dumplings (a bit spicy, very juicy and accompanied by a delicious soy sauce) and the chicken wings (golden and perfectly sweet). Also, their bowls are great, a wonderful mix of flavors that you put together from a bunch of awesome choices. Kati Roll: imagine an Indian food taco made in a delicious, flaky Indian bread (roti), with mouth-watering spices and tender meat or freshly cooked veggies. Kuro-Obi by Ippudo: I love eating at Ippudo but there's usually a long wait associated with it. Here, not so bad. Their ramen is perfect for a cold winter hangover weekday (a good choice after a bad one). Urbanspace is an easy, quick food spot where everyone will find something they'll feel excited to try.",Urbanspace Vanderbilt
727,"Came here for Fathers Day with the wife and kids. Was so looking forward to coming because we've been here before and had the oxtail burger. It was amazing and I was looking forward to having it again.  I don't know what happened since the last time we were here but it wasn't the same. We even questioned if it was actually oxtail meat in the burger because it just tasted and had the consistency and texture of regular burger meat. Was so disappointed. I'm keeping from giving this place a ""One Star"" because I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt in case I come back here again. But I don't know if I'm just over this place. I hope I'm wrong and they're not scamming people by passing off regular ground meat as oxtail.",Food here was good and vibe was dope. I accidentally walked in and was not disappointed.,"The food was good, but service particularly inattentive. I waited at the door for 10min as 4 servers buzzed around me tending to their tables. Finally, one stopped and said I could sit at the bar. I appreciated her finally taking 15 seconds to tell me that. The bar was a little wet and littered. My setting didn't get wiped down at all while I was dining, but a server did wipe down the section next to me. Maybe they just hate me. I didn't have utensils until the food was brought out and the server realized they didn't set up my setting. It took a while to get the check that I wondered if anyone would notice if I bolted. Would never go back.",WOW!!This is a pearl of a restaurant. The flavors are insanely good MUST TRY: Oxtail RavioliOctopus Steak- Staff is really nice- Restaurant is Intimate and great for a date - No need to dress up but you definitely can - Honestly one of my favorite restaurants. The flavors will blow your mind I'd highly recommend checking them out,Really good food prepared with care and without pretense.  The quintessential neighborhood restaurant.,"Sunday funday! I found this place through yelp and was very glad that I closed out the weekend with brunch at Aita's. It was very warm and was surprised to notice there wasn't any AC. It turned out to be fine but a bit toasty as you were waiting for a seat.I believe they were short staffed or at least it seemed they were stretched pretty thin. We waiting around 15 minutes for the hostess to seat us. It wasn't an issue as it gave me time to decided what I was going to get because I'm pretty indecisive. Once I was seated I ordered almost immediately. There are so many good things on the brunch menu that it was difficult to decided. I ultimately chose the salmon hash which was incredible but also looked at breakfast, scrambled, and eggs benedict. I definitely made the right choice. The salmon was very good and the combination of the bacon, potatoes, and scallions topped with the fried egg was amazing! I was a bit nervous about how much salmon I'd actually get, but I was glad to see they included a healthy portion. Brunch was fantastic but I definitely have to be back because I need to try the pasta!",Aita
728,"The place is like a kitsch hotel restaurant, the waitress who served us was kind and welcome, but I can't say the same about the hostess who leads us to the table and the guy at the entrance. The food was good, we had buttermilk pancakes with cappuccino, it wasn't the best pancake experience but I can't complain about that.The place claims to be fancy but the only fancy thing about it was the price. I'm very sorry about the rude and unkind manners of the guys at the entrance.","The service was abhorrent. The coffee liquor drink was quite frankly disgusting. (And it comes with whipped cream, which is never mentioned on the menu). The avocado had this kind of rotten taste to it and the bread wasn't well toasted, so bites in the middle were soggy. Overall, this place is unimpressive, way too expensive and lacks high quality ingredients. Would absolutely never return.",I just had my breakfast they have a stupid rules everyone has to make an order and we have 2 kids so we have to make 4 order. This too much food for us. I hope they change the policy.,"So clean, great ambiance, and friendly servers.I wanted lox and bagels but was pleasantly pleased to have salmon with my eggs Benedict. The table loved the French toast and my sister in law said the jalapeño omelet was to die for.The English muffins are baked fresh and so light and airy. Pricey but yummalicious!","Review:  Thursday afternoon, I called up two of my favorite brunchnistas, and we headed to the Upper West Side for kiki and brunch. I have always dreamed of being a lady of leisure - where my girls and I twirl and have brunch in the middle of the day!  This day made me feel like I was one step closer to that dream. Sarabeth's has been on my brunch bucket list forever.  Growing up in NYC I strolled past this restaurant more times than I can remember. I am also a huge jam/marmalade connoisseur. Some people buy t-shirts on vacation I buy Jam! Nothing warms my heart more than opening a new jar of jam/marmalade purchased overseas or right here in the USA and  Sarabeth's marmalade is one of my favorites.  If you're not familiar, Sarabeth's started as an orange apricot marmalade distributor from an old family recipe. It received rave reviews, so they opened up a bakery, which eventually led to the Sarabeth's franchise.  Today, the iconic restaurant has many locations in Manhattan and is famous for breakfast and Sunday brunch.The staff was tremendous in accommodating our seating preference. (we wanted a quiet booth in the back so that we wouldn't disturb anyone with our mid-afternoon kackle and kiki ) Mini Caudle; the General Manager assisted us graciously. After being seated, we reviewed the brunch/lunch menu. The brunch options were extensive, and I was overwhelmed. Brunchnista rule # 1: order sweet and savor for optimal brunch experience -was at the forefront of my mind.  Torn between the lemon ricotta and the pumpkin waffle, I finally choose the lemon ricotta. Surprisingly the pumpkin waffle was sent to us - compliments of the chef!  The pancakes were good, but the pumpkin waffle, sour cream, and fresh fruit were unexpected, creating a palate party I didn't know I needed! The chicken sausage which is a rare find in many breakfast menus was pure perfection. My vegetable frittata was okay. It needed the addition of salsa or sauce to bring a little more flavor to the dish. Sarabeth is perfect for the new Instagram foodie culture and the presentation is superb. My brunch babes for this adventure enjoyed their dishes as well. I got a chance to taste both dishes because of Brunchnista rule #2:  share and share alike, no side-eyes allowed. Of course, my girls obliged.  If Sarabeth's is on your list, I recommend it.  It's something natives and visitors should experience a least once!","Classic American food with the Central Park in the back drop !The location is great. Facing the Central Park south. However the location matters only if you get one of the curb side tables. But they have a only a handful 2 person tables outside so if you come with a big group than you will have to get an indoor seating. Reservation is preferable.The food is basics American - sandwiches, burgers , pancakes, eggs and so on. We went for a Saturday brunch. We did not make a reservation but since we were a party of two they were able to find us a table outside within 10-15 mins (while we strolled through the fringes of Central Park )We got a classic eggs Benedict- which was pretty standard and lemon ricotta pancakes - which were amazing! Perfect balance of the sweet of syrup & pancakes with a tang of lemon & ricotta. Melt in mouth - soft and fluffy. We ordered them after reading the great reviews about it and we were not disappointed!!They also have a selection of cocktails and drinks.Overall the place is slightly on the expensive side - more so because of the location.Good for sunny day plans around the Central Park !",Sarabeth's
729,I wish I could rate this place but my wife and I walked out in 5 minutes.  This place is a DIVE!!!!! And not in a good way!!!,After watching WWE in Barclays center we wanna to seat somewhere and found this place which was open late night.. Bar attendant was funny guySo sadly kitchen was closed but they have snacks,"I got wasted and Made an ass of myself soA successful night!!!**cheap, strong drinks and friendly bartenders. Im still so embarrassed so see you never","Delicious, no complaints. The fried pickles are a must. My BLT was delicious and came with a salad (which I'd usually skip, but the dressing was so good). Boyfriend enjoyed his burger I might have stolen a bite. Great food, nice bartender and server. Would come back here!","I feel conflicted about the review because it really depends on what you're looking for. Came here for a quick, casual dinner - burgers and beer. And for that, this place delivers. They have a $15 burger + draft beer deal that is hard to beat. But...the burger's not great quality. The fries were solid, but honestly I think the burger was so greasy my stomach revolted.The good: beer selection is fine, and the bartenders are really cool. Will probably come back for late night drinks, but skip the burger next time.","Like this spot a lot for a relaxing hang in my neighborhood. In the winter there's a fire in the back and the backyard is delightful in the summer. Really good beer and shot combos; beer and burger combo; beer and hot dog combo... you get the picture. I would not call this a dive, it's far to clean for that, but it's also not stuffy, nor too self-conscious. Just a great neighborhood spot.",Hollow Nickel
730,"Decent, if not stellar Korean BBQ. A bit overpriced. It offers the standard experience though if that's what you want. Not a bad place.","Decent, if not stellar Korean BBQ. A bit overpriced. It offers the standard experience though if that's what you want. Not a bad place.","The meat is great, possibly the best kbbq in Manhattan, but what really sets Yoon haeundae apart is their stews. The kimchi jigae and especially their doenjang jigae is fire. I'm not joking it's not your grandma's watery miso garbage, this shit is thick as fuck and so hearty it gives you heartburn on your first bite. 10/10 the orange salt they give you for the meat is crack.","We went during the lunch hour. Their set menu for lunch was worth your money. Comes with 4 sides, rice, a choice of soup and an entree. We went with spicy pork belly and kimchi soup and beef belly with soft tofu soup. Loved loved the spicy pork belly and the soft tofu soup. The tofu soup was filled with sea food and the flavor was excellent. The spicy pork was on the spicier side and I loved it. The kimchi soup was a little on the saltier side and compared to the tofu soup- it lack a little flavor. The beef belly was excellent as well. This place is worth it. The wait staff was attentive and courteous. Our food came right away.","Came in after a late meeting nearby with J.H. and E.L.. While we were actually looking for some cold buckwheat noodles (nengmyeon), the restaurant itself was a nice surprise with a good variety of dishes. Billed as an upscale Korean bbq joint, the interior was very nice. It was super busy but didnt have the excess smoke like you have in normal Korean bbq places. They only had bibimnengmyeon which is a spicy, no broth version of this dish so we ended up ordering other items.The side dishes were nicely done, though the jelly was a little firmer than it should have been. The kimchi a touch spicier. And the odeng was fried very solidly and had a different texture than I was expecting. For myself, I got the soondubu jjigae. Spicy soft tofu soup is always where it's at for me. I'm very bad with spice but can usually tolerate soondubu but this was a touch above my level. If you use BCD as a marker, their normal (botong) is just a touch below the normal at this restaurant. The meat and seafood they added was fresh and of good quality which lent a nice rich flavor to the entire meal. My other two friends got the uni bowl and another beef broth based soup. Being sick I didnt have a chance to steal too much but the uni bowl was a fusion between Korean and Japanese styles with our dried sauteed seaweed as a backdrop. The other clear broth soup was decently flavorful but nothing to write home about according to my Korean compatriot. So why 4 stars? They were good about refilling the bonchon and the dishes were overall decent. What do I need to try before I upgrade to 5 stars? All the bbq. Haha. Until next time!","4 1/2stars It's actually four stars but plus half for how clean and neat they grill the meat. Ordered the premium meat set that comes with everything. Tried their squid salad , pretty good Spicy ramen, was just OK",Yoon Haeundae Galbi
731,"We went there as a family but we had  super bad experience .

The service was below average for that caliber of a restaurant but the price, ah the price was outrageously expensive. I know what I am getting into but didn't realize that for the price of a down payment I wouldn't have a fantastic time.","Truly had a five star experience here.My friend Allison and I came here for their pasta happy hour (50% off all their pastas - but not their risotto, which is what I was initially planning to get).I ordered the pasta special -- a tagliatelle with crab, butter sauce, and herb breadcrumbs. One of the servers mentioned that they had hired a new chef who made the special! The pasta was amazing -- it was the perfect texture and it was well complemented by the creamy sauce. Would definitely recommend trying this if it's on the specials menu when you visit! My friend ordered the olive oil crushed potatoes with garlic chips and the broccoli rabe. We both loved the potatoes (the perfect texture and had a good richness and depth of flavor from the olive oil and garlic) but thought that the broccoli was just mediocre.The grapefruit givre (dessert menu!) is another must try at Boulud Sud. The presentation is very unique, but everything was very good. The grapefruit sorbet was tart yet sweet and tied together the entire meal. I can definitely see why they are well known for this dessert!We are sadly only in NY for the weekend but I would definitely be back the next time I'm in the city. Please check out Boulud Sud you won't be disappointed!","My friend and I went here for NYC Restaurant Week.I had the watermelon gazpacho, the sea bass (+$7), and the grapefruit givré (+$5--their most famous dessert).The good: - Service was kind, knowledgeable, and attentive. My server knew my name and didn't forget it. It is a small detail, but the fact that he knew my name made the whole experience feel very personal. People came to refill our water pretty frequently. The staff at the front of the house were also very cool and professional. We never felt rushed throughout our dinner even though the restaurant began to fill up.- The bread and olive oil they provided was VERY good. I could tell the olive oil was quality because of its finish.- The watermelon gazpacho was refreshing, tasted like watermelon, and the portion was generous.- My sea bass was cooked PERFECTLY. It was delightfully crispy on top, moist, and didn't have any bones.- The givré was generously sized, and the flavor of the halva (stringy things on top) helped to undercut the bitterness of the grapefruit. I was also able to taste all the flavors advertised (sesame, rose, grapefruit).The bad:- There was a green sauce (cilantro tahini) with my sea bass that I thought was odd. It was nutty and bland, and I didn't feel that it added to the dish. I think it would have been better if it were more salty or acidic. The freekeh already had walnuts, and adding something else with a nutty flavor felt like overkill to me.- The side salad with my bass didn't taste bad (though it was a bit bitter), but I also don't feel that it added to the dish.- The givré was messy and difficult to eat--not the kind of thing you want to eat on a first date. I also felt that the sorbet could have been a bit sweeter, because it was a little watered down. Still, I thought it was worth trying, and I'm glad I did.- Maybe I'm nitpicking, but I noticed some pilling on the napkin I used. Additionally, the bench I sat on was a bit worn at the side.Verdict: I am giving Boulud Sud a 4/5 stars for the service, gazpacho, preparation of the sea bass, and inventiveness of the givré. I am removing a star because every part of a dish really needs to knock my socks off for a 5/5 rating. When the host saw us leave, he said ""See you again""--happily, we will! (Additional fun fact: I asked my waiter what happens to the grapefruit that gets scooped out to make the givré. He said they make a juice! Nice to know that the restaurant is making good use out of the ingredients.)","Food is a 3.5/5, service 5/5, ambiance 4/5.Had restaurant week dinner. The bread they brought to the table was delicious, focaccia and olive bread with flavored olive oil (had salt, pepper, garlic and rosemary in it, a bit too salty though). The waitress was even nice enough to bring us a second round of the bread.To start we had the mixed mezze plate and watermelon gazpacho. The mezze plate had babaghanoush, spicy hummus and two falafel. The babaghanoush was lackluster and the hummus had a nice texture but wasn't spicy. The falafel were very good though. The gazpacho was tasty, but lacking in watermelon flavor, it just had some cubes of watermelon in it.Entrees were the dorado and lamb. The dorado was cooked perfectly (soft flesh and crispy skin) but way too salty and the roasted pepper sauce and sides did not really go with the dish. The lamb was very good and nicely spiced.For dessert we tried the greek yogurt mousse and caffe e latte. The mousse was good, but the latte was delicious, chocolate and espresso log with crumbles. Probably the best taste of the evening. I enjoyed the experience, but expected more of the food as it is a Boulud restaurant.",Boulud Sud
732,"I went to Verlaine around 8 pm on a Thursday to partake in Verlaine's happy hour that runs from 5-10 pm. There were open tables, but in order to sit at one of their tables you need to order food. We ordered the Red Sangria, Martini, and Chicken Satay. The Chicken Satay was a bit dry and the peanut sauce was a bit thick. The Sangria was also very thick - not as refreshing as a typical sangria. It also had a fruit that looked like a white rasberry/shrimp. Was not very appetizing to look at while drinking. The martini was better than the sangria, but still not excellent. Service was adequate, but not super attentive.Overall you get what you pay for, and with Verlaine's deals one should expect to get mediocre drinks and service.","So disappointed in Verlaine! I had heard great things about this restaurant for a great happy hour and good noodles. I went with a group of 6 and we had a reservation at 7:15 on Wednesday night (though I don't think we needed the res, it was fairly empty when we showed up.) We were seated at the front of the restaurant near the window which was nice since the whole place is very very dark and overall difficult to see anything, so the window allowed us to actually read the menu without the aid of a phone flashlight. The low table and club style couch/ottoman seating meant all of our necks and backs hurt by the end of the meal from leaning over to eat. Probably would have been a more pleasurable experience if we were seated at a traditional height table.We started off which the $7 happy hour lychee martini special. Pretty good, though heavy handed with the lychee juice (very very sweet.)  We ordered two orders of dumplings (one of each kind, one steamed and one fried) as an appetizer alongside a few dipping sauces, and we all ordered either the lo mein or rice noodles as an entree. We waited for quite a while for our food (not a huge deal since we weren't in a rush, but we were starving!) Disappointingly, our entrees came out before the appetizers, and they forgot the three dipping sauces until we asked about them. Our server had a bit of attitude the whole night and was particularly annoyed when we asked her to tell us which sauce was which. The dumplings were ok, nothing special. Glad we asked for the dipping sauces though because the noodles were very very bland. We all dumped peanut sauce and Vietnamese mayo all over our bowls to add some sort of flavor. The evening went downhill when one of the candle jars on our table cracked, causing a piece of glass to land in the peanut sauce bowl. Probably just cheap glass jars that can't handle being at such a high temperature for such a long period of time. Our waitress again seemed annoyed with us, and took the broken candle away as well as the piece of glass that flew into the peanut sauce bowl - but left the peanut sauce. What?!?!?! Did she think we would still eat that?!All in all - food was subpar, the service was poor, and the dim lighting and loud music made it difficult to have any sort of conversation. The prices are decent but not enough to warrant a trip back.","Verlaine seems to be around for a long time and known for their happy hour drinks. I tried their famous lychee drink which was decent and pretty strong, but they were small.. Also, I didn't like the vibe here. It looked sort of old and rundown with some asianish decorations that just didn't go with the restaurant itself.","This is a good HH with $7 drinks until 10pm!The lychee martinis are the customer favorite here. Customer service here was nice, they kept checking in with us to make sure we were okay, and when they had vetch over a red sangria and not the original ordered white - there wasn't any difficulty in getting the correct order! Food wise - they could use a little more help! Chicken Satay was dry and the peanut based sauced didn't complement the texture - all my friends didn't enjoy this dish. We also ordered the fried mushroom dumplings - which I did like - sauce was a tad too salty tho. The beef sliders and spring rolls were my favorite! IG: @phothegram",This place gets insanely crowded so it's best if you have a reservation during peak hours. It's also hella loud during peak hours so if you have AirPods you may want to use the assisted hearing feature so you and your date aren't in a screaming match trying to have a conversation. The lomein pretty much tastes like spaghetti but the rest of the food is good. I recommend the lychee martinis.,Lauren was fantastic as usual. I'm always impressed with her level of professionalism and ability to manage multiple tables at once. Kudos to her! Verlaine has late night happy hour until 10:00 The ginger chicken wings are to die for!!!,Verlaine
733,"It's what you'd expect.  Overpriced drinks and cheese.  I've taken a gander downstairs and upstairs and purchased from both.  Service is direct and to the point, no banter with the bartenders here.You come in, you want a table, fine.  You want to sit at the bar, fine.  Order what you want, and expect nothing else.  Upstairs, I selected some cheese from the fridge and while there were at least 3 people behind the counter, I had to specifically get their attention, in order to pay.  Otherwise, who's to stop someone from leaving without paying.  It seems, they make it ""walk out the door"", easy.","Decent spot for happy hour (beers on tap for $8, certain wines for $9, list of cocktails for $10). The service (we sat at the bar) was good. We didn't eat, but the food seemed okay ($15 for toast isn't really my thing). We sat in the Cellar for an hour or so until the time for our dinner reservation around the block.","The cellar is what is sounds like: Dark and kind of dreary. Very weak internet so if you are by yourself or waiting on a friend and trying to look busy, be prepared and bring a book. Happy hour wines are $8 which is not a super deal. The food specials are slim, so leave your appetite at home. I'd try the upstairs if I were to come here again.","As soon as I saw The Cellar listed on Yelp as a wine bar on the lower level of an artisan cheese shop, I knew I had to visit. Reviews about the great happy hour were a plus too. Happy hour goes until 7 and you get a decent wine for $8. The night I went, the red was an Argentinian Malbec. The happy hour cheese platter was great--a handmade Gouda and mild house cheese with part of a baguette. Next time, I'm getting the mac and cheese, which looks and smells fabulous. They have a good selection of wines outside of happy hour too. About 4-5 different reds by the glass--4 times as many by the bottle. That said, I'm not sure I'd call it a ""wine bar."" It's quite noisy and the bartender doesn't seem to know much about the wine--when I asked which country the Malbec was from, he guessed wrong before looking at the bottle. Not a big deal--is expect that from most bartenders--just not one at a ""wine bar."" When I asked about the rose, he just cited the maker and that it was dry. Again--par for the course in a regular bar. The plus side is they have something to make almost everyone happy. Two local beers on draft, about 4-5 in cans/bottles and a cocktail bar.  If you have a friend who only drinks mass-produced beers like Bud Light, it may not be a good fit. As for ambiance, it's dark, cute and cozy. But noisy. Great for hanging out with friends or xo-workers--is try a time outside of happy hour if you're looking for something more romantic.","This place was a little hard to find (I walked past it twice haha). It is located in the basement of a cheese shop. When you finally find it, it has a great vibe. The lights are dim and it is very cozy. They have happy hour that goes until 7pm, even on Saturday. The prices are pretty steep for the ""happy hour"" food though. We ordered the ""worlds best"" mac and cheese. It was $10, which isn't bad at first glance, but the portion was the tiniest I have ever seen! It was about two bites worth of food. Also, it was definitely not ""worlds best."" It was average at best. The cloth napkins on our table were also very dirty, which grossed me out, especially since they were folded nicely as if they were clean. Overall, I would come back, maybe, for a drink only. However, I would definitely pass on the food. There are much better options in the area.","This cozy little wine bar is  located in the basement of Beecher's Handmade cheese. It's warm and inviting and a nice place to grab a bottle of wine or try out some of their great cheese.We came here to grab a drink before dinner, and the crowd was mostly smaller groups and couples on dates. The wine and cheese selection is extensive and varied, and out friendly server helped us pick a nice bottle of red and three cheeses to nibble on. The cheese was tasty and came with bread, some caramel type spread and some nuts. We also got some deviled eggs to nibble on and these were fairly good too.Overall a nice spot to get a drink. They also have a signature mac n cheese which I hear is delicious. Perhaps we'll try it out the next time we're here.",The Cellar
734,"Just a review for happy hour... Came twice. The first time I came it was totally empty just a handful of people was there on a date and I guess it was OK the only thing that bothered me was the smell of stale beer. This time however, not only did it stink like stale beer but it was packed with young loud kids and really loud music. Don't want to sound like an old man here but, definitely a younger bar. We couldn't hear each other at all and the stank smell just made it that much worse. Kids banging into you left and right just really not a fun bar unless you're young and want to drink a lot I guess!","Not sure what I'm missing out on since my experience wasn't as amazing as everyone else's. I absolutely love happy hour and was looking forward to trying the drinks and the food here. Unfortunately, there was nobody to greet me at the door and I found myself just wandering around the place. Eventually, I snagged a seat on the first floor near the bar. Ordered the frozen painkiller, which is poured straight from their frozen drink machine. It is already painfully sweet and to add onto the sweetness - there was a sugar rim! I was not a fan and found it difficult to drink. I was surprised myself since I love my sugary snacks and treats. Also, my friend wanted the Rogue Dead Guy Ale but they didn't have it that night or a number of draft beers. There was no opportunity to buy and try food, especially the lump crab mac and cheese. It was also quite loud and we had to shout so we could hear each other. We left shortly after we forced ourselves to finish most of our painkillers as we were not enjoying ourselves here and was ignored for the most part. I will probably not be back.","Cuts people off when they feel like it, doesn't evaluate what they're customers are feeling.","A great time EVERY time!  If you are in the area you have to check this place out. I love the nostalgia about this place! Every time that I've been here, it's been a great time. So much character, reminds me of my granny's house in the late 80's early 90s with the decor!  The Service: I've only popped in during the week after work for happy hours M-F and it's can fill up rather quickly. There is a ton space with a cute quaint upstairs area if you have small group of folks. I don't think that  you have to reserve it. There is also a ""back living room"" type of area that is nice for groups.The food and drinks-- clutch! The painkiller is a favorite of mine, it's like The Hulk version of a pina colada! A must order! Food wise-- I would avoid the tots-  A cod tater tot was just my least favorite experience of 2019! Totally my fault for not reading the menu thoroughly and ordering those. Otherwise, the service is great. I have witnessed a man running the show solo with an unexpected weekday packed house for happy hour and he kept his cool and provided impeccable service!","We were looking for a place for light dinner one evening, and found this interesting spot. The entrance is down the stairs from the street, almost hidden a bit. The inside felt like you are on some kind of large, old ship. I really liked the atmosphere. The space go quite far down, much bigger than it looked from the outside.We wanted some light snacks, so we ordered two small items to share. The first one up was Lump Crab Mac & Cheese. It had great flavor of crab in every bite, and it was soooo cheesy, super delicious!  Another items of choice was Salted Cod Tater Tots. It is more like cod croquettes. They were packed with flavor, and loads of cod fish in there. Soft and juicy, lightly fried, really great!The staff here was nice and efficient, we had a nice, comfortable, relaxing time here. We didn't get try any of their craft cocktails, but I would love to go back to try some cocktails and more of their tasty dishes!","First time here last night with some co workers and had a great time! When you walk in the bar is on the left side with booths and seats on the right. Keep walking and you will see the bathroom on small set of stairs, right across from it is a photo booth. When I got there it was crowded in the front but got less packed in the back where there is more seating, although not sure if you have to reserve it. I arrived around 7:55pm and the lady was nice enough to squeeze in 2 happy hour drinks before time ended. Painkiller is delicious if you want something yummy to drink, the tequila shots however were warm... but anyways. The music was great, lots of oldies fun to dance to and the vibe is great.Definitely a fun place that's not too fancy but not divey either. I'll be back again for happy hour :)",The Folly
735,"This was rough. Felt sticky and dirty on the inside and although the close environment with other patrons is unique, it felt a little invasive. Also the food just wasn't good. I understand how our perception of Japanese food is a little skewed here in America but they managed to take inherently Japanese home food and replicate it terribly. The flavors were off and I wanted to yack on at least two of the omakase dishes. Also no person would leave this place full even if you loved the omakase. Overall, not worth the price even a little. Idk what the people here are talking about.","Very romantic. However, portion sizes are too small considering they are shareable even amongst two people.","Quaint ambience - I liked the zen garden concept. You're tucked away in a small nook for privacy, but the lighting in the restaurant is so dim it distorts the mood.Food is average. Not inventive in its flavors and the omakase is slightly overpriced in my opinion. I'd rather go to an Ootoya.","What an experience. I mean, seriously, what an AMAZING experience. This is one of the restaurants that made my trip to NYC such a pleasure. Let me just start off by saying, the ambiance is just impeccable.The restaurant is dark and romantic. You walk in and there is a sitting area, amidst shady candle lighting. Asian inspired, with rocky lantern lit look. Very Instagram picture worthy. The host grabs you, and take you to your table. Usually, depending on where you are located, you will climb a narrow set of stairs, very dark and kinda scary, but trust me it adds to the flavor of the restaurant. You are then taken to a small table, it is enclosed, and when you are seated they pull down and shade and VOILA you are in total privacy with your dining companion. The only time the shade is lifted is for service. You press a button when you need help.Service is impeccable. So much attention is paid to detail. The food itself is very deep, taste and flavor wise. You order in an a la carte style. It is not cheap but they have tasting menus, and waitresses are very helpful in describing what you may or may not care for. Warm saki was potent :)I would love to come back and share this experience with all of my friends and family one at a time. But first, I have to get back to NYC!","The place is very small and we are seated in a small cubical (maybe 3x3 feet) that fits only two of us with a small table and a blind that provides privacy. The environment is very interesting.We ordered the omakase; it is a little pricey for the quality and portion. The plating were very pretty and remind me of our meals in Japan, of course the flavor can never be compared. We really like the grilled fish, but the sushi sashimi were not as fresh as could be. The raw beef were a little chewy but the three miso sauces go very well with the beef flavor. The highlight of the meal is the grapefruit agar jelly dessert, we ended on a good note and will definitely go back just for that jelly. Not all the dishes were amazing, but it does deserve a four star for the unique experience.","I came here with my family to celebrate Father's Day. We got the Spring Omakase which was an 8-course tasting menu which was $75/person. The meal started with a spring sea beam which was a miso soup with yuzu peel. We then got an appetizer platter which included five small tasting dishes - sea bass sashimi, miso marinated cream cheese, micro-vegetables/broccoli rabe, lotus root/snow peas, and scallop tartare (my favorite from the platter!)The following tasting dishes were as follows:- Three kinds of sashimi (super fresh)- Cod & green shiso tempura (prob unmemorable cause I don't remember this)- Saikyo black cod (amazing- so buttery and soft- we liked it so much we decided to order another one)- Thin sliced washugyu beef (comes with a yummy yuzu spread on top)- Chirashi (did not come with any fish, seemed more like a carb-filling plate to me but I was super full at this point regardless)For dessert we got the black sesame ice cream and the chocolate pudding. Let me tell you. This pudding sent me spiraling into my own happy world cause it was so gooood. I did not want to share this at all. All in all, we all very much enjoyed our meal and I was glad I was able to introduce some members of my family to their first omakase experience.",Zenkichi New York
736,I'm not much of a spicy person but knew I had to order this spicy lemon grass soup. The chili's are boiled for hours to bring out the flavor and you can sure taste the effort put into the dish. I would say the bone marrow maybe more for aesthetics. Not much to eat.,"Because of good review of the roasted bone marrow pho, I had to try their dry vermicelli bowl with pork belly because it's my preferred vietnamese food. Great presentation but the flavor was significantly lacking (the liquid condiment didn't tasted like fishSauce-garlic-chili-vinegar-sugar (the norm) and the pork belly were all lean meat and overcooked (dry) and not caramelized (the norm). So this low rating is just for this dish. I have to try their signature roasted bone marrow pho next !","Disclaimer: I only tried dessert items.My boyfriend and I specifically came to try to ube cheesecake, which is the one item on their dessert menu. Presentation is absolutely beautiful and it comes with dragonfruit and blueberries. However, taste is at the level of an average cheesecake and ube lovers will be disappointed. There is a very tiny trace of ube flavor (to the point where you can hardly taste it) and it is on the thick side for cheesecake. Definitely a unique look but taste is not really justifying $12 for a tiny cheesecake.We also ordered the taro latte and it is this that makes me knock down a 3 to 2 star. I took one sip and did not want to keep drinking. Absolutely disgusting and did not taste like taro.That being said, I've seen good reviews about their meal items and might be back to try noodles. So this review is exclusively dessert-centric.","Food was amazing! My zillion times come back for this delicious Spicy Lemongrass Soup!! It has the hint of lemongrass which make the soup much tastier . Don't forget to add the marrow bone, soooo yum as they add herbs on top. Seriously, can't find a better spicy soup anywhere else in the city! For those not big fan of spicy, the Pho is amazing as well! Service was remarkable! Everyone was so nice and friendly - make you feel like home! The place is very cute and cozy.Highly recommended!!!! Can't wait to come back!","I had pretty high expectations for this place and was pretty disappointed when they weren't met after my visit here. I can honestly say that this place doesn't serve legitimate Vietnamese food and is just a place for hipsters to gather and feast on overpriced and bland food. I had the beef pho with the sliced eye round and beef brisket. I also added the bone marrow to my dish since it looked appetizing judging from the photos. At the end of it all, I felt cheated and ripped off for paying $20 plus tax and tip for this bowl of pho. After I threw in the jalapeño peppers, chili oil and bean sprouts into my soup, it was still overly bland tasting. The soup wasn't rich at all and flavorless. The brisket was alright...nothing out of this world. The bone marrow also was not worth the extra $5. Even the free iced coffee with the Yelp check-in wasn't done right. It was unnecessarily sweet. The sweetness covered up any coffee flavor. I assume they used Cafe Du Monde coffee with condensed milk.  Overall, I wasn't satisfied with my first experience here. NYC doesn't have a big pho scene, but there are far better pho places even in Chinatown.  They're even better tasting and much cheaper.  Would not recommend coming here.","Randomly walked by this spot while I was in the area with a friend and decided to stop by. They had the pre fixe lunch special for $14 so we got the: fried spring rolls, pork belly vermicelli bowl, pork belly sandwich and Thai iced tea. Everything was delicious! The pork belly was so tender and juicy - full of flavor. Not bad for $14 either! Will return again if I'm back in the area.",Ginger and Lemongrass
737,"Food was authentic, fresh, and delicious. Seriously like the food from my childhood! If you're planning to visit this location, I'd say either do take out or plan on waiting for seats, since there are only a handful of bar type seats against the walls.Food can be mouth numbingly spicy (which we loved), but be warned if you have a a more delicate palate!","Xian was my go-to when I was craving Asian-style noodles in midtown and didn't have time to make the long haul down to Chinatown. Unfortunately, my last visit caused me to question this. Admittedly, I showed up late in the day, so I guess I shouldn't have been too surprised when my go-to order, liang pi noodles, were sold out.  So I ended up ordering the vegetable hand pulled noodles instead. I had an upset stomach that day, so I specifically ordered my noodles with NO spiciness. Unfortunately, the kitchen must've not read the order because my order was FULL of spicy Sichuan hot pepper bits. I took it back and watched as they put my order in a sieve, rinsed it with water, and then inelegantly dumped some soy sauce on top. As you could imagine, there were still hot pepper bits so the order was still spicy. In addition, it was oversalted, and I drank 3 bottles of water during the night because I was so thirsty from the meal. Even if my order has been correct, the vegetables the noodles came with were pretty abysmal. Who serves pieces of potato in an Asian noodle dish?? Other than the wood ear mushrooms and tofu, none of the vegetables were authentically Asian. The one shining bit of this trip was the hand pulled noodles, which were deliciously and freshly pulled as I waited. But I would've rather eaten the noodles plain than have eaten that oversalted sauce.Unfortunately, I'm not sure I'll be back to Xian unless I go early enough in the day that I can guarantee I'll get my liang pi noodles.","I was so excited to try this place as it comes highly rated and a friend recommended it. Modified-owner mentioned it's not cash only, but when I purchased my food I was told I couldn't use my card. Perhaps there's a minimum? I tried the lamb cumin noodle (non soup version) as it's a crowd favorite here. I was looking forward to it, but I wasn't impressed. I added A TON of chili oil for that extra kick, but I found the flavor pretty bland and not spicy (shockingly). The cumin flavor is certainly present though, but not much else. There's also not a lot of lamb included. I ordered it to go and dug in 5 minutes after it came out, so they noodles absorbing the oil and changing the flavor shouldn't be a concern. I think I'll come back once more to give it another shot, but I'm fairly disappointed I didn't have the great experience others do.","What is it about the term ""hand-ripped noodles"" that evokes mouth watering feeling of urgently needing to eat them? Well, look no further. Xi'an has a few locations throughout NYC but make you go to one of the legitimate spots. This location is very small, NOT good for great groups but may be perfect for a first date spot. Personally, I say go big or go home when it comes to spicy food so I highly recommend getting the spicy lamb with hand ripped noodles! It's a bit spicy, heavy on the cumin so be aware of that. The portions are generous so ask for a to-go bag. I still think about those noodles some times.","Xi'an Famous Foods opened to rave reviews and expanded to several locations throughout the area.  However, I really did not enjoy my meal and was shocked by all of the hype surrounding it.  The Liang Pi Cold Skin Noodles were made of wheat flour and served in the restaurant's homemade sauces.  While the pasta was perfectly cooked, the ""mild"" spice level I had requested had been ignored, allowing each bite to set my lips on fire.  In fact, all I could taste was spice.  My friend's Spicy Cumin Lamb Burger was also overpowered by herbs.  In fact, the patty contained so much cumin that he could not taste the meat.  As if that was not bad enough, the bun was toasty, but completely bland.  We also shared 2 other dishes.  The Spicy & Tingly Lamb Face Salad was served cold.  It was as zesty as promised with its addition of Chinese pepper.  In fact, I found it a bit too peppery and just decent; this was not nearly as memorable of a dish as it should have been being that it contained muscles and tendons from the face of a lamb.  Unlike the other intense courses, the Lamb Meat Soup contained tough meat and a flavorless bone broth.  The soup really would have benefitted from more salt.  Overall, we found the food very poorly executed and the service rude.  While the conceded ""hospitality"" was in-line with the buzz about Xi'an Famous Foods, it was certainly not warranted by the food.","You might think the food here looks simple and might wonder why there are literally 10 different locations in the city.  However, that's the beauty of Xi'an Famous Foods - simple and affordable foods that focus on the flavor. Although the menu is huge, a lot of the options are pretty similar. I'd like to recommend to always go for the dry option over the soup option. The soup's broth isn't that flavorful and it really just takes away from the flavor of the sauce. For a delicious and pure taste of Xi'an's flavors, go for dry over soup. With that being said, the spicy cumin lamb noodles are my recommendation. The lamb is great and the noodles/sauce are delicious and full of flavor. The restaurant is very simple and small. You order at the walk-up counter and there are two long tables against the wall with maybe 5 chairs at each table. This is not a good spot for large parties. I'd recommend only dining here with 1-3 people or just getting it to-go. Overall, a simple and affordable option for some tasty Chinese noodles. You can always expect a nice affordable meal for under $10 when you dine here.",Xi'an Famous Foods
738,"Overpriced is what I would describe this place. Food are basic yet the prices are high. Seriously, you're just capitalizing on kids that get hungry after playing at a nearby water park, sand park and playground. I don't mind paying but just serve the food that's equivalent to your price.",Pros:Nice viewsRooftopServiceAmbience (lively)Cons:Long wait for foodCrowded (but hey it's Summer),"Super disappointed in my second trip to Fornino. My boyfriend and I raved about this place in the past and decided to return with both our moms. We ordered inside, got a number, and grabbed a table outside. We waited. And waited. And continued to wait. No pizza. Meanwhile new patrons around us were receiving their food even though arriving much later than us. Eventually we went inside and asked what was going on. The staff had no idea what to do and seemed completely confused. Finally they found a manager who came over to our table. No apology. He just simply said, ""We looked for you upstairs."" We found this ridiculous considering we were told we could sit anywhere - up or down. Our pizza arrived five minutes later. And to make it all even better-2 of the 3 pizzas were ice cold, clearly having sat somewhere for quite awhile. They didn't have the courtesy to even warm them back up. And they didn't give us a discount on our bill. Terrible customer service.",Really loved this open air on top lookout to the beautiful skyline of NYC and the brooklyn bridge. The drinks were good. We ordered sangria for our table and two pizzas. They have long tables which is good for big groups. As wells as they have separate areas to order your food and drinks. The atmosphere encourages good conversation as well as the music playing in the background is not too loud. We were there on a friday night and the place was packed but we were still able to find seating for a group of six. Would definitely be back at this spot.,"So we came to Fornino with friends to hangout. It's very close to the pier 5 and thus seems like easily the best option.Positives 1. Seat yourself. Many large tables for big groups 2. The vibe is great - music, rooftop styleI think the pizza is abit salty and overpriced","Our favorite pizza place in Brooklyn. Whats not to like about it! Decent wood oven pizza (1-star) and a great outdoor dining with a view of Manhattan (1-star). We love taking our friends here who aren't from the neighborhood because its such a nice location to walk to on Pier 6 with the parks, water and sporting activities.This is a counter service location so you cant expect staff to engage with you too much. Its the interactions and brief conversations when ordering that I have rated their customer service with 3-stars. The bartenders are usually happy to have a quick chat and they are always happy to help. Plus they are quite efficient by taking your order when they are finishing off another customer drink. I love efficient hospitality workers! The floor staff are usually pretty helpful and are quick to clear tables (which can be in high demand). There is a separation between where you order the food and where the bar is which I think works really well for speed of service. While there is nothing amazing about the service to stand out, its pretty much spot on for what you need in a location like this. Its casual dining with a view at its best!One current negative is that their beer lines need to be cleaned or some kegs have turned because some of their beers currently taste like sour orange juice. I pointed this out and my beer was replaced. They were aware of this so personally, I would rather them take off the line than sell a bad product. But that's just my opinion having run bars in the past. Wont deduct and stars for this because this should be fixed soon. Fingers crossed it does.",Fornino
739,"Come here for the tacos, they're not too small and surprisingly filling!The nachos on the other hand were a disgrace. Soggy upon serving. Where is the cheese? Lackluster flavor.Nobody would think the tacos and nachos were from the same place.I'm torn on if the tacos are worth increasing from 3 to 4 stars.",This place was great... PowerPoints under the bar to charge ur phone while you eat/drink :-)The queso was ok... not the best I've eaten. The place has a great atmosphere and is in a cool upcoming strip.,"Terrible service. Servers are so slow and clueless. Couldn't even get his attention to get the check, after 10 minutes had to go up to the cash point and ask to pay and then get stopped on the way out accused of not paying by the server who was chatting to another employee!!","My new favorite lunch spot!!! I'm from California so I'm a total Mexican food snob but Mexicue is the bomb.com baby!!Highly, highly recommend the incredible nachos, they are seriously the most tasty I've had in NYC. I'm also obsessed with the Avocado romaine salad, but my secret is to have them add shrimp..mmmm, my mouth is already watering at the thought of the refreshingly light citrus vinaigrette (try this vs the creamy one) and it's so filling!Haven't tried the drink menu yet but I'm definitely going to after hours on my next visit, they have an extensive cocktail menu that is calling my name","The name alone had me stuffing my feet in sneakers and high-tailing it to the restaurant. I'm in NY for work and needed grub ASAP. My hotel was only a four minute walk away so Mexican food, here I come!I arrived during happy hour so the restaurant was empty but the bar was almost full. I didn't drink but the drink menu looked yummy.I needed some vegetables and fiber, so I ordered the seasonal roasted vegetable bowl and added pulled pork. I also added a lobster taco based on previous reviews. The bowl looked really small when it came and I got worried if this would hold me over. I dumped it onto a bigger plate so I could add my creamy chipotle dressing without making a complete mess, and it turned out to be more than I thought. There were roasted sweet potatoes, charred cauliflower, corn and kale mixed in for a beautiful blend of healthy Mexican flavors. Based on this alone, I would give this spot 3.5 stars.The lobster taco was served on a corn tortilla with green onion and cilantro. It had a lot of lobster meat and was drenched in green onion (like a lot) but I had to add a bit of the dressing to give it that extra somethin' somethin'. Otherwise, it was a bit lackluster. I ended up ordering another taco because... tacos! Great lunch. I might visit again and try a new option but the price seemed a bit steep for what you get. Sidenote: kinda wish they provided free chips and salsa. It's Mexican for goodness sake, come on!","Mexicue is just okay to me, probably about 3.5 rounded down. I've only gotten delivery and maybe the ambiance of the restaurant itself makes the food taste better. The menu is pretty interesting, with (you guessed it!) BBQ and Mexican fusion offerings like brisket bowls and also some lobster and impossible meat add-on the options. The lobster here is real lobster! I've had the lobster mac and cheese which is decent, but not mind blowing. There's a reasonable portion of lobster but the mac and cheese is a little too mushy/wet for my taste. For tacos and burritos, there's a wide range of filling options from fish to impossible meat to elote to pork. Burrito bullets are smaller burritos - consider this option if you want to try different types! I like the pulled pork. Overall, I think I've been a little disappointed more than I've been satisfied with the food here , and I think Mexicue is a little too expensive for me to have that reaction.",Mexicue
740,"Very sad attempt at a Spanish version of Eataly. The merchandise selection is limited. I tried some of the desserts and the gazpacho. The dessert was so-so (and so mediocre I don't even remember what I actually bought), and while the gazpacho was on-point, I waited for over 15 minutes in a 3 ppl line to get the pre-bottled gazpacho to go.In short, the management needs to revamp the operation or Wholefoods will be taking all the business from this sad place once they open in 2020!","Had some expectations based on the nyt review but should have believed the yelp reviews.. it was the definition of a tourist trap and even worse than eataly -- at least at eataly although the food is expensive its quite good and sufficient. Our group of four got so many dishes but still left unsatisfied with quite a significant spend. My 3stars are reserved for places i didnt care for but would go if someone really wanted to, but this was a place i would actively discourage someone to go to if they wanted to.","My thoughts on the food & experience: I've eaten at Mercado Little Spain a few times for dinner & breakfast and the more I experience it, the lower my opinion gets. While the concept is bold, the food itself & the treatment of customers are disappointing. The FoodAs someone who loves Spanish cuisine, I was thrilled to have a cool Spanish market open near my office. However, trying the food, I found it leaves a lot to be desired. Most dishes, such as the pulpo or mushrooms were bland & tasteless. The more decent ones were the rabo del toro and liquid olives, but these were nevertheless overpriced for the quality. Sad to see the locale celebrate the peasant cuisine of Spain, while charging unjustifiable prices for mediocre food. Experience The staff can be hit or miss, with some members friendly and others can be rude. One afternoon I bumped into the head chef, Jose Andres, himself there, and was saddened to see how he treated his customers & fans. A few customers ventured to say hello and ask for a picture, and he waived them off with a disgusted look on his face. Of all the celebrities & celebrity chefs I've seen in person, Jose Andres was the least gracious or appreciative of patrons to his restaurant. And it seems like this attitude towards customers trickles down to staff & restaurant. OverallThere are much better places in New York to experience quality Spanish food, and no need to overpay for this mediocre fare or sit through poor service & hospitality. Stay away!","This place is a delight!  So much yumminess squeezed into one place, I can't eat enough to satisfy my eyes.We sat at the seafood bar and kept ordering everything on the menu.  The sizzling shrimp in bubbling butter brought audible satisfaction to the feeding frenzy.I have yet to try the sandwiches across the way.I highly recommend this place!","I know the chef who owns this place. As a matter of fact I like José Andrés' way of cooking and his philanthropic moves. But out of all the stations in his Hudson Yards baby, who's actually cooking? The flavors are distinct- but they're mass produced, mass produced, mass produced! Mercado Little Spain has been undoubtedly on our radar for a visit- and for a gorgeous Sunday late afternoon, Mercado wasn't crowded. Stations are each designed with their own flair and each working up their 'specialty'. But the further in you walked, the area feels closed in. I know I walked into the first floor, but it feels like the basement. Am I under the High Line? Or one of the Hudson Yards buildings? Some stations- you couldn't even bring food 'out' to eat in the common seating areas- and had to eat at that specific restaurant. 'La Barra' is one of those restaurants where you HAD to sit at their station. When the server noticed I was sitting away from her restaurant, she explained she could get in trouble for bringing food away from her spot. In the end she gave in. Food? I know things shift- I get it- and food never tastes the same- but this is Spanish (Spain) food that's just way off. The Paella station had only but 2 to choose from: Vegetarian or Chicken-Rabbit. What's that??? And no seafood Paella. It has a food court feel- BUT...I can get better and upscale food at The Westchester in White Plains! Plus food here isn't out of this world. Did I feel like I was in Spain? I don't know... you tell me. But I hope that you will enjoy your choices as much as we did. But in Mercado's defense, you can go from station to station to eat bits and pieces from each restaurant and service was nice. But honestly, we didn't find the unexpected and we weren't delighted by this place. Listen...this is a nice Spanish-focused concept....for tourists- not for me. World Famous, Michelin Star Chef José Andrés- just put his stamp, his face and money into Mercado Little Spain...and that's great! I really wanted to jive with Mercado- but there are better Spanish restaurants in the city! And please Milena- do not respond to my review with Mercado's generic comment. Better yet- do not respond. Gracias!","After visiting Barcelona this summer I was thrilled to check out little Spain at the base of Hudson yards in New York. All the stalls were reminiscent of the delicious food I had in Spain. From the fried potatoes, tortilla, gazpacho, spinach and goat cheese empanada. We never went wrong. I'm so happy this is next to where my friends live because I will definitely be returning! Quick, easy, affordable, delicious!",Mercado Little Spain
741,"This restaurant never disappoints. It's maybe my 3 or 4th time. Always excellant food and service. The lamb in puff pastry, Branzino and mezze platter were out of this world   This place is a must","The 2 stars are for the food.We came in as a walk in 3 top at 6:30pm. We asked for a table outside on the patio. The host asked if we had a reservation which we did not. She then proceeded to tell us that the patio and dining room were unavailable due to reservations and all she could offer us was the bar. About 30 minutes later a party of two came in and asked for a table outside. She did not ask if they had a reservation and immediately sat them outside, no question. I don't know what kind of establishment permits this behavior. I live in the neighborhood and I was very offended. She didn't even offer us a table inside the dining room. Disappointed.","Returned for brunch. Did not enjoy the green shakshuka unfortunately (spinach felt very cooked - almost cakey, and my eggs were undercooked and after tasting my friend's green shakshuka whose eggs were slightly overcooked and had no run at all to them) I asked for a chicken kebob pita instead which was amazing. The lamb kebob pitas got rave reviews too. We started with the spicy feta and overall had a great experience once the green shakshuka was forgotten.","Incredible experience, all around and is consistently so every time...!If you want some of the best Mediterranean food in NYC, Bustan is your spot! The tastes are amazing, and you can tell the level of care that the Chef places into every dish...Great atmosphere, and great service!I've been here for brunch and dinner... cant go wrong with either! Highly recommend...!",We had a night out with three couples. We literally ordered all the main courses to share and to try out the place as it was our first time there.The food was beyond delicious! Everything was so interesting and colorful and the service was just perfect. They really made us feel at home in our backyard served by a talented chef that paid us a visit every here and there to make sure we are having fun.I am certainly coming back!,"We had a delicious meal at Bustan last night. We sat in the garden, enjoying the breezy summer evening. My sister was visiting from Baltimore and we knew this was the perfect restaurant for a family gathering! Their falafels were light and crunchy, like small feathery green morsels (best in the city). The Israeli salad was a perfect summertime appetizer. The bronzino fish was served over roasted vegetables and grains. The lamb was topped by a puffed bread crust. Dessert was amazing: the best chocolate mousse cake I have ever eaten and a light berry sorbet meringue.  What we enjoyed the most was the balance of flavors and textures, everything was so fresh! Everything was delicious! We enjoyed every bite!",Bustan
742,"I allocate a portion of my paycheck to the $18 octopus I order from here on a weekly basis.  That's $9 per tentacle and I HAVE NO REGRETS.  Also, order the spanikopita and chicken skewers with tzatziki sauce.  Everything here is delicious and authentic.","This place has a pretty front and I really wanted to come here. However, honestly it's definitely more of a date spot and not a group dining restaurantWe had a total of 6 people, and we were all squished up in a private ""island."" However, the tables aren't arranged exactly for group dining.It was really hard to eat food & not bump into my friends.First, we ordered some Greek fries to share- didn't taste like anything and it didn't come with any sauces.Then, we ordered grilled octopus ($17) and it was a small portion only enough for my boyfriend and me. I also got the pita with lamb and the food was pretty cold.The service wasn't good, and the waiters literally never responded to us. I waved a couple of times and literally, there was no response at all.I would say it's a good place for photos, but 2/10 would come back again for food.","I find myself craving Greek food every now and then and when I do, I always make my way to Souvlaki.The food here is well done and I trust that I will always get a good meal here.The lamb pita as well as any of the dip options (of course, go figure) are my go-to.Service here isn't outstanding, but it's consistent. Pricing is average. I typically only come for lunch.4/5",This place takes me back to Santorini. The aesthetic is wonderfully greek. The food is authentic and delicious! 10/10 would recommend this for some comfort greek food and a Mythos beer.Food to try: Chickpea salad is fire. The lamb meatballs are also great.,"Finally tried this place again years later and it is not as good as I remembered it. Either that or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. We started out with some Greek meatballs and Greek fries. The Greek meatballs were great, especially with the tzatziki sauce it came with. However, the fries could have used something to dip them in as well. We started using the tzatziki for it. For my main, I had the lamb burger. I liked that it was served with pita instead of a regular bun. I also liked the roasted tomatoes and the beet slaw. However, the lamb was a bit dry. With so many other Greek options in the city, I'm not sure I'll be back a third time.","Such a cute place! It really makes me feel like I'm actually sitting at a restaurant somewhere in Greece. Granted, I've never been to Greece, but it's how I would imagine it - the white walls, the blue shutters, the contrasting pink flowers - deffo not your average LES hole in the wall.Our party of 10 came in at around 8:30 on a Friday for a birthday dinner and we were seated promptly, even though we were missing a couple of guests.To start, we all shared the Greek fries (pretty good, even though I'm normally not a fan of feta cheese), Greek salad (standard) and almost all of the mezedes/dips they had. Unfortunately, I can't remember all of them (it may or may not have been due to the fact I was slightly buzzed) but I do remember liking the skordalia (super garlicky, which is why I liked it) and NOT liking the melitzanosalata (eggplant). All of the dips come with a load of pita bread. Seriously, a LOAD - I mean that we had about two full plates of leftover pita afterwards.Two of my dining buddies and I also wanted to try the keftedes (Greek Meatballs), on top of our entrees, of course (don't judge). These were really good! The outside was a little crispy but the inside was tender. It almost reminded me of Swedish meatballs, but better.For my entree, I went with the Souvlakia Kalamaki Paketo (choice of sixchicken or pork skewers with tzatziki & pita). I opted for 4 chicken and 2 pork (since I'm not a HUGE fan of pork). I ended up liking the pork better than the chicken, which was slightly dry - but the tzatziki deffo helped negate the dryness. On top of the great food, our waiters were super nice - even took some selfies with us! (c'mon...if it's GNO, you HAVE to expect a few selfies here and there!)Souvlaki GR was my first Greek food experience and I can't wait to make it my next!",Souvlaki GR
743,The only thing truly eaten was your time. Extraordinary SLOW food service.Lamb ribs at 9$ each. Dry and overly salty with no other nuanced flavor. 4$ each oysters small and underwhelming.6$ fries portion very small. Everything was over salted... I needed to drink a pond to flush out all the salt.Left starving.,Very disappointed with the new menu and chef change--$45 dollar rib eye which turned out to be three slices of meat and a burnt end.,The place looks nice for drinks. but It's really hard to enjoy over salted beef tartare with almost no meat in it... just disappointing...,"Honestly amazing. Lived 500 feet away for the last year and this is the first time I've been here. Every dish was perfect - charcuterie, Great lamb ribs, burger, perfect fries, lite posset dessert. Who knew.","KenScale: 7.75/10When we check out new restaurants, my wife Jun and I rarely order the same dish twice, mostly because we want to try as many different dishes as possible before coming up with my KenScale (and for Jun her own score). On a recent early Sunday dinner, though, Jun did the unthinkable. After making a quick work of one of the two glazed lamb ribs served at Cherry Point in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, she proceeded to order another set. The ribs were priced at $18 per two, with $9 per additional piece. I asked her if she was thinking of sharing the third one with me; she quickly shook her head and said she wants one full rib all by herself. Knowing that my wife loves good ribs in general, I didn't object and ordered another rib for myself. Based on the ribs, alone, is Cherry Point a great restaurant? Definitely, but then a single dish doesn't necessarily reflect the quality of the restaurant. In a way, the experience at Cherry Point was a bit of a mixed bag.Let's talk about the ribs again for a second. You don't often see rib dishes made of lamb, presumably because of the difficulty with controlling the texture of this gamey meat. The kitchen behind Cherry Point more or less perfected the art of lamb cooking, and the glazed outside really did a wonderful magic, giving a beautiful contrast between the crust and the meat inside. The seasoning was also superbly balanced with yogurt and shallot without overpowering the texture of the lamb. No wonder Jun, astonished, quickly remarked that the lamb ribs at Cherry Point were some of the very best she had had in her lifetime. Cherry Point, with its British leaning menu, serves many dishes around meat. In addition to the lamb ribs, the beef tartare and bottarga on a toast was also solid with nice balance in flavor. The other meat dish we ordered, however, turned out to be quite a disappointment. I understand Jun, always partial to duck meat (especially the breast), sets a pretty high standard when it comes to the poultry, but she was very puzzled after taking the first bite of the duck breast that came with bruleed pear and celeriac. The meat's texture was simply off although its color looked enticing. It wasn't clear what the kitchen exactly did, but either the meat seemed to be of poor quality or the right temperature wasn't applied. In any event, Jun declared the duck breast at Cherry Point one of the three worst she had had in her lifetime. The underwhelming duck breast certainly wasn't helped by the side dish of grilled asparagus with capers and basil which could've worked very well with the duck meat with its crunchy feel.Getting a reservation at Cherry Point online wasn't too challenging and the dining room was around half full in the course of our meal. We both really liked the casual neighborhood vibe of the restaurant which seems to be filled mostly with local Brooklynites; if the consistency of the food was there, I could have even considered Cherry Point in the gem category. There is full bar with some potent cocktail offerings that will help complement the food. In retrospect, as we were taking a walk from the restaurant to Williamsburg afterwards, I kept wondering if our dining experience would have completely changed had we ordered something other than the duck breast. If the duck were only half as decent, Cherry Point would have been comfortably within the solid 8.0 or more category in KenScale. It's a bit sad that we jumped from one of the best ribs my wife had ever had to one of the worst duck breast dishes she had ever had. I would certainly love to come back just for the ribs, though.",I went here with some girls for a post-bachelorette brunch and was happy that we were able to get a reservation for 11am on a Sunday for 5 ppl just 1 day in advance. The cold brew was la Colombe which is always a treat. I had to run to my flight just a half an hour into the meal but I was able to order everything to go upfront and they accommodated quickly -- with even some time for me to eat at the table. The breakfast sandwich itself was delicious!,Cherry Point
744,"I won't come back. Ordered the well-acclaimed Sichuan Chili Salmon bowl (the regular size; they also have large) and it's literally a bowl of rice with salmon wrapped in a sauce similar in color and texture to sriracha mayo, some green onions, white onions and a ton of Japanese rice condiments (the one that's made from fish, brown in color and a little crispy, which I have at home and sometimes sprinkle a little on home-cooked white rice to add salty and seafoody flavors.) I was expecting more vegetables/toppings and just overall more effort in the bowl, not so much garnish and spices that I could buy from any Asian supermarket myself. The usual make-your-own poke places in New York offer much more variety in the fresh ingredients you can choose from, and the other made-to-order places in the area where you can't make your own (like Humble Fish, though smaller in portion and more expensive) put considerably more thought and creativity into their listed menu items. The salmon tasted okay; the only thing that stood out was the spiciness. I don't have much faith/interest in trying their other items based on my disappointing first-time experience.They also give out chopsticks by default. I didn't check the take-out bag and there's no utensil station in store so I assumed I assumed they included a fork inside the bag. But no, just chopsticks--It's really hard to pick up the rice stuck at the bottom with them.","Pricey and not as flavorful as I expected. If you are looking for typical poke that you can find all over the city, this place is not it. You don't get to make your own bowl and the topping options is limited. I have never had a fishy tasting poke until this place. It was also very salty. The staff was nice and the place is cute but this is def not on my go to list for poke.",I came here solely for the dole whip and it's simply spectacular.  Highly recommend.I'll update my review for the poke if I ever have room after the dole whip.,"Hands down #1 Poke restaurant in NYC. HANDS DOWN!!!- I was never into the whole poke epidemic until my mom introduced me about a year ago. - Chikarashi is amazing, I've tried a few other places in Brooklyn & Manhattan & they do not compare- The fish is fresh. Only negative is I wish they gave you more - ~$15 - Never a wait & Staff is Willing to walk you through the menu MUST TRY: Ponzu Salmon Chili Salmon Mayo Tune","Came just for the Dole Whip soft serve cause I don't think any other place offers this. For the price and amount, it is worth. It's more like a sorbet and I enjoyed that they offer an option of twist which I'm a sucker for (Best of both worlds). I had the pineapple and mango twist. The seasonal flavor for the dole whip twist does change (idk when) so I didn't expect mango flavor to be on the menu either. Although the server pointed out which flavor was which, I honestly couldn't taste much difference between them because of how over-powering the taste of the pineapple was. It wasn't WOW but it is very tart indeed which I liked and was a refreshing treat for those post-meal hot summer days.","I used to work in tech in San Francisco and most companies offered free lunches. Now that i'm working in New York and have a new job, those tech perks have been taken away. Now I have to buy lunch 4 days a week. Sighhh!Chikarashi is not your average chipotle style poke joint. They have pre-made flavors in regular or large sizes. Since I love a little spice, I got the Sichuan Chili Salmon in regular size. It was a decent amount of food, but I was not full after. I would recommend the large size if you are a big eater. The flavor was nice and the fish was decent quality. I wish it had more toppings and veggies.I think the bowls are a tad overpriced. This location is near Chinatown and I feel I can get some cheaper options for lunch. There's not many ""healthy"" options in the area so I might be back if I have a poke craving.",Chikarashi
745,"Not sure what happened to this place lately but my last visit was the least pleasing out of all of my ~20 visits in the past two years.Today I went with three friends on an extremely rainy day and while we were sat down immediately and our order was taken swiftly, the food was not the best, nor did we feel like we got the best value.Our appetizers: Cucumber, Husband and Wife Slice Lung (extremely salty, didn't taste as fresh), DanDan Noodles (extremely salty, didn't finish the dish)Our dry pot consisted of 15 toppings, 6 of them meat, and we felt like we got less of the expensive choices (fish, beef, tripe, lamb, quail egg) and more of the cheaper choices (tofu).For a meal that came to $130 for one dry pot (which we generally have no problem paying) we literally got 4 quail eggs, hardly any beef, lamb, tripe or fish. We got a disproportionate amount of spam which is obviously the cheapest meat and a lot more tofu then we could possibly ever ask for.Now you may be thinking ""15 topping is a lot for one bowl, there's probably diminishing returns"" know that I have made this order in the past at the same Mala Project and have gotten much more pleasant results.This makes me feel like Mala has either had a management or strategy change to cut costs in corners that leave loyal customers like me betrayed.What was the worst part? We complained to the person who took our bill and they said, ""it's probably because it was a rainy day"".Thanks for reconfirming my doubts of the value we get here Mala - I'll probably think twice about coming here again.","I read about this on Eater and I was excited at the background of the two owners - young Chinese. One a graduate of the Culinary Institute of Arts (""CIA"") and another at NYU. But the food didn't taste good. It wasn't hot when it arrived at my table and the dry pot mix had liver pieces and other offal that I didn't order. I like the taste of liver but surprised they were just putting any meat in my dry pot. The place is dirty looking with makeshift depressing furniture and I didn't think the dry pot had fresh well prepared ingredients. The pork belly weren't thick or large and thin slices I see in Sichuan cooing but American bacon that was boiled and then fried. Overall the food didn't taste bad but I didn't think it tasted good and won't be coming back. The 2 out of 4 stars by Eater was correct I thought.","Look at that hair... This was my first time ordering from here. It was for take-out, and when I started eating it, a strand of hair came out of the food. Really disappointing to see this level of quality from a popular restaurant like Mala Project. $23 gone down the drain.","This is hands down the best place to get dry pot, you can customize what goes in as well as the spice level. The recommended amount of ingredients is 8-10 for two people, we went with and it was a ton of food. We did end up finishing it anyway because it really was too good. Our order was glass noodles, rice cake, five spice tofu, wood ear mushroom, bamboo shoots, wakame, bok choi, potato and quail eggs with the spicy sauce. They do actually mean spicy, it was good but I am now afraid of what the super spicy level might be like. The potatoes were a bit undercooked I believe this was intentional so they would have a ""snap"" to them like the rest of the veggies but I personally didn't like it and wouldn't order them again. Everything else was amazing though, I'd recommend getting the rice cakes as the absorb the sauce and take on a lot of flavor. This is a great place to take people who may have various dietary restrictions as you can easily make things vegan, vegetarian etc. The place itself is a lot bigger than you'd think it is from the outside, with that being said it can be tough to get a table so would recommend making a reservation. I also really enjoyed the look of the place., there were a lot of plants and they even had a little disco ball in the bathroom. We were seated in a far corner which sometimes can run you the risk of being forgotten by your server but everyone was really nice and attentive, they came by often to refill our water and check on how we were doing. They have two locations this one and the one in Bryant Park but I would recommend as the menu has a lot more options, especially mushroom and veggie options. I have ordered from here as well and the food was still great and packaged very well in a tin trough thing.","Ummmmmm DRY POT IS WHERE IT IS AT YALL.I am obsessed with the spicy dry pot. You make your own, like pick and choose the different options from the various categories (veggies, proteins, etc.).If you're unsure what to get, the staff will also make recommendations for pairings. I love that they have everything from fish tofu to crab meat. Yum.This bowl is more individual and served with rice to offset any salty spices. I highly recommend eating it with rice. Staff is helpful and attentive. Restaurant is in a great location and spacious. I went right after work and was seated right away. More to the menu but I solely came here for the dry pot. And oh, affordable eats! Love that.","Ordered the Dry Pot (mild spicy) and Beef Jianbing!We both loved the Jiangbing- when you bite into it, you get an initial crunch but then taste the tender and sweet beef inside. The dry pot was a little salty, but even the mild spice was flavorful. We ordered 7 items for the dry pot, which was filling for 2 girlsOverall, the atmosphere is cozy and on the ""fancy"" side; nice vibe. We didn't expect so, but the food tastes pretty authentic!Total was around $51. Only complaint is that it is a bit pricey, especially since you pay ~$4-$6 for each item added into the dry pot",MáLà Project
746,Ordered from this restaurant. It says 30-40 minute delivery. My food never showed up!! They charged me and said they were working on it. I called three times and the restaurant never picked up the phone or gave me any answers on my food. Never ordering from here again!!,"This was NOT a weekend.  It was around 5 on a Wednesday...Highlights:Decent bar menu.Great burgers.Great beer selection.Cons:Tiny,tiny, narrow cramped place.  People standing everywhere.Very, very loud.People reaching over you to get their drinks.Was in search of a hangout I could count on for my repetitive stays in Midtown.  This place seemed like it may work based on reviews, beer choices and menu.  I like low-key, reasonably priced, bar seating that isn't so tight that you have to suck in your elbows.There were two seats at the bar open - but only one was usable because the stools were actually touching.  So I wedged myself in and made a go of it.  The bartenders were running their asses off and it took a while to get a look.  I got a beer fairly quick. It was so horribly tight and narrow that people were standing behind me against the wall and I could feel their breath.  They were reaching over me to get their drinks.  It sucked.  But I was thirsty- so I tolerated it.Normally I have 2 beers with dinner.  But I couldn't wait to get out of there.  The burger was great. But I ate it so fast - that it was not enjoyed like it deserved.  The prices were a bit high for the beer and food.  After all - it's just a bar.Got my check, and split.I guess if I'd have been there between 1pm-4pm - maybe not so crammed.  But I won't be back. Very uncomfortable.  I found an Irish Pub a couple blocks away that wasn't crammed and had a larger menu and the same beers & pricing.",I wonder who's paying these people for reviews. The buffalo chicken burger and pulled pork sandwich were disgusting. Y'all must be paying for these reviews lol,"I love this place. I come here for lunch/dinner after work and after events in the area. The food is great and beer on tap plentiful. Sonya is the highlight of our stay, shes smart as a tack and witty to boot. Come for a good time or to watch the games. Tell Sonya Gio sent ya!","Around opening time on a Saturday morning, no one else in the restaurant (not really a brunch spot). Some small table seating to the left and bar seating to the right, sat down at one of the stools and got the food menu from the bartender.Impressive draft/bottle list including several different types of beer. Settled on an IPA ($8) to go along with Mac and Cheese Bites ($12) as well as the JRB Burger ($18). Certainly expensive - hoping it's worth the cost. The mac and cheese bites are four large cubes browned perfectly and served along with a spicy aioli. Well breaded and super creamy on the inside - aioli is good, but that was too much creaminess altogether (better with straight hot sauce). Burger is served next, thick patty with bacon, onions, cheddar cheese, pickles and fries. Meat is cooked a little over the medium I asked for, though still juicy, and the bacon compliments well. Pickles are supposed to be fried (they were not), which may have been a good thing as the burger is hard to finish. Fries are your standard fare.Server here is friendly and up for conversation, and the food came out at a good pace. Seems like a great spot to watch some games (given the TVs displayed). Would come back just for the food.","Perfect New York City establishment. The lunch special is a steal, the service was spot on and the selection of beers on tap was tailored for every palate.

747,Grilled cheese - NO PLEASE. I've been in New York for 5 years and have never come across worse customer service. The entire staff is unreasonably over-entitled and refuses to accept any mistakes and criticism. OVERpriced and UNDERserviced. Highly disappointed. You're better off making your own grilled cheese and save yourself a headache and your hard-earned money.,"Creative grilled cheese sandwich place.  Ambience is ""Lower East Side"" look - graffiti inside in art shapes like a heart, and more.  Commune tables with high stools.  Some with backs and some without. I had the avocado with bacon.  It was good but I added more hot sauce to get more flavor in.","If you happen to be in the Lower East Side this is a solid place if you are definitely craving cheese. The food is inexpensive and and there is variety depending what combo you are looking for. Soup, sandwiches, mac etc. I tried the 3 Cheese Grilled Cheese and the Buffalo Mac & Cheese. I would rate both a 4/5 because they lacked some flavor so I added some hot sauce. The place is also small, so depending the time, it's a bit congested to sit in the back.","Loved the chilled out vibe I got from this place. The Mediterranean Grilled Cheese is where it's at, its a must order. Mac and cheese was amazing. Ask for Mike, very pleasant and great convo. Definitely coming back when I'm in the lower East Side.","The Cheese Grille is a really quaint little place in the Lower East Side.  We were looking for a quick bite in a fast casual restaurant, and that's what we got.  My bestie had her daughter with her, and we didn't have the inclination to eat in a formal sit-down place.  This was a good match for us.The recipes inspired me to try some of it at home.  I want to try to make my next grilled cheese with 3 different cheeses instead of with just American slices because I went here.  The tomato soup was freshly made and excellent, too.The only thing is that a restaurant specializing in comfort food like this should really have a small or a kiddie portion of something.  Kids like grilled cheese and mac & cheese.... why isn't there a kid's portion?  We asked, and they nicely said they couldn't accommodate us.  So, 4 stars instead of 5, but don't get me wrong.  This is a good place for a quick bite, and I would go back if I found myself in the area again.","Tried this place out this Saturday afternoon with my bf. The spot was super empty around 2 but we didn't mind. We ordered the crispy goat and buffalo chicken grilled cheeses. The goat cheese was delicious! The bacon added a nice crunch to every bite and the avocado surprisingly went really well with the sandwich. Buffalo chicken was what you'd expect - gooey spicy goodness.  I liked the pieces of jalapeño and the chicken wasn't bland like most buffalo chicken dishes. Overall, solid spot spot for a quick bite. They were out of like every beer besides Brooklyn lager and Heineken which was pretty disappointing but maybe they were just having an off day.",Cheese Grille
748,"We came here for brunch and I must admit that I was underwhelmed.Must try: sunchokes, fizzy sodas (non alcoholic)Missed out: PizzasIt's not unknown to my fellow yelpers that I'm not a big fan of brunch, but when a sandwich cost $20 and a pancake over $15, I am already up at arms and expect a level of service and cuisine that befit brunch items. Unfortunately, Vic's did not rise up to that expectation. The service was on the slower side, despite a fairly empty Sunday morning. The coffee refill took quite a long time throughout our meal but fortunately became more frequent towards the end of brunch.Of note, I did not try the brisket sandwich, but my wife liked it. The sunchokes are decent, however, a bit pricey for my taste. The overall ambiance is upscale hipster with high ceilings and visible kitchen and modern Italian.Food: 3 starsPrice: 2 starsAmbiance: 3 starsService: 3 stars",A very busy spot for Sunday brunch.  The brisket sandwich had tender pieces of meat that were chock full of flavor.  The soppressata pizza had thin salami pieces atop mozzarella; the crust was thin and fresh.  There was kick with an accompanying chili sauce.,"Vic's dishes should be retitled Oil + ________.  We ordered carrots, snap peas, gem salad and the pork loin.  Only the gem salad was appropriately ""dressed.""  All the other dishes were swimming in a pool of oil.  The pork also happened to be bone-dry (perchance the oil?) which made for a pretty unappealing combo.  Wasn't worth sending back given how long it took to arrive.","The best food in New York!Anything you will order, has the most unique taste!My favorite is Heirloom Carrots. My daughter's is Honey Semifredo.","Came here for brunch and was really impressed with the menu, it had a good variety and everything sounded really good. I ended up getting a Bloody Mary and a pizza. The Bloody Mary was good , nothing special just average. What really gave it the four stars though was the food! The pizza I got was delicious and the sauce had great flavor! The only thing was the bottom was very thin and got soggy fairly quickly but overall the flavors were there. Another person I was with got the fried chicken which I tried as well and it so good! I would definitely get that again if I came back.","Vic's is beautifully decorated and has a good amount of space for small or large parties. It doesn't get too noisy at all which is rare for popular NYC restaurants.The food was absolutely amazing. I appreciate how they have size option on their pastas so that you can size down if you want to order multiple and share. We got the Cacio de Pepe, ""Purses"" (I forgot the menu name) and the crispy onions. Everything was amazing. Although the crispy onions really are just fancy onion rings, they are amazing and I would go back JUST for those.",Vic's
749,"3 stars for the magnificent views, but the food was not good  don't bother spending extra $$ on the seafood ""towers"". A ""premium"" drink does not include liquor so keep that in mind. The cruise is 3 hours so plan accordingly. Wouldn't really recommend","I've been on the Bateaux Champgane brunch twice now... In general it's worth what you pay but both times we went the boat was just too HOT. And it's a real issue when it's hot outside, but still cooler than being inside... If they fix this issue I could increase my rating...","2 stars instead of 1 because the view was really nice. For starters, came here for a company party and they seated us separately even though we requested to be sat together. We are only a group of 12 and considering the tables are all long rectangle tables, I don't see why it was so hard to just seat us together. Secondly, the service was horrible. My colleague is vegetarian and she had some questions about which items on the menu were vegetarian and our server really didn't give any suggestions or was accommodating to her dietary restriction. He seemed to just want to quickly take our order and leave. When we finally got served our drinks they had no idea who ordered what. I had specifically asked for the violet hour with Rum instead of vodka and Thirdly, the food was BAD. I was lucky to have chosen the safer options on the menu, so they turned out good (butternut squash soup, short rib, sorbet) but my colleagues who got the ahi tuna, cod, and chocolate cake, weren't so lucky. Ahi tuna was not fresh and cod tasted dry and like cardboard. It was so bad that she had to ask if there was any short rib left in the kitchen so she can swap things out. Even though my short rib was eatable it was not great. It was cooked too well done and had an artificial taste to it.",The only negative for this cruise was the thick fog lol. The service and food was amazing! I had the mushroom ravioli and it was mouth watering. There was a live band that were exceptional and fit perfectly with the mood. I'd totally recommend this place to anyone.,"This makes me sad to have to write this review but I hope management reads this and finds a way to get back to how they used to be. I've been on the Bateaux New York 5 times, Bateaux Washington DC once and Bateaux France once. By far, the New York WAS my favorite. Hence why we went so many times. We thought France would definitely have the nicest one but the lack of dress code really disappointed us (as did the boat crashing while docking TWICE). We always loved the food and always ordered the short rib and the butter cake. Honestly before our last visit, it was five stars all the way. The food was always great and the service was always top notch. However, after our last visit, we won't be returning. We did a sunset cruise and ordered our favorites.The service was incredibly slow. It took them over a half hour to just bring us a piece of bread and water. Then it took them forever to bring us our champagne. By the time our second bottle of wine came, it was almost time to dock. The service was almost non existent. I couldn't even get a clean glass of water- I had to drink it with something floating inside (eww). The short rib was not hot and the flavor that it normally has was not there. The butter cake was also not the same- this is what we look forward to MOST to be honest lol. The texture was off and they added some weird, extremely sweet sauce to it, it was gross- I couldn't eat it. In addition, we were packed so tightly that we were practically eating with the table next to us. Extremely disappointing considering we splurged this time for the window seat only to be squished like sardines. My last experience was as a 1 star. Bad food. No service. The views are obviously great but for the price, I expect what they used to offer food and service wise.","Bathroom: 3; Everything else: 1 Average 2 starsLets start with the bathroom since it'll be short and concise. Its good for a boat, but it could be better. Urinals are literally next to each other so might as well have a trough. Maybe install dividers. The stalls are nice. Great ventilation since most boats are grotesquely smelling and this one was not. The soap is also diluted so it feels cheap.I know this account is mainly for bathrooms but I have to comment about the other aspects for a while. So I paid $600 for this experience for a couple. I could've had a steak for 2 at Peter Luger's, then bought two mezzanine tickets to Aladdin, watch UFC on pay per view with a full cheese spread and 3 bottles of wine for $600. I could have bought a ticket to Las Vegas, went to Marquee club, put $40 on red, then flew back to NYC for $600.Instead, I got this. I got the seafood tower. Shrimp was not fresh, date said she almost spit it out but was courteous enough to down it. The lobster tail was not boiled enough. It did not come off the exoskeleton; I had to scrape it off. The king crab was pretty good tbh. The waiter forgot the wine and appetizers, the entrée that came out was wrong, and the dessert came out 10 minutes before docking so we had to eat it really fast. To be fair, mistakes happen, but for $600, you kind of expect elite service, right? In fine dining, these mistakes are pretty rare and for 4 things to go wrong, thats like winning take 5 lottery. The bisque was good, probably the best thing on the menu since you cant really mess that up. The tuna tartare tasted a little cheap. The entrées were pretty okay. The short rib was like the short ribs I cook on my skillet. The ravioli was okay, better than the short rib. You can take out the arugula, doesn't match the taste. Cheesecake and brie was good.The experience was nice. Cool pictures, boat stuff. Live music was a 6 out of 5. Really good, extremely underrated. If the band was part of the boat I'd give the rating a 3.In conclusion, I'd say this is worth $300 for a couple's date night because I know cruises have more overhead than restaurants. But, please upgrade the food just a little and put more effort into the experience. The waiters were extremely friendly so it's the only saving face I could find from this mess.",Bateaux New York
750,"New to the neighborhood and decided to stop in to try out some Venezuelan cuisine. I got LA BESTIA arepa filled with steak, chorizo, fried queso blanco and pico. I was hungry when I came in- it really hit the spot. It's a cool location with a very diverse menu filled with different arepas, bowls, burritos, empanadas, and other specialty foods. I have no doubt this will be the first of many trips to this establishment. Shout out to White Maize for bringing this cool concept to Smith St and executing it flawlessly.","I got food poisoning today after eating the avocado chicken salad. According to reviews below, a couple who also had the chicken salad less than a week ago got food poisoning as well... I have enjoyed their food many times before in the past, but am now worried about returning.",I came in with my girlfriend on Saturday I ordered a chicken bowl without quinoa my girlfriend ordered an appetizer of tostones with a guacamole chicken Salad & a pabellon arepa we both ended with food poisoning  we were in the hospital to 7 the next morning. After that meal  not a place I would recommend to my worst enemy,"Got the vegetarian arepa and wow! Is it good! Better than those east village area spots Caracas and Arepa Factory. Totally shocked me as I've been going to those places for years. The arepa itself is so fresh and fluffy and grilled and corn-flavored, while the avocado and sweet plantains give it a creaminess and sweetness. The beans keep it filling and the white cheese is the cherry on top.Can't wait to come back and try the beef arepas and their appetizers.5 stars!!!!!!!","Yummmm. Tried the pulled beef arepa. It was delicious, but not a 5 star. I was still a little hungry after one arepa to myself, so maybe I just eat too much.  We got it to go, but the staff were nice. Maybe I'll try this place again.","Ok so I went in today all excited to find out about their special which was a seared salmon bowl with black beans, white rice, quinoa, pico, some cheese, avocado and fried plantains. At first, the dish was delicious but afterwards, it made me want to vomit! I then opted for a desert hoping that something sweet would help. I received the cake and the presentation wasn't great but I dug in anyway. In the middle, the cake was chalky like undercooked flour. They gave me an UNDERCOOKED cake and told me they could refund me for the cake but if I wanted to finish the cake I could go ahead and do so as well. I am highly disappointed as I was very excited to be eating here & surely I will never return!",White Maize
751,Ordered:Black sesame creme brûlée Matcha parfait Nice ambience but the desserts were underwhelming. Service wasn't great either. Our server did not look friendly the entire evening. We didn't feel comfortable talking to her because she was in a bad mood.,"Matcha tea is bitter and mediocre. They either didn't use ceremonial level matcha or their matcha power was not well stored and was oxidized. (I kept my matcha powder in fridge and culinary level stays very well and fresh)Dessert is good (like good Asian dessert), but don't expect like, established-restaurant level. Would eat the dessert again but wouldn't recommend to my friends to go if you only have a few days in NYC","Bad value, mediocre tea, and a hint of Japanese food.Tea, this is why you're here? No, David's tea will actually steep your tea for the appropriate time. Or is jade oolong just a bad tea? For $10/tea it better be made right. The set is as far from Japan as American Chinese food is from China. Under pickled veggies, bland pork, dressing to save the mediocre smoked salmon, yam balls of no consequence... The value was too low for me to appreciate the effort.",Came here after a workout and it was just the perfect combo of healthy and satisfying. The eel unagi rice tasted better because of the side dishes like pickled cucumber. Salmon toast.. sounds like a weird combo but somehow everything fits just right! Get this if you're hungry and craving both sweet and savoury.,"Cha-An is an adorable Japanese dessert place in the East Village. Usually on the weekend, there is a wait. I've attempted to come here for dessert twice and found the wait time to be unreasonable. Finally, one weekend I got to try it! Five of us waited 50 minutes to be seated. The tiny dessert/ restaurant is located on the 2nd floor, up a narrow flight of stairs. The area is dimmed and demurred. Most people having quiet conversations, and enjoying their drinks and desserts.We each got a dessert- which was way too many desserts. Some of the desserts were aesthetically pleasing but didn't taste great. Other desserts were tasty but not beautiful. We were sugar overloaded by the time we were done. We shared: Jewelry box- tiny lacquered box filled with miniature desserts. This was really hard to share. It was so adorable though! I loved the sakura raindrop cake (jelly). There was a blossoming sakura inside the raindrop.  3 shortbread cookies in the Jewelry Box- one was green tea, the other black sesame.Matcha truffle. It looked cute. Didn't get to try.Strawberry cake in the Jewelry Box- this was ok. It was a little dry. This was our group's least favorite. Green tea parfait- this was the best tasting dessert. There was red bean, soft fresh mochi, cornflakes, green tea ice cream. There was so many textures and flavors! I wish this was my dessert.Strawberry shaved ice- the cream and strawberries were good. The strawberries were a little bitter. Then we ran out of cream and strawberries so it was just ice that was left. Our friend was not happy.Whisked matcha affogato- this was beautiful to look at but was so bitter. I could only take a few bites.Daifuku- this soft house made mochi was ok. Green tea was soft and sweet. The Black sesame was as expected. The best one was earl grey chocolate. It tasted like chocolate truffle with a tea taste. The service was excellent (frequent water refills and check ins). I would return to eat the sakura rain drop cake, the Green tea parfait and daifuku (earl grey chocolate).","Really disappointed in this place. I was wowed the first time I came to NYC but this last visit I went here twice just to try to have a good time Neither time was a good time.They changed their lunch set from the prix fixe to donburi bowls. They weren't bad, just nothing special.The dessert and service though...The hojicha ice cream wasn't as wow as I remembered and my tea was oversteeped both times. They were also out of my favorites. The waitress forgot my boyfriend's order the second time we were there. It just wasn't a great experience and the flavors just weren't working.",Cha-An
752,"I've been to many Meatball Shops around the city as I'm a big fan of the veggie ball. The meatballs are a 4 and the manager is a 1. I happened to come to this location on a food tour for my dad's 65th birthday... The group got their meatball to taste and the manager started to tell us about the establishment/history/etc. Because we were on a public group tour where photos were encouraged my dad took a photo (seated, no flash, not disruptive) of the manager speaking. HE DID NOT LIKE THAT. He starred my dad down for 15-20 seconds and there was awkward silence throughout the group. He rudely told us ""you don't take a photo of someone without their permission."" I totally get that... but we were on a group tour with 20 tourists, you are speaking publically, and you did not state ""no photos"" before your speech. Some people capture memories with their phone, relax, and be patient with senior citizens. What we experienced was unfriendly and unprofessional. Choose another location to dine at.","First let me just say I appreciate they have vegan meatballs and they were ok, nothing special. The menu is kinda confusing. For their ""make it a bowl"" option, according to the menu, you get 1 side for $17.50 and additional $3 for an additional side. We decided for just 1 side since it's already kinda steep for a bowl of pasta. The bill came and we were charged for an additional side which we stupidly didn't question. I ordered the classic tomato sauce and honestly, it tasted like it came from a cheap jar you buy at the grocery. So for the ordinary  taste of a pasta, I'm not sure I'm willing to pay that much to make another trip here.",So I went yesterday to this location with my bf.  He ordered a bowl expecting that the balls and side order will come as separate while I ordered balls biscuit and gravy.  To start my food tasted old especially the biscuit and the gravy was cold.. only thing that was good on my plate were the eggs not even the spicy balls.  And my bf's order was completely wrong.  I mean who eats polenta with alfredo sauce?? Like I said expectation was that they would come as separate instead of being in one bowl; also the little piece of bread was stale and ordered coke which was flat with no bubbles whatsoever.  Had high expectations from this place but they failed me,"This is one interesting restaurant, the interior design will take you back in time.  I found the ambience to be quite relaxing and others conversations did not seem to carry over.  The purpose of coming here is obviously to have meatballs, the question you have to ask is how would you like to have them?  There are many different options, we chose to have them in a bowl with one side.  You choose the type of meatball, the sauce you would like with them and what you would like to eat them with.  They do have vegetarian options here as well.  I ordered the classic meatballs in a bowl with mashed potatoes and a white sauce.  The mashed potatoes were phenomenal, definitely homemade and paired perfectly with the white sauce and meatballs.  I found this to be a perfect lunch, not overwhelming on the stomach at all. Again the price point for this restaurant is just what I would expect and well worth it for what you get in return.  Cheers!!",Had the meatball/mash/BACON!!!! Did not know how these 3 will work perfect together.Returning back with more and more friends and family so they can enjoy what I love so much.,"LOVE the Meatball Shop! I have been to several of their locations, and this location is among my favorite. This is a spacious restaurant. I came here for dinner on a Saturday evening, and I was able to sit at a table immediately. The service was speedy and friendly. And, all of the food I had was super fresh, hot and delicious. I had the original meatballs (my favorite) with the traditional sauce. I always order the vegetable of the day amongst my sides. I always have wanted to order dessert here, but I never save enough room for dessert. Hopefully, one day I will!I'd definitely come back here, again!",The Meatball Shop
753,"Would've given 5 stars for food and ambience. (seriously, it was delish!). However, the service was lacking. Our server, (name starts with a J) was unfortunately inattentive. I arrived about 10 minutes before my boyfriend got to the restaurant, but waited a total of 20-25 minutes before we were asked what we wanted to drink. By that time, we were ready to order. I asked about the portions (yes-  tapas portions are small) and he said back abruptly, ""it's tapas style,"" So, we continued to order more and more things and he then goes, ""are you that hungry?"". Well, maybe if you were more specific in your answer, we could've clarified that in the beginning! Didn't see him again for several minutes, as the bartender brought us our drinks, and the food runner brought us our food.He maybe stopped by 1-2 times towards the end to ask how everything was. We also saw the server on his phone several times near the POS/bar area while we were waiting for him to come over. For people who have worked in the service industry for many years - it's not cool!","Great Monday night special - any bottle of wine over $42 is half off! We went with the L'inconscient 2015 Priorat which was very solid for $25. The ambiance was comfy/trendy but the lack of A/C was brutal (they had A/C; it was just weak). As for the food, nothing really life changing, some good dishes but they all lacked explosion and creativity that I seek when I dine out. At the end, I wondered if I could have made the whole meal myself. However, for the price points, and some quality dishes, I would return to try other things on the menu.Lamb Skewers - (definitely order) 4.5/5Eggplant - (likely order) 4.25/5Octopus - (likely order) 4.25/5Patatas Bravas -- 3.75/5Shrimp special - 2/5 was so boring. Just a bunch of shrimp in a hot pot. Cauliflower - 0/5 the one that I was most looking forward to eat. It was dry and awful. Once we used the oil from the octopus dish, oil from the shrimp dish, and the couscous from the lamb dish and mixed it all together, it was very nice.","I read the reviews and expected an awesome meal. We must have had bad luck because our meal experience was not great.- Staff insisted we order the big group menu despite being only 6 people - The group menu food was mostly terrible, especially the cabbage and the seafood paella, that nobody ate- Cocktails were good- Brussels sprouts overcooked - Tuna and beef dishes weren't great I love Spanish food and was hoping to love this place, but didn't.","MuihhBueno!I was invited by the board saying happy hour 4 to 7pm, even on Saturday,,Drinks are $5.Several choices for tapas, from 3 to 7 bucks.Good price, nice ambience, good service.It's a Yes.","Great BOGO gin and tonic deal all night on Thursday! Service was great and the ambiance was good.Giving it three stars because the food was just ok. We may have had high expectations because of all the other reviews here, but a lot of the dishes lacked flavor. We had the tomato bread, meatball, octopus, brussel sprouts and patatas bravas. Our favorite was the meatball. Overall just wish the food had more of a kick to it.","El Born is a nice restaurant with a menu that is pretty reminiscent of Somewhere in Spain.We walked in around 9:30 on Friday without a reservation and were seated right away in the back. The backyard area is perfect for a date or spending quality time with someone you actually want to hear talking as there is no music only lights,( you can faintly hear the music from the inside through the door used to carry out the food) candles and greenery. It feels like being in a backyard and so incredibly intimate. There's a stillness to it all, the location, the lack of sounds, almost like New Yorkers slowing down and taking a pause which is rare.Coliflor gratinada (The cauliflower) had a strong scent that filled the table as soon as it was brought out. The sauce was delicious and creamy. The Carxofes confitades amb idiazable (artichokes) were interesting and my partner really enjoyed the Cru de tonvina (tuna)Our sangria pitcher yielded about 5 glasses. The pistachio cake is delicious but could go without the mango as it drowns out the taste of pistachios. There was also quite a bit of mint..too much.All and all great place would come again.",El Born
754,"I mean it's good, but I thought it was strange that there was kale in a vegetarian pho.Kale is not really in the Vietnamese food group. Also, the chicken pho was only served Monday through Friday. Why the restriction, Little Mo? However, I was very impressed with the broth. Very impressed actually because it was really flavorful and not using chicken broth or some basic veggie broth like most places who serve a vegetarian option. I got the chicken char su vermicelli dish. I don't know if the chicken was bad or what not, but I had a really bad stomach ache shortly after dinner. Didn't have lettuce in this! Which is weird to me too. Usually some greens in addition to the daikon and cucumbers. But this is me being nit-picky as a Cambodian-Vietnamese person. That's all!","This place is so painfully mediocre. The broth just kinda leaves you wanting for more. And by more I mean flavor. I got the weekend beef pho, by the way. Sucks. Ive had the catfish banh mi. Sucks. The only thing that was okay were the wings with the carmelized fish sauce but even then they just like... drizzle the sauce on so there isnt much to it.",Ordered take out on a cold rainy day. Got all the way home to find they forgot my Pho. Had to go back to get it and they didn't even realize they had left it out. Not going back,"I've lived in Seattle and Orange County, two places where there's a big Vietnamese population and an abundance of pho restaurants. Growing up, I'd have pho with my family every week and had a childhood friend who's parents made it.This place's pho doesn't taste like anything I've had and it doesn't satisfy my cravings for pho. If you're a pho lover I think you will be disappointed but if you're new to it, it's a decent noodle soup overall.They got good sandwiches too.",All I had were the wings and I got the sweeter ones with a nice glaze on them. Small menu but everything looks fantastic. Next time I will try more but I wasn't that hungry. My buddy got the veggie pho and it was a huge bowl which could definitely be two meals,I love trying out new pho places when I visit new cities and this shop was great! Cool interior and food was delicious. I was surprised that they had Austin Eastciders since I'm from Austin but glad to have that with my pho. I was able to get it customized because I only like specific meats and glad they were able to accommodate. Cool coffee shop next door too. The broth was a tad heavy for me but I would definitely come back again.,Little Mo
755,The food at Osteria Morini was good but didn't meet expectation. There are better pasta options in the city. The vibe of the restaurant is also relatively dull,"After reading the positive reviews on Yelp and elsewhere, my family decided to go to Osteria Morini for brunch. Unfortunately, the experience was disappointing and ended up being both overpriced and underwhelming. We ordered the veal parmigiana and two pastas. The veal was small, undercooked, and placed on top of a pile of mayo--not exactly appetizing. The pastas were incredibly dull in flavor and not cooked al dente. Also, the service was off. There was no sense of organization in the restaurant and we really had no clue who our waiter was. Also, while we were eating, the servers/managers all sat right next to us to have a large team meeting. It was uncomfortable and simply unprofessional. Will not return.","Please do not eat here. I was really excited to try this place out especially since their sister restaurant, Ai Fiori, is a Michelin Star and we had reservations with them later in the week. Can you ever get enough Italian food? Needless to say, we cancelled that reservation due to the food quality here.  Yes, they are at different levels, but you would expect that the food would, at a minimum, be worth it's price point, which it wasn't. To begin, the bread and olive oil that was brought out was a lower quality than what we received at Eataly. Eataly. Not expected. A positive of the evening was the meatballs, but that was quickly overshadowed by rather tough pasta. The pasta seemed to have been overworked resulting in too much gluten built up and was also not thin enough resulting in a longer cooking time and tough pasta. We ordered the veal, which was under seasoned. Very disappointing. On the positive, the staff was absolutely lovely and we thoroughly enjoyed our wine! All in all, maybe worth a quick stop at the bar, but not much else.","I gotta say I didn't have high expectation when walking in cause it's kinda too close to the touristy street of Broadway to be good. But damn I was wrong. My friend and I got Burrata with candied strawberry and drizzled balsamic for appetizer. This is like combining two of my favorite things on Earth together. SO GOOD. For entree I got Mafalda with shrimp, scallops, and crabmeat. The pasta is very fresh and chewy. They sprinkled some breadcrumbs on top which adds some crispness to the whole dish. Top-notch!It can be a little pricey but not like breaking your wallet or anything.","TLDR: Solid Italian eatery by that stretch of Cleveland Place and Lafayette. This is more on the authentic side, smaller portions, not too much red sauce. Pricier but good stuff. Service could be better.I've been here a couple of times. I've always thought the food was solid but found the service to be lacking. The tables are packed a bit tight and it gets busy here frequently. It was annoying that all the tables around us had gotten their bread before we did, they sat after us too. I felt I was constantly trying to get my server's attention to just even place an order or whatever.On to the food. This is closer to the kind of food you'll find in Italy. I do like the boards you can order with different kinds of meats or spreads. On our most recent visit, we did the duck liver mousse, smoked trout and felino (type of salami) to start. They serve these with these grilled pressed medallions of bread. Awesome.The duck liver is excellent. If you've been to Tuscany and you're craving for that liver crostino - this is pretty dam close. The smoked trout was good too. However, my favorite on this board is the lardo they give you. It spread on the bread like butter but.. it's pork fat and herbs. So good.All the pastas here are $25, except on Mondays after 9. Mondays after 9PM, it's Industry Night where some pastas are $12. What a steal! They do have an extensive pasta list with some rare shapes. So if you're a pasta connoisseur.. when's the last time you saw gramigna on a menu in New York. Not too often.So we've done the Cappelletti which is similar to a ravioli. It's tossed in this truffley butter sauce with strips of prosciutto. The first time we had this, it was really good - the second time something was lacking. The pasta a bit too al dente and the sauce was kind of bland. Most recently I got the Mafalde which shrimp, scallops and crab. Imagine thin ribbons of lasagna, tossed in seafood. It wasn't bad but nothing really stood out to me on this.I haven't tried their entrees yet, so I'll have to report back. So far, I think the meat/spread boards are their strongest offering. So while I wasn't blown away by Morini, I'm still down to give it another try.","Good stopover around 10 PM on a Tuesday night for a glass of wine and some meatballs. Was solo celebrating finishing a 10 week certificate for work and felt like treating myself. Soho is notoriously expensive and most of the dining options are overrated but this one felt almost righteous. Bar service was prompt and it was nice to be able to sit in peace and sip my wine. For $20, the appetizer meatballs is a filling portion. Comes with four to a serving with two delicious pieces of crusty bread. Sauce is on point. Don't think I would go out of my way for it, but overall, a solid option in the neighborhood.",Osteria Morini Manhattan
756,"Came here on a Friday night expecting a long wait, but the line moved quickly as the majority of the parties ahead of us decided to leave. I personally thought the burgers were decent, three star worthy. Burgers were juicy and tender; however, not overtly memorable and the bun was completely soggy.What made this restaurant a 1 Star was the service which was incredibly rude and racist. Including tip, I gave $40 and asked for $2 back. The waitress came back and said ""in America, we usually tip 20%. But fine, if you want your money then here"" and threw two dollars on the table and walked away. I'm Asian, born in the Midwest and raised in California so yes I am American. Other than NYC, tip is not 20% in America... And 20% would have been $39 total. It's unbelievably problematic and inappropriate that she would make such a racist comment, and all for a dollar. Zero chance I'd ever come back.","FOR NON POCIf you like your burgers with a side of WHITE SUPREMACY this is your spot! What can you expect from a UES place like this! Upon entering was barked at by the host with a very rude ""Can I help you??"" We where only going to stop by for drinks. As I waited by the bar I was rudely and intentionally bumped by the waitress and I even over hear a couple say ""what is he doing here?"" DISGUSTING!","Came here awhile back. I was honestly so excited to come try the burgers here that I've had in my bookmarks for years. I heard this was Bobby flays favorite burger joint so it was of course a must try. I don't know if Bobby gets special treatment here because it was nothing I expected from a great tasting burger. First off my burger patty needed salt? It taste like they didn't add any seasoning whatsoever. Second I ordered the bacon burger and my bacon was cold and over cooked. Like it was cooked hours ago and almost burnt. How could you mess up bacon? I'm honestly so sad even complaining about it because I wanted it to be great. Maybe I went on a bad day or time, who knows. I made my whole group come eat here and they all thought the same. Maybe I'll give it another shot next time I'm in town but seriously disappointed from my last trip.","What a cute great affordable place! We just had to try the burgers after we saw Bobby Flay has been eating them for years and recommended on the Flay List show. Atmosphere was cozy and warm feeling. Small place at this location. No wait at 6pm on a friday, we sat right now. The place was filled though. The burger was crunchy on the outside and very flavorful but not too meaty tasting. Sometimes thick burgers taste too meaty but this was delicious. Definitely make it a cheeseburger! And they give you lots of pickles and onions to put on top which I love. Super affordable at 12.50The cottage fries were really good too. They are thick chips that are crunchy on the outside but have fluffy potato on the inside. Very good,  I would take these over fries any day. And I like how they are served plain so you can put the amount of salt you want on them. We had the chocolate chip cake for dessert since I have a sweet tooth. Which was a rich chocolate cake. The iceing was very sugary. Tasted like an entenmanns cake but in a good way. And they have whipped cream on the side. Nice to have something sweet after a burger. Can't wait to come back again. I kind of want to try the turkey sandwhich but I don't want to not get the burger again b.c it was the best burger I had at a restaraunt!","Okay so, before I get into this.. the burgers here are really really good. It's not my first time here, and I've been to the other locations. It might've been an off day but I will tell you what went down. I came with a group of 5 for my birthday, because this my absolute favorite spot for burgers in NYC. The old school vibe, the simple just burger and bun type of deal. Nothing super fancy or extra. I ordered a cheeseburger, extra cheese - Medium Rare and everyone else at the table got their burgers Medium Well. For starters I think I got a medium closer to medium-well burger while everyone else got a Well done for sure. Not a good start as it's a burger place so you'd expect it to be spot on if not close. My cheese was just barely melted and I've had cheese melted here where it's hugging the burger pretty much. The taste was there, but the technique just missed my expectations from the past and it was a disappointment. I was excited to finally be back after they closed for renovations. I just hope that next time I go I get the experience I use to get back in the day. Maybe it was too busy when I went (Sunday afternoon) but I would absolutely recommend everyone to give it try. It's not bad, just maybe a bad day. I will be back and will update if it changes!","J.G. Melon truly has one of the best burgers in New York, delicious, juicy, the cheese melted perfectly and the cottage fries come nice and hot right from the fryer.The service was okay, I wanted to sit at the bar but was full, so was seated in the dining area, I was ready to order as soon as I came in but had to flag down the waiter to get him to take my order.Looking to have a great burger while in New York look no further than J.G. Melon and don't forget the restaurant is cash only",J.G. Melon

My wife and In had our wedding brunch there. Management was accommodating and provided great services and tended to all of our needs. Thank you The Douglass!The appetizers are amazing especially the mac & cheese bites and their buffalo wings are perfect. The service there is attentive and prompt. They have a variety of beers on tap. My wife and I travel all the way from Washington Heights to hang out on Fridays, some Saturday nights and we frequent brunch there. It's a bonus that it is also a Rugby friendly bar. Definitely worth checking out!!!","We greatly enjoyed our first visit to The Douglass Public House, or The Douglas as it also seems to be known. We were hungry, and with this establishment residing just a block away, it was calling to us! So, we decided to give it another try on this Sunday evening. Last time we ate here, it was very busy, prompting us to make a quick online reservation. As it happened, it wasn't necessary on this visit.Service was very good, and we ordered our dinners: * Plain Jane Burger (with Swiss): Custom Pat LaFrieda blend and build your own burger from over 20 toppings* Personal Chicken Pot PieWe very much like the friendly pub ambience here and enjoyed the open windows on this warm evening. Our dinners arrived within about 10 minutes, and we found the burger to be perfectly cooked, and the chicken pot pie to be delicious. There were large chucks of chicken in a lovely sauce, with potatoes and carrots underneath a tasty puff pastry.Great comfort food - just what you would hope to find at a local pub. We look forward to our return.","This was the first time in this area of Brooklyn, so we Yelped some restaurants and arrived at The Douglas. It has a pleasant pub type atmosphere, and we were please to be provided an immediate table by the window.  The service was excellent and we opted for the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup, and a build your own burger with fires. Yes, this would not exactly qualify as a low cal meal! While waiting for our dinners, we were able to take in the old tin ceiling, and rustic pub ambiance of this restaurant. And we liked what we saw. Our food arrived quickly, and the cheeseburger was fantastic, one of the best burgers we've had in some time. It was perfectly cooked (medium - as in pink, warm and juicy in the middle). The fries were hot and crispy. The grilled cheese sandwich arrived in three halves (1.5 sandwiches) that accompanied the tomato soup. The soup was slightly spicy and very tasty, thick and creamy. The sandwich was delicious, hearty and filling. We happened to arrive on the early side, around 4:30. By the time we left, a line was forming, as this seems to be a very popular place. If you're looking for comfort food, check this place out. We'd be happy to return.",The Douglass Public House
758,"I called Nerai to make a reservation and never got a person however, the recording states they are open for dinner service on Sundays 5-9. We went on Sunday around 6pm, and they were not open. The answering machine needs to be changed. We went back on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch. We ordered the Greek salad which to me looked poorly put together, with a few large cut tomatoes and a few small. It looked as though they ran out of one or the other.. the feta was the only thing enjoyable about this tiny $19 Greek salad. I ordered the grilled shrimp skewer which came with four over cooked shrimp(they were hard), sautéed greens with no seasoning (even though it states a mixed green salad) and lemon potatoes that were so tart they were inedible. One of the four shrimp was filthy and not deveined(DISGUSTING) which, is both disappointing and unacceptable in a restaurant charging $26 for four shrimp for a lunch sized portion. I told the waiter about the not deveined shrimp and he brought out a new plate completely, with four cleaned shrimp. The shrimp were all deveined however once again, completely over cooked and this time the dish had a salad, not sautéed greens. To sum it up... this restaurant is very inconsistent and very over rated.","Awful dining experience. The restaurant aesthetic is chic; however, the food quality can only be called typical Greek fare and certainly not evening above average. The drinks were disgusting and offensive to the palette. The atmosphere created by the waitstaff is conniving and uncomfortable. Like some previous customers, we were deceived into getting mezzas and forced into getting deserts. When I sought to have the waitstaff and then management correct these issues, we were ignored on several occasions. I do not recommend going here.","Exceptionally disappointing. There is little Greek here except for the names of the dishes and the lousy wine list. The food is fair.  Often over seasoned, small in portions and very much over priced except for its location. Wine list for glasses is very limited and very pricey for completely in exceptional, poor choices. This is a ""no tipping""place which adds to its problems. I'm a very generous tipper but here the quality and portions being poor and small, I can only hope the server staff is compensated well given the stiff prices for such low quality. Servers here are very attentive and accommodating. I did not complain about the first wine ordered but when they asked me if I was enjoying it I had to say I was not.  They then offered an alternative - which I thought was very nice. Unfortunately it was as poor as the first and their description of them was quite off.  $18 a glass for swill is too high. I've had far better Greek salads in Astoria at storefront mom and pops. The grocery store tomato's almost looked like a joke for poor produce. The salmon tasted swampy and was pan seared,  not grilled. The accompanying rice puckers salty making it inedible. The meatball ap which was supposed to lamb and beef tasted only of the latter, and the ""whipped goat cheese""was non existent. Only an insipid tomato sauce. 18 for 3 smaller than golf balls meatballs.  Short ribs were good - they usually are everywhere - but the orzo accompaniment depressingly over seasoned and cheap tasting tomato sauce.  Spinach side - a child's portion at 14 - again puckery salty to the point of not being edible.  Seriously they are flying under a false Greek flag. ""New American "" would be more suited.  For high quality upscale Greek, Periyali is a far better choice and there are several others. The space is upscale, true to the neighborhood, but the quality/value ratio way too low. Completely forgettable.","Decided to have dinner here for my fiancée's birthday and it was such a great choice. We'd been meaning to try Nerai for over a year and are so glad we finally did.The weather happened to be beautiful so we took a table on the patio out front. We went with the 6-course chef's tasting and many a cocktail to accompany our meals. The pacing of the dishes was excellent and so were the portions. The tasting started with a Greek salad (fresh & tasty), followed by Octopus over Santorini fava (something we love and it was perfect). Fisherman's stew came next. It was a delicious piece of fish in light broth with veggies. Next, we had squid ink pasta with lobster; that was buttery and light. Our main course of lamb rack was excellent. For dessert, we each had a variety plate of pistachio gelato, tahini mousse, and some other cremes. They brought out a beautiful olive oil cake for my fiancées birthday and it was delicious. I requested a fig old fashioned and they made a lovely cocktail which I ended up having several of. Service was superb; our server Dimitri was super attentive and accommodating without ever intruding. We had a satisfying night and would definitely come back to try more of the menu.","Last night was my second time dining at Nerai. I don't know if it was 5 star-worthy though, possibly just because I was so enchanted during my first dinner there that this time failed to measure up. Also not sure if they changed chefs between my first and second visit, but I wouldn't be surprised. We went for the 4 course tasting menu and I had:Tuna tartare (starter): possibly one of the smallest tuna tartares I've ever had. That did end up being a blessing later because of the massive size of the main dish. My bigger issue is that it was too citrusy--normally I don't have an issue with that, but this just felt like it was bathed in lemon juice and a bit sour. I think the octopus that my mom had was better. Pastitsada (pasta dish): I would've probably given this full marks except for the fact that it was impeccable the last time I had it and this time, it unfortunately wasn't as good. The braised short rib was done to perfection, just wish there was more of it sprinkled within the pasta. Chicken and lemon gnocchi (main dish): I almost always end up choosing an appetizer as the best of the night whenever I'm having a multicourse serving (about 8 out of 10 times). However, this dish was by far the best of the evening. The gnocchi was ridiculously great. The chicken also was flavorful and tender, I was just sad I couldn't finish it all because by that point, I was already getting really full. Blonde chocolate mousse w/ raspberry (dessert): all's well that ends well. Super solid way to finish off the meal. Not too sweet and with an interesting flavor.I was satisfied. I think I'd try it again to see if the third time matches the first.","In one word: overpriced We tried a few appetizers. They were all just okay. Nothing special. In particular, I thought that the octopus was mediocre, so I was surprised by all of the positive reviews. The biggest disappointment though was the lamb. This just wasn't very flavorful... the lamb itself didn't taste very strong, and also it seemed pretty underseasoned. At $44, I felt that it was a major rip off. The waiter recommended the bread pudding for desert, and this basically was in line with the preceding courses: very average, and overpriced. The only good thing really was the service, which was friendly and they did check on us often. Will definitely not return.",Nerai
759,"A place to get Japanese skewers, appetizer, ramen, don buri etc etc. They really have lots of food choices.I got potato salad to start and it was goood.Howevehh, i came for the skewer. But uh, it was dryyy. No no no. Pro : Potato salad, seated right away, reasonable priceCon : Not so warm service by my waiter (wish next time I'll just get a nice and polite japanese server), a bit disappointing skewer.The saving points are really their food variety and good price.",Chill spot in the East Village that looks to provide an authentic Japanese experience. Unfortunately the food wasn't memorable for the right reasons. The Japanese fried chicken was very undercooked. Chicken liver and bacon wrapped scallops were the best things I ordered.,"Came here around 11:30 at night after ezoo. It was very busy despite it being very late at night. I ordered the spicy ramen and it was okay, but lacked a lot of extra stuff like fish balls or seaweed. It only had three slices of pork in it. For ramen in a simple broth, it was not worth $13.","A good place for late night snack/food. Had the Japanese streetfood/bar feel. A little bit cramped inside, but had the cosiness. The place wouldn't be good for big groups, probably max of 5. But I is also a good place for solo eaters.Went here at midnight, and we were seated immediately. The server was very attentive to us, he also suggested us drinks that we found very good. We ordered the Calpico-Soju, Tamago, and Chicken (Tori) Yakitori. Like most asian places, these plates could be shared amongst (2-3) people. Our bill came up to a total of ~$33 ($16.5 split between 2 people).The tamago was sliced thickly. It didn't have the usual sweet taste that I've been used to, but the tamago's texture and taste were something that would make you want to bite more into it. Kind of like a taste of home cooked omelette. The tori yakitori was plentiful to share. The sauce wasn't too sweet. Overall, the food and drinks' taste-wise is good. The size are shareable between 2 people. The price set per item in the menu is affordable. And the service was good.Would definitely come back here for late night food trips!","Not a good experience at 12:30 am on a weds night. Skewers were served as if they were precooked and then warmed up. - tough beef tongue skewers - undercooked liver- overly salty spicy ramen - either super hard (not even crispy) or too soft chicken skin- undercooked takoyaki balls Everything was either undercooked, overcooked, and overly salty. Not a great experience for my friend who came all the way from another town to try. The only plus was that two servers were approachable and welcoming in the middle of night. The chef, on the other hand, must've gave up.","Came with my smallgroup, but jk actually 10 people! They fit us in the back pretty tight lol. Food: pre good , the eel was my fav. Didn't like ginger in the salmon noodles. The takoyaki was decent too! Service: was pre quick got seated in 5 min. They didn't tell us there is a $10 min for each person before we sat down tho.Price: shared 3 dish was about $13 including tip tax . Avg for nycFood was pre avg beside the eel don buri.Would come back for the skewers! The beef ball was the best IMO.",Yakitori Taisho
760,"First Time I came we by I just wanted to try the place so we got a few appetizers to go; though the portions were very small & the place was extremely expensive ($65 ffor 4 appetizers) it was ok.Stopped in for dinner the other night - totally different experience. I was greeted by 2 black guys behind the counter they me & my sister the look of death as soon as we walked in. The server that seated us was nice and sat  us right away - place was dead anyway.We ordered the salmon salad which was bone dry and hard as a rock. It was so small, not even a descent portionsWe ordered grilled fish tacos w out mayo- Which came out deep fried in lard and super greesy. Gross....Then we shared another salad and asked for dressing on the side/ that came out drenched in oil w dressing on the side.I think they purposely ruined our meals because we were 2 little white girls....$109 later and a stomach ache to boot we left. For good.Anyway- never","I've been here to pick up raw seafood before. That was okay.This time I tried the restaurant. It was so gross. I got fish and chips, two orders for $40 total. Not worth it at all, save your money. The fish and chips were extremely over salted. I could barely taste the fish and fries. They both tasted like the chef dropped the entire bottle of salt into the fryer.I wouldn't recommend this place or come back here.","I have been here a few times and it was amazing! A lady cooked our food and she was fantastic. This last time was horrendous and changed our mind for good! We waited 45 mins. A bunch of tables and bar area opened up and instead of placing us at the table he placed us right in front of the hottest area in the place the cook top!  As soon as we sat the music went up to the most annoying  decimal of loud I couldn't hear, and it was so hot..  We ordered fried fish tacos, and a fish bowl.  The tacos were over cooked and burnt. The fish bowl was short of a salt lick. Super disappointing..  I'm not sure where the lady chef went but it is short of disappointing she wasn't there the night we were.  Dinner was inedible","Had the most delicious oysters, crudo and ceviche at the bar. Staff was easygoing yet professional and the general vibe was wonderful. Loved everything! Will be back for sure.","I really wanted to love this place and I have a thing for corner restaurants, I find them to be great places and very cozy. Walked in, the fresh seafood is to your left, then the back left corner of the restaurant is a bar, then there are a few 2 tops. Not a lot of seating.Fried fish with french fries is $20. The fish and fries were extremely over salted, the fish itself was a little bigger than my palm. The small portion and the heavy salt made it impossible to enjoy my meal, I won't be back. I am STILL trying to find a good place in NYC where I can get my fried fish fix","I so loved Greenpoint! Who loves walking into a fish market/restaurant and not smelling fish. GP is super clean and the staff is nice. We were seated immediately and checked out the daily selection and the menu. We ordered the fish chowder it had great flavor, with chunks of fish and potato. It was def a great start considering it was freezing outside! We also ordered fried fish tacos. The fish was John Dory. They were super crunchy, but def juicy and moist.  The aioli def went well and the radish was crunchy and finished the taco off well! We also ordered a rice bowl with the fish of the day. It was Arctic char. I must say this was awesome. The skin on this fish was cooked on point! It was like breaking glass that how crunchy it was. It was perfectly seasoned.  The bowl came with crunchy cabbage, jasmine rice and a mango salsa which went great with the fish.  Big props to the chef last night what an awesome dinner!! Greenpoint is a must try for great food and layed back atmosphere.  I will def be back and you should def go and check them out!!(267)",Greenpoint Fish & Lobster
761,"All class, pure civilization. A few proper pints in the bar, followed by dinner in the dining room. There was a minor mix up with our food order, but the French fellow was a professional and rectified it immediately. No worries.The dining room is small, but not tight. The artwork is interesting, and the bop/postbop soundtrack including some obscure Jackie McLean was much appreciated.The wine list is very well thought out. The scotch egg is light, and cooked with a soft yolk.The chicken tikka is my favorite in the city. My only complaint is that there is no bread put on the table. New addition to the list of regular stops.","Very English-atmospheric pub in a hotel basement a couple blocks from the Morgan Library, so convenient for lunch when I was spending the day there.  There's only one (bottled) English cider on the drinks menu (though there are plenty of American ones), and when you order it they'll come back later and ask if you didn't mean the lager from the same brand instead.Among the appetizers, Scotch egg.  This was good; sausage tasty though not particularly thick, and the egg yolk is not quite hard boiled, which I really liked.Had a Cobb salad, not particularly notable except that, by doubling the price, I was able to have salmon added, which came in a large but very tender chunk on top, which was possible to break up and mix with the greens.","Came here for dinner... it may be a good place to go for drinks, but not for food IMO. Ordered the fish and chips. First of all, it's a fairly small amount of food. The solitary fish was relatively small. Taste was ok, but I think the batter to fish ratio was so high. Fries were good. Ordered the sticky date toffee pudding for dinner which was terrible. It was not sweet at all. And had no date flavor. Easily the worst I've ever had (including compared to ones that I've bought from the supermarket). Service was poor. I don't think anyone smiled. And they continuously kept returning and asking if we were ready for them to collect our plates (while one of the people were still eating)... the restaurant was empty btw. Won't return.","My review is mostly based on hosting a private event at the Shakespeare, however we did dine here twice to make sure it was the right choice for our rehearsal dinner.We had a large task - possibly seating for 75 people, Friday night private rooms, a want of outdoor space and keeping the tab under 10k. After we searched around at least 20 other places in NYC the Shakespeare dining rooms were perfect- we rented the two back rooms which I believe comfortably sat 68 (we risked it) and they came with their outdoor patio for no extra cost and a total rental time of 3.5 hours (which was .5 longer than any other restaurant we had checked out). We dined here twice to make sure we liked the food, not a big English food lover but the Shepard's pie was outstanding and the drinks were perfect so we decided this was the place. Plus - the in-laws are English and the grooms side is all from out of town so this combined a speakeasy New York feel with a good ole English pub scene.We were able to have almost a cocktail hour before dinner where people had an easy flow through the rooms and outdoors and eventually all the seating was indoors. The menu and drink pricing was beyond reasonable compared to anywhere else we looked, we chose to go with burgers, salmon or Shepard's pie (with lamb) as our main courses, and our menus allowed for each guest to have 3 choices on apps and 3 choices on dessert. Their drink menu you cold choose Bee&wine, house liquor, or top shelf depending on your budget. After our initial booking our experience was a little weary as I think the event planner at the Shakespeare changed 2-3 times between our booking and event date. It seemed we had to re-explain our booking and what we were promised to each new person even though it was in our contract. However, in the long run, the latest planner was able to work with my MIL and create personalized menus, rearrange costs to stay in budget with also adding some hor doeuvres and suggest a florist to help decorate the room.Our rehearsal dinner was so fun! Everything ran smoothly, the service was superb, they provided a microphone and speakers for the speech and the food was delicious. Additionally - it was such a great venue because after dinner was over we suggested all guests go downstairs to the pub for hang outs and drinks.

She recommended this place for some awesome pub food. Finding the place was a bit difficult but it was very cool hole in a wall. Food overall was very good.   It was obvious that my friend was a regular. Service was friendly and knowledgeable. The first dish we ordered was their appetizer special homemade burrata with zucchini to share.  The portion size was ideal for one but we split in half. The dish was a great start and complemented our happy hour drinks. In this case I ordered a cider which was a great portion for the price I paid. We moved along with the main orders. I had the chicken sandwich and fries. The sandwich was a close to perfect balance of bread to chicken and the chicken was breaded and fried to perfection. The fries were definitely homemade and authentic like a true chip British style. My friend ordered the traditional fish and chips which was pricey for the portion she received. She loved her meal but unfortunately they only serve fish and chips as the main entree and she recalled seeing as an appetizer.  Personally I would definitely take my friends here for happy hour. It's a great hole in the wall located secretly below or within a hotel. I want to try their other dishes especially their shepherd's pie and burger.,The Shakespeare
762,Top 5 restaurant in NYC.This place never disappoints.It's definitely where Italian food meets farm to table.All the dishes are excellent and ingredients really high quality. The lightly fried artichoke is ridiculous.The meatballs are delicious.The fried calamari is probably the best I've had.The Pacceri alla Norma is a killer pasta dish.Love it.,Lunch in NYC - Prosciutto and Arugula Pizza & Homemade Pasta with New Zealand Cockles,Havent been in Yelp in while. Hello people. I took my children to San Gennaro Feast for the first time today so they could have the experience for the first time. So we get there and while in the main street its almost like being in a movie theatre in the way of you know you are going to be robbed just dont know how much - like at a movie you pay 10$ for popcorn etc so 5$ slice of pizza doesnt seem unfair. So we try to get a table at a few restaurants on Mulberry St and they were a little crowded so I decided to go to Mott St - 1 block away. This place seemed nice and had nice menu - we got there at 4:50 and they told us the menu is limited and gave us some abbreviated menu - he never told us if we wait 10 minutes we can order from the main menu. Is this the most ridiculous you ever heard? so we settled for a pizza $25 with 2 slices of prosciutto on it and a bowl of pasta also $25 - very expensive and not really that good. the cherry on the cake was my son and I ordered 2 sodas - 10 oz bottles - $4 each!!!there are ways to rob customers and them not know. This place should find a better system to rip people off since everything we got was blatant robbery.,"At this point, I've come here at least 738262 times for one reason only - the prosciutto & arugula pizza. It's *always* made to perfection. The prosciutto, which isn't too salty, pairs perfectly with the arugula, cherry tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella and huge chunks of grana padano. SO GOOD. I get this every time I come here - whether with friends or on a date.If I'm in the mood to switch things up, I'll order one of their pastas which, thus far, have been quite tasty. I've gotten the pappardelle bolognese and rigatoni alla norcina but would probably choose the bolognese over the rigatoni (the rigatoni was a little too salty for me). This is also a cute spot for any occasion - brunch with friends (they have a nice seating area in the back with a skylight) or an intimate dinner date. Definitely check this place out!!","Emporio serves one of the best gluten free crust pizzas in Manhattan. They up-charge $3 for it, but it's worth it. We got the prosciutto and arugula and absolutely loved it, but considering how fresh and delicious it was, I'm sure all the other options would be just as fantastic. Also a great atmosphere, cozy setup, and sweet Italian manager.","I needed a spot pretty last minute to have brunch on Labor Day and found Emporio. Emporio was offering reservations on Seated, so I made one for 12:15pm. Super easy and we were seated right away. I had their Prosciutto Eggs Benedict, mom had their Squid Ink Pasta, and sister had the Pappardelle. Everything was very tasty. I really enjoyed my eggs benedict. It came with some mixed greens and potatoes, which worked well to soak up my egg yolk. Service was A-OK and we had a good brunch.",Emporio
763,Awful service and overpriced drinks. The short male bartender is incredibly rude and ignores patrons on purpose. Funny enough I went next door and heard a couple complaining about his service too. Will not be back.,"Not sure if we came in on an off day because it was not to the standard of other reviews.My girlfriend and I both got cocktails, mine was quite good - a bourbon based one, but hers was a tequila based drink that tasted like none of the ingredients that were described.The worst part of it was the Olives.. they charge $7 (not the $6 shown on their online menu) for ""marinated olives"" which are supposed to come marinated in Rosemary, Citrus Oil & Chili Flakes. What I got had no rosemary, oil or chili and was literally straight out of a cheap jar of olives one can buy at a supermarket. They even gave us a bowl to throw out the olive pits WHEN THERE WERE NONE INSIDE THE OLIVES!Left feeling totally ripped off.","AVOID this place I do NOT recommend this place at all  !!  the attitude of the owner or bar tender that was there last night , was just annoying and disgusting so the place is great OK but this person is just awful , difficult to get a glass of water after two glasses of wine  ?? I even offer to pay for a bottle !  ,also one of my friend needed to charge her phone it was no as well ! he made everything annoying and difficult, there are many other options where you will be well received not only for your money !","Randomly stumbled on this place looking for happy hour specials. Great spot. Owners are very thoughtful and professional. They made sure my friend and I were comfortable and not bothered by other bar patrons. I've never experienced that kind of thoughtfulness and it was very much appreciated.  They have open mic nights which is so fun to meet new creative people. Some of the acts were really good too, actually most of them were. The bar eats are good too, like the grilled cheese and fries which are as good as the other reviews say. I would recommend this spot to anyone in the area.","This bar is absolutely incredible. Let's start with the ambiance and decor...STUNNING. The bar is so beautiful and full of gorgeous details. I like it because you can dress up for a night out with your girlfriends or go casual and grab a quick drink. Plenty of space for small and large groups.Prices: totally killer! They have a great happy hour and their cocktail menu has completely reasonable prices.Drinks and food: AMAZING. The food is available until midnight and the fries are TO DIE FOR. Definitely try those and the grilled cheese.The cocktails are some of the best I have tried. They have cocktails curated in house as well as the classics.Staff: super friendly and great at giving suggestions.Overall, such a great gem in this neighborhood! 100 percent my favorite bar in the E. Williamsburg area!!","I live close by and this is the perfect neighborhood bar. Great happy hour specials, well-crafted and reasonably-priced cocktails, and solid bar snacks -- all in a space that never seems to feel crowded. (oh, and a nice pup sometimes hangs around on weekends -- what more can you ask for?)",The Topaz
764,"An exceptional dining experience. The whole package was quality, from making a reservation, to being greeted at the door, the service, the food.True professionals, the entire staff.The stuffed flat bread and lasagna exceed all the hype.","We managed to get a reservation a month in advance. The food was good and the drink menu was very extensive. Their famous lasagne for two had very thin pasta sheets which i liked. But I'm not a big fan of heavy spices especially star anise and dill, and I could taste that in the minced meat :( not the biggest deal but just personal preference. Desserts had a (quite noticeable) touch of salt/savory (we tried two) which was welcoming but a little overdone. I kept drinking water for the rest of the night at home",Top 5 meals Ive ever had in my life. My question is to anyone who wouldnt give it 5 stars. We got the flatbread to start and the veal tartar with The lasagna and broccoli to share. My boyfriend and I were both dying. The cocktails were incredible too. I didnt want the meal to end!,"If I have to name my Top 3 Restaurants in New York City, Don Angie would easily be in that list. Hands down one of the best and most enjoyable dining experience of my life! To start with, this restaurant already holds a special place in our hearts because this is where we held our small post City hall wedding celebration last year and I fondly remember how they made us feel special and gave us that corner table on the right side, upon entering the restaurant. We had the most wonderful meal as we toasted to our newly married bliss. Since then, we were captivated and vowed to come back as often as possible. Coming back however proved to be quite a challenge because they were always full and it was so hard to get a reservation. On our wedding anniversary, we tried to come back but couldn't get a reservation. Fast forward to 3 weeks ago, and just after finishing watching Tootsie on Broadway, I got an alert from Resy that there was an available table and so we immediately grabbed it.It turned out to be the wedding anniversary celebration that we initially hoped for and more. Damien warmly welcomed us and upon finding out from us that we were there for our wedding celebration last year, he personally made sure that we were really taken care of. He asked Kyle to personally look after us and our table and the rest of the evening went by perfectly. We initially were dreaming about their lasagna but we felt celebratory so we indulged in ordering more and trying their other dishes which were all honestly incredible. My husband especially loved the Stuffed Garlic Flatbread and with all those melted cheese, it was a thinner pizza. Delicious! I got to try the prosciutto with melon and wow, what a revelation. We of course ordered the lasagna (and ended up taking this home instead) but we were distracted by the two other pasta dishes which were scene stealers in a way: the Sopresinni with Smoked Mussels and the Buffalo Milk Caramelle. These two dishes were so unbelievably mouthwatering good! All of these paired perfectly with their prosecco too! And lastly, even if we were full, we just couldn't pass up on the dessert we had in mind because, we wanted to bring back the memory of our wedding night, so we had the Honey Zeppole which was made of Sicilian Pistachio and Whipped Robiola. So divine!!I will let the rest of my pictures tell the story. Anyone who appreciates incredible food and fantastic service deserves to experience all that this place has to offer. One for the books! Thanks again Damien and Kyle for taking such great care of us, it was absolutely worth the wait!","TLDR: New school Italian American. Difficult restaurant to dine at but if you can snag a table - definitely go. A lot of unique menu offerings but it can get pricey quickly.Don Angie reminds me a lot of Lilia's. You open RESY and it always just says ""Notify Me"". DA is part of this new wave of Manhattan restaurants that are so busy, all you can do is wait list yourself.It's a cozy spot near the Greenwich Village Equinox, grab an outdoor seat if the weather permits and if they have availability. You'll be much more comfortable out here and it can get loud in the dining room.I've eaten here several times but my quick recommendations are:Stuffed Garlic FlatbreadTonnato VitelloBBQ CalamariStracchino GnocchiBuffalo Milk CaramellePrime Rib Braciole for TwoThe garlic flatbread is the thinnest stuffed bread I've ever eaten. You almost wonder how they even stuff the cheese in this thing. It's garlicky, gooey and just oh so delicious. The veal tartare and tuna carpaccio is unique. It's a rarer appetizer to see on menus but they way they do it here - it's delightfully crispy, that lemon adds a nice acidity.. very refreshing. The BBQ calamari is good but a bit rich, especially with the pepperoni.I've had every pasta they offer on their standard menu. The gnocchi and caramelle are very unique - the preparation, the pasta shape, everything. I've not seen this offered anywhere else. The only downside is these two pastas are crazy small. It's like 8 pieces per order, seriously. The lasagna is very popular and it's plated cool but I think they have better dishes. It's also quite expensive for a lasagna.Other than the garlic flatbread, the prime rib braciole is what keeps me coming back here. It is very pricey, its $116 for 2 but so worth it. They only make about 3 or 4 per evening, so if you're interested - ask right when you get there if they have it. It's just a luscious dish. The prime rib juicy, rolled with provolone cheese, breadcrumbs, garlic and comes together that's just wow. They serve it with a tomato polenta that's pretty great too but every slice of that beef.. you'll know why you go through the hassle of eating here.For dessert, try the zeppoles. I'm not crazy about zeppole (fried donut basically) it's not super oily here. Here it has that doughy consistency of like.. takoyaki! Sweet though obviously, the pistachios and the whipped robiola. If you're like me and don't care for zeppoles, you will be changed here.I like Don Angie a lot. I don't think it's the greatest Italian restaurant ever but I think what they have to offer is special. It's a unique menu and definitely sets them apart from the crowd. I liked that they were able to serve me things that surprised me.","I went here against the recommendation of one of my dearest foodie friends and unfortunately she was right. TLDR: Skip this place and go to one of the many other amazing Italian restaurants in the neighborhood instead.My friends and I, a group of four, walked in early on a Thursday evening and were given the last walk in table for a party of the four available at the time. I actually do not recommend walking in with a party that big because it's really a crapshoot if you can get in or not.The ambiance here is cute and I would say the service is over eager if anything. We had a Seinfeld like sketch with the umbrella.. I recommend just trying to go without if you can withstand the sun.My table ordered the garlic flat bread, chrysanthemum salad, bbq calamari and lasagna in addition to a ton of drinks. The appetizers were rich and decedent so not something you can eat large amounts of before pasta. Unfortunately the lasagna... I just don't get why this is so popular. I saw it on every table but I've made much better lasagnas than this for a fraction of the cost that they charged. Nobody at my table enjoyed this and even though we were splitting between four people, we did not finish it. The drinks were of varied popularity with my group - none of us enjoyed our first round but the second round was much better - but the inconsistency at this price point is not acceptable and why I don't recommend the bar either.I'm glad I came to try this restaurant but I would not recommend it considering you can walk down the street and have absolutely amazing pasta in a similarly cute atmosphere.",Don Angie
765,"Not at all impressed with our meal here. Salads were fairly basic and over dressed.  The veal dishes we ordered lacked any depth of flavor and the meat was quite chewy.  Also be careful about making any substitutions. When I asked to switch out the mashed potatoes for the pasta that came with certain other dishes, I was told no problem and received a small portion of linguine on my plate. Surprisingly the bill showed an up charge of $4 without the waiter ever mentioning anything. Not a good business practice in my opinion.  Won't be coming back.","Top Italian in nyc. are you kidding me?Lamb chops medium rare means pink not dark brown so they went back and came out second time even browner. What did you do , throw them back in the oven and see if they would lighten up. 8 people 800 bucks but  for this price you expect the chocolate molten cake to have a little molten. No chance - not even a drizzle just a little cream in the middle. Not terrible but there are hundreds of better Italians in nyc.  Sadly Williamsburg still fails on the food front again.","This place should be renamed the Italian Daycare because of the amount of families who overload the restaurant with screaming children. If you're planning a date or a group of adults who actually want to enjoy your ambiance, stay out of here for dinner. Before you dismiss this as a stroke of bad luck -- I spoke to the hostess if it was always filled with so many families with young children & she said yes, but typically dies down after 9.  Well, whoopty-do. It's a shame because otherwise when you look at pictures, the interior looks like it should be a restaurant for couples. It's not. It caters to families.The food is average so the ridiculous distractions that were allowed to carry on by management will keep me from every coming back. There are simply too many Italian options to have dinner ruined.I ordered the lobster ravioli and just as I was impressed by the lobster chucks, the sauce left me majorly underwhelmed. My boyfriend ordered chicken and he thought it was just OK but there was no consistency with the tastes - so bites dry, some bites moist, some tasted overwhelmingly lemony others had no taste. Not sure how the kitchen accomplished this - maybe they were distracted by all the kids screaming in the dining room.My Pinot noir was terrible. Not a great wine selection. I always finish my wine and couldn't finish this one. Shame.","Came for dinner and drinks with my cousins and had a great time. Service was quick, warm, and polite. They made us great martinis - extra dirty with blue cheese olives, just like we like them! Highly recommend the burrata for an appetizer, the calamari was so-so - lots of breading, but if you like that then go for it.One of my cousins ordered the brown butter/sage gnocchi special and that was delicious - definitely order if they have it! Rich but the portion isn't too huge. I got the Cavatelli Bolognese and it was DELICIOUS - good meat to sauce ratio and I loved the whipped ricotta (rather than parmesan, etc.). It was a nice take on a tried and true classic. Not too expensive and great for a midsize, somewhat loud group like ours.",Beautiful Day Beautiful Restaurant! Citrus Arugula salad with fresh fried calamari plus chicken with artichokes in a lemon butter sauce.Aperol spritzer and your love sharing this amazing lunch with you..... Nothing in public gets better then this !!!!Go and enjoy ....,I've ordered delivery and been to the restaurant and both times the pasta was incredible. The best carbonara I've ever had. Decent lasagna but my favorite pasta of all time is the cavatelli bolognese. I tell everyone I know to go here because the pasta was so memorable for me. I have yet to try their other dishes though. Oh and the tiramisu was very good too.,La Nonna Ristorante & Bar
766,"Came to El Camion on a Thursday evening after work. It was happy hour so their margaritas were only $5. Along with margaritas I ordered cod fish tacos. (3 for $12)It's a fairly small restaurant but it wasn't crowded the evening I dined. Service and food were both on point. Overall no complaints here, I will be returning!","I have no idea what to give this place. I had a reservation, the table wasn't ready when we got there, oh well it happens. As we waited for the table we contemplated leaving because it was SO LOUD we could barely hear the hostess. We decided to stay though. Drinks were great and the food was awesome but we waited over an hour for our meals (only 3 of us at the table). I noticed that one table sat down and wasn't waited on for about 15 minutes, they got up and left. Same thing happened a few minutes later. Really really slow service! Basically.. service and atmosphere: terrible, really the worst, but food and drinks: really good. This place would easily be 4-5 stars if they figured out their noise and service issues!",Meh. The maduros are good but the marg is blah. It's basically cheap store bought marg mix that's over priced with Cuervo. No thanks.,"Nice spot in the east village/ alphabet city.I ordered the fajitas which came out with lots of flair and promise my wife ordered the carnitas burrito.Burrito was delicious, the fajitas were ok but I was hoping for more, a little bland l. Still have it 4 stars because the service was great and so was the burrito.","Super disappointed in this restaurant. For starters it was REALLY loud, probably because they over stuffed the number of tables they can actually fit comfortably... Everyone in the room was screaming so they could hear other people they were dining with. Oh and there was a crying baby... got to love it. Overall the service was terrible. I went with four other people and it took them 10 minutes just to give us water. The waitress was not attentive or friendly-- it took another 10 minutes to put in drink orders which didn't arrive for what felt like 20 minutes! Side note, the waitress didn't understand what ""on the rocks"" meant.......... how do you work at a restaurant / bar and not know that phrase???? Like come on now this is New York, be efficient and don't waste my time. Once we got the drinks everyone agreed they were strong and good. Probably the best part of the evening. We ordered guacamole and chips with the drinks ... the guacamole was the tiniest serving I have ever seen. It was just baffling because the waitress didn't even mention the amount was small-- she could have told us since there's a lot of you maybe order two.... I mean after all it's just more money in the restaurants pocket????Three friends ordered beef burritos which they were all again disappointed.  They all complained there was not enough meat and gave a lot of rice instead.  Also, the burrito did not come wrapped.... and the lettuce and tomato was on the plate ........... it was very strange. I ordered shredded beef tacos which were yummy. Basically couldn't wait for dinner to be over because it was totally NOT the ambience we were looking for.","You're waking up well past noon on a Saturday afternoon, a creeping headache mounts to the pressure of  a hundred elephants dancing the merengue on your head. You need to chase some painkillers with a dose of greasy eggs and potatoes and think Huevos Rancheros will do the trick. El Camion is your place. It's not the most exciting Mexican Cantina, but the photos of poached eggs drenched in bright chipotle hollandaise sauce will be enough to drag you out of bed to feed you before another evening of regrettable libations.The Huevos Florentino is exactly what it sounds like- poached eggs over smoked salmon. Instead of the usual english toast muffin El Camion sit the eggs on veggie patties, which sound interesting but were so heavily undercooked I felt like I was eating raw bean mash. The spinach hollandaise sauce with its bright green hue looks pretty in photos but the taste was largely forgettable. The roasted potatoes had a nice crisp outer layer although flavor wise this was also kind of bland. Douse them in El Camion's extremely spicy hot sauce (think Halal Guys hot sauce level spice). For $11 this is still a good deal and better than what I can whip up at home. Does anyone actually know what goes into hollandaise sauce? (Google tells me egg yolk and butter).Expect a wait on the weekends, as nothing gets New Yorkers out of bed like the prospect of poached eggs and mimosas.",El Camion
767,"The injera was quite sour and the meats not well cooked. We were made to move to a different table in the middle of our dinner. The music was very loud and the lighting was very poor. This was the worst experience for an Ethiopian dinner in all of NY/NJ (and a few other places in the US_ for each of us who went to this restaurant.An unsolicited suggestion: the hostess/manager should focus on service, food and ambience instead of being busy trying to hug whoever comes in and goes out the door, and/or photographing us while we eat.","The food was fantastic and the portions were huge!! However why this isn't a five star review is the service. The host completely forgot about us and was rude when we inquired. She then was rude to other customers when she realized that she sat them before us. I would definitely go back, but at a time when it wasn't crowded.","Sad to rate this place four stars. It's cute in terms of decor, and I wanted very much to love it, but it just didn't hit the spot for us. Went with a group of vegetarians who have all had better Ethiopian food and weren't blown away by the food (somewhat bland, flavors weren't that amazing, all kind of tasted the same in terms of flavor), also our server was rude. Cocktails were good, but not amazing. They do offer the veggie combination for three at 49, and for four people that with the sambusas seemed to be way too much food. Probably won't go back, will stick with places like Bunna Cafe for ethiopian.","If you're looking for the best Ethiopian food in the city, this is not it. We got the chicken sampler, which was A LOT of food, but I wouldn't say the best cooked or spiced that I've had (go to Awash or Meskerem in Manhattan). And, the injera was thicker, doughier, and not as soft as I've had. So, why the five stars? The service was AMAZING. The ambiance is something that you can't get anywhere else. And, the cocktails were extremely unique and charming. You can tell a lot of thought, personality, and care was used to cultivate the experience of the restaurant. It almost feels like the late 60's/early 70's in there with the music and the seating. It does fill up quick, so take care to call in to make a reservation and/or prepare to sit at the bar. I have absolutely no complaints about the bar seats - and we got lots of attention from the restaurant owner. She's so funny, eclectic, and stylish. I don't remember the last time I had such a good time having dinner.That being said, she did say that they're closing at the end of October so go while you can!","I normally walk at a pretty quick and steady pace.  When I was dashing from Varick Street over to Chelsea Market, I ran right past Injera but something I saw out of the corner of my eye stopped me dead in my tracks.  I backtracked a few steps and stared at the silver store front with two sections sticking out on either side with a small entrance/staircase in the middle.  It was before lunch time so the restaurant was not open yet.  I pressed my nose up against the glass (literally) and saw the *gorgeous* bar inside with what appeared to be a very classic looking interior.  I vowed to return some time for a meal.I was back that evening with my girlfriend.We did not have a reservation and it was right around 6:30 PM so I was worried we would not get a seat.  Fortunately the super-mega-nice hostess seated us right away!  The interior was every bit as awesome as I had hoped.  The place is not huge, but it has a very comfortable and lounge-y feel (indeed, I would later learn that this location had once been a lounge/club called ""Shag"" around 2006).  Both sides have long, leather seats while the middle has more traditional chair/table settings.  The bar with its gorgeous cabinet full of liquor was set against the far wall.We ordered Chicken Combination for two.  It is served with two chicken dishes and four vegetable dishes.  We ordered the Doro Wot and the Doro Tibs.  The staff was super accomodating when we asked them to tone the spice down wherever they could.  For our vegetables we ordered the Misir Wat (lentils), Gomen (collard greens), Atakilt (cabbage, potatoes and carrots) and Kaye Siir (beets, carrots, potatoes).  For those not familiar, these dishes are all served on a giant platter with a soft bread known as Injera, just like the restaurant!  This bread has a spongy texture and you both eat it and use it as a ""utensil"" to pick up the food.The Injera had the perfect texture and flavor.  The Doro Wot was perfectly good without extra spice.  It had a wonderfully savory flavor and the chicken was not dry.  The Doro Tibs were spicier but very rich.  All the vegetable dishes were fairly mild and acted as a good counter point to the Doro Tibs.   The food was absolutely delicious overall.I would be remiss if I did not give a shout out to the incredible service.  When our food came, the gentleman who brought it carefully explained everything.  Our water glasses were never empty and we were checked on several times.  As if to make it more perfect, towards the middle of our meal a live band showed up to play some light jazz which offered a perfect backdrop to our meal.Injera is awesome.  Beautiful setting, amazing staff, awesome food....what's not to love?!  I can't wait to go back.","A very cozy restaurant that can accommodate around 30-40 people. However, the best part about this restaurant is its ambiance and hospitality. Accompanied by live music, this place can get very noisy sometimes. But the hospitality here covers well for it. The platters are a good initiation for someone new to Ethiopian cuisine (You can always ask for more injera if needed without an extra charge). My favorites here are their Yetimatim FitFit, Misir Wot and Atakilt. Do try their coffee after the meal as well!Quick tip: cash or Amex only policy.",Injera
768,"The floor to ceiling windows makes this a bright place for brunch in the Chelsea area but the food is not NYC standard. I ordered the shakshuka and it was the worst ive had in 3 states ive ordered it. Sad. It was mostly oil. All oil and zero flavor. The chucks of tomatoes floating in the reddish oil did not help matters. I saw this mess being made in front of my eyes: two ladels of oil (!!),  a cup of tomatoes and 2 tbsp of chickpeas was basically what I ate. Service was attentive and friensly.","Foragers Table has really cute decor, with lots of natural light in the restaurant and a little store attached to the seating area. However, a lot of the seating in the restaurant is high-top stools, and stools with no backs. I was coming here with my grandma who was visiting NY, and I didn't want her to sit on one of these for the whole time we were eating brunch. The staff made us wait a very long time to get one of the lower ""normal"" tables. I hope they bring in more of these! No one likes high stools! The food was very good but nothing spectacular, although I enjoyed the overall farm-to-table concept.","don't get the gnocchi here, the duck breast was okay however if I could do it all over again I would probably order the butchers cut.the steak tartare was a good starter.I want to give this place more stars because the service was good but cannot because I didn't really enjoy my main entrees.","Delicious food, polite staff, beautiful ambiance.We were seated rather quickly for a walk-in on a Sunday for brunch. Upon reading the menu I realized that the prices were quite high but I hadn't been before so I wasn't sure if the price matched the quality. I felt a little hesitant to spend $20 on an egg, bacon, and cheese breakfast sandwich but I was curious. Oddly enough, I ended up enjoying it very much and found it to be worthy of the price. It was paired nicely with an arugula salad tossed in a light lemon vinaigrette.I'm sure we'll visit again if we're in the area. If you get the chance to stop in, it's worth it.","Delicious food a little pricey. Ambiance was SoHo-esque.  noisy for a Saturday before noon. Service was great. In a nutshell, great - just wish it was a little cozier, slower, etc to match the locally sourced and beautifully created delectables.",Just tried dinner here and yes all day!!!Loved it.  I had the pork chops and unfortunately can't recall the rest but I gave it a 4 so trust me on this one and eat here!!!,Foragers Table
769,"Three of four dishes were over salted. Ill conceived dishes, such as scallops and foie and split peas? Unfortunately their cooking can't live up to their aspirations as the dishes come out poorly executed. It's as if the chef watched top chef and figured ""I could do that"". No. No you can't.","The overall experience was just ok. I did enjoy the food, but nothing wowed me. It was also really loud which made it hard to carry on a conversation. That could've just been because the place is a little small and there were two big groups.",Very bad experience. Such a slow service . Waited for 1 hour for apps to come and basically got full on bread basket so by the time food arrived no one at the table was hungry anymore. So I guess the place was good for a very expensive take out. Don't recommend for lunch or dinner if you want so anything else that night since you ll be waiting most of the time Maybe they should have just refunded all the food for uNo we did not talk the manager about that,"Delicious food.Highly recommend the cauliflower, octopus carpaccio, and the ribs.They were all amazing. Very flavorful and very fresh ingredients.I will be back!","I came here for the first time for brunch with a group of friends. I think it must have just been a slow day because the place was fairly empty. We had a reservation and when we arrived our table was right in front. We were seated right away but weren't attended to for some time, until I asked the waiter to come to the table. I ordered a Bloody Mary and had French onion soup and hot sausage. My Bloody Mary was somewhat warm and watery but the flavor and spiciness was good. The French onion soup was really great, and did not disappoint! It was slightly on the salty side but I enjoyed it nonetheless. For the table we got the roasted cauliflower and apple fritters. The fritters were very delicious, certainly enough to split amongst a group. The cauliflower did not really wow me all that much.My friends got the French toast and hanger steak which they both seemed very pleased with. The French toast had a lovely array of fresh fruit on top and the kitchen cooked the hanger steak to perfection.Overall, after having to call the waiter over a handful of times for various reasons,  I didn't think the service warranted a standard 20% tip added to the bill.",This is a little gem in the neighborhood of Fort Greene! We really liked the place and the service. The food was really good. Pressed orange and grapefruit juices were delicious as well as the Norwegian eggs Benedict and the bison burger chosen by my husband! We will go back ;),Gentleman Farmer - Fort Greene
770,"Waited to come here for the first half of our trip but had to cancel our reservation due to bad weather. When we finally managed to go one night the view was amazing! We wanted to sit at the terrace but moved in after a while because it was just way too cold. We went on a weekday night so there weren't many people there. We ordered the family style jerk chicken which our waiter warned us would take 30-45 minutes to wait. When our dish came out my mom was horrified because of how black the chicken looks. She asked if all of it came out like this and the waiter said yes, so I'm not sure if this is the usual! It was very filling though for $37 so I'm glad we ordered that instead of the individual dishes. As the sky turned dark the view became even more beautiful. It's a place worth coming if you're on a date or just want to see the city at night! Our bill took over thirty minutes to come though, and I was quite frustrated because our stay is over 40 minutes from the restaurant. Not sure what took so long but I can't give a 3 star because of the view and experience.","After being attacked by many fruit flies on the outdoor patio, we asked to be moved inside and after our nice server, Matt, placed us at a 2 top by the window, another waiter showed up at our table as we were eating to tell us we had to move because the table was ""reserved.""  The restaurant had 8 open tables and yet we were asked to leave during our meal, making us feel very uncomfortable.  I should also add we were given an option of sitting anywhere upon our arrival. The staff is clueless and rude.  If you enjoy fruit flies and/or awkward stares from management, please enjoy the view.","5 star views, mediocre food.I came here for a lunch with 10+ coworkers in the early afternoon. It's located within the Club Quarters WTC hotel so you'll have to make a reservation and let the front desk know hat you'll be going up to the 20th floor. They'll give you a card key.When we got upstairs to the restaurant area, the place was empty - which was perfect because we wanted to go on the balcony to take in the views while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. The views are stunning!When we were seated, we ordered beverages and apps - the guacamole, hummus, and wings. The guacamole must have been made in the morning and left out because it was a very deep green color and has almost no taste. The waiter also said they only had one order left and it was only 12pm which I found to be strange since they have avocado toast on their menu. The wings were okay but dry, and I didn't get a chance to taste the hummus.We ordered while we waited. A couple of my coworkers ordered the asparagus risotto and I ordered the fried chicken sandwich. While we waited, we noticed that one of the folded napkins on the table was actually a USED, dirty napkin which was gross and a bit disappointing for a higher end establishment. Our waiter had that switched out right away for us.Our food took quite some time to come but when it did, it was underwhelming. My fried chicken sandwich was extremely dry - dry chicken, dry bun, you get the picture. The fries were good though. My coworker ordered the risotto and said it was okay, but her plate came out dirty.All in all, it's an okay restaurant. Nothing special and not worth the price unless you consider the views. My advice is to come here for drinks on the balcony.","I ate dinner here with my family on July 4th.  We dined on the terrace with a view of the World Trade Center memorial.  The view is great.  You can see the Hudson River off to the side.  It was very warm and humid outside but the sun was starting to set, which helped.The food is good but the portions are small unless you order the family-sized dishes.The restaurant is located on the 20th floor of a hotel, and the entrance was a bit challenging to find at street level.","Great food preparation with exquisite portions and lovely presentation, obviously prepared by a trained chef. Also a really excellent wine list and wonderful view and ambience. Unfortunately all of these positive attributes are undermined by the lack of training provided to the waitstaff, a lack of professionalism in service staff in general, and an inability of staff to apply adequate energy and attention to their guests. They seem to have better things to do, like chatting with their friends. This is honestly probably entirely the fault of management for under paying their waitstaff and not providing adequate professional training. I do not blame the staff, I entirely blame management.It is unfortunate because this small restaurant could be an lovely jewel in the heart of the city.",Came here afterwards with my girls friend and the food was great. The drinks were great along the view. Would definitely recommend here.,View of the World Terrace Club
771,Not only my favorite Mexican spot it may be my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn. Every single dish is amazing.... In the summer there's a cute patio area too.Obsessed with everything about Claro,"We recently visited Claro and felt that the flavors were very one note. The aguachile was extremely spicy, to the point of being inedible, and we could barely find any scallops inside the dish. The same was true of the tuna tostada (very little tuna). Our server also recommended an absurdly expensive fig quesadilla ($24) for which we only received two portions. All in all, the food was lacking but I was particularly shocked by the outrageously bad value. My sister and I each spent $100 and we ordered six tapas and had two cocktails total. Mind you we did not even order the entree-style mole dishes. How does this restaurant have a Michelin star? Baffled.","Took a while for us to get seated for our reservation, which we were totally cool with (we were drinking anyway, and they gave us champagne to make up for it) but I would just warn you not to sit outside. After we were seated the service was very slow, I don't think they had as many servers in the back yard. The food was very good, there wasn't anything on the menu that we didn't. The beef dishes were particularly tender and the mole was very tasty. We didn't love all of the cocktails so we stuck to beers.","Summary:This place genuinely surprised me with how much I ended up enjoying it. I was expecting just a nice dinner out for the night, and was blown away with the flavors and overall amazingly made food.Food:To start we got the Aguachile, which for this particular night was made with jalapenos, and was way hotter than what we were expecting. That being said, it was absolutely delicious. I really enjoyed the wide variety of the textures and flavors, from the softness of the scallop, to the crunchiness of the jicama and radish, to the tastiness of the tomatoes, this was a standout dish. It would have shined even more if it was less spicy.Next we got the pork memala which was delicious as well. The memela tasted freshly made was was delicious. The pork on top had a nice flavor and the dish was overall enjoyable to eat.The mole was quite good as well. We got extra tortillas (which tasted delicious and freshly made!) and ate it with the mole. It had a nice sweet but savory taste that went really we'll with the falling off the bone goodness of the short rib.Service:Excellent service, our server was helpful in helping us pick on the menu items and was attentive to our needs.","Pro tip: if it's nice weather out, ask to be seated in the outdoor back patio area, especially if you have a larger party. We stumbled upon Claro for a quick dinner before a show at Littlefield's, and they obliged with quick service. I was in the mood for classic tacos, but I still enjoyed the edgier dishes I ordered. A friend and I split a fig quesadilla, which didn't look like the quesadillas I'm used to, and it looked more like a flat taco. But it was really good and not too sweet, so it still felt savory. Our shrimp tacos came on blue maize tortillas, so that was pretty cool. We were so hungry that we scarfed it down while it was hot and it was really good. Shrimp could've been more plump though- these shrimp were...well, shrimpy.I get that Claro has a Michelin star, but for its prices, I don't think I'll be back again unless I'm attending a celebration here.","Would like to give this 4.5. If future visits are as consistent as our first, I will happily update to 5. Delicious Oaxacan fare in an unsuspecting neighborhood in Gowanus. What we loved:- Tuna Tostada was our favorite of the 4 dishes we had. Exceptional. I could eat this every day. Must order. - Barbacoa Tacos, second favorite. These were some of the most satisfying tacos I've had in a while. Juicy barbacoa, squeeze of lime, fresh tortillas... I give them an A- Quesadilla, good but not incredible. An interesting quesadilla for sure, but didn't have the wow factor of the first two. - Mole Negro Short Ribs, so good. The short rib was insanely tender. The veggies that accompanied it were great with the mole sauce. Pretty big portion too, we were absolutely stuffed by this point. - Cocktails, cannot remember which two we ordered but both were great. I doubt you can go wrong with the cocktails here. We enjoyed sitting on the back patio under the market lights. Seating could be more comfortable and with some small changes could be a really amazing patio. Some candles, comfortable chairs, maybe some lounge seating or an outdoor bar would really be special. Service was very fast and attentive. I could have used more spacing between dishes to savor each more fully, but appreciated how on top of things their staff was. Can't wait to come back here and (eventually) try everything on the menu!",Claro
772,"Very unusual tiny little place where you have to stand at the bar for your food or drinks cuz there are no stools at this place!We were wandering around to kill some time in the area and found this place. Their menu looks very enticing. You know, I can never skip skirt steak nor octopus!We got Fried Shrimp with Wasabi Tartar sauce ($8), Marinated Skirt Steak ($9) and Spanish Octopus Salad ($10). Every dish was spot on. Skirt Steak was prepared perfectly medium rare.Too bad the service was kinda off tonight. The bartender wasn't quite friendly nor attentive. We were never once asked how the food was or if we needed anything else. Just in case you don't drink, don't forget to order Ginger Honey Lemonade ($4)!","A tiny off shoot of Basta Pasta; standing only. Omg, so good! HH drinks only & Tapas I had Branzini cooked, Sea Scallop Carpaciuo $9 each & Shrimp Shitaki Risotto $14. Yumyumyum. Will go back 4 more!","Bar B, I'm so happy you exist. Your uni bruschetta and scallops with uni are my raison d'être. I don't even mind standing at the narrow bar while my knees get weaker with each drunken glass of $5 rosé. One of these days I will complete my uni extravaganza with an order of your uni risotto followed by an uni pasta at Basta Pasta.","Wow this place rocks. Standing bar only but super good food, everything I had was spectacular including the octopus risotto, skirt steak, fried chicken, French fries with anchovies, and rose all day. Will definitely be back!","This is the best restaurant in Chelsea. Kid you not. This narrow little alleyway of a restaurant, where you're forced to stand while you eat divine and creamy shrimp risotto with shiitake mushroom, made right in front of you. Where you eat grilled calamari made in a pan a foot away, topped with kale and bottarga and the best calamari you've had. Where you munch on grilled veggies and ricotta and prosciutto, and al dente penne bolognese.This is the sister restaurant to Basta Pasta, and it sure tastes like it, but this spot is all it's own. It feels like a sexy little European getaway, a cozy nook, a little secret.5 Stars!!!!!","If you plan on checking this place out for the first time I recommend bringing a friend. When I say ""a"" friend, I literally mean one friend!!  This amazing little place only has a bar where about 8-10 people can stand. Whenever I hangout in the area or just looking for chill place to meet up I always find myself recommending this place. It's a solid one for my books.The place is intimate, charming, and comfortable, although there is no seating. The dishes here range from 8-9 dollars and are small however packed with flavor. There is also variety of wine to choose from and great happy hour from 4-7.It's definitely one of my favorite places in nyc.",Bar B
773,"If you are only looking for pizza. This is not the place that you are looking for. The pizza is small, but very pricey. I ordered the truffle mushroom pizza adding Italian sausages, which cost me $27. However, I was very disappointed because the pizza is small. The taste is okay, otherwise I will only give 2 stars.","I live right next door, haven't eaten there yet, but due to a crisis in our building me and my Mom hung out at the bar and got treated like queens by Chris the bartender, and wonderful conversation with Iara, the manager.   Can't wait to eat there!","I have tried this restaurant twice and my impression is still the same. I am visiting and usually stay in a hotel close so the restaurant is at a convenient location. The first time I dined in and ordered something other than pizza and it was terrible. I thought the second time, I would try Pizza and have it delivered. Google maps says it is a 3 minute walk, however the pizza arrived via bike and was cold. It absolutely had to be the worst Pizza I have ever had. In short, the food is terrible! There is way to many good places in Brooklyn to eat terrible cold food!","Several of my friends had recommended I try Forno Rosso, so I decided to try it out for Saturday Brunch with a friend visiting from out of town. The menu honestly was brimming with authentic, Italian choices. I was surprised and excited I wanted everything! Jimi was our server and he was beyond courteous and sweet. He gave us our space while also tending to our needs. I asked about the tortellini and he said it was to die for (he was right). Naturally, I met his tortellini AND raised him one Caprese Salad (a perfect addition). The sauce on the tortellini was soooo rich and creamy, I couldn't get enough....thats where the bread came in. It was warm, fresh and ideal for sopping. Ten's across the board and highly recommend! I can't wan't to make this   a regular go-to place.","We went here two consecutive Fridays because the happy hour is so good. So this review is happy hour only. I haven't tried anything not on the happy hour menu. Basically there are 3 pizzas, 3 apps, and 3 pastas half off. So that's 7-13 dollars instead of 14- 26 And thier house wine is 6 dollars a glass and it's pretty good. I like the house red a lot. The atmoshoere is nice too. They put nice fall flowers on the table which sets the mood. Though a table for two can get pretty crowded with drinks, food and decorations on it. Also if there is a big party the night you go, like one night we went, it can get pretty loud in there. Also the bathrooms are a bit dirty and cramped. The food is great fresh quality. And the food comes out quick from the kitchen. We loved everything especially the pasta. It is home made and the star of all the dishes we ordered. We had both the orecchiette and the truffle fettuccine pasta. The texture of the pasta was great and the flavors were very bold and delicious. The apps are small in size. 2 meatballs and just about 6 pieces of calamari. The calamari was fried so well and so fresh and delicious but I only got 2 pieces since we were sharing with 3 people. At 7 dollars though I get it, calamari is usually 16 dollars for a whole plate at places. Also the calamari has some fried zucchini in it so even less squid!The pizza dough is doughy and chewy and not crispy on the bottom. The margarita pizza lacks flavor. The pizza is nothing to rave about but for 10 dollars on happy hour its pretty good. The diavola pizza is the best and has the most flavor with the salami on it compared to the two others for happy hour. Besides the pasta being the star I also loved loved the olive oil that comes with the bread. I drench it in it. It has capers or peas or something in it and that makes it taste so good. Also make sure you check your receipt. We had no problems the first time we went. But the second time they charged us 18 for the orecchiette pasta instead of 13. And they adjusted it though the waitress was a little rude about it. Can't beat happy hour prices. Best happy hour for food around (4-7 mon-fri). And get the pasta!!","Beautiful space and delicious Italian food. Made a reservation for 6:30 on a Thursday but didn't need it. The bar area was packed but there were several tables in the dining area open. You will have a person to bring water and a separate person to bring bread. Someone from the bar will bring drinks. If your server is busy with another table when your food is ready, a different server will bring it out. The point is, there will always be someone there to serve you, it may just feel like a lot of different folks. We arrived in time to get apps and the first round of drinks during ""happy hour"" (=half price). We had wine and calamari. The calamari were a little thick, but still tender. They also had some battered and fried zucchini in with the squid which I enjoyed. The dish could have used a big dash of salt, but everything tasted so fresh that it wasn't worth complaining about. I ordered the veal tortellini and my husband had the Frank's pasta (branzino and shrimp over linguine). Both were wonderful. By the time we were wrapping up, the whole restaurant was full. The restrooms were terrible, but some could categorize them as rustic/industrial. The toilets were fine, but every surface of the communal wash area was filthy/covered with water and rust. We would definitely eat/drink here again, we would just avoid the restrooms.",Forno Rosso
774,"I really did want to like this place..mostly because of all the hype and the 45 minutes of my life i spent waiting to eat but..We got:- tagliatelle bolognese 6/10: was a pretty average dish, definitely not worth the $23. Tasted like something i couldve made at home, although the pasta itself was quite good. But the sauce and flavors lay flat - gnocchi 5/10: the gnocchi was reaaaaaaaally soft, im not sure if they were going for that soft doughy texture but it just tasted severely undercooked to me. Service was noticeably bad (and i dont even notice service ever), it took forever to get anything - especially to order. Also, there was a table ready but they didn't seat us for at least another 10 minutes for some strange reason..? Also not really within their control but peeved me anyways was that there's only one bathroom for the whole establishment and it is literally in the middle of the restaurant. Practically begs for a traffic collision when you open the door. Overall, definitely not worth the hype or the wait. Maybe the hype is around the atmosphere...? I really dont get it. Save yourself some everything and go eat at any number of the restaurants nearby.","The customer service at this place is 10/10. We ordered the beef carpaccio, grilled squid and the grilled bread. The grilled bread paired in the grilled squid juices were to die for! The beef carpaccio was pretty good also just wish I had more of that white sauce that was topped on it. Okay so the potato gnocchi is DEL-CIOUS. I got the spaghetti with the clams which isn't in a red sauce but I wasn't really a fan of that dish. The desserts really stole the show. The tiramisu and the vanilla creme brûlée were to die for!","Sad to report that my food took 2x as long as the people that ordered at same time next to me, (they were finishing when my food came!) and the cost of the same thing I've ordered for years doubled. Worse service AND higher prices? $54 for two glasses of wine and soup? Boo! Regulars are your business! Disappointing.","Food was cooked and prepared fresh! I ordered the Polenta and Bolognese. Was greeted by the hostess and sat quickly on a busy Saturday night.Warm ambiance and upbeat music/ atmosphere. The place is live- it does have a lot going on (loud environment, kitchen cooks in front) but thats what keeps it lively.The waitress was very friendly and made sure the dishes were out in a timely manner. Polenta was creamy and rich. The topping red peppers were not too sweet and onions complimented the sauce well. Very balanced and proportioned. Overall, I would give this a 8/10. The only downfall was the portion was small, but I think the restaurant was going for the 'small plates style'. The Bolognese was very flavorful and seasoned thorougly. Taste was very warm and noodles were light and delicious. Very meaty! Overall, i would give this dish a 8.6/ 10.Good pasta and vibes, great for a pleasant evening.","There are a lot of Frankies and its confusing. This one is the original and down the block is Franks which is split into two places. A wine bar with an app menu and a reservation only side. Then there is one in Manhattan. This one was okay. Average food and high prices. I liked the rustic atmoshpere and we sat by the window. Thier backyard is gorgeous and they have a courtyard too which looks like for weddings and other events. 17 dollars for eggplant marinara. Came with no pasta and was just eggplant in red sauce. It tasted good but not worth 17 dollars and not filling. My boyfried ordered the cavatelli with sausage. 22 dollars. The cavatelli was very good. Homemade and in a brown butter sage sauce. I'm lucky he let me eat half. The sausage I didn't care for. Too spicy for my tastes and the flavor itself I didnt like. Portions average size. Cocktails at 14 dollars I guess is pretty typical. The spritz was actually really good. My boyfriend's drink tasted like medicine to me though, I forgot what it was called, something with bird in the title. Overpriced average food, wouldn't come back but glad we tried it.","This is the place that does the Resy backyard chef collaborations I can only attest to place as a wedding venue and the food that was served for the wedding.The backyard space was amazing, tasteful, and intimate.The food for the wedding was 1. A bunch on crostini(mushroom, pesto, chick pea, honey ricotta)- all amazing2. Salad-very good3. Two house made cavatellis( sausage and cauliflower) both amazing4. Damn good meatballs with pine nuts5. Gnocchi-light as air in tomato sauce6. Chocolate ganache and light as air cheesecakeAwesome and friendly service. Super attentive.

775,"We love this place with my husband, the hamburger is in our top 5 of the best burgers of NYC but what we don't find good/fair is that it says in the menu that the orange juice is fresh squeezed. Which is not true at all. it is the same Tropicana juice that I can get in the market and that really sucks! Don't lie to the customers.","So sad to learn there was a fire and they will be closed until September, but glad that no one was hurt.We were there with friends for dinner 2 weeks ago, it was quite busy even on a Tuesday night. Small menu but decent food and the outdoor garden at the back is a plus! I was looking to make reservation to try their brunch this weekend, and that's when I found out about the fire.","I come to this spot regularly because I live a few blocks away. On NYE I was disappointed because the servers were impatient and rude. My little brother asked what beers they had and the server retorted do you want me to list them??! That's the definition of your job and if it was tough to remember she could have easily brought the list. My $36 scallops were cold, I asked for more bread and they said they couldn't ""sell me anymore"" due to some bread shortage, everything was super rushed and after this experience I won't spend money there again.","Dope little spot in Greenpoint Brooklyn. What I loved is how simple each dish is but packed with flavor. Was here for brunch with some friends great little greenpoint vibe and spacious outside seating. Drinks were great and so was the food- I had maybe the best BLT of my life and my friends enjoyed all there dishes as well. Loved the healthy brunch options as well, so if you go in alittle banged up from the night before the food gets you back and doesn't make you feel like a total piece of shit. (Get the side salad dressed with lemon)","The Summary:Atmosphere - 5/5Neighborhood - 5/5Food - 3/5Drinks - 3/5Inclusivity - 5/5Experience - 4/5The Story:Came here for brunch with a friend. I don't venture into Brooklyn often, but this place makes me want to come back. Try getting seated in the cute backyard area if weather permits!I had a sangria and french toast, by friend had a kale salad with fries. My meal was good, but not as memorable as the restaurant's great atmosphere. The french toast wasn't the best but was decorated with fruit, whipped cream, syrup, cinnamon, etc. so those things could hide the otherwise average taste. Still, if you're in the neighborhood, this is a go-to!",Where is your pride flag to show support for your LGTBQ patrons?Great atmosphere. Happy you reopened after the fire.,Anella
776,"Came here for lunch with my boss to try out the 2019 summer restaurant week menu. I have wanted to try this place for a really long time (it looks good on paper) so I thought RW might be a foot in to keep coming but I was disappointed yes.The food was very plain and the service was shockingly not good.I ordered the bora bora shrimp and my boss ordered the soup of the day (which was chicken ball soup) to start. His food look completely unappetizing and he said it tasted home made but not in a good way. My shrimp salad was ok but was difficult to eat as there were a lot of items to chew. It wasn't well balanced in terms of texture.I ordered the Japanese karaage chicken sandwich which came with fries. It looked amazing but once I took a bit it just started to fall apart. I could've stopped at two bites and would've been happy, it wasn't worth eating in my opinion. The star of the meal were the fries. And after I just felt nauseous and uncomfortably full. Very disappointed.","Came here for brunch with a large group. It was just ok. After everyone else at the table was served, one person's cottage cheese gnocchi was nowhere to be found. Apparently, the restaurant could not make the dish, so substituted something else. The substitute was brought to the table without warning. It was ""here's this similar thing or I'll bring you a menu."" My poor friend just accepted it knowing the rest of us were starving. No compensation was offered following this mix up. I ordered the French toast. I almost never order French toast at brunch, and now I remember why. Please see my posted picture and compare it to the description. The listed candied bacon was only four tiny pieces. Apples were little slivers and tasted strange. The dish as a whole tasted ok, but wasn't what I expected.","Ambiance: simple and modern decor, moderate noise level Food: portion size is HUGE. During restaurant week, a 2 courses lunch is usually not enough for me. But not at L'ADRESSE! I actually started to feel full after my appetizer. I had shrimp bora bora salad and it was very refreshing. My second course was salmon poke with soy sauce(I think), sadly this was not as good as those places that specialize in poke. I also ordered mushroom risotto from the regular menu, and it was delicious! Slightly burnt mushroom smelled so good! However, my friend's truffle burger was somewhat disappointing, only the outside of the patty had flavor, inside was very plain. For a 35 dollar burger I expect it to be better.Service: tbh I was not very happy with the service. I ordered salmon poke and risotto without knowing that the poke had rice as its base(when I eat at other poke places I usually go with greens). My server asked me if I wanted any protein with the risotto but did not remind me that both dishes had rice. Luckily my risotto was very good so I thought I'd let it slide. Second, our total was ~120 after tax and my friend and I split the bill. On each of our receipts(1/2 of the total amount), the recommended tips were calculated according to the total! I didn't notice this at first but my friend caught it. It was very misleading and I've never been to any other restaurants that do this. L'ADRESSE is seems to be a decent restaurant, please don't let the details ruin it.","I love this place! Ordered the L'ADRESSE skillet, which has fried potatoes, mushroom, sausage, two eggs, and toast. One dish is enough for two girls already! Also ordered the lobster salad, I don't remember the name, but the first one in the recommendation. Very tasty as well.The place is decorated, and the online reservation is convenient. The service is not bad either. I think will definitely go back!","The Ambience was excellent. The servers were very attentive and polite. Food was good . My breakfast Skillet had all the essentials, but it was not ""special"". My wife had a vegetarian omelette which comprised of an omelete with brocolli and spinach over it. Again nothing special but tasted good. was just expecting a little more than the""usual"".

777,"We drove two hours to Brooklyn as Tanoreen came highly recommended from friends. The food was fantastic, but we were disappointed at the level of customer service. Our waiter highly raved about the shawarma sliders and suggested we try it, so we ordered it. It never came out, so we approached the waiter about it in which he told us we never ordered it. Instead of saying ""I'm sorry, that's my mistake - will bring it right out"" he argued with us and insisted that we didn't order it. He could've handled that more professionally. After that instance, he wasn't attentive to our table whatsoever. Another waiter came over to wipe our table down and asked us if we were interested in coffee and desert before we even ate dinner. We were expecting a different customer experience as we were so excited to eat at Tanoreen.","I went for lunch by myself and had soup and a fish entree. I was writing in a notebook while I ate, just relaxing. The restaurant was only serving two other tables--- nearly empty. And the other patrons had been there long before me and were having leisurely tea. Still, without asking me if I needed anything or seeing if I was finished, the waiter plopped a togo container and plastic bag in front of me. So rude. I was not even halfway into my entree. I really don't understand why he rushed me out.","Overated wish I could give no stars...Heard this place was great, but was very disappointed. Ordered 3 apps a salad an entree 72 dollars. My entree was over cooked and lacked flavor besides the over seasoned dry over done chicken that had the texture of cardboard, the seasoning in everything else was linear and quite boring for such a large menu. To make it worse the service was horrendous. Our waiter Paco was non attentive with only 5 tables and three servers there is no excuse and when I complained about the chicken being dry he only took half off when I didn't eat a much of my plate at all. I tried to be polite but that did not help. Never coming back here and I wouldn't recommend it. I work in the industry and this treatment to guests and food was offensive. What a waste of money I should've got bagels. Also to top it off I got food poisoning and am in excruciating pain thanks again!","I've been here twice, both time the service was on point (even when they were BUSY), and the food came out amazing.Everything I tried was completely full of flavor, so get your taste buds ready. The ambiance is alright, for the type of place it is.Pretty decor, and low light- excellent place to go for a dinner date, because you'll be able to hear each other well.","Dropped by with no wait on a weekend afternoon after a day of exploring Bay Ridge. I'd heard great things about Tanoreen, and wasn't disappointed. We split the eggplant napoleon and lamb shank - serious yum, especially the eggplant. I loved the combination of flavors and textures with that dish, and never had anything like it before.The lamb shank was good, but some parts were slightly dry. The parts that weren't, though, were out of this world delicious.","The fatoush, the eggplant, the hashwa, the talamee . . . where do I start? Seriously.The customer service here is on par with the best, too -- always attentive, always smiling.Tanoreen makes me happy -- genuinely, deeply happy.Here's to Levantine comfort food at its best!",Tanoreen
778,"Have been here several times.  The last two times (separated by about 6 months)  were during Restaurant Week -- prices (now $42 for dinner) having increased on our second visit recently, but still much less expensive than regular prices ($62).  Salad choices were average for a Manhattan rodizio.  Shiitake mushrooms were hard to find.  The little biscuits were outrageously good, but appetizers (mashed, plantains and polenta were totally unnecessary).   Meats were limited (eg no lamb chop, chicken hearts, filet mignon or beef ribs)   Meats were still good, rare was available,but pork ribs were not..  Plenty to choose from and amazingly undersalted.  Ambiance, service, restrooms all 4/5 stars.  Coffee $3.25, soda $3.50.  Dessert was very thin sliver of chocolate mousse cake and key lime pie.  At least, they're consistent.","For a restaurant that BOASTS on their website that they have great vegetarian options they don't even have an entree and you can't even make a good salad at the salad bar. went here for a work gathering so no choice on the place, if  i knew i'd be eating a plate of raw vegetables while constantly being offered meat i would have passed. the rice and beans weren't even veg, try harder if you're going to brag about being able to feed special diets. don't lure newcomers under false pretenses.","I frequently enjoy the Los Angeles location but this was my first time here in NYC. We went to celebrate father's day early and we tried the ""experience"" all you can eat bbq. While the food was very good, the overall dining experience was just okay. For the reputation and price, I expect a higher caliber of service. I think the experience was derailed from the beginning when the hostess seemed rude and like she didn't care for her job. The overall atmosphere of the restaurant was not very comfortable nor welcoming. Can't ignore the great chefs and menu though, so three stars ...","Fogo de Chão is an ""authentic"" Brazilian steakhouse (churrascaria) or as authentic as it gets around midtown. You can order a la carte or ""rodizio"", the menu includes cuts of grilled meats such as sizzling steaks, lamb, chicken and pork. All carved tableside as well as a buffet table with some lighter fare and salads. You get a red and green flag to indicate when you are done (red) or still waiting for more (green). Pao de queijo (cheese bread) and polenta frita (fried polenta) are my favorite sidesThe buffet bar consisting of salads, fresh-cut vegetables, cured meats and imported cheeses, as well as a variety of traditional Brazilian side dishes and desserts.They have a pretty solid happy hour special including some tapas from Monday to Friday. Staff is very friendly at bar or dining area and they will get out of their way to accommodate you.Fun place to dine (especially if you arrive in time for Happy Hour!) and a wonderful service. Remember, don't fill up on the salad bar before the meat servers begin.","Two words: Overhyped and overpriced. I was not impressed by the flavors and variety of the meats nor was I impressed by the salad bar. Many of the meats were dry (namely the pork tenderloin and chicken) and it all tasted the same by the end of the meal. It was so bad that I couldn't even finish the pieces they gave me; I would take a bite of each thing and not want to finish it. I started asking for smaller pieces because of this. I didn't like how I kept getting end pieces too, which tend to be dry and tough. I don't remember a single meat to be memorable.. even their house special sirloin/picanha was just okay. The bottom cut sirloin was horrible. Chicken drumstick had a crispy skin but bland on the inside (very much needed a chimichurri or some other sauce). Pork chop and ribs - so dry. The Parmesan pork - omg I wanted to spit this out, it was so dry and tasteless. The bacon-wrapped filet mignon - truly very lackluster. My card stayed on green the entire time because I was still able to eat, but didn't want to eat anything they brought over... which honestly rarely happens for me at all-you-can-eat buffets. Now to the market table / salad bar, I was impressed by how many items they had and there was not a single thing I really wanted to put on my plate. I had really wanted a salad to go with all the meat but none of the salads looked appetizing. I stuck with the fruit (the papaya, pineapple, and dragonfruit were good). My husband liked the candied bacon. That might've been the highlight of our meal. I'm giving it two stars solely because all the wait staff were very friendly. I found it very comparable to Rainhas in Queens (if not worse...) and much pricier.","Been here many times; this review is only about their service during Restaurant Month. The best restaurant service I've ever had.  Here's why.1. We were about 10 minutes early for dinner based on our reservation, but were seated immediately anyway.  You hear horror stories of reservations not being honored all the time.2.   The table was properly set and the staff leading us to our table pulled the chairs back.  A waiter then came a minute or two later to welcome us and take our drink/water orders right away, while putting menus in front of us.  You hear more horror stories about wait staff never coming to greet and take orders until just minutes before you die from old age.3. As this was a rodizio, she inquired whether we knew the routine.  I replied yes but since my friend was new to it, I asked that she explain the process anyway.  4. We informed her we wanted the Restaurant Month option and she told us the cost, what it included and what it did not.  Many times the different choices are not fully disclosed; you only learn certain items are excluded when later on you ask where they are and it is then revealed they're not available on that option.  Transparency is always a good thing, especially up front.5. After making our choices (Restaurant Month, tap water, soda) our water glasses were promptly filled.  My glass never went below half full (empty) the entire night.  The soda came in a bottle and was poured into a glass with ice; the remainder in the bottle was left with us. Strangely, no one asked alter on if we wanted a refill, which we would've liked; we thought that's how restaurant make their money ($4/soda, etc.) 6. The dinner begins with a fabulous help yourself salad bar--definitely not your grandma's old salad bar.  Items included prosciutto, marinated mushrooms, mozzarella on tomato, every imaginable green salad and add-on, caramelized bacon, and tons more.  Stacks of clean plates were readily available; some buffets run out of plates!  All items were replenished before emptying, except for the crazy good candied bacon.  Many buffets are slow at replenishing items, especially the more expensive or popular ones  (BTW no crab legs for hoarders here).  All necessary plates and utensils were laid out; soup bowls, spoons, separate ladles.  A sneeze guard fully covered this very large salad bar.  The warm dishes were kept warm; e.g. rice, soup, feojada.7. A bowl of cheesy bisquits/bread was placed on our table.  That bowl was replaced with fresh warm bread maybe four times during our meal, any time the bowl dwindled down to one bisquit.  After the first refill, we didn't have to ask for more--it was automatic.8. Once our indicator turned over from red to green, the meats starting coming.  The servers with their skewers were never more than five minutes apart and we had an opportunity to sample each and every item.  Even this fine establishment seemed on other occasions to hold back on the finer cuts, but not this night.  Every meat came around two or three times.  Every degree of doneness--medium to very rare.  When the server ran out of rare garlic steak, he promised to come back with a rare piece--which he did only a few minutes later!  That's personal service.  Whether we asked for half the usual slice or two slices, they accommodated us. The rare was truly rare.8. Dirty plates were constantly taken away. In fact, we were asked at least five times if we wanted to have removed an extra plate we used for fat, grizzle, bones and other detritus.  It is rare too that plates are cleared so frequently.  One waiter displayed acute attention to minutia when he saw me playing with an after-dinner mint wrapper that was buried in my hand and offered to discard it.   9. During our meat orgy, sides came out.  We could have easily forgotten about them in the meat frenzy.  While we were ""only"" asked once how the meal was or if we needed anything else, our waitperson was never more than a table or two away.  We never had a problem getting her attention.   10.   When we stopped the meat attack, no one asked if we wanted coffee or dessert.  Again, we thought the extras were a profit center for eateries.  The check then came fairly quickly.  We paid and left and some one must have thanked us, but it was so busy and noisy, such an omission was forgivable and could be overlooked.11. There wasn't any aspect of service that was lacking.  Some places refold your napkin or wipe your place until crumb-free, but those touches do not define service, and are only a couple of items.  The overall service here with its many facets was top notch. There was always a sense of wanting to serve exhibited subtly by every waiter, busboy and host; totally absent was any air of snobbiness or disdain. I can't recall any other place meeting practically all of the many features that comprise ""service.""  For those who can't understand how bad service can be, try Demarchelier.",Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse
779,"I got the fettuccine molisane or something like that, it was a chefs special. I was recommended to come here by a friend. I was seated immediately didn't need a reservation which was nice but the service was missing directly after. The food was so bland and lacking flavor I was basically dumping the salt and pepper shaker onto it. My bf got the beef ravioli which he didn't end up finishing because he didn't enjoy it. The noodles tasted fresh but it just had no flavor. If they added some flavor I'm sure it would've been great. I had to keep fighting to get my waiters attention for the check. Needless to say I won't be coming back which is disappointing because I really wanted to like it.","I come to NYC every six months or so, since I moved, and this is always my first stop.  This time, I had the tortellini, cream with peas and ham. Delicious, and the lunch special was only $10.95, a complete steal, especially for the portion size.The staff is warm and welcoming...",This is one of the good old school pasta place. There are many better and upscale pasta places in nyc but this place always remind me of homemade italian food. Also reasonable price is a plus!,"$81.Eighty one dollars for two entrees, a bottle of wine, an appetizer, and dessert.And it's fucking good.Pizza Urbano was very tasty.  Crust was incredible, sauce supported the toppings without overwhelming them.  My only complaint would be that I wish they'd put the prosciutto on before cutting the pie.  It may have been a one time thing.Porcini mushroom ravioli was amazing.  The addition of walnuts adds to the mouth feel and sublimely accentuates the flavor.Service.  Incredible.  Right there when you need them, GONE while you're enjoying the evening.Taking the Tiramisu back to the hotel for later.  Will keep you posted.","Came for dinner and had a nice meal. The restaurant itself is a bit cramped, so getting around tables is tough, but the ambiance is nice. The service was good as expected. The food here is tasty and extremely affordable. I would not say it is mind blowing, but it is what you want when you are craving pasta and the portions are generous.We ordered a margherita pizza as an appetizer (only $10) and it was very good, great crust and nice cheese. The sauce could have used a bit more flavor but overall a very satisfying pizza. I tried the amatriciana pasta ($12.95) which again was tasty and satisfying. The sauce was good, but not as rich and flavorful as other amatriciana's I have had. A very hearty dish though and plenty of food. For dessert we tried the fruit sorbet which comes inside a frozen fruit. It was very good and refreshing. If you are not a big eater, one of the pastas should fill you up so you get a nice meal for $12-15. They also have a white and red wine of the day where the bottle is $20. I would definitely go back because it is the most reasonable Italian meal I have had in NYC.","Love Love Love this place! I came here multiple times and I was never let down by the food I've tried so far. Everything on their menu is delicious and at a reasonable price.It depends on the timing you get to the restaurant because it's can get super pack. The seating here is kinda tight, so you'll be sitting close to the other people around the area. Won't be ideal to come here if you're looking for a low-key, quiet area for lunch/dinner.Recommend to try their squid ink pasta, SOOO good. Generous amount of seafood in the pasta, so it's a must if you want to give it a try.",Il Corallo Trattoria
780,"I've been here several times but I think this will be my last. In my previous visits the food and service has been pretty good, but this visit was very disappointing. Our server seemed very disinterested in serving us and more like she just wanted us to hurry up and get done. We ordered the eggs Benedict and huevos rancheros. The huevos rancheros looked good but were so salty that I left a big portion of it since it just wasn't worth my blood pressure rising. Since our server was pretty much checked out we only had 2 carafes of the mimosas. She quickly brought out the check and that was the most of our interaction, she never asked how the food was because it was evident that she didn't care. To make matters worse the ladies bathroom reeked  of vomit! Spending over $50 per person for this sad brunch has me rethinking my priorities in life. If you come here hopefully you have a better server and enough alcohol to make up for the mediocre food.",Had high hopes because I've seen this place a lot on Instagram and the atmosphere lives up to expectations but my food was cold and the portions were a little small. Also upset that they would only split the check four ways. So unrealistic if you want to be a hot spot for big brunches. I have a feeling that they can split it more ways most restaurants can and they're too lazy to.,"Appalling. The service was particularly bad, we were left standing at the front for 20 minutes despite having a reservation. No one even acknowledged our existence. When we were finally seated and ordered our food, it was mediocre at best. The staff had the audacity to add a 25% tip to the bill when the service was abysmal. I chose this place for my birthday and was so let down, don't bother coming here unless you want to get drunk and forget it all. The one plus was that jugs of mimosas were left on our table so it truly was bottomless.","**this review is for brunch only ** amazing bottomless brunch, they do not disappoint! continued carafes of mimosas, we couldn't even finish them! super helpful staff & Joe is the best btw! I will say that the bloody marys are not great. they were just vodka... food was amazing, we had two vegans with us & the staff was helpful and accommodating with that as well. would totally go back !!","I came here after dinner in the area and wanted a bit of a night cap. We came and ordered a couple drinks at the bar.The ambiance is definitely yuppie and loud, which is fun if you're going for that. The well drinks were great and there's a decent selection of draft beers. It's a lot of fun, not much of a dancing area but I did see people eating dinner here.Overall, would come back and enjoy the ambiance but definitely more of a party/group vibe.","The place looks very nice, comfortable for groups and the staff is very friendly.We came here for bottomless brunch with friends.You will love their drinks, they actually use very nice champaign vs the cheap Champaign some brunch places like to use just to mix it.Food and appetizers were good.",CK14  The Crooked Knife
781,"I enjoyed my meal at NoMad, but it didn't knock my socks off. I stayed at the hotel the past week (enjoyed my stay there). The restaurant was very busy on a Thursday night, we were sat by the door and cold wind kept blowing in. I ordered the white truffle (I'm a sucker for white truffle when in season). The pasta was done nicely. I also ordered the sea urchin appetizer. For a Michelin stared restaurant, I was expecting more. I also found The service was a little apathetic. In summery, it fell short of the experience I was expecting","Came for dinner to just try the famous chicken even though we were full from a late lunch/pre-dinner drinks at the show.Though I mentioned that it was her birthday celebration, no mention was done by the front of house. The coffee and matcha latte that we ordered were delicious, but the chicken was really disappointing.Extremely heavy with quite a dry breast. We both weren't sure what the hype was. And at $98, I think you are much better to go with couple apps and a main instead.Would try their brunch next time instead.","Second time here and already going down hill massively.  This is simply put overpriced for what you get.  The charcuterie board for 35 dollars a person is a joke.  It's regular kielbasa and essentially pigs in a blanket.  Really disappointing for what I thought was a high end restaurant.  I got the chicken dish for one which they said was their speciality.  Unimpressed as well, it's a chicken breast.   Sorry, much better at this price range in NYC.","Amazing food, cocktails and service. Not much else you can expect if you're not in the mood for a tasting menu, but want great food.Carrot tartar, bay scallops, and of course the roasted chicken were all outstanding. My new NYC go to lunch spot.","Yes yes and yes !Ambience ServiceThe hotel venueThe foodThe Amish chicken, the locally sourced Long Island fish, the farm fresh harvestNomad was another in my series of bday treats and boy, was it the highlight . Even the flatbread with the zucchini, tomatoes and pecorino was well doneThe best thing about the menu was not outlandish combinations of flavors or gimmicky fusions but the solid simple consistency- still with a hint of creativity- and the flawless execution of the simple art of cooking. Chefs Daniel Humm and Will Guidara, of Eleven Madison Park, run this and I have a feeling that nothing short of eleven Madison itself will ever top this bday dinner. It honestly put the fine blue hill's chefs tasting experience - with it fresh ingredients and unique combinations -  from my night before to relative shame. Chicken - oh what do I saw about this amazing chicken, presented before cooking and cooked in three ways. My favorite was of course the breast stuffed with brioche, black truffle under the skin and foie gras was the stuff of dreams. The venue - oh the venue : five distinct spaces, all designed by Parisian architect Jacques Garcia: a dark-oak-clad dining room with heavy fabrics and an open hearth; a sunlit atrium with a pyramidal glass roof; a cozy fireplace room; a library for afternoon tea and evening nightcaps; and a cocktail lounge featuring a stately mahogany bar. One definitely feels transpired to a different time and place and after a night at the mcintryre hotel - it was the perfect endAlmost as perfect as the end to the meal itself : the milk and honey. The dehydrated milk and buckwheat honey: do yourself a favor and just get it. And while you're at it, don't forget the queen bee barley latte with the same honey as a palate cleanser. New favorite. Until next time - NoMad; Perhaps this time I will be rewarded with a seat in your atrium ;)","I have spoken to many a men and women that say they would never shell out two dollars shy of a hundo for chicken....well friends they are dead wrong in there ideology!If you come to The NoMad you come to The NoMad for the chicken. My good friends and I came to this restaurant for my birthday dinner and we kept smelling some would say almost a magical aroma. After analysis I have concluded it is the smell of the chicken being ""shown"" to you! That is right after you order the chicken the waiter brings it out to you when it is half way cooked so you can have a look at it! What a magnificent and orginal touch to the dining experience.The chicken is served in three different plates with three unique tastes to each plate of chicken. The thighs were the most original which I would describe as a flavor explosion.....before I tasted it I was forewarned by one of my buddies it has massive flavor and this was not a lie (I would compare it to the sixth taste bud the unami flavor if I had to compare it to anything).The other plate of chicken with some of the most delectable corn and garnishments stood out to me. And finally the main course of chicken - I do not normally eat the skin of the chicken but was informed you must as this is accompanied with foie gras and black truffle butter, this was the most moist succulent chicken I have had.Ordered the $32 Walter Gibson for two, I managed to finish it myself as everyone else at the table opted for a different cocktail and I say it was very good but the pickled vegatables that come with it go light on, I put many in my drink as they gave you a healthy size of vegatables however I think it disrupts the overall taste of the cocktail.And please, please order the Milk and Honey dessert! Going to be hard to top this birthday dinner although I do have it on my bucket list to try some Seal in Canada....perhaps next year! And as always people SYOY!!!",The NoMad Restaurant
782,"This place was such a disappointment. My friend and I went for dinner tonight and the experience was sad. First the positives: the wait list was super easy to get on and the scallop was very tasty.Now the bad. My friend ordered yakisoba without pork and two chicken breast skewers. I ordered okinomiyaki, a scallop skewer and a chicken skin skewer. We wrongly assumed that because we ordered our skewers separately that they would arrive separately with our meals. The first red flag was when my friend got her noodles, which were in a spicy kimchi sauce, despite nothing on the menu indicating that it would be anything different than the standard sweet gingery soy sauce that typically accompanies yakisoba.  The second red flag was when our skewer order had been combined.  My friend can't eat seafood as she is highly allergic so I took my skewers off the plate and we sent hers back because of the cross contamination.My okinamiyaki arrived next, and looked promising. It soon turned out that it was mostly dough and had no flavor. There were promises of flavor and porky goodness, but everything that makes okinamiyaki tasty was absent (cabbage, flavor).  Meanwhile my friend attempted to eat her strange kimchi yakisoba, and when we asked about it we were told that's how it comes, despite the words kimchi not appearing anywhere near the yakisoba description. It was also too spicy for her to eat.It also took forever to replace the chicken skewers and when they arrived it was like they hadn't been seasoned at all. Not even a shio grilled seasoning.  Typically ( at least at other places) the skewers are basted in a soy based sauce.  At no point did we indicate a soy allergy or that the typical yakisoba sauce would be unacceptable.  The only explanation seems to be that the sauce they use to grill the meats or on the noodles has pork or seafood cross contamination, which probably would have changed our order, but would at least explained why everything she got was bland or improperly flavored. At the end we also saw that they added a special order for the kimchi flavored noodles, which again wasn't what we asked for and contradicts what the waiter told us. TL;DR our food was disappointing, not what we ordered, and the staff didn't seem to care. Will not be returning, not with all the tasty options within blocks of this place.",Food is pretty good but service seems brusque at times - in particular the hosts/hostesses.  One time we used Yelp Waitlist only to be made to wait as host prioritized walk ins right in front of us.  Then they were very argumentative when we pointed it out rather than being apologetic or generally showing some level of empathy...  Another time we walked in and were told there's no tables in a way that seemed like we were inconveniencing them by even asking..... I guess I'm sorry for wanting you to take my money..?Hey there's not that many authentic Japanese restaurants in this area so maybe you're ok putting up with that... I think I will just avoid in the future.,"3/5 for food and 2/5 for service. This used to be one of my favorite izakayas in the city. Unfortunately, after they relocated to the new location from 49/7, the food seemed to have taken a noticeable nose dive. The Japanese-style carbonara at the old Bar Hagi was my go-to dish, but the ""creamy"" Mentai pasta was dry and seemed to be missing the spicy cod roe. The fried chicken and kimchi fried rice were pretty unimpressive. While the rest of the dishes were okay, the food for the most part was somewhat disappointing and well short of my expectation. The service was also frustrating as it was so hard to get the waiters' attention.","If I had to pick one, JUST one, Izakaya place to go to in NYC, this would be the place.  Why? The food is reasonably good with a lot of variety. Sure there are cheaper places, more expensive places, but there is no place like Sake Bar Hagi 46 with its amazing variety. It's down right fun to be here to eat and drink with friends in its fun-filled movie-themed Izakaya bar.So what to get:diced prime ribeye: juicy!kushiage combo: variety of fried fish and veggies, not greasygrilled cod: flavorful codfried baby octopus: super crispy and taste great with their mayo saucetakoyaki: crisp on the outside, soft on the inside like in Japan. Fried, so not super authentic, but this might be some of the best takoyaki in NYC. Even the authenticly made ones in NYC are terrible.Yuzu Sake: Its like a lemon soda mixed with sake!Beer: reasonably priced esp during happy hour","A lot to love about this place!  This might be my favorite Japanese restaurant in NYC. This is my go-to Japanese late nite pub grub izakaya  type of joint! They have good selection of both food and beer. So you can find something for anyone.What we liked:-takoyaki: crispy and full of crunchy octopus-Kushi-age: giant fried skewers were crispy and tasty.-fried baby octopus: crunchy. there is something in their batter that that makes it so tasty. nice tart and creaminess with their spicy mayo. -prime rib eye bits: the steak was so tender and juicy. The excellent seasoning and the hot plate that it was served on was great! one of the best sub $20 steaks in nyc and its prime!  comes with ponzu sauce-grilled cod collar: slightly sweet and charred-large alcohol selection from beer to fun sake!Items that were just OK:-grilled beef tongue: chewy and tasteless-yakisoba: too salty and noodles were too limp-omurice: it was large, but rice was dry and the egg was thin and lacked creaminess.-yakitori: wasnt very juicy or charred. probably the grill wasnt hot enough so it was almost like steamed meat without any char or sear.There is a lot to like here. There are some things that were not as great but the great items totally outweigh the mediocre ones.Service is attentive and courteous. Top-notch like many Japanese restaurants.","Delicious and good portions. Great deal for happy hour. Only 4 out of 5 bc service was just extremely rushed. Waiter gave me a terrible look because I couldn't order fast enough. Also, too many options on the menu. Really good find in this neighborhood.

783,Chunky pork tacos are bomb.  Smoothies are trash.  Burritos are good.,Checked the reviews hence why i went... The food was HORRIBLE! Maybe it was once in a million luck for me but the beef had absolutely no flavor and the texture of the taco as a whole was undesirable.Will try again maybe it was off today.,I moved neighborhoods and seriously miss this place! Very quick delivery. Always amazingly delicious.,"Was a little skeptical at first because the restaurant looked closed and empty, but could not be more satisfied with my experience. The food was amazing, with plenty of options and friendly staff. Definitely will be making this place a regular go-to!","Updated Review: this place used to be amazing. It's really gone downhill. Delivery times are often 30 minutes to an hour later than what they tell you it will be. When the food arrives, it's cold and soggy. Original review: When this place is good, it's truly amazing. Quality can be a bit hit or miss though. We order take from here regularly have had to throw out the salsa a few times because it was not good and tasted like it was fermented.

My husband made a reservation for 3 on open table and then reduced it to 2 people about 2 hours before our 7pm time-slot. We took a subway and a bus and because we did not realize we would have to take a bus until after we left our house, we called the restaurant to tell them we would be 10 minutes late. We were already on the bus in the middle of a business district in central brooklyn when met with a recording ""we are closed tonight for a family matter."" I am really sorry about the family matter, and no problem at all to cancel on us, but when you made the recording, why not also go on to open table and cancel the reservations? Even now I am able to make a reservation tonight when you are clearly closed. Anyway, my husband and I got into a huge fight bickering about when to get off the bus because there are no other restaurants around this commercial part of Brooklyn. And i am truly sorry about the unfortunate family matter, which must really be a bad emergency to have treated customers so rudely.","Probably one of the best Italian restaurants that I have ever been to. As an Italian, I know what good Italian food is supposed to taste like. The chef Mario, is from Naples Italy. I met him and he's such an amazing and talented person .We were 10 people. (5 couples)This is our 5th time here. I have been wanting to write their well deserved review, for the longest time. We went here on a Friday night. Our order was as follows:Appetizers- Fried Calamari, grilled octopus, Melanzane Rollatina and Antipasto Misto. Everything was amazing. The food came out hot and was served family style. We literally ate every morsel of food lol. The chef is an amazing cook. You can tell that the food and ingredients are of highest quality. For my main course, I had ""Suprema di Pollo"" its Chicken breast, portobello, cremini, shiitake mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes in a Marsala wine sauce. Served with potatoes and vegetable of the day. This is one of my favorite dishes at Il Porto. The rest of the group ordered various dishes. There was not a single complaint. Dessert and coffee topped the evening. The staff is tentative and they really are great. There is always one of the owners present. If there is a problem, they remedy the situation immediately. I can't speak highly enough about this place. If you want authentic Italian food, then you need to try this place. They also have a pizzeria which is next door to the restaurant. The pizza is just as good. Almost forgot to mention, they have a full bar too and live music on the weekends. Not sure what night the live music is.","Excellent food, drinks and service. We came here last Saturday. There were 10 of us celebrating my 30th wedding anniversary. Everything on the menu sounded great. We literally ordered almost all the appetizers they have on the menu lol.  Each appetizer was amazing. Calamari was the best. For entree, everyone ordered something different. Not 1 person complained about their food. I had a chicken dish ,which I believe the name was chicken supremo. Unbelievable. The chicken literally melted in my mouth. After indulging for nearly 2 hours, it was time for dessert. I spoke to one of the owners and told him that we would love a sampler of desserts for the table. Wow.... Be careful what you ask for. The owner ( Anthony) came out with this huge display of various desserts. If that wasn't enough, he also brought us a complimentary Nutella Pizza. Each dessert was to die for. 3 hours later... We were about to explode. Lol.  Everything was excellent. I have been to many Italian restaurants, and this place makes the top 3 in my book. We will definitely be back. If you want authentic tasting Italian food, this is the place. I heard the chef was from Naples. Now I know why the food was soooooo good.","My crew and I have been eating at Il Porto 3 times/week for the last year and everything about this family-owned ristorante is top-notch. I've brought my restaurant friends from the city to eat here a bunch of times and Porto's solid food and service has never let me down/ always makes me look good in front of my smack-talking buddies. Place is a well-oiled machine, delivery guys going in and out every couple minutes, line for slices moves fast even at lunchtime and people in the dining room always look like they're having a great meal, crackin jokes/sharing the dishes with their buddies. You can tell from the vibe of the lunch crowd that its the highlight of the day for a lot of people. Old school hospitality that you sadly don't get a lot of in other places these days.Pretty obvious why people in the neighborhood are always talking about this spot. Can't be beat.",Il Porto Ristorante
785,"This was by far the worst steakhouse I have visited, and I am a steak fanatic. Let's start..... we were seated promptly, Place had a 1980s ambiance to it, live piano and servers dressed in tux. We both had the ribeye, honestly it is a serving for two. We could have done just one ribeye, steak was tasteless and rubbery , juicy on the outside , potato was mediocre,the sautéd mushrooms had a odd aftertaste that made me want to puke and cream off spinach had had no creaminess and it was bland. Overall ..Paid over $200 and only took a few bites, not worth it.","I eat all over the world and like to try new places. This could be one of the most disappointing places I have dined at in quite some tome. Steak was burned, wine menu by the glass is terrible. Asked for a son and was told ""we don't have one"" - second steak was average.",,"Came here as part of a meeting through work and was very impressed with the steak. Unfortunately, or fortunately, work paid for this meal so I can't comment on the price. I got the filet mignon which was amazingly prepared. Medium rare, tender, juicy, and red. Well cooked and a great cut. Seriously impressed. The sides were mashed potatoes, spinach, and Mac and cheese. All were good but nothing special. Lastly, the ambiance was pretty upscale. Everyone was wearing atleast a button up, very elegant decor, table cloth, and decorations, if you're into that.","I was looking forward to coming here. Great Yelp reviews and allAt first love the duo jazz ensemble in the dimly lit and cozy barWe checked in and were escorted upstairs to a nice dining roomThe waiter was a bit aloof but did his job and I liked that he told us that the porterhouse for three was more than enough for four. Kudos for that We ordered three starters that were mehThe slab of bacon was okBeet salad so soCaprese was so soWhat we did love was the complimentary  mushroom ravioli   Yum!The porterhouse steak came and it was disappointing because it was two porterhouses not a real thick one which was what I was expecting. At least the meat was tender. Also the sauces on the side were blend to meThe sides were also just ok. Charred broccoli with garlic and chili flakes- mehMac and cheese- mehSautéed Mushrooms were goodFries were good dipped in their steakhouse sauceAll in all- with so many steakhouses in NYC that are way more innovative, I don't think I need to go back",We celebrated our anniversary at club a a steakhouses.

786,"Had the venison carpaccio and cod. Clean, minimalistic plating. Tasted good. Uncomfortable chairs. Would go back.",It is a great space. The staff are attentiveand Service is excellent. The food here is good but not the best Nordic food ever. Overall it's still a 4/5 experience.,Didn't even eat there-but tried calling to discuss a reservation cancellation/rebook and was hung up on. Not like an accidental hang up either. Jeezzz I don't want to spend my money here and you don't either if they can't even be polite enough on the phone!,"A subliminal experience from beginning to end. Incomparable culinary creations, impeccable service, classy ambience...and very high prices to match all this. We were seated in the lounge while waiting for our table, in very nice high chairs, and offered house made aquavit. The dinner that followed was nothing short of spectacular. Every dish was a culinary adventure, and the service was impeccable.We had the seasonal menu, added a cheese selection, Bird's Nest dessert. And the horseradish aquavit, wine, glögg, and coffee as for beverages.It was not cheap at $446 total, but worth it still.","I cannot even begin to express my utter disappointment with this sorry excuse for a restaurant, not to mention a so-called two michelin star restaurant. Compare this to Per Se, Eleven Madison Park, or any of the fine establishments that I have been to and this place cannot hold a candle to the other amazing places to eat around NYC. Let's start with the dress code. I called in to the restaurant the morning of our reservation to enquire about what we should wear and was told no jeans, no sneakers, and dress shoes and shirt required. My brother came in from out of town and we had to go out to buy him a pair of dress shoes just for the dinner. But...lo and behold...customers all around us were in sneakers, jeans, and polos. So if you're planning to go, seriously free feel to wear whatever you like. Let's move on to the front desk. My wife and I arrived earlier than the rest of my family. No one offered to take our coats, seat us at the table, or even offer us a drink at the bar. While I wouldn't care if this was just regular dining establishment, I expect far better service from a restaurant that charges a MINIMUM of $150-200/person. Nevertheless, we finally were seated and offered sparkling or still water. I asked for good old regular NY tap water as I do at all of the michelin star restaurants that I have been to and have never been denied. However, at this ridiculous restaurant, they insisted I get bottled water. Again, this is not a problem at per se, jean georges, joel robuchon, french laundry...but at this place apparently tap water is below them. My father also had trouble reading the menu and so he turned on his cell phone light to read the items on the list. He was immediately scolded and ordered to turn it off. I presume this was to avoid bothering the other guests, but a) it was extremely rude and b) no alternative light source was offered. When we requested an alternative source of light the stupid waiter just pushed the tiny candle towards my father which was little to no help. Honestly I was shocked and appalled. I demanded a second candle for him or to at least read off the menu items which he did so begrudgingly. My father shouldn't have to apologize for his poor vision and the ridiculously poor lighting and it is the job of (once again) a two michelin-star restaurant to provide better service and accommodate their guests. If I were to go to the Olive Garden down the road I'm sure i would get better service.With respect to the food, I will try to be more fair. Many of the dishes on the seasonal tasting menu were inventive and well-plated. For that I give my kudos to the chef and kitchen staff. However, I personally wasn't a fan of some of the ""fishier"" dishes like the herring or cod but I understand that it may just not work with my palate. I have already belabored my point enough about this restaurant and its service. I cannot in any way rationalize how this place garnered a two michelin star rating given my experience but either way save your money and go somewhere else. Don't be fooled by the fact that you can easily get a reservation same day as there is a very good reason for that and if you are set on trying it, at least keep on the look out for a groupon deal which I recently noticed was soon-to-be-available.","I picked this restaurant primarily because it was very close to our hotel; it has 2 Michelin stars, so that as a good indicator that the food would be to a high standard. Since my guest and I had to catch a show at the Met Opera, we opted for the 3 course meal. In all honesty if I had to pick my courses again I would've chosen what my guest had (stating this laughingly). As this was our first time here, I wanted to see the specrum of the dishes offered to get a feel of the Nordic cuisine displayed here.The food itself seemed to be overly seasoned/pickled; I'm not sure if that is supposed to authentically represent Nordic cuisine but to my palette it seemed that way. The best way I would describe our dishes was that the plates were beautifully presented and aggressive in flavor. I myself chose the foie gras (red currant, grilled cream, almond), sea bass (morels, cauliflower, rye), and chocolate (malt, banana, walnuts). My guest had the egg (truffle, hazelnut, potato), duck (leek, onion, black garlic), and citrus (bergamot, ginger, kumquat). Along with our meal we had non-alcoholic grape juice selections that were quite excellent.Like I stated earlier, the plating and service are immaculate here. I just can't bring myself to rate this 5 stars as I never had a complete ""wow"" factor while dining here. The particular high point was my guest's duck dish; it was unbelievably moist and executed perfectly. One of the staff explained that it was cooked with an initially cold pan with a low temperature. Of course, the textures and temperatures of every other dish were well orchestrated but I think if some nuances in subtlety in flavor were brought into each dish it would make the courses lighter and more enjoyable.I would definitely come back here to try the full tasting menu when time is not a factor.",Aquavit
787,"Mediocre at best. Got the king Pai chicken,Dan Dan vegetarian,eggplant and oyster mushrooms. The only thing that was good was the king Pao chicken. The Dan dan was over cooked and had tofu pieces instead of crumbled tofu like it should have been to replace the crumbled pork. The eggplant lacked flavor and was very oily. I had high expectations but was sadly disappointed and won't be returning. Bird of a feather is wayyy better than this and so is M Shanghai",I wonder if you can call this place Chinese restaurant. Nothing is better than cheap to go chinese. I liked the atmosphere but the food wise... id rather go to panda express,We tried this place for delivery via Caviar and ordered 2 noodle dishes and a vegetable dish for dinner. Food tasted good until my boyfriend spat out a piece of plastic from the vegetable dish. Photo attached. Will not order again.,"I love that this place is so close to home. My friend and I came here on a Wednesday evening around 6pm and it was mostly empty (though, it filled up towards the time we left). Fantastic service, reasonably priced, and delicious flavors. We ordered the eggplant, green beans, and duck wrap. Everything was top notch. The eggplant is warm and perfectly cooked and not too spicy, the string beans could be a little crisper, but nothing to complain about. Most of all, I loved the duck wrap with plum sauce and pancake. The pancake is the right thickness (hard to achieve) and the flavors perfectly complement each other. Though, the taste of duck was very mild - which is okay since prefer vegetables anyways. My expectations weren't too high considering the neighborhood isn't known for Chinese food. Was pleasantly surprised and I think it s a really great find in the neighborhood. I will definitely be coming back to try other items on the menu.","Very well priced and the best food I have had by far in NY.  We have gone back twice and ordered different things with the same result of being satisfied! The Cold sesame noodles, crispy garlic chicken and angry pig were great! Don't fill up on dumplings as there are so many good choices, even though their dumplings are great.Will come back for a third time to try something else!","Giving this 3 stars because there are some problems. In theory, the menu looks great for eating. However, it didn't turn out to be the case.a) soup dumplings: good inside broth, didn't taste fatty, but skin is not delicate like it should be.b) watercress: wow--what the heck? Why is completely doused in the saltiest fish sauce ever? When I write doused, I mean DOUSED, like it wasn't properly mixed or even tasted. I could understand mixing the sauce, marinade, dressing with some fish sauce, but it's clear the chef did not taste it. I liked the greens, but this is beyond salty. Like, ""Hello! DRINK THIS bottle of entire fish sauce!""-salty. I used some vinegar from the table and the free sweet/acidic/spicy cabbage to eat the rest, but that wasn't enough to fix it. Really I should have just rinsed it in my cup of water.c) maitake: again, WAY too salty. Rest of it was fine, I appreciate the textures.d) dan dan noodles: I've tried this take out and delivery. Noodles were mushy, but sauce was nice. When I write mushy, it is MUSHY. I haven't tried it inside the restaurant. Let me say: the time it took to get from the restaurant to my house wasn't that long to believe that it would still cook while commuting or walking. It just was completely overcooked. Next time maybe I can get the noodles separate and use my own noodles since the sauce is good.e) Mushu: I liked the amount of food you get, but it was so watery--the sauce. Like, how are you supposed to put sopping wet food in the pancake? Major fail for me. f) beef with Chinese Broccoli: beef and greens were cooked nicely, but the sauce wasn't exactly there for me. You definitely get an entire pot's worth of greens--should be shared. The dough noodles were fun to eat, but would be nicer with sharper points--if you want to talk about mouth feel for this particular kind of food (the flour noodle-needles), then pointy to thick is a better shape.h) shrimp toast: not bad, I'm not going to complain too much. I can't quite remember if the shrimp was super soft and juicy--the way shrimp should be, so I can't comment much anymore. And a tip for those who don't know what shrimp should be like: cooking frozen-pre-cooked shrimp is the worst (texture will be terrible--you just lost the flavor--that kind of thing is more suited for ""cocktail"" shrimp). Not saying this place did it, so I don't suspect anything bad like that. Seems like it was probably freshly peeled that day, but again, hard to remember since I didn't eat the toast this year.If the is Chinese, then it's reallllly strange with these problems. Please TASTE the food--do another test run. I've eaten here at least 2xs various years inside the restaurant, then tried it 2xs take out and delivery. Plese tell me that the LES one is better or that I should try other items--which I'm willing to do. And YES I KNOW MY CHINESE FOOD. I've been eating it since I was a baby because I am Chinese and my family is Chinese and I'm pretty positive about what's good. I really do know what's good. I'm not commenting about what is authentic or not, I'm just saying, it was salty AF, too thick, too watery, too mushy. I've never had it that bad...really anywhere. Normally l enjoy going to these kind of new establishments, but this Brooklyn one just had too many issues that aren't good. It's 3 stars for me. Good stars for freshness and quantity. If someone is giving this 5 stars, seriously, the person has zero taste buds. Maybe go to Hakkasan to really taste a difference, or check out simple regular restaurants because I've never had salty AF, mushy or water Chinese food. It's supposed to be perfectly balanced in the savory dept. The free cabbage can use a touch more vinegar. You get a good quantity of food and this place is very popular. I'm sure the drinks are fine, but again cannot comment on that since I haven't had their cocktails. My main concern was the food. Oh, it is loud in there, so expect to raise your voice. And yeah, I had a dinner companion who I'm sure won't dismiss my review.",Kings Co Imperial
788,"Came for lunch on Friday around 12:30 PM - the wait was around 40 minutes. You can't just write your name down and walk around while you wait, you have to physically stand in the line. The restaurant only has one bar with maybe 10 seats total. Got the siphon coffee with Hana beans and the demi-glace omurice. For the wait, not sure if it was worth it. Omurice was definitely tasty but not incredible. Might come back if I decided to go at an off-time when the line is shorter.","This review is solely for the rude customer service we received from the bartender.  When we got seated, it took at least 10 minutes for him to attend to us and ask what we would like. Granted we were in rush since we were on a 1 hour wait for Raku so I tried to get his attention 5 minutes into us getting seated to put an order in. After getting his attention, he would put up his hand as if he was trying to say ""wait please"" but in a rude expression. He caught himself and said ""I'm sorry"" and I said that's fine. When he finally got our order, it took at least another 20 minutes for him to MAKE our drinks. Why? What was he doing? Busy chit chatting with the other customers especially young girls and making small talk about the latest sake bottles. And I don't mean to be racist, but we were surrounded by several Japanese speaking customers. He, without a doubt, showed favoritism towards them, spoke in Japanese and just kept chit chatting with them while while making us wait. It got up to the point that I was almost starting to get confused whether he was the bartender or just the guy that works at the cash register because he showed NO notion of trying to prepare our drinks. I didn't see him making any drinks for anyone else after we got there. When he finally started to make our drinks, he left midway AGAIN to talk to customers. Excuse me ?! Can you please finish making your drink and DOING YOUR JOB before you start socializing with other people again ?! How rude and disrespectful of other people's time. By the time he finished making our drinks, we had 5 minutes left to finish our drinks since our 1 hour wait at Raku was up. We literally has to chug our drinks in order to make it. It was not enjoyable at all and it showed that it took him almost a whole hour just to get our drinks. I also had to cancel the seared mackeral order that he claimed would only take 10-15 minutes to come out because we needed to leave by the time our drinks came out. That is unbelievable and ridiculous and the WORST customer service ever. Maybe since we aren't Japanese speaking, we got the low end of the service ? I have no idea, but it was very apparent and obvious the difference in treatment. It's sad that such an elegant and intimate setting that is tainted by such service and the drinks were mediocre. The one was with a mixture of beer and calpico was good compared to the mojito mix than the mojito.","I must say that this place gets very crowded after awhile. Too bad you can't make reservations in advance. I only went during the night time so not sure how it is during the day time. It probably has a different feel both times.So for the food option we got the sumo ika - charcoal grilled squid. It looked really cool when we saw a few people eating this as you're grilling precooked squid on a grill. The grill kept going out as we were right by the door and the breeze was cold. For sake we ordered the suigei- which is dry and ricey. Tasted great together. Not sure if I would be going back, but perhaps??","Great service and awesome food. Very reminiscent of small restaurants in Japan. I was having Japan withdrawals after my trip and looked up places to get my fix. I stumbled onto Hi-Collar and decided to give it a try. I saw from the reviews that the wait time is pretty long so I got out early on a Friday to try my luck at their lunch service. I went with a friend and as a party of two we waited about 45 mins to an hour. I imagine the weekend wait to be way worse.I ordered the omurice with demiglace and katsu and the katsu sandwich. Both were delicious. The omelet was really fluffy. I would definitely go back for their katsu sandwich again if I had two hours to kill. Overall, despite the wait, it was a great experience. With the limited seating at the bar you get a really up close and personal interactions with the cooks/servers as well.","I would give Hi-Collar 1 more star if the tonkatsu wasnt sooooo small.Omurice was great! Creamy omelete with fried rice drenched in tasty demiglace is always a win win. The egg was still a little runny on the inside and the rice was flavorful.  One of the best Omurice in NYC in my opinion. Most places just overcook the egg or use rice that is way tooo soggy. Rice game was on point. It's a little bit harder than regular white rice so it has a nice texture. However, to pay like $6+ for 3 bite sizes tonkatsu seems extremely high for what it is. Instead of giving you the whole piece of pork, they just fry a giant piece and cut 3 pieces for you. Visually, not the most appealing.  For $20+ for fried egg, fried rice with a small portion of pork, seems a little high for this cheap eats japanese dish. While good, its not great to be worth $20+.Oh yea, wait time, come early or mid afternoon.","Hi-Collar had been on my list of places to visit in the city for so long, and I finally managed to check it off my list. I arrived at 10:45 on a Saturday morning just to make sure that we'd be able to get in with the first batch of  customers. Luckily, we were the third group in line so there was nothing really to worry about. Since it's a small space, everyone got quite cozy once we were seated.Everything on the menu looked delicious, and honestly, we had to keep ourselves from ordering just about everything. We ended up deciding on the Original Omurice (no additions), the Mentai Cream Pasta, and the Hot Cakes with Strawberries. Perhaps my expectation of these dishes were much too high, but all of them failed to meet what I was expecting.1) Omurice -- The eggs were fluffy, but in my mind, I thought it would be a little more runny (think the videos that show the omelette being cut open and the eggs just flowing down the sides). However, they were fine. The rice inside was just okay as well. It was a little hard and didn't really taste like anything special.2) Hot Cakes -- The girl burned our pancakes a bit, and they didn't really taste like anything that I couldn't get elsewhere. They were on the dry side and not very fluffy or light. You get three strawberries for the additional $2.3) Mentai Cream Pasta -- I think that, if it weren't for the fact that I can actually make this myself, this would have been my favorite dish. However, since I didn't find the version that I make to be too far off from what they served, it didn't seem like something that I'd go out of my way for.I'm glad that I was able to try it and make my own decisions about it. However, I'll probably go elsewhere next time.",Hi-Collar
789,"One star for the very good food.  Lack of of other stars for the very very bad service.  Lunch. Sat at the bar near the windows.  First time there (new to the neighborhood) and we eat out very often.  Indifferent bartender but got us we asked for in a timely manner.  My luncheon companion ordered risotto.  Yes, we understand that it takes some time.  A waiter who had throughout our wait, kept bellowing to other waiters in the dining area about table number 10 ""Needs this, needs that;"" ; this led me to believe he was the head waiter.   He finally, just after two pm, seats himself at the other end on the bar.    Almost immediately stands up walks to where we are sitting and turns the tv on right over heads, sound loud.  walks back to the other end of the bar and turns the tv on down there.  I comment to my companion that it might have been appropriate that he asked us if we minded the tv on with sound on.  My companion promptly asks him to turn the sound off over our heads.  He does so then increases the sound on the tv at the other end of the bar, LOUDLY.  The bar is only 10 or so seats so we can hear it quite well.  My companion, loudly and forcefully, says to the waiter, we asked you to turn the sound off.  The waiter jumps up and insists that we do not have to be rude.  My companion says that he should not have to ask twice as we are the customers, still waiting for our meal.  The waiter now angry, says that he is a customer too and he should be able to do what he wants.  He continues to bellow at us about being rude, as he is now being.  We got our food and after a very uncomfortable meal took our leave.  No thank you, no apology, no nothing.  We will not be back and will very definitely make no positive recommendations.","We arrived early around 6:30 and figured we barely made the cut for the happy hour that ran from 4-7pm. When we arrived, there was no host nor bartender that greeted us for at least 10 minutes. Finally a server acknowledged us and told us he'd get the host. About 10 minutes later, the host said he'd seat us soon. It was already 6:55 so we asked the bartender (who seemed disinterested in anybody) for their happy hour specials. She finally mentions the happy hour was only for the rooftop. Our reservation was at 7 so we decided to just wait. We asked the host and they said all parties had to be present.When we were finally seated, we had to ask the host for the menus and more forks/napkins as they were missing utensils on the table setting. We each only also received once piece of bread; why they didn't provide us with a basket is beyond me. Also it was a humid day and I was thirsty, but the water wasn't refilled until 8pm (at least 20 min later).The pasta arrived pretty quickly however, albeit the wrong order. On top of that, they charged us a fee ($40) for the cake we brought. We were pleased with the food but overall unsatisfied with everything else.Overall, ultra slow service, unpreparedness of the staff, the inaccurate order, and the hidden fee makes it one star. The quality of food makes up for it a bit so I'll round it up to 2 stars. Would not return or recommend.","They charged me for 1700 dollars for 2 drinks. I don't recommend coming here.  I don't know how other people feel but I feel that's wrong. Bad place bad service and bad customer relations, try called me a liar.","Came here with a party of 6 for my dad's 70th birthday this past Saturday night. The service was impeccable, particularly from our waiter Fadil Morina. He has a great personality and had no problem accommodating my gluten free needs and a very lively table. The Maitre D (or possibly the owner?) was also great, wish I got his name, and he gave us a bottle of red wine at no cost! We also got additional complimentary martinis at the end of the meal, which was very generous. In addition to the great service, and perhaps more importantly, the food is fantastic. I've been to this restaurant once before, and the food was consistently great both times. Thank you, Allora Ristorante and Fadil for hooking us up on my dad's 70th birthday! We'll be back!","Amazing food, amazingly loud. Don't come for the conversation, come for the deliciousness. You'll get a true feeling of Italian awesome cuisine... the veal chop (huge), well prepared fishes, and fantastic appetizers. Did I mention loud? The cacophony is just worth it, but this wouldn't be a regular go-to for me if I needed / wanted to connect with people. The wait staff hustles and is fully outfitted in tuxedos and they earn their keep (though a trip downstairs to the restroom let me in on the near-to demeaning way they deal with the bar backs, dish room people, etc.).","Let me be clear in saying that both the service and atmosphere at Allora Ristorante were exceptional. My business party of four were well tended to in what was a comfortable and classy atmosphere. Having sung those praises, at the end of the meal we all kind of thought it was just okay. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?Like I mentioned, the staff at Allora Ristorante were exceptional. They were just the right amount of attentive and ensured we stayed on schedule given we were coming together for a pre-meeting lunch. I'll point out that they did try and upsell us at virtually every order, but who can fault them. Star. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?Allora isn't cheap, especially when you've been upsold into three orders of squid and octopus appetizer, but at $24.00 my mushroom risotto entree wasn't unreasonably priced. Star. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?This was good, but not what I would call great risotto, and I received comparable feedback from my coworkers regarding their saffron risotto and the squid ink ravioli. For the risotto the flavors were just a bit too simple and while I liked the cheesy consistency it wasn't incrementall good compared to what I can find even back in Los Angeles. Single Star. Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?Allora is good, but it would be a stretch to say I would be excited to go back. No Star.",Allora Ristorante
790,"Overall: Bathroom 3.5, Food 5.5, Average 5 star.Bathroom is meh. Messy from constant use since there is one for girls and one for guys, even though a girl came out of the guy's bathroom when I got up to use it. Everything works, there's actually a urinal in the men's one so we don't have to use the toilet. Heavy traffic, so getting to use one is difficult and also the outside is where busboys and waiters walk through so you seem like a nuisance while waiting. However, since I know the traffic is heavy and the employees are swamped I wont give it a 2 star. They are opening up another gopchang story on the first floor so stay tuned. Hopefully the bathroom is amazing and bigger.Food is to die for, if you haven't had marinated large intestines, you haven't lived life to the fullest and you should be ashamed of your existence.Waitlist is 2-3 hours on weekend dinners so you really gotta check-in in advance.","Very disappointed at this yelp waitlist... don't get it. I waited for a 3 tops at 7:30pm.Estimated was 30 minutes became 2 hours, they keep letting people behind us seated and it's the same guest count and when we asked the hostess she said they have more guest .... but it was 3ppl like my group... -.- I also went inside and it's empty seats all over -.- do you make your guest wait for fun? Unacceptable !Please be aware of the stairs, long & steep, I fell and hurt my knee :(","The wait here can be unbearable at times but the food is consistently on point.  If your looking for bbq-ed intestine, Korean style, this place will not disappoint.  Make sure you put yourself on the waitlist via Yelp and then check in so you get seated on time!","TLDR: KBBQ specializing in beef intestines. Definitely a unique experience if you've never had. This what the restaurant is known for but they do serve other types of meat if offal cuts are not your thing. Try to go during a non-peak time or be prepared to wait for awhile.So the first time I had Gopchang Story was in Korea. I don't like intestines, I've come to eat it more because my SO likes it but still it is not my favorite. When I had this in Seoul, this was probably the best thing I ate on my trip. It's a bit different here although it is the same restaurant chain.The portions here are not particularly large and if you'll probably need 3/4 of an order per person. It is incredibly rich though, so maybe it's not a bad thing. The rice cakes are dusted with this special seasoning (I swear it's some blend of garlic powder) and they're quite addictive. You can order more of these separately. Stick with the fried rice made on the grill, the ones that come directly from the kitchen are not as good IMO. The small intestines I think taste the best, especially if you let them sit for awhile and render out - they get ultra crispy.I do wish the grills were actual gas grills, I feel like it doesn't get the high heat to really crisp them up. It almost ends up boiling in its own fat.So while this is not my favorite place, I do recommend you try it. Especially if you want to experience something new. It's nice to have this gap in Korean cuisine filled by Gopchang Story. As you've noticed, a lot of other Korean restaurants have started serving gopchang recently too.",Gopchang is my favorite food! I am glad I came here to try. We had double assorted gui and gopchang jeongol (intestine casserole). Both of them are super delish. Double assorted gui alon probably can feed 4 people and casserole feeds 3 people (=we were party of 4 so we ate a lot). Grape fruit Makgeoli was a killer too.I was told to be there before the restaurant open and I got there at 4:45pm on Saturday. There was a line going out of the door. We left at 6:30 and still there was a line so be mindful that you probably need to be on a line when you want to dine at this place.,"Summary:Gopchang Story is an excellent restaurant that sells gopchang (beef or pig intestine). The food was delicious and was fun to eat as well.Food:We ordered the small gopchang which was enough for two people if you get the additional items. At the end you can add on fried rice with cheese and they'll cook it in the leftover oils of the gopchang, which made it taste extra delicious!The gopchang was well made, and they will help you cook it. Each of the pieces tastes excellent, especially if you let the outside cook to a crisp. The seasoning they put on it was also delicious.The fried rice you make after is also quite good, especially if you get the cheese version in the eggs, which adds this nice cheesy taste to it.Service:Service was excellent, and they help cook your gopchang!",Gopchang Story BBQ
791,"I found the place nice enough. But at a Friday happy hour the woman bartender, around 50yo, long dark hair - she's seems to have been in the bartending business too long and was not friendly.

They got us a high top table pretty quick when we asked for seated.The music was LOUD. Throughout our time there, wife and I were having to lean in and repeat ourselves multiple times. Not that we were wanting a quiet drink, but it was loud.The hostess (Seahawks fan) sat us, gave us menus, everything was good. Then... we waited... and waited. Hostess brought us water and said our server would be there soon... we waited and waited. It actually took a long time to see anyone who actually worked here.It was probably 20min until the server got to us. Poor girl, looked like she didn't have help. Saw her frustrated before she got to us while entering something on the computer.The 3 guys who sat down next to us left before she ever made it to the table.  The place appeared to be UNDERSTAFFED at that timeWhen we go to finally order a drink, we ordered Moscow Mules with Tito's Vodka (none of thei cocktails appealed to us).We waited for an additional 8-10min for our drink to arrive. The mules weren't full. Mine had 4 ice cubes, my wife's had a couple more. There was a single wedge of lime in them, and they were less interesting than if I made it myself at home. This was a NO LOVE and IDGAF drink we were served. Sure, it's mainly a beer place, but they serve cocktails and ours were lame.Anyway, waiting for our check now. We can't recommend this place to anyone. It's the worse stop we've made on our NYC trip to this point. YELP let us down on this one. Still love NYC though!",Came for a playoff game and a meal.

792,"My husband gives it 3 stars, I give it 3.5Came here on a Thursday evening for an early dinner. We went with the 8 course meal and let the chef choose for us(dishes are tapas size).The good:Our head waiter(slim with gray hair) was fantastic and made each dish sound amazing.The bread and cheese butter was out of this world.With the exception of 1-2 dishes which we found to be okay, everything tasted amazing.If you don't like something, like capers (yes both, my husband and I hate them), let them know and they will make sure your dishes doesn't have any.The so-so: The place feels a little stuffy. Most men wearing suits and women wearing fancy outfits. They change your utensils and clean any crumbs after each dish... So imagine how annoying it can get if you're eating 8 dishes.Also, the clientele was not diverse ..my husband and I were the only brown people.This is an experience so expect to be there for 3 hours.Once we were done, we had to hunt down the waiter for our check.The bad: If you need to cancel your reservations and don't do so a week ahead, they charge you $100/pp.  I understand that they lose money if people cancel at the last minute but at least give people 48 hours... because life happens.I ended it up getting a stomache later on but my husband did not Even for the experience, this place is somewhat overpriced.Final Verdict: This is one of those once in a lifetime kind of experience.Glad we tried it but doubt I will return.","Food was fabulous so these 2 stars are for the horrible service.  There were 3 of us and we all did the (not cheap at almost $200 pp) prix fixe.  Service was okay until about half way through the meal.  Not sure exactly what happened but perhaps since we had ordered, they thought they were done with us.  I am so annoyed that I spent a lot of money and had such horrible service.  It definitely overshadowed the food.  I'm not sure I will be going back and certainly will not recommend (except to people who don't care that they will have to wait around for anyone to even look at them)","If you're looking to treat your taste buds to amazing Italian food....go to Del Posto for a tasting menu!  It's pricey but worth every bite! Be prepared for an explosion of flavors. At the end you get a menu with each course you've had and the date.If you opt to do the wine tasting, keep in mind it's a glass of wine for nearly every course.  That's a lot and will make you drunk by the end of the meal. I've learned to avoid that.","What a wonderful experience!!! We were seated at the table on the first floor but the whole restaurant was filled with the live classical music on the piano. There are only pre fixed menus being served at the table and you can pick between a 5 course or an 8 course dinner. We chose the 5 course which is priced at 179 pp. Wine pairing is 115 more pp. This place really lives up to the star. The service is a little slow but overall very attentive and professional. The ambiance is very classy and romantic. It's perfect for a celebration or a date.  For the appetizers, we had the carne cruda and the shrimp cruda. Both were very delicious but I liked the beef cruda more. They were served with whipped cheese/cream with a small baguette. For the pastas, we had the linguine allá vongole and the rabbit pasta!!! It was the first time I had rabbit and it was surprisingly good! (Sorry bunnies). The linguine was also cooked to perfect al dente but it was a little salty. Both were delicious tho!For the main courses, we had the chicken and the wagyu steak. THEY WERE BOTH THE BEST DISHES!!!!! Omg the wagyu beef steak was so juicy and tender! The chicken was stuffed with truffle and had foie Gras sauce poured over.The desserts were sooooo good as well. It was the best panna cotta I've ever had in nyc! The chocolate cake was just ok. The birthday madeleines were also very good. I was very happy and full at the end of our meal.Definitely one of the best experiences in NYC! MUST COME HERE for both food and ambiance!! Soooooooo amazing!!!","Del Posto had been on my list of to-visit restaurants for a long time, we finally got the chance to visit over the weekend to celebrate our first anniversary. The reservation was very easy to make online, and I made it a few weeks ahead of our planned date. We got there at 6:15pm on a Saturday night, and were welcomed in and immediately seated. We were both struck by the elegance of the dining room. As for service, it was about on par with other Michelin star restaurants in New York, but there was a strangely long wait time in between being seated and being brought our menus, so much so that we wondered if they'd forgotten. Anyway, they brought our menus out shortly after that. We went with the five course tasting menu ($179). This menu included an appetizer, a choice of two pastas (shared by both of us, so it was two choices and not four), a main dish, and dessert. All the food was presented in a timely fashion, and they started us off with a complimentary melon soup, which was very interesting. We were then brought bread and butter - the bread was freshly baked, and was served alongside a ball of creme fraiche and butter, which resembled burrata very much in appearance. This was delectable. I had ordered a simple antipasti of lettuce, and didn't have high expectations, but the lettuce was small and smothered in a delicious truffle dressing. My husband had the crudo of madai in olive oil, which was also great. We shared the busiati and agnolotti pastas, both were excellent, flavorsome, and had perfect texture with just the right amount of bite. Both the chicken and the pork mains that we had were amazing. I usually shy away from pork, but Del Posto's rendition of pork was perfect.In addition to our desserts, they brought us out some complimentary little donuts, which were very tasty, and a small tray of bonbons. Both of our desserts, the panna cotta, and the griddled sweet cake, were excellent, but I preferred the sweet cake much more. Overall, an excellent experience, and would highly recommend for a special occasion meal, or just because.","Del Posto is a big, dark space right off the West Side Highway and 16th Street that looks and feels a bit like a private club. It's a little too fancy to be described as ""cool,"" but it's also not stiff or uptight. The restaurant is set over two floors with a dramatic, fairly steep staircase, and if you sit upstairs and drink a bunch of wine, be careful when walking down.There are two ways to go about dinner here. First, there's a $149 four-course prix fixe option where you get to pick your appetizer, two pastas for the table, an entree, and dessert. Second, there's a full-on eight-course chef's tasting menu for $179, of which there's also a vegan version. Whichever way you go, you'll eat fantastic high-end Italian food, so the choice really depends on how much of a control freak you are. Based on what we established above, you're probably a pretty big control freak, but we'd say as long as you're not picky, leaving it in the kitchen's hands can make for a memorable evening. If you're willing to cut the evening part out, a meal at Del Posto can be had for a third of the price at lunch, when there's a $49 three-course option, with an additional (and recommended) $10 pasta supplement.Del Posto is not the place to come if you're looking for a fine dining experience that involves wacky foams and gels and molecular gastronomy elements. It is the place to come if you like the idea of eating great pasta and a perfect piece of fish or veal, and you'd like to be treated like you're at a five-star European hotel as you do it. New York is always going to be full of too many good choices (and probably even more bad ones), but as long as you enjoy excellent Italian food and outstanding service that makes you feel special, you'll walk out of Del Posto pleased.",Del Posto
793,This is not my favorite brunch spot. The entrees are very veggie heavy and not very big. I thought the dish I ordered was ok but nothing special. The coffee was also very small and not great. I would not go here again.,"I had high hopes for this place. However, I left underwhelmed and still hungry. The strip steak was six small slices of steak with 4 tiny potatoes...for 32 bucks. What?!","To be able to walk into a restaurant, look at the menu and not feel like I am navigating a gluten mine field is just such a relief and then to have every single dish I ordered be so flavorful just takes the experience to another level. I can't wait to go back!","This place is phenomenal.  I would come here all of the time if I worked/lived close by.  Came here one week night after a school alumni obligation, and wanted a quick but nice bite that wasn't super expensive, and healthy but tasty.  It's a tall order, and they delivered 100 times over.Their cocktails are amazing-literally.  They have the freshest ingredients (think like high end juice presses, but with alcohol).  And the food-oh my goodness-so good.  We got the shishito peppers, I want to say one other app that I can't remember now, and the grilled shrimp added to one of their salads-I wish there were more places like this that made earthy food so completely delicious and not outrageously expensive.If pure in the area, it's worth a stop-but go when you can take your time and try a thing or two-including a cocktail!","Mushroom and cauliflower tacos, sweet potatoes , sheep's milk ricotta , Yuzu lemonade were all on point. We did tapa style and we're coming from equinox so might have ordered with our stomachs but it was surprisingly healthy and light while still being filling and satisfying.Might be on the Pricier end if you go tapas style : for the kind of fare and it's rustic, almost industrial ambience it can definitely add up but the portions were at least generous","I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a long time. I wanted to go out to eat dinner with a very sweet friend of mine for my birthday and asked her if she would be down to try this place out. We made plans to meet each other there to celebrate on a Monday at 6pm. While on my way to the restaurant, she texted me that she is running a little late but had made a reservation for us at 6pm. I arrived to the restaurant a little after 6pm and it was mostly dead. The hostess allowed me in without my friend and I was seated before my friend arrived. The restaurant is off to a good start already. My friend arrives a few minutes after and she lets her in without a problem. The waitress for our table already gave me water by the time my friend got there. Once my friend and I were ready to order, I asked her what the LBT sauce includes that comes with the Grass-Fed Burger and she was able to answer me. Answer: a bunch of stuff like mayo, mustard, ketchup, etc. mixed together. I decided to order the burger but without the sauce and without a bun. I didn't bother to ask if there were any substitutions for the bun but she mentioned that I could get the burger in a lettuce wrap. I decided to have the lettuce sub for a bun. I got my burger medium rare with sweet potatoes on the side. The burger was good. The sweet potatoes were also pretty good but around half of a couple of the pieces were slightly undercooked. It was still very edible and better than ones at other restaurants I have been to. Boo to burnt or very undercooked sweet potatoes, yuck!  I also got the Seasonal Greens as a side. The leafy, thick greens had a little bit of a spice kick to it and it was pretty good. While we were eating, she did stop by to ask how our food was and refilled my friend's cup with more water. For dessert, my friend got the vegan chocolate mousse and I got the berries with coconut cream. My friend asked the waitress to have a candle put on my berries with coconut cream dessert because it was my birthday. My dessert arrived with a lit up candle and was delivered by two non-singing men. Phew!  The waitress stopped by while we were eating our desserts to check to see if a candle came with my dessert. The coconut cream had what looked like and tasted like pieces of basil. The texture and consistency of the coconut cream was good. There was a generous amount of berries (blueberries, strawberries, and few pieces of raspberries and blackberries). The berries were also fresh. All in all a decent and very healthy dessert option. On the other hand, the restaurant's chocolate mousse wasn't a decent dessert option. My friend and I thought it had a weird taste. This weird taste appeared in the back of my mouth, around the time I swallowed a bite of it. We didn't finish most of it. Toward the end of our visit, the waitress wished me a happy birthday. Also, right before we left, I noticed that the place was a full house; There was only one table with two seats vacant. I don't know what the waitress' name is, but she might have told me. What I do know is that she was wearing glasses, had her hair up in a pony tail, and was on her game. Overall, decent food (You can't beat free! Thanks, sweet friend! ;) and great service. However, there was hardly anything on the menu that I wanted to try out so it might be a long time before coming here again.",Little Beet Table
794,"So disappointed with the menu section, the small portion sizes, and taste of food.  Not what I expected.  Before we were seated they left us outside waiting without menus for over 15 minutes.  When we were finally called inside to be seated they made us uncomfortably wait inside and in the way of the fire exit for another 5 minutes.  There was only one thing on the Menu that caught my attention and they were completely out of it by 8:15pm.  We were not told what they did not have when the waitress arrived at the table.  The only other options the waitress could suggest were their Tacos (very small and expensive...$8 each at dinner) and a $32 Steak dish.....What? I can't eat cheese which obviously was a problem for this establishment.  The chips were hard round corn tortillas which would have been okay but they only gave us 6x for our guacamole and there were 6 people in our party.  The food was tasteless and the corn tortillas completely overwhelmed the dish, I didn't think that was possible.  The vegetarian in our group was at a loss for what to eat.  She ended up getting some corn tortillas, rice, beans, and lettuce.  The dessert menu was lackluster and our entire table agreed to go elsewhere.  I do not recommend.  6 of us were seated at a 4 person table next to the kitchen and I felt in the same way the entire time.  Expensive with a one stall bathroom in the back.  The worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been to.","2.5 stars if I could. It's hard to rate this establishment. Went there this evening. We were immediately seated outside, which was great. Especially because we were walking around forever trying to decide what to eat. Although we were seated immediately, the waitress took a very long time to come and take our order. We ordered 3 drinks and guacamole to start. The guacamole came after about 20 mins of ordering. The drinks did not come at all we had to inquire about it. The drinks were good and so was the guac.  Again, we had to wait a reallly long time for the food. I ordered 1 Tinga and 1 queso quesadilla. I did not like either. My cousin ordered chicken enchiladas and did not like it. My other cousin ordered the salmon special and did.  I asked the waitress to change my quesadilla for something else. She was very accommodating. However, after thinking about it and how long it took for everything to arrive I passed.  I like the vibes but I will not come back.",Had brunch there. It was ok but nothing special. No idea why people wait in line for this place.,"Margaritas made just how you like it.  Should I say more?  Why yes!This is a nice spot in Brooklyn with a vast drink and food menu.  It's a lil tight but the ambiance is very relaxing and great for a date night or a bite with a small group of friends (like under 4).I would definitely suggest a margarita.  I had the classic, however, they do offer different flavors, if that's you thing.  Plus I'm all about the sugar rim and they gave you plenty.The guacamole is freshly made and they give you extra chips if you need it.Service was great and quick.",Excellent tequila mezcal selectionExcellent mole and chilaquilesPork in the haruche could have been a little warmer and more tender but great other than that.Cute atmosphereWould totally come back,"Mexican food is how you win me over.So, I know what you're thinking. Is this place like legit. Is it authentic. How do I know what's authentic or nah? You try the gauc and chips. Chavela's nailed the perfect lime proportion to the avocado smash. It was chunky enough and freshly made. Just the right amount of salt and citrus! Now the rest of the menu: my boyfriend ordered the shrimp enchiladas and i had the don plato with pescado and camarones aka build your own fish and shrimp taco. Our verdict: AMAZING. Tip: ask for habanero sauce for that extra kick if you like spicy food. I honestly thought they were only gonna for me like 5 tiny tortillas but NO! They were kind to provide more but they should given how big the platter is. (Picture attached). Ugh, it's so good.The Spanish rice was a tad dry but not too bad. Overall, the food was good. The enchilada was good too! The green sauce really was authentic and brought the dish together. We had dinner around 7p and not long enough of a wait and seated outside. Staff was on point with checking in and providing extra requests like sauces and utensils.Def gonna heads back! It's a little more pricey than I would like for tacos but it's a nicer place. If I had to vote who served better Mexican compared to Rosie's and Chavela's. CHAVELAS WIN.",Chavela's
795,"BEST brunch I've had in Manhattan:1. Bagel Board with half whitefish and lox - holy smokes this is the best bagel. Not even comparable to the bagel and lox you get at typical bagel shops, which are already very good in most NYC places.2. Buffalo French Dip - usually the dip is incredibly dry at other restaurants but this was UNBELIEVABLE.3. Jersey Girl - pork belly with egg, do I need to say anymore here?I hate writing reviews but had to do one here.","Had the Burger for a late brunch. It was good, but the potatoes were under cooked and the water glasses smelled absolutely rancid. Even after asking for replacements, the glass smelled very unsanitary. The staff wasn't super attentive, but the hostess was great! Overall, Wouldn't go back, because to top it off the menu was very limited.","Was seated by a host and sat for 20 minutes and not one person approached me. 10 minutes prior, I had asked a staff member if I order from the cafe section and they said ""no a server will come"", a server never did. The sad part is that I don't even think anyone noticed when I left. Won't be going back.","This is a good solid meal. I might have even given it a 5 star review but I tried one of the bagels that people are all about these days and wasn't wowed. It was a good bagel but it wasn't quite right. There are other bagels in NYC that are a great consistency, great flavor in the dough, and  great flavor fo the type of bagel. I just thought this one was fine.My friend and I came for lunch during the work week around 1:30PM. There were many tables full, but plenty of tables to sit at which was nice. They asked if we had a reservation, which we didn't have and didn't need but I imagine more towards noon, dinner time, and on weekends this place gets pretty packed so I recommend doing that. There were lots of great looking options on the menu and we both had a tough time deciding. We started with the labne plate and I got the heriloom tomato salad with ricotta and my friend got the brown rice bowl with tofu and a fried egg. We didn't have to wait long for the labne and it was delicious! The bread that came with ti was outstanding. Our mains came out fairly quickly too and both were quite good. The tomatoes were fresh and ricotta was also clearly very fresh. The flavors went so well together and the tomatoes were dressed beautifully. My friend's dish was excellent! It was so fully fo flavor. I actually want to go back and get that next time! I think their breads are great, the bagel was just fine, and their other dishes are excellent.","Great service, great food and great outdoor seating for perfect people watching. Went there this weekend (Saturday) and our server was so enthusiastic about the food! She was fantastic! And her enthusiasm was spot on. The food was incredible. Get the salad on the brunch menu. I know that's a hard brunch decision, but it's fantastic. Love this place. Great neighborhood spot.","Stopped here for breakfast to treat my mom on her birthday. We ordered two sandwiches and split them. The bodega was delicious. The sausage is very thick and the biscuit is dense. The forager was amazing! I loved the mushroom and how delicately the milk bun held the sandwich together. My mom preferred the bodega and I preferred the forager.Definitely coming back for the pastries. They all looked so good, especially the black sesame kouign amann.Also, the service is quick and super friendly.",High Street On Hudson
796,Brunch is tastyIts surprisingly empty for a Saturday at 1pmservice was goodenvironment is cool,"Saw really good reviews so I wanted to give it a try. We ordered soup of the day, foie gras, risotto and meat stew. Everything was mediocre. We returned the soup because it was too salty. Maybe it's because I had a high expectation  on this restaurant, since I was missing French food in Paris. If you've ever had authentic French cuisine, i wouldn't recommend you coming here.","What kind of twisted trend is this? Yet another European restaurant pops up in the hood. And the irony is far from lost on me, a place that celebrates social antagonists located on Malcolm X Blvd.Well, despite its very presence reminding me of imperialism, the food is just ok. The service likewise. I've been here twice now. We will not be back. Certainly not worth the hype. But hey, the Emperor has some new clothes.","A Neighborhood GemWe have eaten at L'Antagoniste since its opening in 2015 and have had exceptionally good meals every time. The tasty and innovative food is arguably the best in Bed-Stuy. There is an extensive and finely chosen wine list as well. Just when you think you cannot eat any more, the restaurant offers a range of special desserts, including the Paris-Brest that would make a French pastry chef swoon. The atmosphere is sophisticated yet homey, making L'Antagoniste a very pleasant dining experience. The garden/outdoor seating keeps me coming back and is one of our favorite outdoor areas because it is partially covered and full of plants. The wait staff are attentive and knowledgeable. It is always nice when a restaurant succeeds because of its staff and not in spite of it. L'Antagoniste has been consistently good for some years and it gets better. Prices are relatively modest, especially given the quality. Come here to impress a date, have Sunday brunch with a group of friends, or hangout at the bar by yourself. L'Antagoniste is unpretentiously perfect and definitely worth trying-again and again!",My favorite date spot dot com.Been here more than 5 times!! Each time is a hit.I always walk into a vibe of soft spoken individuals with romantic music in the background. It's always a candle light dinner at its finest. We always start with the dozen of oyster with a bottle of dry red. Menu changes and I love trying their specials and it's never a let down. Food quality is truly amazing. This place made me love French bistro even more.,"This place is awesome. My father and I had a great meal here in the outdoor space which is super nice. I got the burger and loved it. Very well-run establishment. We also loved the neighborhood, which was tree-lined streets with beautiful brownstone homes.",L'Antagoniste
797,"The Good: Food and service were quite good. Wine was decent.The Bad: Lack of ventilation (our clothes and hair stunk of food and smoke when we got home) and no sound absorption (very loud, hard to hear to each other during our meal).","Could be great, but was just ok. Decent food and service, but no ambience (loud and dark) whatsoever and extremely poor ventilation system (I don't need to smell my food cooking in the back, nor do I need to go home smelling of it). Wine selection was fine. Overall, not impressed and would not return.",Big disappointment. Had brunch there last week. In our hood so wanted to try it. Brunch was decent so went back last night with some friends for dinner. Disaster! Mediocre french onion soup. Took literally 10 minutes before we got spoons. Wait staff too busy hanging. Our Flatbreads came out 45 minutes after the soup. COLD.Over it. Won't go back for diner.,Oh my godddddd. What a gem. My husband & I had a fabulous linner (it was 3pm so lunch/dinner). We shared a crabcake. I had the chicken tartine & he had the tuna tartare. All of it tasted so fresh. Nice ambiance & staff is super attentive. Cocktails were great. We had an Aperitif & a glass of the sauvignon blanc (sadly forgot the name).Definitely go enjoy this delightful spot!,"Cute and quiet spot for a weekend brunch! I came here on a hot summer Sunday around noon and it wasn't crowded- however, they do take reservations so book ahead just in case!I liked the open layout of the restaurant. The wooden tables and bar area gave the place an elegant touch and with a bit of imagination,  a Parisian vibe :)They have classic brunch options, and I ordered the Smoked Salmon omelette. The waiter was very nice and attentive, and the food came out fairly quickly. The omelette was tasty and generously portioned- I loved the fresh cream that came with the smoked salmon. I also ordered an ice coffee which was just okay; I felt like it was a tad watered down.Overall, I had a good experience here. I'd recommend it for a casual brunch if you're nearby. And I've also heard they are known for wine and cheese, so I may have to come back to try that!","I like this restaurant. Based on the menu, I'd say this place is pretty authentic. For appetizers, I was impressed by the foie gras. It's hard to find foie gras cooked in this ""grilled"" way. It's one of my favorite. We also ordered escargot. They were amazing. The sauce was really good. For main course, my friend got the steak. It was very good but a little bit over cooked, as she ordered it as medium rare. It tasted like medium well. I ordered stewed beef. I believe that it's a French classic and I personally do not like it too much. Overall it's a nice restaurant with great food. Service was solid and price is about right.",Le Pif
798,"1st time visited this place as many reviewed about it's most famous squid ink friend rice & rotisserie chicken. The 1/2 chicken came out with crispy skin, and moist breast meat; which is very hard to achieve. Squid ink usually has a very fishy taste on any dish. They had made the squid ink fried rice with seafood sweetness. Also added a grilled pork chop order. Again, it is hard to achieve crispy outside with moist inside, but they made this very good.Service in this restaurant is beyond average! They have an average of 1.5 staff checking our table about every 8 minutes. Server would not push to over ordering for 2 of us. With 3 dishes, we still have left over for next day!","Very disappointed to update my review on a bad note. I have eaten here several times going back years. Last night (Saturday 3/17) as a group of four I came here to grab some food after a play. I double checked the time the kitchen closed before we parked. It was 11:25 and they closed @ 12. From all of my past experiences their turn over is extremely quick. Mainly because they usually want to give your table to the people waiting.Nonetheless, we walk in together I let the man know a table for four & he blatantly looks at his watch huffs and proceeds to walk. Then quickly stops and says ""you do know we close in 25mins right?"" (That's 11:50 btw)""I ask will that be a problem?""He gets nasty and rudely says in a loud tone... ""Did I say it was a problem?""So I simply laugh and about face. Everyone follows me without even a 2nd thought bc they witnessed his attitude. The four of us went across the street to Jacob Pickles where we were welcomed, immediately seated, created a pretty hefty tab and left a very nice tip. Just A Note:I will not argue or beg anyone to spend my money for crappy service. #NotNEVER!","I have walked past this place for years, finally decided to give it a try. Big mistake. I ordered takeout, so I couldn't send the food back. The roast chicken was so salty, it was inedible. Not just the outside, it was salty through and through. I tossed a half a chicken. The ""salad"" (iceberg and slice of hard, pinkish tomato) and ""bread"" (soft, white) went into the garbage along with the chicken. Even the maduros was dry and HARD. Maduros is supposed to be soft, crispy on the edges and soft inside.Never again!","This place blew me away.. hands down my favorite sweet plantains are here. Everything we had was so good and the service was amazing. Couldn't ask for anything more. Here's what we got:- pork chops (highly recommend - cooked perfectly with a tasty garlic sauce. ask the waiter which pork chops to get.. they'll know)- sweet plantains (highly recommend - if you love plantains as much as i do, these won't disappoint) - squid ink fried rice (huge portion, good for 2-4 people)- rib eye (same sauce as the pork chops)- salty plantains (unique but i still love my sweet plantains more)","We accidentally came here yesterday thinking it was its sister location on Broadway. We walked in and realized it was smaller than the other one, and that it had a lot more people waiting to eat. Thankfully, the magic number yesterday to be seated right away was 2, and we got to skip through the mob of hungry people waiting in the front. The bus boy gave us warm bread and butter right away which was so perfect because we were starving. The bread that they used tasted like a baguette, which is my number one choice. Our waiter came soon after to take our food and drink order. We ordered the pollo alla brasa and the lomo saltado to eat. To drink, I had a glass of the Rioja Spanish wine. The pollo alla brasa was as good as I remembered it was at the other Flor De Mayo location. The chicken was tender and seasoned well. Then I got to try a big bite of the lomo saltado. It blew me away. The steak was delicious, as were the fries that were soaked in the fat of the steak. The rice that they used tasted like the fried rice offered in Chinese restaurants, which was a wonderful fusion. The Rioja wine was not too dry, just how I like it. It complemented the chicken well. We were offered flan for dessert but had to pass because of how stuffed we were. I can't wait to return.",The service was great. Small spot and we was a large party but they got the job done with out no pressure. Food too good and the drinks strongggggggggggggg. Love it I'm going back.,Flor De Mayo
799,"Very disappointed at the new guys they hired. H was so stingy with the sides, plus he hands were so dirty. My wrap was like a 1/2 wrap. Price went up but portion is smaller? Make sure the mexican guy is the one adding your add-ons and sauce. They put like 3 drops of sauce on my wrap. When I asked for me he put 3 more drops. I think I'll go to cava from now on",This place is horrible because of the staff! The staff weren't professional at all and extremely sexist. They were sexually harassing some young female customers and hitting on them. They made them so uncomfortable and kept eaves dropping onto their conversations. They also were ogling the females and looking them up and down like they were pieces of meat. The two hispanic workers need to learn how to respect women and not see them as sexual objects to hit on. Also the food was very bland and extremely Americanized. It wasn't authentic at all. The salad was stale and like a fast food salad. I suggest all women to avoid this place because you will be  sexually harassed and hit on and made very uncomfortable. No women should have to go through this when they are just trying to eat and paid so much for!,"I went here today for lunch since I was in the area . Got the beef/lamb bowl with rice and hummus on the side .   First off, the halal carts gives you a lot more portion than here . The meat does taste better than what you'd get at a halal cart .  But it's not the true Doner style of thin slices of meat . I would say it's more shawarma style than anything else .  The hummus was okay, but not the best.",This is a first for sitting in restaurant while the lunch time rush poured in. I am impressed at how not once did any of this team lose a beat. People came in and left as fast as their cards swiped by their cashier. It seems like the manager or boss mans the fryer and grill with ease. He steps in where needed and didn't lose his speed when online pick ups came in and couldn't be found. But you're not reading this review for an observation based on quick and precise movements; you're here for the food. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the wrap found in downtown wrap known for smaller sizes and bigger prices. It was lightly seasoned the way that Mediterranean food should be. Happy camper over here. Keep up the good work.,"This is what I would call a gem hidden in plain sight! Not sure how I had absolutely no idea this place was here this whole time. The Beef and Lamb Doner bowl I had was great! (They did not use fake lamb!!) The meat was flavorful and tender, with a bit of a char on the edges, and the bulgur, sauces, garnishes, and fries were delicious. Just a heads up re expectations... this is a fast-casual spot near offices filled with less adventurous palates, so the food here will not make your mouth burst with dynamite levels of exotic flavors. This is more like a non-chain Mediterranean version of Chipotle with fair pricing for downtown Brooklyn. The portion is very filling! And in my opinion, it's better value than most options you can find in DeKalb Market.That being said, I did have a bit of trouble placing an order online for my team of for a work lunch. After I had meticulously entered seven people's worth of food with all the variations of toppings and sauces and was ready to pay, I received an error message saying the site did not accept orders currently. The online form also does not include an option to choose bulgur as the carb for your bowl. So after spending over an hour trying to use their online form, then grubhub, then calling them, I ended up walking over in person to provide them with a physical list of everyone's order. (It appears other customers have had more luck using Seamless... which I will try next time.) Hopefully they fix this soon so the options for ordering in are more clear ahead of time. Once I did show up in person, however, the staff was very nice and very willing to help! The delivery guy was also nice, and everyone's order was correct. Overall, the experience was good despite the technical glitch. I would definitely order from here again.","We got the chicken doner cone and it was pretty good! Lots of stuff that goes in it and the chicken was well seasoned. I wish they had other meat options like lamb but oh well.The cone is a bit smaller portion than the other things on their menu it seems, and the employee was nice enough to warn us before we finished ordering which i really appreciated!",Doner Kebab NYC
800,"I came here on a busy Sunday around 11-12pm we were told it was a 45 min wait. They texted us 45 mins later and we went in, it was a small packed place. First of all, they should give you a little more than 5 mins to get back to the place ..no one is going to sit around there for 45mins. The food was.....meh. If you are new to this type of cuisine then its fine, but if you've eaten Moroccan/Mediterranean before then its not so good. I got the Shakshuka, which had absolutely no salt. AT ALL. Even my boyfriend tried it and said it had no seasoning on it. This could have been because, if you get it with feta it might be overwhelmingly salty..not sure. Also the tomato cucumber salad it is served with was extremely salty. But it enjoyed it because like I said my dish was saltless. My boyfriend had the lamb burger, it was good but not the best I've had, and not worth a 45min wait. We also had the mint lemonade which was good, but again places like Pret and Le Pain have similar better drinks. Will I be back? No. Now the place I will be trying is the place next door which we were told to go to but we couldn't wait because we did have an appointment to make. All in all it was a cute experience but the food wasn't amazing, also the waiters were dancing and clapping around. Its fun and all, but people are trying to get their attention and they're legit doing spins around tables lol.","I was so excited about this place but then my hoped were dashed when I ended up with food poisoning.The lamb sliders were undercooked- bloody pink on the inside- couldnt eat them. The hummus didnt taste flavorful as I know it can be. It was a subpar experience altogether. Unfortunately, I ordered the food to go and was far from the restaurant when I unpacked the meal to chow down and only to be met with the undercooked meat and bland hummus. I had to settle for eating the salad. Also the labaneh was drowning in too much oil, couldnt eat it.I'm certain that eating the undercooked lamb must've been what caused the food poisoning that happened next morning- because the last thing I had to eat before I got sick was the food I picked up from 12 Chairs. I didn't realize the lamb was undercooked because the sliders looked done on the outside. It was only when I went for the second bite that I noticed how red, not pink, it was in the middle.Funny, I picked this place because of the reviews, but based on my experience, I cant endorse it. Also, as I mentioned I did not find the food to be that good and I've been to a few Israeli/mediterranean food establishments ( this is nyc, afterall) that have flavorful hummus, soft warm pita, labaneh with just the right amount of oil drizzled, not drowned on it with za'atar. This type of cuisine is incredible when done well. Simple and flavorful. This is what I expected from 12 Chairs. Big let down. Maybe I caught them on an ""off"" night, who knows? ButI wont take that chance with them again. $60 down the drain plus waking up with food poisoning. Nope, no thanks.","Their food was nothing to write home about. But the primary reason for leaving a 1-star review is because of their staff. My family and I literally saw one of the bartenders taking a leak outside in broad daylight, and then doing a 360 for absolutely no reason while there were women and children outside. Very disappointing to witness this kind of behavior.","The experience of a cozy Mediterranean restaurant with amazing middle eastern cuisine is just what you need on any night to have a great time. The dishes can be small but they pack so much flavor that you are full just by the aroma as plates come to the table. I felt like having a light dinner. I got the hummus and falafel dish that made me want to order some to go because my hands were empty in a minute after eating them so quickly. You have to try the lamb kebabs that is a must get, this review cannot describe its taste just get them. Your welcome!","Such a freakin' all-star breakfast. Not your usual eggs and toast, but delicious sunny side up eggs surrounded by creamy tahini and fluffy, homemade pita bread. A bowl of filling, comforting hummus. Scrambled eggs with warm tomato sauce in the shakshuka. Rich cappuccinos. Outdoor seating. The best! 5 stars!!!!!!","I have come here three times and counting and it has been a great experience overall.Enjoyed the Israeli guac, lamb chops, and lamb burger.I have certainly had a better lamb burger (but my hubby is Middle Eastern so I have high expectations), but overall the consistent food, friendly and prompt service, and just great vibes always make me come back here.",12 Chairs Cafe
801,"I came here on a Sunday evening & luckily there was no wait & my friend & I were seated immediately. It was the first time for both of us, so the waiter explained how the ordering process goes, which is simply just putting a check mark next to the items you want. Lobster house also offers alcoholic beverages.My friend I decided on a variety of different flavored shrimp, mussels, crawfish, salmon, crab legs, ribs, calamari, broccoli & seafood lo main. Everything was good , hot, & seasoned well. For drinks we tried the ""Lychee Passion"" which was eh it's not something I would order again. For pricing, I think it's very moderately priced for what you get which is $40 per person for the unlimited seafood. The way they have the food portioned is good & the only thing we ordered a 2nd serving of was the crab legs, while still having plenty of other food still left. I do feel the drinks are few dollars overpriced. I would think it would be between $10-$12, but it's gonna cost you $15 with limited options. Our server was very polite & attentive. We never had to look around for our sever because he checked in. So, why the three stars might you ask...it's due to the ""service charge"". They specify on the menu the ""service charge"" is for the ""business"" & not gratuity. I have a really hard time believing that & when my bill is going to the business...now if the business is also taking that ""service charge"", that's just greedy & unethical in my opinion. My next question would be how are you coming up with that % because it's 12% they are charging as a ""service charge"". At the end of the night the waiter also reiterated to us how the ""service charge"" works & a tip isn't mandatory, but would be appreciated. We did tip him, but I just don't know about this ""service charge"" thing not going to the waiter, who I feel should be entitled to it. Just because you change something to ""service charge"" & not use the word ""gratuity"" that doesn't mean that's not what it is.",The food was ok nothing amazing. Honestly the wait time was insane got there at 7 wasn't seated until 9. I did not like how they used the same sauce for majority of the food. The only good thing was the crab legs because that just had butter.,DO NOT GO HERE!!!! RIP OFF!!! Husband and I decided to go here for our anniversary. First off the food was mediocre.  Don't be fooled by the all you can eat. Everybody in your party have to order the all you can eat or it's invalid. Why is this disclaimer not on the menu?? How you gonna force people to pay for food they don't want??! So fine cause the hubby eats a lot I agreed. So we had to ASK for bibs and crackers for our crabs. We had to ASK for butter which was just that... melted butter.. no seasoning.. bland. Server was nice but he had no idea of the policies. So we're ready to go so we ask for to go containers. WAIT!!!! you are charging us $20 PER PERSON to take the food we already paid for to go??! Once again no disclaimer!!! We should've went to Red Lobster. They pissed me off.P.S. This was the Queens Blvd location,"All I can say is ask for Fred, hes wonderful and funny. This was our first visit and he explained everything.The food is very good and it came out quick. The potions are plentiful. We were seated within 5 mins. On a Saturday evening.We will be back","Visited the Lobster House for the first time yesterday 9/1/19. Waited about 25 mins for a table and when we got the text our table was ready we had to wait another 10 to 15 mins. That was the only con to our experience there. The food was impressively good. Everything we ordered was very well seasoned. Jumbo shrimp in garlic and butter sauce was phenomenal. They don't lie when they jumbo shrimp either. The crab legs were all good. My daughter loved the ribs it was more the sauce for em that made the ribs good. My hubby really liked the fried scallops and he enjoyed the crab legs as well. I was very pleased with the food. The service was pleasant too. Our waitress, Kimberly, was super nice, patient, and gave us great suggestions as to what she thought we would like and she was spot on. Thank you Kimberly for suggesting the whole bass in chili sauce and the salmon! They were both great! We didn't feel rushed to eat or order. Each order was made fresh and everything is made to order. The food and service here is definitely worth the money!!! This will definitely be the spot!","Pretty good place. Delicious food, great service and reasonable prices. The only problem is, as time passes, it gets worse. They used to let you order lobster, and that was included in the price. Now they got ""smart"" and quietly changed their rules. Now you have to pay $25 EXTRA if you want lobster.You know what you came here for. So don't be stupid, and don't stuff yourself with bread, noodles or rice. Eat only shrimp, crab, scallop and other seafood. Make sure you have space in your stomach for it. The more carbs you eat, the happier the place will be cause you cost them less money!",Lobster House All You Can Eat Seafood
802,"Very under whelming experience. The best part of myExperience was leaving. Despite the fact that the establishment was relatively empty, it took forever to get our food. As far as the food, steamed with oil and garlic is the only way I can describe it. My drink sadly  was no better Than a wine cooler. Long story short you should probably skip this place for claw daddy's or just purchase the crab legs yourself from your local seafood market.","Went here for a Friday night dinner with some girlfriends of mine and first things first I'm not a crab person, more a lobster shrimp girl. Our drinkkkk was so bomb !!! (see photo) I couldn't tell you how happy I was with it. On to the food; I wanted to get the shrimp in bag with the works (corn potatoes lobster) unfortunately the menu states they have Argentinian shrimp and when I went to confirm with the waitress they said they were the prawn shrimps . I ended up getting a fried shrimp sandwich which was Ok (didn't take a picture of it). Service; the waitress was nice and did what she had to do, she was extremely attentive. What I didn't like was the bus boy ; how he just dropped our food without a care wasn't my cup of tea. I understand they have to clean the tables upon people leaving to get more customers in but they should really use something that has no scent, not pleasant to inhale while you're trying to eat. Now the bathroom ; I saw a sign that said not to throw tissue in the toilet; PLEASE FOR THE SAKE OF SQUEAMISH PEOPLE !!! Get a garbage can with a lid, let's just I was extremely mortified.","Came here with my sister & was super excited as I had been craving crab legs. We arrived approximately an hour after opening and the place was already packed. We were offered a seat at the bar and ordered a drink, the fisherman's drink (or something like that). It was basically juice with swedish fish in it. Our table was available fairly quickly and our order was taken promptly. I ordered crab legs with shrimp and the fried oysters. My sister had crab legs & mussels. The fried oysters were disgusting, don't even bother. The crab legs & shrimp were good, the shaking sauce was good but spicier than I expected. The mussels were kinda tough and the sauce was a bit oily. I'm only giving 2 stars because that night I had the worst stomach pains. When I called my sister she said her stomach was hurting as well. This cannot be a coincidence. The 2 stars are for the short wait time & friendly waitress.","I had a very positive experience at Shaking Crab. I was expecting a long wait as it said reservations were totally out that night but we surprisingly got seated right away. My friend and I split the Cajun fries which were nice and tasty. I got the snow crab legs with the shaking crab sauce at medium and thought they were delicious. Super garlicky just like I like it. Word to those who like mega spice: I personally found my medium to be spicy - not crazy spicy but a nice kick of added flavor. My friend Marla got the spiciest level and literally added chili powder after and didn't find it spicy at all. So if you are into flavors so spicy they may kill you, it may not be spicy enough here. Knocked down a star for slow service. Being that the food is spicy I would expect them to refill water more frequently as we were regularly out. Otherwise I liked everything.","Went here yesterday with my best friend because of the ratings.Nice atmosphere. Enjoying the outside  balcony. Our wait staff was Daniel very knowledgeable on the menu n helped us make great selection.My bff selected the fried shrimp basket.. low quality on the fried shrimp heavy on the frieds... Alaskan king crab legs which seemed a little pricey for me ($36 for 1 lb) which she found quite salty.My choice was spicy calamari... mussels.Althought the food was plentiful and the Cole slaw was delicious we found the seasoning to be bit too salty a little hard to keep eating.If I should return to this place a lesson learned I ask that the season be on the side which will allow me to control the salty intake in the bag.Love the idea of the coming in plastic bags less messy.But do go you will enjoy the food, drinks and corner location.",I had the wonderful chance to experience this wonderful fairly new restaurant. I am always cautious when trying a new restaurant but I was pleasantly surprised with Shaking Crab  the ambience is laid back and you can get comfortable and enjoy the best that this restaurant has to offer.The lobster roll is delicious and nicely season. The wings and fries were great and seasoned to perfection but the absolute cherry  on top of this cake was the gumbo and please don't forget to add those shrimp! I can't forget the absolute best bartender I've ever had the pleasure to know. Ms. April gives a new meaning to doing your job with a smile. She's fabulous. Tell her Hope sent you.,Shaking Crab- Brooklyn
803,"I love a good Cajun seafood boil, but this place is the absolute worst seafood boil I've ever had. The seafood was way over cooked and not actually a pound of shrimp or a pound of clams. I ordered the spicy version of it and it wasn't spicy in the least. My tongue wasn't tingling at all. The seafood boil honestly was like vomit to me. When I asked the waitress if it was spicy, she said she had it written down as spicy and scurried off. This is probably the worst restaurant I've been to in NYC. I will say the special of the cinnamon fried chicken and waffles were really great, and so was the cornbread but wow the seafood boil was so horrible it ruined the rest of my day. AVOID SEAFOOD BOIL AT ALL COST.","My boyfriend and I got the 2 po boy sandwiches that they offer and both of them were extremely tasty ! The only thing I wasn't too fond on was the Mac n cheese on the sugar freak po boy , I think it could of been better without it. Other than that I think I would check out this place again to try out what other things they have! I should also mention that the service was very good here and pretty quick !","Visited this place for a quick bite, ordered their Spicy Chicken & Belgian Waffle. I thought it was a safe pick considering they're a southern comfort type restaurant, but I was wrong.The chicken was dry, the breading bland, and its temperature was as if it was sitting out for an hour. The waffle was nothing spectacular, it didn't taste sweet or buttery like a Belgian waffle should. The dish was served with some maple syrup, no additional sauce over the chicken. Overall it was a really disappointing dish, having eaten only half of the portion and opting to not take the rest for leftovers. Maybe this one is on me for not ordering their seafood?","Sugar Freak is a tasty Louisiana Creole restaurant in Astoria. The place is big and they don't take reservations, but I came late enough and missed any crowds on a weekend night.  The service was friendly and efficient.The food was all tasty.  I particularly enjoyed the fried okra and the jambalaya.  My wife loved their baked oysters.  Recommended!","My partner and I came here on a Friday night. It was packed! The decor was beautiful- it had a NOLA vibe.Our server was really great.The food was.... subpar. The drinks were okay.We got the calamari as a starter.She got the shrimp Po Boy, I got the Holy Trinity Po Boy (oysters, catfish and shrimp) and we had to order a side of fries (since you have to pay separately for sides).According to her, her sandwich was good.Mine... not so much. For almost $18, I expected more flavor.The oysters were cooked PERFECTLY. The shrimp was good but the catfish tasted like old oil.The sweet potato fries were good.They charged us 1.50 for a side of spicy mayo. Absurd.I got the ""Hurricane"" cocktail and she got the Sazerac. My drink was kind of weak. Her drink was good.For $105 before tip, I could've had a better meal. I'm not too sure if I'd give this place another try- I probably would.","So if you ever had Louisiana Gumbo and wanted a retake on it GO HERE it's good! We had the seafood gumbo. The fried chicken was too salty and so was the collards. The charbroiled oysters we all loved. The fried calamari was good except they fry hot pickled peppers which added a great kick but after a while you realized you have more peppers  that calamari.. made me fall in love fried peppers, great bite to this dish but hey! I ordered Fried Calamari... where is it...?!? The deviled eggs were also quite good. Mac and cheese tasted like powdered cheese, no one was a fan.Drinks I thought were masked by way too much ice. Like the sangria you taste that if only it didn't have so much ice..well dam this is some good sangria :/The seafood jambalaya was okay not enough rice though.",Sugar Freak
804,I've been waiting to try this place for some time.The food at IKEA is better.I am continuing to write more because yelp requires me to and said my review is too short. If this doesn't cover it then I'll also add paid $90 to sweat inside a small room.,"I went here tonight for a birthday party and was blown away by the Boeuf Bourguignon, the scalloped potatoes and green beans. The chocolate desert I had was indescribable, so I won't try. I applaud the whole place. I can't wait to go back.","everyone get the F*CK OUT! it's MY neighborhood restaurant!!i cannot say enough good things about le fond's food that hasn't already been said. literally the only negative is that there needs to be more food on my plate because i hoover the food in under 4 minutes and my husband looks at me and regrets ever thinking he could take me out for a nice, romantic meal where we linger, chat, and share bites of our food. no, sorry you aren't getting sh*t off my plate when we're at le fond.. you can get the f*ck out, too.love le fond.","One of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn. Lovey ambience, thoughtfully prepared food from a small menu which changes regularly, and perfect non-invasive service. 10/10 recommend","My cousin recently got married but her bridal shower was hosted at Le Fond. It took months of planning but we actually decided quite early because of the accommodations and privacy we were able to secure for the event. The owners were helpful in our planning process and were able to tailor some of their menu items according to guests with specific allergens - I'd recommend notifying and planning ahead for these cases. They were kind enough to allow us to decorate the interior with a simple backdrop for photography purposes (hung with command hooks for easy removal). We were also able to decorate the tables with our own DIY succulents. The menu consisted of a variety of brunch items including but not limited to Egg Sandwiches, Fresh Fruit Salad, Nutella French Toast, Buttermilk Fried Chicken (resembled tenders) with Polenta, a Deconstructed Salad - requested ahead of the event, and Fresh Fruit Tarts. All with the exception of the fruit tarts were buffet style - Le Fond was really great in terms of making sure the trays were full. Our experience with Le Fond was nothing short of perfect.","Amazing quiet intimate neighborhood spot! Ordered the agnolotti- which was cooked to perfection, heirloom tomato sourdough salad w/ ricotta- not too rich for a panzanella, the burger- with gruyere which was fantastic and brussels sprouts w/ curry which were also delicious (I'm a sucker for brussel sprouts)! Great service and would definitely recommend for those looking for a date spot in Greenpoint. Pro tip- they only have a half bar so only beer + wine but try the Rosé negroni- tastes like a negroni but a lot easier to drink and it's on happy hour for only $8.",Le Fond
805,"We used to like this place. But recent experience has been very disappointing. We ordered lasagna. First the dish came out was cold in the middle; so it was not freshly made. Instead of making a new one, they simply microwave it and give us back the same one. Lastly, they never apologize for it. It feels like it is our fault for ordering the cold lasagna. The quality of both service and food is very bad. Will never go there myself. And I don't recommend anyone to go there unless you want a cold lasagna.","First time come here on a Thursday not too busy which mean perfect time not waiting for too long but been waiting over 45min and the foods still not come out yet. Service is good not too much to complain, serving water and appetizers while waiting for some tiny meatballs $16 and $25 for pasta that's enough for 1 person. Paying 50$ for some uncooked pasta took me 2min and I got out of the restaurant I can't stay here no more the seafood was just shell. This is so over price and I don't know who cook like this and took 45min wait horrible experience","Good wine bar for downtown, I had better time atThe bar than the date. A bar had a separate than the restaurant. They have a whole bar and lounge area. Good spot downtown, a bit hidden due to construction but good atmosphere. Drink prices were 12-15$ a bit high to bad they had no specials for a Sunday evening. But would come back if needed a spot in the area.","Thank you Francisco, Emily and Luigi for the best night with my parents. I've been to the UES location but tonight's meal knocked my socks off. I came for Restaurant Week but discovered what's now one of my all time faves in NYC. We had the arancini, mussels, calamari to start. The ingredients were so fresh and well executed. Listen people just come here for the calamari. It's a religious experience. Last time I was so happy from a meal was Gramercy Tavern. Sundays 25% entire wine bottles. We had a bottle Lambrusco that was divine.","This place has a beautiful inside architecture and a classy and laid back ambiance.I enjoyed the food and the service.The rice balls appetizer is good.The sauce for the Fusilli was a little too rich; it's served al dente (not boiled thoughly), but good overall.The Felice sundae was good.I plan on visiting again, hope the service is eeven more friendly and food even tastier.","I came here for dinner on Friday night, and it exceeded my expectations. The manager, Mina, made us feel right at home. My boyfriend and I always order the meatballs and ricotta toast to start since both are delicious and easily shareable. For a main dish I always order the specials, so I got the cheese-stuffed pork chop. Oh my god it was incredible. Then for dessert we ordered the lemon chiffon cake and the hazelnut cake. Both were delicious. They also have a great wine selection and very good cocktails. You can't go wrong.The service was awesome too: our waiter Carlos was super attentive and very helpful with our menu choices.My favorite restaurant in the city, I will obviously be back!",Felice
806,Good music and vibes. Variety of beers on tap and some good looking food optionssss. Would def come here on a date. Only negative was that their AC wasn't that strong. It was maybe like 70 degrees in the restaurant when I was there.,"I came back to try the burger. It is surprisingly good. Also this time, I didn't order a beer. That was weird. What is wrong with me?Use my Seated app referral code: JASON1080Can I say that? Will I get banned from Yelp?","#I came here because I've been using this dining app called Seated. I needed to get my rewards #bonus. I was sick and didn't feel like going out. But I needed my #bonus.Pretty good food. I used to live kinda close here, but never gave this place a shot for food. Thanks, Seated. Thanks for making me get off my butt, even though I was weak and tired. All for the #bonus. FML","It's only 5:30pm on a Friday and I am celebrating here. Well actually it's a good spot to meet up and enjoy a happy hour. Over looking the menu of draught beer, I decided to go for a usual German wheat beer. German makes the best beer and that 100% true. This place is not crowded yet with about 20 or so soul drinking their second drink for the night. After getting my drink at the bar, I can easily find a table all to my self. With about 10 to 15 booth tables and many more chair, I work on my reviews peacefully. Ambiance here is pretty chill. Just a bit close to the main traffic, you get to hear all the car and truck. Actually, I sit myself at a chair with a beautiful view of the sunset. Great spot to ease into the weekend.Beer $7, burger $14 and pleasant music priceless.","I ordered Yelp delivery for the first time from Sugarburg. The burger and fries were good and pretty standard. The mac and cheese is not as good as the pictures and is certainly not worth $15.  My biggest issue was the delivery and payment process. When you order, you pay immediately. That seems standard enough, but the restaurant can add charges to the credit card as they prepare it. So they charged me for a side again, when I already paid for it to place the order. I got an emailed receipt. Second, they didn't deliver one item on the order. It wasn't even on their receipt that came with the delivery. I had to call Yelp (Grubhub) and wait on the phone for them to give me a refund. So, for standard food and questionable service, I do not recommend delivery from this place.Update:After reading the sincere review from the restaurant  I wholeheartedly believe that many of my complaints were due to multiple variables outside of their control. While many consumers are looking for convenience, some restaurants are better experienced in person with fresh food in their controlled atmosphere. I can say that I would be willing to try the restaurant again in person.","As soon as we walked in we were greeted by Jessica. She made us feel so much at home. She even said we could sit on top of the bar, as a jest, but it was well received.  They have such a list of whiskeys, scotches, bourbons and ryes, it is extremely difficult to choose. We sat down towards the end of the front part of the bar. They just took good care of us. I started with a Manhattan and my friend had the High West Rendezvous rye. Both were well prepared and delicious. I went for the Brimstone bourbon which was the smokiest bourbon i ever had.  It almost tasted like charcoal.  I drank it like I would drink an Island Single malt, but much heavier. I forgot the other bourbon my friend had but way more smoother than what I was drinking. Jessica kept popping in and out while serving and greeting other customers. She is a doll!!",Sugarburg
807,"sons of thunder is one of the few places in manhattan that offers a chicago style hot dog.  too bad they're closed on sundays, which is when i'm in the murray hill neighborhood.the seating in the back feels like a secret oasis.  the skylight brings so much light into the space that i could just sit there and keep ordering hot dogs, fries, and soft serve.  actually, this reminds me of my shake shack order, but i keep coming back to sons of thunder for the less rushed eating experience.","Decent portions, I was a bit confused with the menu at first since they have a lot of items to add which I thought meant the poke bowl came empty with just the carb choice and poke but it came with the usual seaweed salad, lettuce, onions, roe, rice and choice of poke. The poke was well seasoned.","With a poke spot on almost every block, it can be hard to determine which if any are standouts. Well I'll save you the time and guesswork- this is a standout.","good food here. I went yesterday because of front sign. Looks very clean and comfort atmosphere. They serve Poke & Hot dogs, and milk shake! Noce lunch place. Pro : good food","Saturday afternoon, made my way over here to try something different. Interesting menu of hot dogs, poke, and shakes in a bright environment.No line to speak of, so quickly ordered the Banh Mi Hot Dog ($5) and a Strawberry/Nutella Shake ($7). Got a pager to wait for food, then took a seat in their spacious dining area with a skylight bathing the room in sunlight. Both items come out within 10 minutes, with a station of sauces/utensils to the side after you pick up the food. Shake starts off with a big hit of strawberry flavor and not much else. As you drink it, globs of Nutella comes through the straw and inevitable becomes mostly Nutella flavored at the end. Hot dog is cooked very well, the ""banh mi"" ingredients are a few pickled veggies and some hot peppers nestled in the bun. A few bites of good hot dog sandwiched between tanginess and pure spice.Service here is efficient as they are meant to get through the workday lunch crowd. For a quiet Saturday afternoon the music is blaring which tends to keep the turnover high (not a place to relax and have a convo). Next time would try a different hot dog or maybe the poke.","I was overcome with the craving for a hot dog, I don't do street dogs and so I was on my way to Danish Dogs in Grand Central Station to get a 'Great Dane'  But then I remember a coworker telling me that Sons of Thunder has good Hot Dogs, so, why not it's only a 2 more city blocks walking.The place doesn't stand out and I walked right by it,  after which I check out the menu and they have 3 dogs, Chili Cheese,  Chicago, Banh Mi Dog ? and plain to if that's what you are into.I went Chicago, and it was good but the tomato and pickle made my bread soggy, and I like toasted buns so it was a downer but the combo was still good and with the taste of fresh ingredients. Plus my craving had been diminished, mission accomplished.",Sons of Thunder
808,"Entered this restaurant since Traif was booked and got seats right away! I love the communal style seats but you will be limited in space so if you plan to order a lot like I did, you need to eat fast! It was a first date dinner that started off great since I choose what to order for the both of us. I went with the marinated king salmon ceviche, roasted mushroom fajitas, grilled carrots elote, artic char tartare, and warm diver scallop carpaccio. The king salmon was my favorite and the rest were good but not mouthwatering. I appreciated all the dishes having different distinct flavors. I also snagged corn from my neighbors since they left and had two lonely corns left. I couldn't let it go to waste! He actually suggested it and I committed the crime. The corn was as expected; it's hard to go wrong with spicy creamy roasted corn.","Parents were visiting and wanted to impress them with a nice dinner. I failed miserably because most dishes were either too greasy or too salty.The octopus especially, really a disappointment. The shrimp and mussels were also way too salty. The scallop was good though and duck also was good - crispy outside and tender inside, but unfortunately we were too full by then.","I have been to Traif numerous times for special occasions and have had tons of moments of bliss.Last night we went to Xixa for the Valentine's Day tasting menu, the staff at Traif always recommends. We were seatedquickly and delicious courses began to appear. Then halfway into dinner, nothing. We decided to give them the benefit of the doubt since it was a holiday. 30 minutes later I asked if more courses were coming,our waitress said ""there was a lull in the kitchen and courses would be out soon."" 30 minutes later I asked again what was going on,she said courses would be out soon. Things happen but I did not appreciate having to ask for updates during a 1hr lag in service.Also a 20% gratuity was automatically added to our bill. Great Food. Bad Service.","Xixa may be my favorite restaurant in the world. While the outside entrance is a bit unassuming, the ambiance inside is magical. I highly recommend indulging in the chef's tasting menu (~$55 per person) - it is customizable for dietary requirements, the presentation is beautiful, the flavors between dishes are perfectly synchronized and you will be FULL. If you're with a large group, the pitchers of Mezcal are a great move (though, in my experience, you really can't go wrong with any of the cocktails).","First things first: what a cool name!! This was an interesting experience. We made reservation and we were seated at the long table. They insisted we sit right next to the other party. The next patrons were requested to sit right next to us too. I understand the need to maximize business but the rest  1/2 of this long table stayed empty till more than 2 hrs later, when we left. So do you really need to do that? The menu is interesting, though I don't think I'll call it ""authentic"" Mexican but rather more like fusion, with Foie gras option. Most of the menu is tapas-like food, some are larger, like the Pekin duck carnitas was excellent and large portion ( 1/2 a duck ). The food was very good, tasty, fresh. They treated us for a small tapas to start and chocolate treat at the end was very Grand and the chocolate is very rich! Yummy!! The wine menu is intense, in a good way. So intense, I could barely read it, especially with the low light. It seems though the younger ppl in my party had no problem with the font size. As a Marilyn Monroe fan I thought she ""earned"" the Champagne menu... lol. They had wines that are not so common here from Italy and Spain and other pets of the country and world. We had two bottles and they were delicious! Kudus to the Sommelier or who ever made the selection. For dessert we shared the Espresso flan. Delicious. And I'm not a flan fan. The only reason I gave 4 and not 5 stars was the service. At first, they came every second to take orders we weren't ready to make. One reason- even the cocktail selection is wide and took us time to explore, consider and as you can see, we ended up with two bottles of wine. Than, when we were ready to place orders, it took them forever to come back and we felt quite ignored. $255 for three ppl including the wines, I think is reasonable. We will be back.","Oh wow this place! I'd say 4.5 star but just want to be little picky on it with some suggestions. The menu creation is amazing so does the drink menu, you see the passion from the chefs and the staffs are proud of where they are. De-constructed Old Fashion - pretty and delicious, adds more fun to the drink. Foie Gras Al Pastor - I love foie gras, I love French toast, to me it's a perfect combination. However I feel the sauce was overpowering the foie gras, if I eat the whole thing together, the foie gras's presence is gone. So later I decided to each the foie and French toast separately... Bone Marrow Taco - very innovative but again the sauce was also very heavy that this dish is too sauce driven for me. The tortilla came with it was delicious though. Peking Duck Carnitas - love it! They did a great job on this dish. Crispy skin that's addicting, tendered and perfectly cooked meat. Not sure why it's called Peking Duck as I was expecting a little Peking Duck flavor in it but I guess it's the cooking style? All the sauces came with it are Mexican style. But texture is perfect! Coffee Custard - pretty good but not as wow like the dishes we ordered, nice touch to finish though. Should have done the tasting menu, next time~",Xixa
809,"I came right before close (past 9pm), so maybe this place is better earlier in the day, when food is fresh.Our food came out pretty dry and meh. The shrimp noodle roll had barely any flavor, and the soup dumplings (not pictured) had stiff skins and were dried up. Turnip cake and bbq pork bun were pretty good.I'd give this place another chance just because of the high ratings, but it wasn't a good first impression.",The oldest dimsum place in chinatown is my favorite.This is the place i go back to always after trying  other new dimsum  places and it never disappoints.The ambiance and service may not he the best but the food here beats everything.Even the looong wait times(sometimes over an hour).Very traditional looking dimsum and tastes similar to the ones i have had in Hongkong.The shrimp ones are my go to.tip: Take cash with you(they don't accept most of the cards).,"Everything came out hot and fresh, particular highlights being the egg roll and the scallion pancake. Service was understandably harried and slow, and the wait wasn't short, but the food is worth it.","Solid dim sum establishment. It has historical value being 100 years old and touted as oldest dim sum spot in NYC, and it was filled with tourists so I thought the food would taste bad but it's actually pretty good. My only gripe is that it is pretty expensive- around $5 per plate, which I could accept if some of the portions were more generous or if this were Tim ho wan or this place was less homey and more bougie, ya know? They are going for a vintage vibe, having not remodeled in like 70 years or something. But I think you can still look super clean and classy while being vintage. Anyway, food breakdown:- Steamed pork bun: this was my favorite dish. I balked when we only got one but it's pretty big (maybe good for just splitting in half). Really solid and yummy.- Shu mai: good, nothing special but still tasty- Pea shoot dumplings: unique and interesting, kinda healthy tasting, my friend rec to me- Stuffed eggplant: visually appealing but sort of bland in taste. I hail from Cali where a lot of szechuan places do a good job with eggplant and I thought it was just okay. Wouldn't reorder- Scallion pancake: skip for me. Bland. Would get at Joe's Shanghai next door instead!- Pork Spare Ribs: Good but I've def had better, plus it's kinda small?? This is supposed to be one of the better value items usually- Shrimp Rice Roll: my friend liked it a lot and I think it's well done for what it is! However back in socal I am used to my shrimp rolls having a crispy golden fried component inside instead of just rice roll and shrimp which seems a bit simpleOverall solid recommend.","I want to give another honest review for Nom Wah as many people have noted: it has its charms and positives with some negatives as well. I was raised on dim sum and probably have eaten at every place in flushing and chinatown EXCEPT Nom Wah, but i guess my grandfather (RIP) knew better than to take us here. Positives:-the oldest dim sum restaurant in NYC has alot of charm, a diner like feel and famous people on its walls. -waiters are ...friendlier..than ..well other dim sum places where they never smile or barely speak english. Dim sum without an chinese speaker can be daunting so at least there isn't much confusion here. -the rice rolls and Shrimp and snow pea leaf dumplings were some of the best i've ever had. These took a few minutes to come out so you know they were fresh and not preheated (more on that later)-a extensive list and description of various teas. Most dim sum places only give you the typical 3-4 choices. -no sharing tables-pictures of all their food on the menuNegatives:-Prices are $1-2 dollars per item higher than other dim sum places. This isn't a huge deal but this is dim sum and things add up. (My grandfather would've got up and left if he saw this menu.)-No carts, no grandmas, no typical eruption of noise and fan fare associated with traditional dim sum. Kinda takes the fun out of dim sum. Def. would not take a newbie here. -Many of the items minus the two mentioned above came so quick that they felt reheated or worse, re-heated in a microwave. The sauces of some items were so gelatinous, they were obviously not fresh or used too much corn starch. -90% of the patrons are tourists or non-asian. I didn't love or hate our time at Nom Wah for a Tuesday mid morning dim sum. It was mildly charming but if they want to charge tourist prices and put out hit or miss food, then at least go all out and make it fun. Make your waiters and waitresses dress up and change the decor a bit to resemble the 1920s in Shanghai. If you're not going to do traditional dim sum, then be original and stand out. At least then, people would have a reason to go.","Would not particularly recommend for people who love dim sum. We said we should've known when we walked in and there were barely any Asians. Should not bring any traditional Asian parents here. My dad had a field day with the prices and criticized the way practically everything was made. Dishes are minimum 4.95/5.00 per plate. -roasted bun was too doughy. Like chewy stretchy. Also overpriced at about $5 per ONE bun. Does not come with 2.-dad says turnip cake had too much flour in it, making it also doughy. I didn't mind it as much Things that were decent: -eggplant -beef filling in the beef noodle roll-pork ribs Overall wouldn't recommend. Overhyped but the pictures of celebs on the wall that have been like Jeremy Lin are interesting.",Nom Wah Tea Parlor
810,"I was at nowadays with a couple of friends about a week ago, I didn't spend long enough here to really experience it fully so this review is really only about the food. I ordered the jerk chicken thighs with rice and beans, the other alternative was flatbread. After about 1 minute the food was ready.No exaggeration - this was the absolute worst rice I've ever had in my life. Hands down. It could not have been worse. There were no grains, it was just one big rice glob. I brought it back and the woman who handles the orders asked the cook ""is the rice fresh?"" and his answer was ""I don't know."" They offered me ""flatbread"" instead, which was a large tortilla. Because of how hungry I was, the chicken was edible, but it was pretty bad and was definitely not jerk chicken.","I went to see Tony Humphries DJ here.  The event was at 10pm and, since this place doubles as a restaurant prior to nighttime events, there was a thick fog that smelled like smoked meat.  I don't mean to be nit-picky, but, man, it did not set a good mood for having a nightlife experience.  The indoor portion was not air conditioned, or poorly air conditioned, and there was absolutely no light.  It was like a bad haunted house.  My wife and I ended up hanging outside most of the night, which was a shame, because we really wanted to hear Tony DJ.  The crowd was pretty much there to drink and BS, there was some dancing happening, but it seemed like most people were there just to sit around and talk.  Not my cup of tea.  We were also accosted by a particularly ""out of it"" patron, but that is not particularly the fault of the venue.  Just not psyched about this locale.  I went here because Mister Sunday/Saturday moved here and I loved the Industry City party, so thought it would be that same vibe.  Definitely not.  Too bad.",Your food is ok but not worth the 2 hour wait. Your beans are dry. And your pico de gallo had too much agua. No thank you keep your non bushwick patrons,I reserved two tables here for my birthday celebration on a Saturday. The process was super easy and the staff was very accommodating when I had to change the date last minute. I used to frequent this place when it first open and it was incredible to see the transformation! The space is well decorated and a nice vacation from your busy NYC life. The drinks are good and cheap (compared to other NYC places)! The spiked lemonade is no joke so tread with caution. The bathroom trailers provide a great backdrop for your golden hour selfies and inside they're very clean. They also have games you can check out as well as other events happening throughout the month. I wish I didn't live in Philadelphia so I couldn't frequent this place!,"Saturday night, 10pm. Nice crowd. Great atmosphere to kick back and enjoy the beer menu and whatever games you want to bring from home. Picnic table seating with unique lighting set up. Staff is friendly and patient. I was hoping for much better mix of music and was disappointed for the food truck having 1 option left on their menu by this time. It seems like if the place is open so late, the menu should be able to hold the crowd. Also, typical area pricing for the 'pork bowl' meal, tad bit pricey and the portion was skimp. Left starving and in need of a good music playlist for the ride home.","This place is beautiful i recently moved into the area and decided to go there with two of my friends. I wanted my friends to have a nice experience as they came out of town to see me. However the bartender (young woman with black hair )was so rude to me and my friends. She asked for ID and we said "" we haven't been carded in a while that is nice "" making a joke , she responded in a condescending tone "" well I don't have a bouncer what do you want"" and we told her it wasn't in a negative way she continued to be rude and we went to sit and have our drinks. We went for our second round and she proceeded to be so rude to my friend and had the audacity to mess up her drink and refuse to remake it and CALLED HER HOMEGIRL ! well we are African american and with a combination of her rudeness AND CALLING HER HOMEGIRL, we were left feeling discriminated against and uncomfortable this was an embarrassment to me and my friends and I hope she gets sensitivity training ! if this is not rectified i will contact the NYC Dept on Human rights.",Nowadays
811,"Ok, it's not as good as I originally thought. It's very good, but in terms of ingredient quality it's not up there and you can taste it a bit with the pork on the pizza or even the tomatoes.The eggplant parm is still a winner and the arugula salad very fresh, but the calzone although good, isn't as good as some other places I know in the city.",After ordering food I went to the bathroom which is after you walk through the kitchen. Seeing the kitchen and how disgusting and unhygienic it was made me leave (the bathroom is right next to the stove which was so disgusting I dry heaved as I walked in. I can't say how the pizza tastes but I prefer my food to have the dust and lint from the can fall into my food.,"Neapolitan doesn't get much better than this, even in Naples.  Our server was outstanding as was the pizza.  Cant believe you have the Agricola cheese in NY!","This spot had been highly recommended so we finally decided to give it a try one night before heading to a show. Omg I'm so glad we went. The Margherita pizza was to die for! It's such a cute small restaurant that gives fun and intimate vibes. The waitstaff was great and even danced with some tourists who were there having dinner, it was really fun! My only advice is make a reservation in advance!","Instantly my favorite Italian restaurant in the city (along with some other ones to be more clear).Unbelievable. The eggplant parmesan is super flavorful, the calzone is ridiculous and the paccheri is delicious. Such a great spot.","Song E Napule checks all the marks for a great NYC Italian spot.1. Cramped. Check2. Neighborhood regulars. Check3. Wood-burning fireplace. Check4. Wacky owner who loves his craft. Check5. Delicious pizzas and pastas. Double check!However, the one thing that really convinced me was the use of San Marzano tomatoes DOP. My bae is an excellent home chef - or at least he thinks so - and he's convinced me that the only way to cook Italian is with San Marzano tomatoes, and only those with the DOP designation. This restaurant does this, and we love them for it.",Song E Napule
812,"Eh so the corn looked amazing but it just didn't do it for me. We make a quick stop in here because it was pouring out. Our corn wasn't hot. It was like if the corn was just sitting in water for a long time. Besides that, we also had the classic margarita which was quite tasty","I was excited to try this place but it was kind of a letdown for the following reasonsI came in wanting the fish tacos but they didn't have them. I was going to settle for a nice mix of carne asada, carnitas and avocado tacos but they wouldn't let me mix. So again, I settled on just carnitas. The area we sat in smelled heavily of bleach the whole time. My carnitas tacos were decent, maybe a bit dry and I did like that they came with rice and beans. Unfortunately, my drink was not strong enough to make me forget all these transgressions.","Thursday evening for dinnertime, was able to snag a couple of seats near the ledge before the crowds started showing up. Small interior with limited seating and an open kitchen up front.Only one waiter for the entire spot, so took a while to get our orders in. Simple menu with your regular Mexican options. Opted for the Chicken Quesadillas ($14) - a significant tortilla stuffed with cheese and chicken. I like how the meal comes with rice, beans, salsa, sour cream, and even guacamole. Lots of flavors to combine together and work with, especially with the various hot sauces on the table. The extreme cheesiness and toasted tortilla really made the meal.Again, service is slow due to only one guy working all the tables (and assembling some orders). Not really a good place for big groups - yet a nice spot for a low-key dinner.","Man this place is so good! I've been here a couple of times before concerts at Barclays and am never disappointed. We arrived around 7:10 and there was a line out the door! Having been here before we knew that it would be worth the wait. The restaurant itself is fairly small. Most of the seating is at the bar or a few tables. Our group of 4 was seated at the bar around 7:30. We started with an order of the Brooklyn Queso and a round of Margaritas. The Margaritas are made well and the rims are super salty (to my liking). The Brooklyn Queso was super tasty as well. We ordered the fish tacos, carne asada quesadilla and carnitas tacos. Everyone was super happy with their food. The tacos are made with authentic corn tortillas and are super tasty. They have all the fixings and the carnitas were so juicy. The carne asada quesadilla was fantastic. Normally the steak in quesadillas is over cooked but this was medium perfection. We were so happy we waited. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!","Burritos are easy to make. Burritos are fun to eat. Burritos are life. When you come across the food Challenge presented by Don Chingon, you start to see burritos in a new light. Don Chingon has become one of Flatbush Avenue's best spots for a bite to eat and/or have a drink. Delicious Mexican food and tasty tequila or mezcal drinks to help you feel alive. You can even people watch if you get a seat by the window. They have a pretty solid happy hour to take advantage of. Make sure to get there by a good time though. The place can fill up and isn't the largest. The tacos here are my favorite. As alluded to before, there is a food challenge here. I love burritos. I can't quite imagine myself eating an eight pound burrito though. Even if it means a percentage ownership of the business or something crazy like that. Someone told me it changed to a group challenge, but I have no idea. Give them a call if you're that crazy. This makes for a great spot to eat before an event at the Barclays or if you find yourself in the neighborhood.","I'm here right now! Second time and I still love the food and vibe! Open air and delicious. I'm picky and I love this place. This salsa is freshly made, the elote is a must, and the chicken quesadilla could last you two days but you won't want to stop.  There's always space, a game on the two TVs, and the margarita's are carefully made with flair by Marco. A GREAT PLACE!",Don Chingon
813,Foods are great but ppl who are working here look very unhappy and unkind. Not sure if ill ever back here tbh.,"Lol one of the worst curries ive hadIt's watery like soupCroquette is terribleMiso soup very saltyAnd I got mild-medium but it was ridiculously spicy, I think they mixed my order upCarrots also not cooked long enoughGo to another curry shop",Came here so hungry and left happy! Got the basic curry spice level 3 with pork cutlet - 8.99+5.99 for the pork. Pretty spicy but not too hot so it's not enjoyable. Don't expect service to be entirely attentive,"The curry here is so delicious! They offer so many options and the cherry on top is that the spice levels here actually are spicy!! I ordered the pork curry, but I actually made a mistake because I assumed that was a pork katsu carry, but it's not! Any of the normal curries that you order only has the meat cooked within the curry and you'd need to order a side of the meat cutlets. So I'll definitely need to come back to try the pork or chicken katsu. However, they do give ample amounts of meat with the rice. I also got the croquette which is essentially fried mashed potatoes and they were tasty but I don't think I'd care to get that again. I would recommend choosing one of their set menus since it seems like the pricing is worth it - especially if you get the couples set. I think the portion size is average especially since curry rice is so filling, but I do know other places offer bigger portions for their price. Definitely watch out for their spice, I only got level 1 and it already packed some heat. But super hearty and comforting and definitely delicious especially on a cold NYC day.","Abiko Curry sits in the heart of the block long stretch of Manhattan's Koreatown, and the straight forward, no nonsense menu is part of its allure. You pick a base of either rice or noodles, a protein, and one of four levels of spice you want your curry, with ""Baby spice"" being the mildest. They recommend the second tier of spice for most people, and they're not kidding around- even with my high tolerance for spicy food, tier 3 spice had me sweating and reaching for several glasses of water. I can't imagine what level 4 would be like.The components of a good Japanese curry involve a nice balance of sweetness and saltiness that hits you first, followed by a spicy kick that creeps up slowly until it envelops your whole mouth. It should taste of something beyond cumin-the primary spice in curry powder- and with Japanese curry the consistency should be on the thinner side. Abiko nails it on every count. A tangle of udon noodles with just the right amount of give was the perfect base to soak up all the flavor of the broth, which was laced with scallions and crispy tofu for extra texture. A small dish of pickled radish, cold and tangy is provided on the side to cleanse the palette in between bites, so you can hit refresh before your next taste.Of course curry dominates the menu here, but Abiko also embraces other  Japanese fare like a chicken donburi bowl. Over generalizations of what curry is seem to deter a lot of Americans from opting for it as an everyday meal, but those in the know will understand that curry can be a relatively light meal. Just note that unless you want to cause yourself some suffering that will last long after your meal, stick to level 2 spice. You'll thank me later.","Located in K-town(Korea-town) this place has many types of curry dishes. I happen to get a table that was wobbly unfortunately but still had the napkin compartment on the side. Herb chicken curry riceThe curry itself was more watery than I had expected but still packed a punch and was flavorful. I expected the chicken to be cutlet style but instead it was just cubed chicken breast which lacked flavor. CroquetteThis was the highlight of my meal, it was extremely crispy and complimented the curry spice very well.Overall not a bad spot to try curry since it's really close to Pennsylvania station so it makes it easy to reach.Food - 7.5/10Cleanliness - 8/10Staff - 7/10",Abiko Curry
814,"We were on our way to the Chelsea markets when we passed by one of The Meatball Shop locations.  We had heard about this place on the radio and online and decided to stop in to try ""a meatball"".  Ended up ordering two meatballs:  one classic and one pork.  They came out pretty quickly.  The meatballs were good, the sauce was good, the service was quick, and we were glad to be to have ordered just two and eat them so quickly.  All in all not the absolute best meatballs we've had but if we ever pass by again we would possibly stop in for round two.","This place is at a Best a neighborhood eatery. Kitschy and a bit pretentious .... being from out of town, not sure I would return and wait in line again. But. If this was in my neighborhood I would return.","After hearing a lot of friends talk about this place, I came here on a Friday night for dinner. I sat at the bar where I got a cider with spaghetti and meatballs. Everyone talks about how good their meatballs are. I, on the other hand, thought they were fine. To me, there was nothing special about them. For $22, the portion size was not great. All in all, the place is fine. Nothing really special about it. Note: This review is brought to you by an Italian guy from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn so I am tough critic when it comes to Italian food.",I've visited this place once every three years or so and every single time I come it's just as great as the last. The flavor consistency has always been fantastic and the service has always been phenomenal. The music is always a great time and the location is an added bonus.Server Dave along with his trainee were superb with their timeliness and kindness. We look forward to coming back to try new things,"I first heard of the Meatball Shop while watching Chopped where co-owner Michael Chernow was a guest judge. The name and concept stuck with me, but I never really made an effort to try it out. Flash forward to the other day when I was making dinner plans - I thought this would be a nice, casual spot to grab a bite so off we went. There are a few Meatball Shops throughout the city - most are in Manhattan and one is in Brooklyn; additionally, they're planning on opening their newest location in Westport, CT. They have a small space outside to eat as well as a pretty large, open dining space inside. The decor was modern but not too flashy, similar to other trendy spots I've been to. I noticed out of the corner of my eye a stairwell that went down to a place called Underballs - I'm not sure if this is a speakeasy or private event space or whatnot, but I was intrigued. Meatballs are the star of the menu as I expected, though they do have a nice selection of starters, sides, and salads. They also have ""baller plates"" where they incorporate meatballs into other dishes. Since we just wanted straight balls, we browsed the ""build your own"" section. They have a number of proteins to choose from for the meatballs, as well as sauces to pair them with. We went with two varieties - the classic meatballs with classic tomato sauce and the spicy pork with parmesan cream sauce. Each plate came with four meatballs as well as a little focaccia. The meatballs are good - growing up in an Italian household nothing can personally beat my mother's, but these are some of the best I've had from a restaurant. The tomato sauce was good and the parmesan cream was surprisingly light - also I was pleasantly surprised at the nice amount of heat in the spicy pork. We also ordered two sides - roasted broccoli and rigatoni with tomato sauce. These were both good - the broccoli was paired with chilis and garlic which gave it great flavor, and the rigatoni was served al dente with their tomato sauce.Service was great, everyone was really friendly and the food came out at a good pace. Overall, I was impressed with The Meatball Shop. While I'm not sure when I'll be back, this is a solid go-to option and it's nice to know I can get decent meatballs when dining out.","Starting this off by saying the service is great. Staff is super friendly, your food comes out fast, and the atmosphere is very pleasant. The decor is cute and it is not too loud inside. I would come back solely on account of this fact. Meatballs were good! Nothing mind-altering in terms of flavor, but hardy and filling. I got pork naked balls with spicy meat sauce, and I have no idea how one could order more. I came in hungry (2pm and hadn't eaten all day) and almost didn't finish because I was so full. Definitely want to come back to check out their happy hour.",The Meatball Shop
815,"I think this place is trying really hard to find their identity.  Seems like they are trying some unique dishes and cocktails, but they fall really flat for me.We ordered some of their cocktails and weren't really that impressed and my wife wanted to try their wings, which I really didn't care for.  They were supposed to be hot and Korean infused, but it didn't work for me.  I'm a classic buffalo style wing person and these weren't it.  I'm sure they have good stuff, but we didn't get it that night.","Owner decided to paint the outdoor railing and parts of the inside walls. The extremely steep stairs + my torn meniscus required me to hold the railing. My cashmere gloves are destroyed, my less than 4 hour old manicure (because oil-based paint doesn't come off with water)got ruined when I washed my hands. They said the owner would put up a sign. As we walk out, there are no signs. Manager never came out to talk to us, and the indifferent waitress comped my $15 glass of wine for the ""paint debacle"". Super helpful when I'm out $15 for a manicure and $110 for gloves.It's the middle of winter, and I understand having pride of ownership of your restaurant, but how was this urgent in the middle of the day???","Not sure if this was the norm but the a/c was out. Food was pretty decent and generous. Everyone seemed to be having the wings and so one would have to start with that, of course. Quite tasty with a. Little bit of a kick. Sauce reminds me of a cross between Peking pork chops and orange chicken. No, not the texture or anything bad but that is what it reminded me of. Had the mushroom fettuccine and my better half had the black bass. Again, very tasty although mine could have been seasoned just a little bit more to enhance the flavor. I think a touch more salt and/or shaving the Parmesan instead of grating it... or maybe even a pecorino instead. Was on the fence for a fourth star but the a/c kinda killed the atmosphere a little. By the way, if your a/c is out... serve ICE water instead....","Came here with co workers to have some drinks and things went pretty smoothly considering it was a last second ask for a party of about 10 or so people.  The staff was very accommodating and attentive.All we ordered were drinks, a bunch of cocktails, which were all great!  Some of the drinks were very creative and tasted great as well!Although it was loud in there, not so loud where we have to be yelling over each other to listen to each other (though whispering might not work either).  Overall, it had a great ambient vibe where people seem to come and relax after work.  If you want to grab some drinks and have a good time, check this out.","The biggest reason for the 3 stars is the distilled burger. The second I tasted it, I immediately thought it was a Burger King burger, it tastes exactly the same. This was disappointing because paying $20 for Burger King style food is not ideal. With that being said the wings were really great, definitely different and worth trying. The service was also really wonderful.","Was here on a late Monday night for a private event which started around 9pm. I was provided with drink vouchers for wine/beers and there was finger food available for everyone which included dips, salsa, fries, wings and sliders. The wings were absolutely delicious. The orange-ginger glazed wings were served fresh so it was tasty and crunchy. A little bit messy  on the fingers but it was worth it. They did have lots of hand wipes available.Spirits were on the expensive side. I ordered Bombay Sapphire gin on the rocks and was charged $19 with tax and tip. Venue was really nice and close to the 1 line subway.Voting 3 stars based on the limited food I tried and couple of drinks.",Distilled

Notes : if you are  looking for authentic chinese food with good price,  maybe Chinatown is still  your best option haha. Hutong is more upscale and more for the environment and experience, and also kinda pricey.... They are a little unorganized, maybe because they just opened that's why. Our waitress almost forget our drink and the bartender was pissed and start giving attitudes to all the waiter/waitress waiting at the bar counter cause there are so many orders.... hosts were busy trying to sit all the customers waiting at the entry, and figure out who is who....

817,"The drinks were fantastic but the food is awful! Another case of ""you should stick to what you know.""I ordered the croquettas, which are really hard to mess up. However, there was little to no ham in them and the whole thing was too mushy and bland. At first, I was annoyed that $13 only got me 4 croquettes because they are super cheap to make. But after tasting it, I was glad there wasn't more of it. It was awful - would not recommend.My friend ordered the skirt steak; she took one bite and proclaimed it was so bad, she couldn't eat any more. When the waitress checked in with us, we told her that the food was pretty bad and she offered to remove the skirt steak off the menu. So points for that.TL;DR Come for the drinks, NOT the food!","The drinks were fantastic but the food is awful! Another case of ""you should stick to what you know.""I ordered the croquettas, which are really hard to mess up. However, there was little to no ham in them and the whole thing was too mushy and bland. At first, I was annoyed that $13 only got me 4 croquettes because they are super cheap to make. But after tasting it, I was glad there wasn't more of it.

So points for that.TL;DR Come for the drinks, NOT the food!","For a hotel bar, The Bar Downstairs is a great option to grab a drink or two and unwind.  Conveniently located at the bottom of our hotel, the Hyatt Andaz, TBD provided an easily accessible escape from the muggy, wet weather NYC was gifting us during our stay.The space is located downstairs and is dimly lit, so it has that speakeasy vibe going on.  During our visit, the bar was occupied with the midtown-after-work-happy-hour-crowd, so it was a bit loud, but there was ample seating for us, and as the night wore on it, it became a lot more quiet and chill.  Our server checked on us repeatedly--not a bad choice if you're looking for a place near Bryant Park.","Excellent food, excellent service, spectacular drinks, delightful decor.  I love coming to this place!  Early in the week it's not so packed.  It can get a bit loud as well, but I always enjoy myself here!","Took a trip to NYC and decided to create my own bar crawl around the city. Specifically- underground bars. This bar is extremely hidden! So hidden in fact that me and my boyfriend walked by the sign several times and eventually asked someone. There's a painted mural on the wall that is actually a door. Leads down a stairwell to a basement. Now in my mind I was imagining some run down bar with old furniture. NOT the case at all!! This place is as classy as it gets.We were greeted by an extremely friendly host who gladly seated us on a huge couch. It was a vast bar with leather couches, booths, a beautiful bar, and dim lighting to set the mood. Menu was a little pricey, but totally worth it.If you're looking for a place to take your date and have a romantic vibe this is the place to go. A must see for visitors.","My colleagues and I were looking for a place to decompress after a work meeting. We initially were at another bar but since there were 7 of us they could only accommodate us for a short period of time. One of my colleagues had been to the Bar Downstairs and suggested we head here next. Located on the lower level of the Andaz Hotel, I was loving the aesthetics as soon as I walked in. Low lighting, a dark color scheme, plus minimal yet effective decor really made it a welcoming space. The area was quite large, and we were directed towards a lounge area which worked out since we could all comfortably sit and face each other. The drinks menu is separated by liquor - there's a large selection at typical Manhattan prices. I wasn't looking for anything too out there so I got a Moscow Mule. While it wasn't served in the traditional mug, it had good flavor and was smooth. They topped it with some candied ginger which I thought was a nice touch. They have a small food menu with charcuterie offerings and other snacks, but we didn't partake. Service was friendly and efficient. Despite it being moderately busy we were it forgotten which I always appreciate. Overall, I was really impressed with The Bar Downstairs. It's an ideal spot for work happy hour with solid drinks and great service.",The Bar Downstairs and Kitchen
818,"Amazingly quick delivery. A veggie broth that's FINALLY not bland. You sold me Bao Bao, you sold me hard and fast.","Bam Bam noodles - Tasty, cheap and very satisfying. Service pretty poor and no ambiance, but I'd go back for a quick lunch.",MealPal RatingMeal: Bao Bao Rice Wait Time - 5/5Portion - 4/5Taste - 4/5Accuracy - 4/5Value - 4/5Tasty but a little dry.,Came here for lunch with a friend. It was a little busy during lunch but the crowed quickly left around 1.The staff was really nice and courteous. I ordered the baobao noodle soup with medium spice. I thought it was quite good and the perfect amount of spicy. The minced meat came with the soup and was also pretty tasty. They had vegetarian options so that was a perfect option for my friend.,"I had high hopes coming into Bao Bao Cafe - unfortunately, I ended up being disappointed with the meal I received. I ordered the Bam Bam Noodles which were very underwhelming. While the portion size was huge (definitely come here if you want a good bang for your buck) the food quality was just okay. I'm okay with paying a little more for good food, but I felt like the value wasn't there. In order to meet the $10 credit card minimum, I added on an egg, which I expected to at least be a tea egg. Instead it was an unsalted, dry hard-boiled egg which I definitely wouldn't shell out $1.50 for. The noodles were also just okay, with no special flavor or kick that made them pop. Bao Bao Cafe is just...okay. But that's the problem - in a place like New York where there are 102938102938 food options, being ""just okay"" isn't good enough.","Great for what it is : a hole in the wall Cute Asian place. The service was amazing ! Cute , small space with quick hearty food. All sorts of customization and add ons available... I don't eat pork but was able to replace it with a variety of other options at a small price. That's what I did with the bam bam noodles. Just fyi, They do not have a bathroom Btw.The eye of lychee drink tastes fresh and had real fruitThe only star I took away is cuz the Hong Kong milk tea could be stronger but other than that it's great. Will be coming back.",Bao Bao Cafe
819,"I took my wife to Sotto 13 for her birthday and, unfortunately and disappointingly, had a pretty bad experience.  The place is nice looking, and the pizza is good, but the rest of the food was either mediocre or strange tasting (the Tuscan Eggs tasted like licorice??).The bad part was the management.  The wait staff was good. They were nice and prompt, but the management was rude and inconsiderate.First of all, I made a reservation a month prior.  You'd think making a reservation that early would guarantee you had a table.  Wrong!  Our reservation was for 1:15pm and we arrive around 1:05.  We had to wait for over 40 minutes to be seated because they decided to book a party at our table.  So much for a reservation.  And then they kept seating people before us, people who arrived after us!  We complained about this and received no apology, just a rude reply from the manager of ""their table is ready"" before walking away without a second thought.The wait would have been more tolerable if they apologized or were sympathetic in the slightest, or if the food was overwhelmingly good.  But the rudeness and the strange tasting food was just too much.I can't recommend Sotto 13. They are rude, don't understand how to manage reservations, and have way over priced food considering the quality.  Skip this place.","This is the worst place in NYC. I will never come back here. We made a reservation and but we had to wait for 50 minutes to be seated. The host and the manager saw us but they didn't say anything. We saw 7-8 groups that came after us and they got seats before us. If the host and the manager said one word 'sorry', I would understand but they didn't say any words to us. We had the prix fixe brunch menu and we got one pizza, two mains, one side and one bottle of mimosa. However, I didn't like the food here. The pizza was okay but other things were terrible. It was my birthday and they ruined my day. Long wait even with a reservation, bad service and staff and terrible food. Oh well... Never never come back. Ciao ciao","I had a horrible experience at Sotto 131. Waiters were very rude and were constantly rushing people to finish.2. We brought a 3 layered birthday cake, and they charged $3 per person cutting fee (~$20 total), which was expected. However, they cut it HORIZONTALLY (instead of vertically as people normally do). This completely ruined the taste of the cake given there are different fillings in the layers. 3. The food tasted mediocre and cocktails were bland.WARNING: If you plan on bringing a cake here, definitely don't let them cut it. They cut cake in horizontal slices!!!! Or just go ahead and find a different restaurant to celebrate your special day so you don't need to deal with all the hassles.","I came back to Sotto for boozy brunch with friends. Not sure if there has been a change or if I remembered incorrectly but there is no longer a bottomless option. The prefix is a few entrees, pizza pie, and sides to share for the whole table. This comes with a choice of drinks as well (a pitcher per 2 ppl). The food was all pretty tasty and the portions were plentiful.The one downside were the drink pitchers, which were on the smaller side and filled with too much ice (our red wine sangria was light pink in color). I'd still recommend coming here for the table sharing options as it is great for a big group of people. The restaurant is also in a very beautiful part of West Village and has great natural light on the inside.","We came here for brunch. We didn't have a reservation, walked up and was seated at the bar. We must have come at the tail end, because midway through our meal the bar area became very clear and barren and there was us and the other couple sitting at the end. They have a pre-fixe menu.  But, you can order a la carte. If you're not drinking, it's better to order a la carte because it's a lot of food and drinks. We can't speak to the drink portion of it because I only got a coffee.The pizza was good. It is made the oven way and made to order.  the middle of the pie was a bit soggy, I like mine a bit firmer and dry, but it could have been the ingredients.We got the mushroom toast with the arugula salad. it was good. The inside looks nice. The service is nice.  Overall, I'd go back.","This place is under what seems to be a residential building. The atmosphere overall is pretty lively and somewhat romantic during the night. They have candles on the tables, but it's very loud because of all the parties that seem to congregate here. I ordered the carbonara. It was extremely rich and really needed some black pepper or salt. The pancetta was not that flavourful and the peas were hard to pick up with a forkful of twirled pasta. Overall, it was a bit expensive for how it tasted but the portion was way too much for one person.The meatballs were really good. They were nearly the same price as a plate of pasta, but they were the most worth it dish. They were very tender so much so that they kind of melted in your mouth. Odd experience, but I really enjoyed that. The pizza was solid. It wasn't the best I've had but it was good for a shared appetizer. It was thin and it was so hot that the cheese and sauce slid off the slice when I picked it up.It ended up being around $160 for 4 people who each had their own plate and two appetizers to share.",Sotto 13
820,"I'm a fan! Already recommended this place to a bunch of friends.I came at 11:40 for a Tuesday lunch and it was packed. Luckily, I came by myself and there was one seat available while other people who were traveling in 2s were in line. All the rolls I had (scallop, crab, and uni) were amazing - high quality and fresh. The rolls are served one at a time to ensure that the seaweed is still crispy. I think I'd skip the salmon sashimi next time tho. It was good but nothing unique.Tips/service fees are included so no need to worry about that additional 15-20% at the end.","Quality of the handroll is 5 stars. Unfortunately, service last time we went was pretty bad for KazuNori standards. The sushi chef was spending the entire time gossiping with another waiter, so much that it took us over an hour just to get 3 handrolls total. Keep in mind, the chef makes the roll directly in front of you, and is serving others at the counter, but this service was just so bad because these two dudes would not stop talking and take a minute to actually focus on their work.I think the manager was on a break or had to step out, because the minute he came back in and it hit 7PM, the place really started to fill up, and the sushi chef was zipping out rolls for everyone in seconds. I was previously a repeat customer as these restaurants and Sugar Fish locations have EXCEPTIONAL service, and was always willing to wait in line, but it's disappointing to realize you sometimes can't get great service here unless there an authority figure watching the rest of the staff. Despite this, know they have the freshest sushi in Manhattan, you can ask where they source all their fish and I would highly suggest the Bay Scallops, Lobster, Shrimp and Torro rolls. I enjoy their iced green tea as it's unsweetened and love the chic japanese vibe of this place. Definitely an awesome date spot or a great place to eat solo ( you'll get a seat faster cause it's bar style).Also, this place usually has a line, but we came here right at 6PM on a thursday and had no wait! 5 stars for food and sushi quality but 3 stars for our last experience here.",,I love this place!! Everything is so good. I've been here dozens of times. There's no reservation. You just go and wait on line. Usually a long line. Some day it is quick and some are really long. The longest I've ever waited was yesterday on a Friday night. 55m wait. Usually it's less than 20m. Lesson learned: don't come here on a Friday night. Tip: you can substitute roll(s) and ice/hot tea has free refills.,"Perfect ""treat yourself"" lunch! It's best to arrive right before open at 11:30am, you'll most likely make first seating. I arrived at 11:34am and had to wait until 12:00pm for the second bar to open.The hand rolls were great -- fresh fish, warm rice, and crisp seaweed. I ordered toro, scallop, and yellowtail. I liked toro the best, and would forgo scallop next time (menu should disclose mayo mix-in). The rice is probably the best that I've ever had, perfectly fluffy, separated, and flavored. The salmon sashimi was melt in your mouth good -- garnished with sesame seeds and a delicious citrusy, soy sauce. I appreciate the simplicity and quality of KazuNori, it will be a regular in my rotation!","The omakase of hand rolls at a price point that doesn't break the bank and satisfies that itch to treat yourself to a classy meal in under an hour. For first timers the 6 hand rolls are a must and includes Toro, Yellowtail, Salmon, Scallop, Crab, Lobster. Amongst my friends, the Scallop rolls were the surprise favorite and the reason I keep coming back. The Toro roll was a classic, but I feel largely indifferent to the Crab and Lobster.  While the burrito (as opposed to cone) style rolls are undoubtably heavy on the rice and a little messy to eat, they make each roll one by one fresh with every intent for the guest to ignore convention and dine asap, the rest of the group will have to wait. Abandon the chopsticks; these roll are called hand rolls for a reason.I've come with both larger (7 people) groups and smaller (3 people) before and the staff was extremely courteous and accommodating. The seating IS all bar seating so have a high preference small groups or even solo dining over a group meal. For me personally, 4 rolls is the ideal amount of food to feel full, but some of my male friends found themselves still hungry after 6. By no means are the portions too tiny, but they are still fundamentally individual hand rolls so take that as you will. KazuNori also has a no tipping policy, making the end of the meal all the better. Is KazuNori the best sushi you'll ever have? Absolutely not. But is the service, the experience and the quality of the food worth finding yourself in the Bryant Park area for. One hundred percent.",KazuNori  | The Original Hand Roll Bar
821,"This is americanized Mexican food done in the worst possible way.  The chips were cold, stale and bland. The rice tasted like the ""instant meal"" variety from the grocery, but worse.  The entrees were laughably bad.  For example, our chicken burrito costs $24 and it was smaller than what you get at chipotle.  Worse than that, it was terribly under-seasoned and tasteless.We ordered tres leche for dessert since it's our favorite.  Out of the 10 or so other tres leche's we've had in the city, this is easily the worst.  The cake was too dry and floating in a very watered down milk.Everything is about 2x more expensive other places in the city of similar quality.  I can't think of one positive thing to say about this place.  Avoid unless you're looking for the most overpriced mediocre restaurants in the city.","Food is having no flavor.  Mole is bland.  Chicken is boiled and no seasoning.  Head for el centro or empanada mama -  Not good food at this place. No seasoning.Thank you for the offer to stop by again.  That will not happen.  You refused to adjust the bill, even a single penny.  The mojito was flavorless, you even brought extra additives to the table to try and fix the drink.  Point being nothing served was desirable.The boiled beans, flavorless.  Not even having salt.Rice - flavorless.Thank you for charging what u thought was right.  I declined to eat the food it was so bad.Yes the manager offered additional food.  Unfortunately after two meals were tried and they were this horribly tasteless - there was not a chance that I would want anything else from this establishment.  It was time to cut my losses and go to another restaurant for a meal. Oh, I am sitting in El Central eating good food.  Yum!  Delicious food here!  Recommend this place to all that want great food.","Ah the most horrible Mexican food I ever had. Our waiter/manager was a really nice guy. So it made it very difficult to express that the kitchen making food needs training. We ordered seafood enchiladas. The seafood was boiled without any seasoning wrapped in a soggy tortilla topped with imitation cheese. The other dish was chicken with mole sauce. Again boiled chicken which was now dehydrated topped with runny mole sauce. We couldn't finish. Ordered a mojito and it was sad sad.  Will not return.Our taste buds are in tune to proper Mexican cuisine with flavorful ingredients and not just boiled food. You and your cook should try proper Mexican food so you can tell the difference. I never asked for any discounts, therefore you are being dishonest in writing such.","Came into this Mexican style restaurant in the city, the atmosphere was calm, they had music playing in the background and the lights were dim. The food was okay, their guacamole and chips was delicious and tasty!","Usually I can rely on Yelp reviews. You can't always be a winner in picking good restaurants. This was one that I lost . I picked this restaurant because my son is vegan and the had a list of vegetarian options that he could get what he needed. We started off with guacamole and chips. The guacamole was very bland.I had the Chef's special Chicken Burrito. The only thing that was special was the lack of Chicken in it. If I wanted a veggie burrito I would have ask for one. I have never had a burrito with carrots in one. Very strange. This burrito and whole dish  lacked in size. For $24 I want to walk away feeling stuffed. My son had the  California Vegetable Burrito. He said it was alright. Same price with the same feeling I had . Not worth the price.Sorry to say , find other options when looking for a Vegan / Vegetarian and a good Mexican restaurant.","We chose Mamasita's as a pre-Broadway show spot for dinner since it was a Mexican restaurant close to the theater. We were immediately greeted and offered salsa, guac and chips. Big plus (even though those are not complimentary).We both ordered two house margaritas but both of us thought they had a weird taste. I kept picking up a flavor of soda but I'm not completely sure. Quick note: we found out the margaritas are not made fresh but from a mix which is something we both consider sacrilegious but, oh well.I ordered the enchiladas suizas (chicken) which came with pinto beans and rice. I was a little disappointed that it wasn't black beans but the pinto were good, nonetheless. The enchiladas were delicious. Very well-cooked chicken and all of the flavors combined nicely. I would definitely recommend this entrée.They sent us out a complimentary tres leches cake. I wasn't a big fan of it but it was a nice surprise. My friend didn't have any since she's a vegan.We ended up staying at Mamasita's a little longer to kill some time before the show and the staff was very accommodating. Service was quite nice, I just hope they work on their margarita recipe or reconsider the mix they use.",Mamasita Bar & Grill
822,"My friend and I have been wanting to try this place for quite a while because of the hype around their burger. We finally made our way to get their famous Emmy burger as well as Arenstein pizza. The burger was juicy and the patty was deliciously cooked. It was flavorful but also very greasy. The pizza was good, but not as much as the burger. It was a bit too salty for my taste. While I recommend getting the burger if you ever visit the restaurant, I don't think it's worth the wait or the price. $26 for a burger is very pricey especially when there wasn't anything super special about it.",Bad - overrated. Pizza was cold. Hostesses were rude. Burger was great for meat eaters but experience was bad enough that even they wouldn't go back,"I had no idea they had one in west village. I've gone to the one in Clinton hill years ago, one time. So coming back and ordering something new made me up the stars in the ratings lolWe had the green sauce pizza (it's a square/rectangle). It was just perfect! It's a tad spicy and we held off the bacon and added mushroom.","Oh man. Easily the best gourmet pizza I have ever had. Still find myself daydreaming about it at work a week later. My girlfriend and I came here on a Friday with a 9:30 reservation (only time we could get despite trying to make it a week in advance! Good sign!). We ended up splitting a burger and 2 pizzas (yikes) because we wanted to try so much and could not come to a decision. Deciding on two pizzas was difficult enough! The pizzas were out of this world - so unexplainably good. We had the Mimi and the Emily and I would highly recommend each (but I want to try all of the others as well)The burger was very good, but a slight disappointment just because of all of the hype I had seen about it. Don't get me wrong, I still ate my half despite eating two halves of each of the pizzas we had ordered, so it was delicious.I'll probably be back within the next few months (hopefully sooner...asap) to try more pizza because it was that great!","Honestly one of the best burgers I've had in my life . The pretzel bun , caramelized onions, cheese and what ever that special sauce is makes this burger one to try over and over again . The Clooney pizza was Baker to perfection . The pepperoni and pickled chilies really made the flavor pop.Ordered the appetizer meat balls, unfortunately they came out cold in the center , only reason why I gave this great establishment four stars.Our server was amazing and rectified the cold meat balls right away and apologized. He was also very helpful with explaining the menu .We will be back again .....","I never get to go out to an actual restaurant during lunch hour but when I finally had the chance, I made sure to check out Emily. I've heard nothing but good things.  A few co workers and I dined at this location and we were lucky enough to get a table with no wait. We ordered two pizzas, the luca and Arenstein. This was just enough for the four of us and both pizzas were good. Service was great, quick enough for lunch but at the same time we didn't feel like we were getting rushed out.",Emily - West Village
823,This place is all the way yum. Went here for brunch and got the avocado toast with smoked salmon and added a poached egg. It did not disappoint! You get a ton of food and it's the most instagrammable plates I've ever received. The venue is adorable. Fresh plants line the ceilings and there is an open kitchen where you can see them preparing meals. I had a Bloody Mary that I absolutely hated (I'm a snob) and they gladly replaced it with a cold brew which I loved.It was busy when we went but there was no wait time so we were immediately seated nestled between two other tables within arms reach. The food is fresh and tasty and I can only imagine how many avocados they go through a day!,"Apparently a destination Aussie-ish brunch spot, we are a block away and never went due to a wait, until today.  I'll just write everything that happened. We walked to the restaurant and shimmied  around a group of 3 with a humongous baby stroller directly in front of the door. Oblivious group. Idiotic.  The hosts didn't ask them to move for the duration of our breakfast. Hostess suggested seats at communal table or window where the sun was blinding. We took the communal. Place was heaving, packed, line at the coffee area, tons of avocado toast everywhere, loud as fuck.  Homeless woman walked in and got extremely close to me and asked for money.  Felt like the most unrelaxing place in the world.  Right when I started thinking that a plate shattered directly behind us. Kim made a comment the whole place needed to slow down. Server was extremely nice and we ordered a yogurt with granola and berries, an iced coffee, and a turmeric and ginger tea. Food came before the drinks, I hate that. I didn't see a lot of hustle on the floor to be honest. Unsure what the experience is like when there is a manageable crowd, but my suggestion is for management to take a step back and work on dialing everything in perfectly. Get your coffees and tea station quicker, do something about the noise, and get the waitstaff in lockstep.","When they say they close at 6, they literally mean they close at 6. You have to get out of there. All the chairs will be up and they won't even give you anymore water because they've literally dumped all the water out of their bottles. Came in to check the place out because of a friend's recommendation. Two of us shared the Smashing Avocado, just enough to fill out stomachs before we headed to dinner an hour after. Our waitress started off really kind, but as time went on seemed to be more and more impatient. She rushed us to order, then when she brought us our bill, she only gave us about 1 minute before coming back to check if we had put our card down yet. We felt rushed, so we put a card down right away. When she came back, she reminded us that they were closing soon. After signing to pay, she came to pick the receipt up again, and reminded us yet again that they were closing soon. At this point it was around 5:50, I get it, your closing time is 6, but telling us this many times really actually just makes me want to stay longer. We both used the restroom and left around 5:55. When we were leaving, there was still one other table, but we could tell that they were being rushed out too, since they were chugging their drinks. With the decent food and pretty decor, I still wouldn't recommend coming here simply because of the unwelcoming service.","Pro tip: use the Wait List app on Yelp before coming here on the weekend during the busy peak brunch hours like noon and onward. Food: Got the Belgian waffle and cappuccino. The waffle actually was a big portion given how sweet the waffle was. I ended up really liking the toppings too. I don't think I'd get the waffle again, but I definitely would come back to try the avocado toast or another savory item on the menu.Be prepared to sit at a communal table, and if you're with one other person they sit you next to the person. However, it didn't feel too cramped of a space or as if I were able to hear every conversation next to me. Overall, great brunch spot!!",I like how the stuff are nice and is not bad.Good for light breakfast.I like the ambience,"A great place for a healthy breakfast and brunch.

824,"beautiful place awful service . I never met such inattentive service . The server were cold and just did not care about us . The waiter prefer to spend time with her friend instead of doing her job. The guy server gave us an attitude when when I asked for  assistance because our server was to busy talking to her friend. Then they did not even gave us a receipt . Cevapi was aright no Kajmak they charge extra and no flat bread, go to queens if you want to eat Cevapi the right way. Ovo mjesto nije dobro",The worst service in all of New York.  We Spet $80 for 10 minutes left them $25 tip they did not even pack all of our food. Those two girls are so rude. Unbelievable.,"Food is great. Service is horrible.The waitress that worked Saturday 12/15 around 10pm  gave the worst service.Horrible attitude from the beginning.Charged us $38 for 2 portions of  cevapi and one Stella. And after asked for $4 more because apparently forgot to charge for kajmak.I've been in the service industry for 8 years and never experienced a waitress with so much attitude. I usually tip 30%.She  loudly asked for tip, so that the whole place can hear her. This is the first time in my life that I didn't leave a tip.I still can't believe that someone in the service industry is acting like that.","I ordered the fish of the day... it came with bread, spicy ajvar (roasted pepper paste), potatoes with Swiss chard and a garlic & parsley sauce. It was delicious! My dessert was the sour cherry strudel, which was a little stale, but yummy enough. The ambiance is circa 1930s, casual but packed with eye-entertaining details throughout, from the kilim upholstered church pew against the wall, to the random Cyrillic written street signs on the walls, even the rakija mini bottles serving as flower vases on the tables, your attention will be at high alert the entire time. The only thing which took me off guard was the 'cash only' policy, but lucky for me there was an ATM literally next door.",Live around the corner from this place and only recently tried it. Loved every aspect of it. Their salads are fresh and tasty. Their beef dishes are amazing. Bread is on point. Spinach patty was super flavorful. Great atmosphere and they have live music on weekends.,"Every single dish was very delicious! Plus it just feels so cultural here. There is this old NYT article about this restaurant framed and hanging on the wall. Family pictures. Waitress with a bit European accent. I love the vibe! Hope next time I go, there will be live music!",Kafana
825,"Perhaps it was an off-day for the staff or they were tired or sadly we may have caught them on a lazy, poor customer service night.  Expecting an Izakaya in NYC to serve skewers late night does not seem to be an outlandish expectation; however, walking in at 11:30, we were told the kitchen had stopped skewers and sushi rolls for the night. Still deciding to stay and order off the main menu, we ordered the pork shumai, shrimp shumai, teriyaki ika, braised pork belly, grilled hamachi and a side of kimchi and rice. The shumai reminded me of the frozen shumai you can buy at any Asian grocery with very little flavor. Pork belly looked great in pictures. Ran out of the pork belly. (I would have assumed the server would have told us what was not available when we were seated.) As they served the ika, the server cut the ika in bite sized pieces which was a nice touch except she dropped the largest piece on the table and picked it up as quick as she could hoping we did not notice. The grilled hamachi was good. I am surprised it was not served with a sauce or seasoned salts on the side. All the platings seemed to be lacking for the modern brand the restaurant seemed to be marketing. Small issues like bringing out a Diet Coke instead of regular coke could have been forgiven but added salt to the wound as we left the restaurant livid because to top it all off...the server requested we close out our bill while we were still eating because they were closing the registers. It was 45 minutes until they were closing. I confirmed with another server that they indeed close at 2am but they all wanted to leave. Makes me think that the servers wanted to see what they were being tipped before we left, which is extremely tacky and blatantly rude.  Mind you, we overheard the same request to 2 other tables. After paying, we asked for a refill of coke and was told ""sorry the registers are closed."" We repeated that we just wanted a refill and they said ""sorry we don't do refills."" After our poor experience, the least they could have done is honored a coke. With so much promise, based on pictures and seemingly high reviews, I'm sad to say but not hesitant to honestly state...whether the food was good or mediocre...that this team of servers sucked tonight. And if management was not present tonight, they should be made fully aware of the staff's laziness, poor customer service and blatant rudeness. I can tell you that all the tables that night felt like we were being pushed out of the restaurant. In hindsight, the service tonight did not deserve a tip at all.  We will not be returning.","Despite the great reviews for this spot, My experience here was subpar because of the unhygienic service. We ordered bacon wrapped asparagus but the waiter brought to our table bacon wrapped enoki instead. We didnt realize that it was the wrong order and ate 1 skewer. He came back, took the other skewers to the table behind us, gave them our order of asparagus too and said he was going to charge us for the bacon wrapped asparagus. Reasons why I would never come back again:1) It was NOT hygienic that he took what we had already eaten to another table 2) He brought the wrong order out and tried to charge us for it.The name of the server on our receipt was Sunjae A.","This is my bad experience today. I can understand that bugs (spider today) happens. However, they  handled it so bad they just don't take the responsibility and saying the manager is too busy to talk to us and saying there is nothing they can do. And saying the bug is only in the soup but not in elsewhere. Is this the legit way to handle it? So unprofessional. Very shame! I am so shame that I liked this place before.","Izakaya offers fresh fish & tender yakitori. We came in a week day shortly after they opened and were promptly seated. Everything is pretty much served shading style and alcohol is limited to beer/wine/sake. My favorite dishes that we got were the short rib yakitori, spicy chicken yakitori, salmon sushi and seared yellowtail. The yellowtail was a pretty big portion in comparison to other dishes we received. Pricing is comparable to other fresh sushi restaurants.","{Overall: 4, Food: 4} Atmosphere: 4, Service: 4Quality of the food is really high. More elevated than most other izakayas I've been to in NYC. Food, 4: Delicious - some of my favorites were:- Marinated Galbi skewer- Tempura: Yum, perfect.- Chicken skin skewer- Okonomiyaki- KaraageAtmosphere, 4: Can sit at the bar or at tables. Feels stylish, lots of wood panelling. Service, 4: Good!","This is the BEST Izakaya I have been to. The quality of the food is amazing! Uni was my favorite. It was so sweet and had no fishy taste at all! The Mussel Hot Pot was my 2nd favorite. The soup was just simply soul comforting! The only disappointment was the Assorted Sashimi dish. There were MANY pieces and the quality was good, so don't get me wrong. But there were only 4 kinds. It had 10 slices of salmon which I felt it was too much! I wish there would be 5 -6 different choices rather than the same one with so many slices. (I hope the owner can see my feedback and make changes!)Other than the sashimi, everything else was perfect. The service was very attentive. I really like the restaurant was small and not too noisy, so we could enjoy dinner and chatted at a comfortable volume level. Haha! I will definitely be back!",Izakaya NoMad
826,"They chill AF. But don't yelp them! It's stupid!! Lmao...yelp says i have to keep writing... so... don't you want me baby,Don't you want me ohhh,Don't you want me baby, Don't you want me ohhh.Swag",Came on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 5. There were a decent amount of people in there for a Sunday which I took to be a good sign. The atmosphere and decor are really fun and summery. The service however kind of sucked. Our server was not friendly at all and inattentive. I did a watermelon margarita and really liked it but they were out of the cider I had originally wanted. They were also out of 2 other beers. Just wasn't super impressed.,"My drink has always been the spicy watermelon margarita with a salted rim, but i was pushed to drop a spicy rim this evening. My new drink has now been formed.",The blackened fish Travis salad is to die for. And great friendly welcoming staff definitely going to be a regular spot for me,"I'm leaving the country soon so my friends thought this would be a good substitute for Kiki's, which had a 45-minute wait on a rainy Thursday night. Luckily the owners of Forgetmenot and Kiki's are really good friends so they offered two dishes from Kiki's on the menu. I really wanted to try Kiki's pastitsio but they didn't have that at forgetmenot so I got the moussaka instead. It was great - everything I wanted and more! The calamari was delicious too but I rather the sauce was something other than yogurt. My friends didn't like the burger they got but the tacos were fine. The place was tight but super cute with throws for patrons who got cold while sitting by the window. However there is no sign for both Kiki's and Forgtmenot which make them a bit like speakeasies. My group definitely overstayed our welcome but the staff was really nice about it.","Came here for brunch, we always passed by this place but never ate here. It's pretty good I got the Boston breakfast instead of baked beans I got sautés spinach! we also got the breakfast Sammie pretty awesome too. I would definitely come back to try dinner.",Forgtmenot
827,"Really really good quality meat and they have ""value"" sets. That being said, the price is not your everyday dinner. They also grill it for you and ask how cooked you like, which is good, considering my bf like his meat on the raw side. But I think they don't have enough server to be extremely attentive to every table, so our meat was a little over cooked. Someone has to step in to take it out just so our meat won't burn. The desserts are ok, not the best for how much we paid but the meat made it up.","Wife made reservation for my birthday. We walked in and there was no host. Wait staff doesn't say hi. We walk in and stand at the tables for about 10 minutes with no one to seat us.I got tired of waiting so i walked further in and made it all the way inside the kitchen. A chef finally offered to seat us in the middle of the restaurant which we declined and walked out on.No food, no stars. No service, no stars. This place sucks.","The service was great, meat quality looks great too but after  I grilled the meat it taste something missing.It might be how they defrost meat is not good or some reason meat didn't melt in my mouth.Also kimchi was old.Disappointed:(","Yakiniku meat was better than what we had in Japan, but don't be like us and go overboard with the order. And to clarify, we had Kobe A5 in Japan and the meat here is Miyazaki A5.  Miyazaki A5 meat is so tender that tastes like butter and it literally melts in your mouth. Read the reviews and overall the hamideru kalbi sounded too rich/fatty for our liking that we opted for the treasure box, wagu special, and finger steak. While I'm sure the meat type and MP changes, our treasure box and wagu special was around $150 per order.  For the price, you're presented a slice of meat, but do not underestimate the portions because 3 orders would have been perfect, especially with the side orders of the veggies and garlic rice for 3 people.  And to our surprise, our friend had ordered an order of pork and scallops while we had went to the bathroom in the beginning of the meal and it almost literally killed us of gluttony. Wasn't a huge fan of the garlic rice or the veggies, but what I highly recommend is the gomashio cabbages, which was super refreshing and balancer against the meat. For the speciality meats like the treasure box and wagu, the server perfectly cooks them for you so that they're not overcooked.  My preference was the treasure box which had a balance of fattiness and meatiness while the wagu special was way too fatty and soft for my liking.  Finger steak was a bit chewy and it was probably because we didn't know how to time it well and was overcooked.  So just note that the server only cooks the speciality meats for you and the others, they will show you how to cook them but not necessarily cook it for you.  After all these, we were at our limits, but still had the pork and scallops.  Scallops were just meh but even at this stage, the pork still tasted good that I would recommend it.  It was fattier than what I was used but it had good texture and flavor.  So while this was one of the best japanese bbq meals that I've had, it was all so painful from overeating that we felt as if we had consumed 20lbs of meat.  Didn't help that we had hotpot for lunch as well...Futago is definitely worth visiting however, just know that it has a hefty price for the speciality meats and definitely recommend making a reservation. Also Opentable actually has cancellation fees so make sure that you're certain all parties are committed.  Initially thought that our server was a bit too nonchalant, but he provide great service overall and loved how Futago is actually a small intimate setting where the whole restaurant is really set up to take around around 15 parties.  Would love to come again for a portioned meal next time!","An awesome dining experience!  I should've realized before our meal that the grill is at the table, but it made for a pleasant surprise and overall unique experience.As someone who prefers other proteins over steak, the cuts they had were perfect for grilling, and our server took over the majority of the cooking, so everything was perfectly tender and flavorful.  We ordered the Futago Premium 4 Beef, one of their recommendations, and it was interesting to see how the four different parts of the cuts varied in taste and texture.  The other notable dish we ordered were the shrimp and quail egg skewers, which were a perfect, single-bite appetizer.  They had a mango soju on their special drink menu, and it tasted like a refreshing mango smoothie--safe to say, it was delicious.In general, the portions are fairly small, which gives you the opportunity to try different types of steak.  For most dishes, the server will handle the cooking; there were only a few things where our server gave us a window of when we should take the meat off of the grill based on our preference.  Outside of assistance with cooking the meat, service was impeccable and attentive.  They gave us bibs to protect our clothes, and even plastic bags for our phones, so we could take pictures of the food without getting splatter on them--I was amazed how they thought of every detail!   In order to accommodate the grill, the table was quite wide, and because we were a party of two, another party were seated at the other end of our table (they had their own grill).  It wasn't a big deal, since we had plenty of space, but it may be something to consider if you'd prefer a super intimate and private meal.Because they specialize in premium cuts, the price point is expensive, but overall they do such a good job with the dining experience, that it's worth it for a nice dinner.  So even if you're not a huge steak person, like I am, you'll definitely enjoy a delicious, unique meal here!","Food: 4/5I wish I knew what we ordered but my friend did the ordering. Overall the food here is delicious. There's different kinds of wagyu, rice, noodles and vegetables. Expect to smell like a lot of barbecue if you dine here and don't come if you're super hungry. Most orders are per piece or a few slices of meat. Our dinner for two girls was roughly $300. See pictures for what to order.Service: 5/5Great service! Our waitress Pauline took amazing care of us! They cook everything for you and take very good care of you!Ambiance: 5/5This place is beautiful and dimly lit. Great date spot location. Very lux and cozy.",Yakiniku Futago
828,Come here for the cocktails. I came here on a Thursday after dinner and the place was pretty lively. Cocktails are kinda pricey but that's expected. No wait either.,Nice place. Drinks not sure if was the bartender or the barback who made it because Aperol spritz is served with orange not with lime !! Couldn't drink it ;(,A very poppy and crowned bar. I do not understand why it is popular cuz I did not see any attractive points. The service is really ..........,"Returned with an early dinner reservation and tried:+ Besos calientes+ Monkey business+ Bone marrow poppers+ Seed crusted black bass+ Braised rabbit + Butterscotch cheesecake+ TufahijeEntrees were a letdown (rabbit was kind of dry and the fish was a little on the boring side). Drinks were great. The move here is drinks, apps (poppers were delicious) and desserts, and I'll probably get The Amelia, which is my favorite so far, next time.","Was looking for nice cocktails and dessert and had been wanting to come here forever. Somehow got a table as a walk in, and proceeded to have The Amelia, which was delicious, and an absolutely incredible chocolate hazelnut torte. One complaint, and it's what's keeping mefrom giving this place five stars: the coat check woman. She asked both my boyfriend and I at separate times if we needed change for a larger bill, then hovered expectantly before even getting our coats. I find this incredibly rude because it felt like she not only expected a tip, but was demanding one. She didn't give us the chance to offer first, and honestly, I was not inclined to tip at all after this attitude-filled encounter. Like I said, she said the same to my boyfriend as he was going to the bathroom, and again to me as I actually retrieved the coats. It left a sour taste in our mouths after an otherwise flawless experience.","Mad props to the bartenders who saw us shorties struggling to get to the bar to see a menu and came to save our grace. The bartender was also very attentive at getting our drinks orders and fulfilling them promptly. Ludos in that respect. As for EO, on a Friday night, it was packed and the railroad-style establishment was not fun to navigate, especially when they try and cram as many tables as possible for diners across from the bar. I felt like half the time as I was trying to move throughout, diners were also getting a serving of my tush. It made me feel uncomfortable, and I'm sure it made the diners feel a similar way. I get the tables are there to maximize profits, but perhaps just focus on the restaurant area in the back and leave some space for bar patrons. We couldn't stand around for more than a drink which is a shame because my At First Blush or whatever it was called was delicious and I looked forward to trying something else. When we went to close out my tab, that took a bit longer to get the bartenders attention. I had been standing and waiting to get attention for a few minutes when another bar patron, tapped me on the shoulder and asked if I could let him through to the bar so he could order a drink. I told him I was waiting for my card, meaning, I am being helped first and you will then be helped because that's generally how this works. He asked again if I could let him order and I was like... dude... let me just close out my tab and then you can stand at the bar and order everything you like without the extra bodies in the way. Like, I wanted to help the guy out but.... c'mon I am trying to leave the place, don't make it harder on yourself. Thankfully, I was able to close out just a few minutes after that but I could feel this guy's seething rage behind me the whole time as he purposely bumped in to me and made remarks that made me feel unsafe. Really? Really. As I left I couldn't help but take the low road and happily said to him something along the lines of, oh wow look, I am leaving now which means you get this nice spot in front of the bar, was that so hard?In short, I'll only come back to EO on a slow night because the cocktails seem like they'd be worth it. The crampedness coupled with the humid August NY stench was just... not savory.",Employees Only
829,"I walked and got seated right away at the bar.  The inside was pretty busy since it's Sunday and the brunch rush is here.  The interior is brick and wood with random hot sauce bottle and other dive bar decorations on the walls. Since it was brunch I felt like a Bloody Mary was in order.  I ordered the voodoo Bloody Mary since it looked enticing with the shrimp and crab meat.  I was also recommended the catfish po boy since it was my first dish here.My Bloody Mary came out and it was on the bland side.  Being a Cajun place I would have expected a strong flavor from the drink.  I ended up adding some Cholula hot sauce to give it enough zest.  The crab meat didn't really do much for the drink, maybe gave it more texture and a slight Unami flavor.  The po boy was legit. The fish was cooked perfectly and the sandwich came out looking very delicious.  Only negative comment would be is that the bread is a baguette.  Just like my banh mi, I prefer the bread to be soft and flavorful.  Usually a po boy would be in a lobster roll which is soft and buttery.  Catfish is a nice chill place.  I would come back again to try more food and other drinks.","I haven't been paying much attention to the wife, so I decided to take her out to this southern restaurant: the country fried steak and the shrimp and grits was really good. The only reason I left out the other star is because I couldn't get the crab cakes and jambalaya for brunch . We will be going back. Sorry; no pictures to post; we ate it all.","Very disappointing, especially for the price.   I ordered the Country Fried Steak, and Jalapeno Cornbread.  It was my first time using the Caviar app. and it worked just fine. The main course, however, was virtually inedible and not at all enjoyable.  I didn't really enjoy any of the food, but the fried steak was so overcooked and dry that it was almost impossible to chew.  I didn't enjoy the grits or the green beans at all, though the preparation was ok. The flavor just didn't do it for me.   The cornbread was also not at all to my liking.  Considering that this meal was well over $30 for just the entry and bread,  it was a major let down.  I could forgive the fact that I didn't really find the flavor enjoyable, but fact that the primary part of the order, the steak, was EXCEPTIONALLY DRY TOUGH AND OVERCOOKED, I can't overlook. If I happened to be out, and friends wanted to try Catfish, I would be ok with that, there seems to be a lot on the menu I might consider.  However, I would never order delivery from Catfish again.  If I had received something this bad in the house, I would have returned it and asked for something edible.  It's to much trouble to do that with delivery, so I just ate some of it and trashed most of it. Two stars only because the other items were edible and the preparation and delivery time was accurate. I have to believe the steak was cooked hours before I ordered it, because it was very very cold and dry, even though delivery was pretty fast.  If it had been cooked when I ordered it, I don't think it could have possibly been this dry and cold.  As you can likely see from the pictures, this does not look like something that was cooked within the last 2 hours.","Catfish is a great spot with even better service. I have frequented a few times for the shrimp & grits plus the crab cakes. The bartenders are always welcoming with smiles & dandy drinks. I love the wood and exposed brick. I tell you what, if you want hot sauce it's definitely in the place. Music is usually in point & I'm big on that. Check out out! You won't be disappointed.","Loved this spot. Ask my boy if he knew of any awesome places I might have not been too before and he suggested this. Since we are both beauties we rode a revel scooter there together to check it out. That's right we rode together. Me manning the sticks while he hung on tight and helped navigate. The food for the dopest! We got NOLA BBQ shrimp and craw fish Mac n cheese to start and it was sooo good. Crawfish Mac is essentially a cheaper lobster Mac but even better in my opinion. We then split a catfish po boy considering the place is called catfish, because how could they fuck up they nametheir restaurant after. We were right, because the sandwich was bringing the noise. Absolutely delicious. Sure sure the food is money and worth the trip already but the drink specials. Go with the beer shot combo if you're looking to crank things up. Pro tip: do the tecate. They give you a 16 oz beer instead of 12 oz that they serve otherwise. Finally if you really want to up the ante, polish off a sazerac or two. Nothing gets a night going better than a family style meal at Catfish with some beers, shots and sazzys!","So been debating over a 3  or 4 star, but unfortunately, I'm gonna have to call it a 3. Been meaning to check out this place, and honestly, I think it has great vibes and the service was amazing. Just don't think that the food, and drinks were worth the price? So a friend and I ordered the catfish po boy, and the banana pancakes. I think the catfish po boy was pretty good, although I wished that it was seasoned a little bit more (just a tad bit bland imo), but my friend wasn't really pleased with his banana pancakes. He thought it was just a little too doughy and soggy. He also ordered a drink that was $15 but we were really surprised how little it was. I mean it was just half a small cup. I get that some drinks can be expensive, and as good as it was, it was just a little sad that it couldn't even be a decent amount. I just wished that the food was a little bit better, and although the portions were good for the food, wish I could say the same for the drink rather than a sad half cup.",Catfish
830,"I was disappointed with my experience here. I went on a Saturday (only brunch is served during the weekend) and I was disappointed to see that there was only one non-meat option. I got the mushroom goat cheese omelette with a side of home herb fries, and I did not like the omelette at all. The mushroom came in big chunks that tasted rubbery and the goat cheese made me feel sick afterward. It was very noisy inside, and I could barely here my friends sitting across the table from me. I would not recommend this place for non-meat eaters.","- Environment: 1 starI like this spot (she states factitiously).  It's typical of the kind of yuppy spot you'll find on the UES.  It's the sort of place that judges you as soon as you walk in the door.  So, if you're into that kind of stuff (icing on the cake, if you're another race), by all means, you'll feel quite at home.- Service: 4 starsOur server, Lydia, checked on us regularly and we were never without of anything for a moment or two.  She was absolutely on point.- Food: 4 stars Started with the cheese-board from Murray's cheese. Overpriced for two people. What can you expect from the city, my city, that's been monopolized with greed and disgust. We had the fried chicken samich and grilled fish tacos. My baby enjoys the food here, and so did I. - More Importantly: would I consider coming back here? Not if I can help it.",Sadly this review is mainly for the service. I've heard nothing but wonderful things about the Penrose and have craved their Chicken Sandwich since the first time I walked by and saw someone eating it outside. Even had to walk by the table twice to get another look!Although when I finally decided to go we went early on a Saturday to beat the usual crowds. We were given a table in the back right away and provided with waters. However then we waited literally 30 mins and nobody came to take any drink or food orders. We unsuccessfully tried to get someone's attention but once the clock hit 30 mins we were fed up and just walked out. Definitely want to try again some day though!,"This place is an absolute treat and did just about everything right when I went, which was Mother's Day weekend.  The staff was laid back and comfortable to converse with yet very accommodating, and our waitress even knew what to recommend for those of us that were feeling indecisive. And she didn't steer us wrong whatsoever. The fried chicken and waffles were to absolutely die for, with a unique flavor I have yet to see bested so far in the downtown Manhattan area. Not only that but they got these home fries that I would go out of way just to get by themselves.  The cocktails packed a lot of flavor for your buck and didn't skimp out on the alcohol content. A perfect mixture. The atmosphere itself was perfect for our group and it's definitely a spot they anticipate people staying for quite a while. Which you'll probably wind up do","This place is an absolute treat and did just about everything right when I went, which was Mother's Day weekend.

831,Nasty. The chicken doesn't taste like real chicken especially the chicken skewers. The drinks are good though. The pad Thai wasnt good either. Also the ambiance is at least nice,"No a/c in this wannabe restaurant. The popsicle sangria advertises popsicles, but surprise, this $52 pitcher offers a mediocre sangria with no popsicles. I hope the food surpasses the drinks.",not the best pad thai I have had. It had a funny taste to it. It was also vegetarian and had a plethora of different stuff. Half of the veggies I have never seen which was interesting. Delivery was also about 45 min late. Not the biggest fan of that since we gave them ample time to deliver. Not a great experience and hoping for better next time.,"We went for lunch on a Sunday in March. Best decision ever. This small Thai place is hard to miss, but a definite place to stop by. It was empty when we came, but filled up pretty quickly after that.We ordered the Potato Fries and Thai dumplings to start. Oh my. Those Potato Fries were kissed by the angels themselves. Perfectly crispy outside and soft inside, perfectly seasoned, and perfect sauce. You should definitely try the dumplings if you want to taste a perfect flavor combination. Granted, our apps took a while to come to our eager table, but the wait was very very worth it. Then, we ordered noodles and salmon. The noodles were the Asian version of al dente. Not mushy nor hard, these noodles were the perfect consistency. They held their sauce so graciously, it was truly like a ballet in my mouth: the noodles, the vegetables, and the spices creating the most beautiful piece of art. The salmon was perfectly cooked, crispy and seared but soft at the same time. The balance of flavors between the salmon and the vegetables was unmatched, but could have used a bit of freshness from some mint or lemon. Overall, this is a FANTASTIC place to eat Thai cuisine. You won't regret it. Believe me when I say that if I could eat here every day, I would.","I came here awhile ago and had the kindest and sweetest/loveliest person ever! Her name was Csai/Tsai. Excellent service! Such a beautiful person!Food was on point! everything was delicious. I had the spicy chicken wings and Bul Go Gi. Everything was flavorful! the chicken wings were perfectly crispy on the outside, just like they should be. I have been to some chicken joints(looking at you wings over Albany) their chicken looked RAW and dunked into sauce. It feels like youre chewing on raw chciken meat! the outside is white because its soo raw. If you wipe the sauce off the chicken, you can see the white raw chicken meat with its pockmarks!! yuckthis place knows how to make good chicken! they can sell their spicy chicken as an entree its so good!The place was neat and clean! the ambiance is comforting and serene.I would definetly recommend this place to anyone!","I came here because of their famous Thai iced tea and how you can construct the whole thing  yourself !! It's such a great idea that I'm surprised other places haven't caught up with it yet. The drink was delicious ! But I kind of got annoyed when the ice wasn't melting ! I wanted more ice tea hah We ordered the calamari basket, the spicy basil lo mein and the pad Thai. The calamari was pretty good nice and tender and crispy. But it was completely not seasoned! The only thing that added flavor was the overly sweet sauce on the side. At least add some salt and pepper guys ! The spicy nail lo mein was pretty good. Nice and flavorful, the spice creeps up on you the more you eat. And the pad Thai was mediocre. I felt my pad Thai was TOO sour. We think they added a little too much lime but it was overly sour and I had to continuously look for something to drink after each bite. Inside the establishment was clean and pretty simple in their design. Hints of Thai culture was scattered around and it was super nice sitting near the windows because of the amazing lighting.",Pinto Restaurant
832,Let's just say I've had betters I've eaten a great deal of Cajun/Creole style food and this just didn't peak my interest. I had high hopes for this place :-/ The host/waitress could have been a little less into her phone as well. It's one thing to do it out of the service areas but another to do it right in front of guests when staff is short and things that need tending to.,-The food took ages.-They prepared the wrong order.-The portions were small.-The food did not taste good.-All round epic fail.,Had the take-out of blacken chicken and it was quite flavorful. The chicken was moist and flavor was just right along with the sides it provided. It was located in the corner of the block. I was at location to pick up my order the the atmosphere of the restaurant was super cute and had the Nawlins feel about it but quaint and not overdone. Definitely a good place to try out this cuisine in person. Staff was also friendly and attentive.,"What a gem in Bed Stuy! Yummy, delicious Cajun food at very reasonable prices. We had the bisque (a must), jambalaya, and shrimp and grits (AMAZING). A lot of the food you have in NYC is sandwiches and pizza- how about a real, home-cooked meal?! This is the place just for that. Bruce, our waiter and the  epitome of charm, greeted us so kindly at the door (none of the typical Brooklyn hipster BS of other establishments happens here). I would highly recommend! Can't wait to try brunch!Note- they don't serve alcohol, but don't pass this place up bc of that- there are plenty of watering holes nearby but nowhere with food like this.","This is a fairly new restaurant in the bed study area serving up New Orleans/ creole style plates with a matching decor. We visited on a Sunday evening and only saw one other table of guests which we didn't mind at all. Service was quick and kind. All the food was fresh and took a little while to reach out tables being that it was obviously made to order; this is a plus in my book. We had the craw fish sliders, Mac and cheese, crab cake, and shrimp gumbo. Everything was yum. There aren't many restaurants serving up New Orleans style dishes in brooklyn or even in NYC so Biyou is definitely worth a visit if you're a NYC dweller and looking for something different and tasty.We'll definitely revisit for brunch and their yummy looking beignets!","I've recently learned about Biyou and decided to check it out with my mother. The decor is simple and delightful, and it felt very comfy here. My mother and I ordered the fish with just the greens and a side salad. It was good and had a nice taste to it. We watched it down with a ginger drink I can't quite remember. I'd definitely return to try something else on the menu.",Biyou

The only thing I would order here again is there beef satay and the Kao Soy. I wish they gave more of the crispy noodles for the Kao Soy cause they only give like a bites worth. The crispy taro shreds, Pat see ew, basil fried rice, and shrimp egg rolls were also nothing special. The shrimp cakes tasted good but didn't have the chewy texture that most shrimp cakes should have. I should also mention that the service here was also kind of slow. Over all this place was just average to me. There are plenty of other thai places in NY that I would much rather go to.",Good is good but the staffs are extremely rude! It's a cash only place which is again a bummer and while tipping they don't want to return the change!,"I ordered the clear soup with mixed veggies and seafood but I got was like just plain water. So disappointed. Not worth my hype. And the old lady with short hair was kinda rude to me and my friends. I remembered that we used very polite way of talking because we use the same language as them. By the time we were paying the order, the register called over our head to the customers who just came in. I think this manner considered rude in Thai society. Anyhow, what I can give them for the compliment is cleanliness.","Best Thai restaurant in Queens! Everything is delicious and there is outdoor seating too!

Very authentic pad thai, it has extra cashews at the side, make it beef! SOFT SHELL CRAB: omg this is so good before it comes with coconut soup with squash but I guess during summer its mango salad! Both are delicious with the crab. MANGO SALAD: it is perfect combination with all the fried foods they offer, perfect amount of spice. FRIED WHOLE SNAPPER: the fish is big and well deep fried, combined it with mango salad! SAUTÉED VEGETABLES with FRIED PORK: the vegetables are not overly cooked and has a crunch on it, the fried pork belly are good addition to it. PINEAPPLE FRIED RICE: omg my favorite rice, so good you can eat it on its own! THAI ICED TEA: so creamy and add some bubbles for texture!Price rating: 6/10 very affordable but cash only!Best Thai restaurant for me! Everything is good! Good for family gatherings!","Love their thai food very much! Sadly there isn't much good thai restaurants in brooklyn. But it is worth traveling to Woodside for decent thai food. I love their drunken noodle, massaman w/ coconut rice, satay, thai ice tea and sticky rice w/ mango dessert. Super delicious and not too expensive! Staff was nice and friendly, and the decor is mod. Cash only!","I'll have to say it's around 3.5 stars.My first time here was with my family after my aunt had this on her to-go list for a while. We got lucky with parking, but you'll have to fight for street parking at certain times. Came again with a friend a couple of days ago and everything seems to be the same as I remembered.I started off with a Thai Iced Tea and the Combination Spring Rolls (Regular and Spicy) to share. I probably should've told them less sweet, but this was just as overly sweet as I remembered from last time (Okay, I really should've been smarter). I got the Red Curry with Chicken and a side of Brown Rice while my friend got the Pad See Ew. My Red Curry: The flavors were all there, but I didn't like how the texture of the curry was gritty. It seemed like they keep it boiling for so long that some vegetables or meat were disintegrating and creating that dissolved texture. I'm not mad about it, but I didn't enjoy it as much because of the texture. The flavors were perfect though and the medium spice level was that nice amount of spice for me! The Pad See Ew: Now, my friend is a huge fan of Kin'd because Kin'd tends to be more heavy handed with their flavors, aka saltier. I quote my friend when I say, ""The Pad See Ew is more mild than the one at Kin'd"". I don't think this necessarily is a bad sign, but I don't think my friend would come back as he prefers the flavors at Kin'd. I did taste that SriPraPhai's Pad See Ew was less flavorful than Kin'd, but I normally eat less salty so I thought it was okay. Service: The waitress that served us was super nice though! We asked to move outside and she warned us beforehand about bugs and caterpillars if we moved. Loved that she always had a smile on her face. Very sweet! Overall, both experiences were nothing spectacular and I wouldn't choose to venture out to Woodside just to eat here. If I'm in the area, I'll consider going here (also why I decided to try this place or a second time).",SriPraPhai Thai Restaurant
834,"I see potential in this place. I used to go to Flushing all the time for Nanxian and Carma East in the city for what I deem to be the best soup dumplings in NYC. So when Bund opened I was excited to have one much closer to home. But I was slightly disappointed in the flavoring. The cucumber appetizer and soup dumplings were waaayyy too sweet. Tasted like they tossed in a bunch of sugar. I got sick of the taste pretty quickly.  The pan fried rice cakes were good but too oily. You could see a pool of oil sitting at the bottom and the food was doused in it. The service is average. We had ordered a pork soup dumpling and a crabmeat soup dumping. As we started eating the second basket of dumplings we thought it was strange that it tasted exactly like the first basket of soup dumplings. But because we were disappointed by the flavoring already we just chocked it up to an inexperienced chef. We didn't realize they gave us two pork dumpling baskets until I noticed in other yelp photos that the crabmeat dumpling is supposed to have the telltale orange peak. Because we had already eaten everything already we didn't mention it to the staff, but I was kind of disappointed by the situation. I don't want to make it sound like they have bad food. There's certainly potential. I would just advise that they lessen the amount of sugar they add to the flavoring of the food and less oil too.","Food: 3/5Service: 2/5Atmosphere: 2/5Food: We got the Bund Special Beef Stew Noodle Soup (forgot about pictures until I finished this dish) and the Sautéed Udon Noodle with Shredded Beef and Hot Peppers. The beef and the soup in the noodle soup were good, but the noodles were flavorless and were a bit mushy. The udon was decent but way too salty and nothing special.Service: When we entered, there was no one in the hostess stand and two people sitting at a table. We looked at the menu while we waited and the hostess finally showed up after a few minutes. The moment we said we were dining in, the two seated people immediately jumped from their seats to serve us. I didn't realize they were waiters and was a bit peeved they had us wait even though they weren't doing anything and knew we were there. The hostess had a bad attitude greeting us and seating us and the waiters provided the bare minimum service. Atmosphere: The place looked bright and clean, but the tables were SO sticky. Upon closer look, the seats were dirty. The hostess and a waiter sat at a table very near us during their break and started talking about things that made me lose my appetite.","I was excited to see a new dumpling place in this area, but unfortunately it did not live up to the high reviews or even my small expectations. The ambiance was...interesting, they were showing videos of half-naked girls dancing on the tv which isn't a problem for me, its just not what you want to be watching during dinner. But this is something that I can overlook. Now on to the food:1. Spring rolls: when these came to our table, they were still frozen on the inside! We notified the waitress and she took them back and said that she would give us another set. Didn't apologize, almost looked as if this is a regular problem for them. At least these were veggie and were didn't accidentally eat any raw meat. Flavor wise, it was nothing special. The vegetables were soggy on the inside. Definitely pass on these. 2. House special cold sesame noodles: Spaghetti noodles drizzled with watered down peanut butter. If that's something you want to pay for go for it. 3. Dumplings: We ordered the steamed pork dumplings and the pork soup dumplings. Again, for the quality and flavor, not worth it. The regular steam pork dumplings were the least offensive item we ordered, if I was forced to return here that is probably what I would order. The soup dumplings were far too sweet for my taste and just not what I look for in a good soup dumpling. They were also stuck to the steamer, that they ripped every time I took one out. Kind of defeats having a soup dumpling if the soup spills out before you can eat it. Save yourself the disappointment and make a trip somewhere else to get dumplings. This place is not worth it.","Updating to 5 stars. Came again for lunch yesterday (think they're past soft opening now) and felt the food has gotten better! Soup dumplings were delicious and juicy. Got the udon noodles again - they were slightly salty last time and was pleasantly surprised, great flavor this time! Noodles are pretty big so would recommend getting to share unless you're not getting appetizer. Prices are great, spent less than $30 for two appetizers and an entree. Really happy to finally see an authentic Chinese place in Astoria! I think they're in their soft opening phase so the menu is a little limited, hope they expand on that. Cute cozy littleCame for lunch today, we got both the pork and crabmeat soup dumplings, really delicious. Cucumber salad was biggest serving I've seen in the city. Also had the pan fried udon noodles, really big serving as well but the sauce was a little on the salty side. Will definitely come back once they have a bigger menu!","Really happy to finally see an authentic Chinese place in Astoria!

No more must we trek down to Chinatown when we have a hankering for the pillowy, succulent dumplings. On a Friday night there was zero wait, but it began to quickly fill as we were chowing down. BUT the best part was that it's BYOB! Finally, a place to bring my wine and white claws! What we got:-Scallion Pancake (Not too Fried and VERY tasty)-Cold Noddle with PB sauce (So fresh; highly recommend) -Shrimp soup dumplings (the best I've had in NYC...yes you heard that correct) -Regular pork dumplings (STILL the best I've had in NYC) You seriously need to stop by Bund for their dumplings and amazing atmosphere. Did I mention it's BYO?! Also, all of this for $23.00! Crazy town.",Bund On Broadway
835,"I came here as a recommendation from a friend. First of all, I should have put myself on the waiting list because we got here and was told the wait would be 30-40 minutes. Well, 1 hour later I came back to see how much longer the wait would be and it appears the host forgot about us. We (3 of us) were seated and it was about 5-10 minutes later we finally received water...btw...the water was warm so I asked for ice (didn't get that til 20 minutes later). Also, may I add that we didn't have any utensils. The food came and this is the only reason why I gave them 3 stars. The food is definitely delicious but the service is lacking. I don't really want to blame the servers so much but I feel Management has to recognize the fact that they need to hire more staff, especially if you know your establishment is always busy.","Decided to come here since its 1 block away from the library and we only had 1 hour to spare. We were seated within 5 mins, placed our orders within 5 mins and received our meals in about 20 mins. Let's discuss the drinks 1st. Khalil had hot chocolate which he thought was good. I had a mimosa that came along with my meal and a rum punch. It was really really good. I was tempted to order another but didn't have the time. Now for our meal. I ordered the poached eggs (actually requested it scrambled) with salmon hash and it came with toast grain bread. The bread was toasted a lil too well. Smelled and tasted burnt. The salmon hash and eggs were decent. Had to add black pepper and ketchup but I ate it all. My son enjoyed his fries and tenders but he said it wasnt the greatest. If you're looking to have a private convo, look else where because you will hear everyone's conversation. The service was alright. Our waitress wasnt the friendliest but I didn't go in there for that. Just wanted fast service with a decent meal and that's what I received.","Only got a picture of the menu because they don't serve food until after 9am, why even bother opening at 8? Disappointed to the max. The water was barely decent.","Awesome brunch spot!! The food was delicious! And those pancakes are second to None! Small spot and always a wait, but definitely worth it.  There's also the cutest little outdoor garden to enjoy your meal at in the back! The workers are friendly and accommodating! I truly enjoyed my visit to Cheryl's and totally recommend it!","I would really prefer to give 1 star but the food is decent and the service is okay. I just don't think this place is for me. I don't like how disorganized they seem to be. A few tables were seated at the same time as us, and when it came time to take orders the server just asked ""who's first"" lol. Bruh, what?! You tell us. I ordered coffee and a mimosa with the brunch special. But my coffee and mimosa came out as the same time as my food. The water was served room temperature, and it's particularly stuffy in the joint. That's the other thing... the heat. It's so hot inside. I'm sure the garden is nice. Overall it's nothing I feel like I have to have, and the atmosphere just isn't for me.","I love this place! A small and unassuming facade with a cute interior with great art, and an outside multi-level garden under the trees, and a really great menu!I was in NYC for the Frida Kahlo exhibit at the Brooklyn museum back in May. I found myself at the museum early and wanted to get something to eat in the neighborhood before entering with my timed ticket. Cheryl's came up on Yelp and Google, so I walked the couple blocks over and was fortunate there was space for me in the garden out back. The brunch options were all appetizing, and because I couldn't decide between sweet and savory, and because I figured this would be my one big meal of the day (because after walking around the Frida exhibit for hours I was planning to jump in the car and drive all the way back to Rochester, NY), I ordered two brunch dishes: the pancakes with fresh berries and fresh whipped cream, and the veggie quiche with a side salad. The pancakes were just how I like them - a little crisp on the outside and pillowy soft on the inside; they also tasted really good even without the addition of the fresh berries and cream. Which, there was plenty of (which is notable since most other restaurants I've experienced seem to scimp on the cream or the berries or both)....The quiche was also delicious - fluffy and creamy, nice subtle flavors enhanced with herbs, and then spring mix on the side with a nice dressing. I managed to eat it all, and then walked it off at the museum!I highly recommend this place and I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area. So many other great looking entrees I still have yet to try!",Cheryl's Global Soul
836,"Walked in here for the first time and the staff rocked it out.I can't wait to return Also, the decor is bomb! UPDATE: I came in to order food for takeout and had a margarita while waiting. Margarita was bomb but the food was a disappointment. I'll try again next time.","Walked in here for the first time and the staff rocked it out.I can't wait to return Also, the decor is bomb!",I wasn't overly impressed as every one else on Yelp. The food so so.  The service was quick.  The place was crowded and hot.  The first drink I ordered was terrible.  I had to order a different drink.  I honestly do not even remember what I ordered except for the queso fundido and I definitely have had better.  It was very oily.  I just was not impressed to go back.,"Chela is definitely a neighborhood favorite. For starters, they provide homemade chips and salsa that are amazing. The homemade tortilla chips are amazing. We also tries the cheese fundito which was on the happy hour menu. It was also tasty. We got the happy hour margarita pitcher and it was huge. More than enough for 3-4 people. For our mains we ordered tacos and the ribs. The tacos were so so but the ribs were incredibly tender and flavorful. The sauce on the ribs was great. The restaurant has a nice vibe and decor. They also have a backyard but we didn't check it out.  If you are looking for a trendy Mexican spot, definitely check out Chela!","A fantastic spot with excellent service, lovely ambiance and delicious, authentic Mexican food! A must try next time you're in Park Slope. I stopped by during happy hour and stuck mostly to their HH menu when ordering. (Why not take advantage of the deals, am I right?) I was happy to discover their happy hour menu was diverse with options for both food and drinks. To drink I had the red sangria to eat, the ""Cochinita Hoagie""  which was stacked with flavorful shredded pork and toppings. I was so impressed with their happy hour menu that I wanted to see what else they had to offer. I tried their ""Chicken Flautas"" and ""Esquite"" corn on the side. They were both phenomenal just like everything else at this spot. Can't wait to stop by again!","One of my few 5 star ratings on yelp.The food was so good even after a few hours later I am still reminicing about it.No need to elaborate what I had or my experience, just go try it out!",Chela Modern Mexican
837,This is my go to lunch place when working in the area. Choose what you want chipotle style but for middle eastern food. Cool interior and quality ingredients. This place gets crazy busy but the line moves very fast!,"One of my go to meals when I'm working around the area.  The food is soo fresh, healthy, and  plentiful. The cute guy in the back is always polite, knowledgeable about the food, and makes suggestions if you need. The tawook chicken is my favorite protein and toppings I always get the sumac and fermented turnipThe garlic whip and red pepper sauce is on point but be warned you may need a breath mint afterwards.","One of my favourite​ lunch spots.So fresh. I've tried their chicken (shredded and marinated chicken breast), shredded beef, and falafel. All of them outstanding.You can get really heavy and mix in sauces or do a little refreshing dish. HAVE IT YOUR WAY!Super filling by the way! Expect to hang some leftover.","Ordered delivery for dinner from this place as it was my first time trying it, and I loved it! The delivery came in about 35 minutes and they followed my exact instructions to separate all the sauces I added to my salad in separate containers.I opted for a salad with chicken gyro and all of the works, including all of the add-one like jalapeños, tzatzki sauce, hummus, tahini, olives, feta cheese, and a bunch of other ones I can't even remember. They all worked perfectly in the salad and I liked hat the hummus was given to me in a Separate container so that I could dip my pita bread into it! I'll definitely try this place again.","Solid 4 stars! Would definitely return. 5 stars for the quality of the food, freshness of the ingredients, and the cleanliness of the food area (from what I can see) and of the seating area. Ordered a chicken shawarma salad bowl. It is on a bed of chopped up lettuce and cabbage. There are unlimited veggie and sauce options, so I picked hummus, baba ghanoush, onion salad (forgot the name), pickles, cucumbers, tomato, picked radish. I got garlic whip and the spicy sauce as my sauce toppings. I gulfed it down, it was very delicious! The meat was soft, and was tasty.Minus 1 star because the food must have been high in sodium. In the hours afterward I probably drank 3 bottles of water. It may be because I got a lot of pickled vegetables.",The food was great. A long line during lunch time but its worth it. I chose brown rice with chicken tikka. The chicken was tasty. I took garlic sauce and hummus and both were amazing.,Balade - Your Way
838,"Be warned!  Their burgers are no ordinary burgers. Their fries are unreal.Shake Shack is worthy of repeat visits.  Their shakes come in an array of flavors more commonly seen in ice creams than shakes, not vanilla and chocolate flavors but also more complex varieties.","This is definitely the best Shake Shack I've had out of the several I've tried. They cook their burgers more medium rare than most - so try it if you're into that. Otherwise, the sides, etc, are standard. It does get fairly crowded for lunch, but service is still fast anyway. However, it will be extremely tough to find seating.",I usually love shake shack but I'm very disappointed in the meals I've bought lately. The last 3 times I've been here I've ordered the 10piece chicken bites. I've received only 8 pieces the last 3 times I've ordered the chicken. Not cool. And the restaurant has don'le nothing to compensate my meal.  Not cool.,"Great burger!Great fries.Even better shake!!Very busy when we where there, but still had our food in about 5 minutes.Best chain for burgers in my mind.","Hamburgers are tasty for sure, but they don't toast the buns so it's mushy and soft when you eat it.  That's a deal breaker for me.I recommend this place but I will probably look for other places instead next time.","I've been to many different Shake Shack locations, and this is the most horrible experience ever.  Came here on a Friday evening.  Trash and leftover food, all over the floor, around quite a few tables.  Used trays and leftover fries, and ketchup smears on the table.  Am I at a Mcdonalds?  Should I even be saying that?Even after moving the leftovers out of the way, I was afraid to sit down.  It just felt dirty.  After sitting for a while, a worker did come out eventually to sweep the floor, but didn't do that great a job.  And tables were not wiped down.On to the food.  Shake Shack has always been my favorite burger place.  After this experience, I'm taking that down a few notches.  The burger looked good, but the beef patty came over-cooked, onions were rather big triangular pieces, and I specifically asked for shack sauce on the burger.  In fact I asked the cashier, twice to make sure, but I never got it. Air quality:  It was pretty uncomfortably stuffy in the left side dining area.  The right side is a bit cooler.Bathrooms:  None for public use.     Final note:  This is a busy location so hopefully this is an isolated incident.",Shake Shack
839,"Just ordered the beef pho. The portions were generous, the beef was tender, and the noodles were cooked well. But the broth tasted odd, not fresh. I've even plenty of pho and the broth usually makes it or breaks it for me. I'm sure their other dishes are tasty and will have to give them a try in the future.","This place is a joke. Caller at 4p and was told they were closed till 5pm for lunch, called at 5:05pm and asked for delivery and I was told they don't deliver and I would have to use and app :o/ also told we would not be able to order till 5:30pm. Hungry can't wait, going else where. Thanks for wasting my time :o/","Waited 20 minutes to be seated on a table that was empty since we got there. Then we waited 40 minutes for a cold appetizer. Then we waited another 45 minutes for our main dish, but since it didn't arrive we left a bill to pay for the appetizer and left. Food seems that is good but service sucks.","The food is so so good! Shakin beef is out of this world. I love also that their veggies are not an afterthought, but shine in their own ways.If the weather is nice, the backyard is a good place to spend your time.","Went here with friends for lunch. The food overall is good. I've had many a papaya salad and this one was average as I couldn't really taste the papaya very well - ingredients lacked flavor. Lemongrass tofu on top not as crispy on outside and soft on inside as I've had elsewhere.The vermicelli bowls were much better. My friend and I both had curry ones - the curry was fragrant, floral, and spicy - highly recommend. My partner had excellent pork imperial rolls on top of his vermicelli - they were crispy, salty yet slightly sweet. Vietnamese iced coffee was phenomenal and fun. Service is kind.","Went here for lunch while visiting Brooklyn and was not disappointed! We got the papaya salad to split based on a yelp recommendation and that was a great decision. The salad was light, fresh, and a little spicy if you added the jalapeños on the side. We each got Bahn mi, I got the lemongrass tofu and he got the bahn mi cari (curry). His was more flavorful while mine was lighter. Both tasted amazing, with freshness and crunch from pickled vegetables and avocado on mine. The tofu was pressed and cooked very well so no texture issues. The sandwich was giant so we were able to take some to go as well! We also tried Vietnamese coffee there (great) and Beerlao dark lager (really great). The server was extremely friendly, he brightened our day and also gave us more information about Beerlao in general so we could find it later.",Falansai
840,"There were Miti-gating circumstances surrounding my visit here.Honestly it's not very good. It's expensive and it's fake hipster Latin food that isn't really Latin and it's the kind of place that causes non Latin people to write articles claiming that it's racist not to like food based on its lack of authenticity.Part of the reason I don't like it is that it's specifically for hipsters, and is appropriating other cultures - the employee that responded to me corrected me, how can we appropriate other cultures when we're Latin owned - well, it's when you say Mexican, but serve American knock off versions, and that is part of the reason I don't like it - the other main part it is because it's just not that good.In other words, if Taco Bell is owned by a Latin person it doesn't mean it's not appropriation. For me, appropriation is when you say ""Mexican"" and then serve American. But I've given 5 stars to plenty of places that ""appropriate"" and serve fake Anglicized versions of another nation's cuisine (and usually serve them to people not from the culture they're appropriating, otherwise they wouldn't do so well). In the end, it's the taste that leads to the star rating. The appropriation remark just is me shedding light on something that annoys me.And Barbie is Mexican, as a lot of you know, so that's why this issue comes up a lot in my reviews of Mexican food. The anger comes from her, originally. Now I possess it too because I agree with her completely.It's also not the worst thing in the world even though it's overpriced, but considering all of Brooklyn is overpriced these days, mostly, I'm going to give it a solid 3 stars.Which I have since changed to 1 stars because that's what I do whenever I get any kind of negative/defensive/argumentative feedback from the business. If I give 3 stars to 1 star food it's as a favour to a locally owned place. If the place then gives me **** over my opinion, I don't have to do the favour and can give it the 1 star I think the food actually warrants. It's fair enough.","First, please tell your servers to tell people the guacamole and chips are not free. It's offered like its free and you find out that it's $12 for a relatively small portion.. Also the 20% tip is ridiculous for over 5 people. The waitress refused to adjust even though the menu says ""suggested"" not required. We also did not appreciate being rushed out because another party was coming. How about management plan better? The food is great but you guys are getting spoiled.",STEPHANIE WAS A *DELIGHT* -- tacos were dope too~  #maximunrecommend ... Yelp is saying my review is too short though so here are some extra words?,"We came here yesterday for brunch. The decor is awesome here and the restaurant is a lot larger than I thought initially. We opted to do the VIP boozy brunch, which is $30 on top of your entree and they add 20% gratuity to any table that orders the boozy brunch. We ordered the breakfast tacos and breakfast burrito -- both were really tasty and satisfying. The margaritas and sangria were good, which made us glad we did the VIP option versus the regular one, which only includes mimosas, bloody mary's, and beer.Our server was great and attentive as he kept checking in with us throughout our meal. The only thing is, we wish that he would've at least given us a heads up that our time for the boozy brunch was running out but I guess that's just a little thing. We will be back :)","Came here for a bachelorette party dinner on a Saturday night. There were probably 2-3 other birthday dinners going on as well. A nice touch was that they personalized the menu with a little header about the party, and the hosts got to pick out what we ate ahead of time (it was a $40 prefixe + drinks... which ended up being about $80/person). I arrived about 15 minutes early and was not allowed to sit ahead of the group. For 11 people, they set the place settings across four 2 seater tables (one end propped against a wall, so meant for 9 people at most). It was definitely cramped. The food was fine, the standout from the menu was definitely the chipotle corn. We had a great time as a group and enjoyed the various pitchers of margaritas. The restaurant made a big deal of the birthdays, so for our bachelorette party they let us blast Bruno Mars ""Marry You"" - which was sweet. Would certainly come back.","Wow... what a great place!!! Fantastic good and drinks !!! Excellent service , friendly atmosphere !!! We had a good time",Miti Miti
841,"Sunny and Annie's does it for me. Most insane sandwich selection I've ever seen at a bodega/deli. They deliver to the neighboring areas but I once walked there from Soho at 3am for a sandwich. And I regret absolutely nothing. My favorites are the George hero, and the pho sandwich.","I had read many great things about this place, so I decided to check it out.I ordered the Pho #4 and was a little disappointed by the overall combination of flavors. I felt like there was way too much roughage and not enough meat or sauce to really have the flavors come together. I ended up with one half the was unbelievably leafy and dry and one half that was very spicy. Not sure if this was just a fluke, but I did not really enjoy the sandwich.","I would give this place a zero stars but i gotta give them one. I went Wednesday September 5, 2018 and the line was obnoxiously first and foremost. I finally get to order and the staff was rude. Sevice with a smile, yea right try service with an attitude. I was annoyed but was super hungry at this point. I get my food and everything was wrong. To go into detail would tak 10 pages how bad it was. So i waited another 20 mins for my correct order just to see a roach run by. I was so disgusted i got up and left. Never again that 1 star represents -1.","I had the pho sandwich here and let me tell you, it literally tastes like the pho is between the buns. It was SO good. All the ingredients taste super fresh.I need to come back to try the other sandwiches. There's a huge menu and large variety. I highly recommend.","The Biden sandwich ain't no joke!!! Chicken cutlet accompanied by muenster cheese, sprouts, avo, sun dried tomatoes all sandwiched between a toasted croissant. Wow all of my favorite things. I added hot sauce to every single bite and devoured the damn thing within minutes. Wish I had a big enough appetite to try all the other specialty sandwiches!","The pho #1 really tasted like pho. I think it's the Vietnamese basil that tipped the scale. I got it hot, but it was cold by the time I ate it (my fault). Pleasantly surprised and solid.The menu was overwhelming and confusing, like most delis. I'd come back and try other things.",Sunny and Annie's
842,"Having been to various Gyu-Kaku location, I'm very familiar with the menu items and I knew exactly what to order. There were no issues whatsoever with the food itself and it was as tasty as I expected it to be. The service we received was fine too and there were no issues there. The restaurant itself, though, is quite small and its entrance (and the stairs that lead up to the actual restaurant) is sketchy and dirty. I'm not sure why it is in such bad shape but it is and it was very off-putting. I probably wouldn't return.","One of the dirtier and smaller Gyu-Kakus. While the food was on par with the other venues, the table was extremely sticky. Literally you could put anything on it and it would require significant force to pull it back up, similar to the tables at a bar.The staff were not attentive and did not refill the water, unfortunately. The location was extremely convenient, but I would likely pass on this location again.","Very bad service. I was there yesterday night and we basically got no service. I had to ask 3 times just for napkins.I thought they were suppose to help bbq everything, but they didnt help with anything.","- Different vibe from the one in the village (very bright inside because of the skylight)- We tried the mango tango, osaka tower, and tokyo sunset- We got the Meat Lover's set menu and the Lady M's green tea crepe- The set menus are quite balanced since they include soup, salads, meats and dessert- My favourites are the bistro hanger steak and the s'mores that come at the end- The quality of the meat is good, the flavor is on point, and their sauces are the cherries on top- Come for happy hour!

I recommend the lunch special and upgrading to the garlic rice. The meat lovers special is also delicious. Both of these options come with soup salad and rice. There's a day time happy hour on weekdays from 11:30-6, meaning $5 cocktails and $6 32 oz. beers!","Guy-kaku has one of the most amazing lunch special/happy hour deals in the city.

I ordered the $10.95 value set which had chicken, pork and beef. If you are a moo moo beef fan, I recommend the $12.95 meat lovers set for $12.95. My friends absolutely loved it! We also ordered a few drinks including the Lychee Gin Mojito, Mango Tango and the Tokyo Iced Tea. The happy hour special was going on, meaning each drink was only ~$5! I tried all three and the Tokyo Iced Tea is definitely the strongest. I needed two to start getting into my happy dance mood hehe.The food here was spectacular, but overall, there definitely could've been improvements. For example, I waited over 20 minutes for my second drink and while our server apologized, it definitely slowed the momentum of the meal. Also, my friend ordered mushrooms at the beginning of the meal but never received it. Upon checking in with the server, we found that the order was never put in. Little details like that really do make a restaurant go from pretty good to outstanding.If you've never been to Japanese bbq before, I highly recommend you try it! Bbq can dig into your wallet pretty deeply, but Gyukaku's lunch menu is so affordable and oh so delicious.",Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ
843,Decent lunch for the  LES neighborhood. Been a patron for a while and will continue to do so. Their new cashier was slightly rude but I'm assuming she was having a bad day,"SO much GOOD food for your money. Small hole in the wall vibe but quick service and large portions. I got the Mediterranean Salad, which was fresh and came with a whole pita. The combo kept me full for a while too.",Took forever to ready my order and when I got home I realized they gave me the wrong sandwich,"Really cute, small intimate place in LES serving up simple, natural delicious food! the service is quick, the menu inst extensive but there is definitely something for every! Truly glad I stumbled upon this place and would highly recommend.","This has to be the best bang for your buck in the area. This is some seriously delicious food for the price. Massive hummus and pita appetizers for $7.50? Delicious paninis for under $10? Soup/Salad and sandwich combos for not much more? Loving it.Portion sizes are perfect, delivery is solid. The mushroom hummus and the Black Forest ham panini are my personal favorite things to order, but I've never had anything bad. The exotic tuna salad is great too for something healthy but filling. Taking off a star in solidarity with my friend who called specifically to ask if they had walnuts in their pesto (due to an allergy) and was told no by the person on the phone when in fact they do. She was fine, but that employee really shouldn't have said anything if they weren't absolutely sure. So - in case you're wondering - yes, the pesto contains walnuts.If you don't have allergies, definitely worth ordering.","Absolutely adore their chicken sandwich~ the pepper and mayo sauce is the one I always get when I order my lunches for pick up. Honestly their prices are a bit steep, the hummus and Thai soup that I've tried both seem but more expensive than what you get. Especially the soup feels could have more substance. However the food are very delicious. The sandwich despite being $8-9 was stuffed with chicken patties enough for a meal. The staff are always very friendly here and I never had any issues with my order. Since I work nearby it's always been takouts only and they always gotten the time estimate correctly which honestly very impressive.I've yet to try out their other offering and hope my next visit will be equally impressed with their sandwiches.",Bite
844,"Bunsmith was one those places I walked into not sure what I was going to experience. I can tell you this place left me wanting to come back for an excellent meal that was not only affordable but packed with flavor and style. This place gave my tastebuds a much needed kick in the mouth compared to places in the South. We first ordered the  kimchi which was shocking refreshing even with the extra kick of spice as well. Then, I ordered the spicy Korean Ramen with Pork. I was worried that the American cheese would be that fake nasty cheese that looks and taste plastic but I was so wrong! I couldn't even taste the cheese because it blended so well with the meal. My meal was spicy but not overwhelming to the point that taste was sacrificed. That perfect tenderness of the pork and cooked just right ramen makes me want to keep coming over and over. Go ahead and try this one of a kind experience! It will not disappoint!",The food was just ok. The two plates we tried were missing stronger flavors.,"Delicious, affordable buns. Came late night on a Saturday, dark-lit, hip ambiance. Can sirt at the bar or hightop for a casual bite, or sit down at a table for a little bit more of an intimate experience. The bar looked good for drinks too. Tons of craftsmanship here all around.Where they lost a star: ""sticky fries"" - $7. Not worth it. Rice syrup and some paprika. Nothing special whatsoever. Basically a large order of McDonalds fries spread on a small metal sheet pan. Felt sort of gypped here.","Bunsmith is the best! They always have an IPA on hand which I appreciate and the buns are amazing...I agree with most of the other reviewers, pork jowl is definitely the best. Their fries are amazingggg, but the Korean Fried Chicken Nuggets were just ok. They come with a standard BBQ sauce that I wasn't impressed with. I'd love to try a bowl here but I'm not sure that I can convince myself NOT to eat a million buns.","Food was good. We Had the brisket, spam and cookie, and fried chicken bun. The brisket bun was very tender and flavorful but fried chicken bun could've have a bit more flavor. Ironically, the spam and cookie butter was really good sweet and savory. The fried could've used a bit more seasoning or salt with the honey and seasoning the fries had no taste.We came on a Sunday evening and it was pretty quiet. About 10 mins later the seats did start to fill up. We sat the bar and the bartender was very informative and attentive.","Food was good. We Had the brisket, spam and cookie, and fried chicken bun.

845,"Wasn't a fan. Nice employees but doesn't make up for lack of atmosphere and overpriced, average tasting food (very small quantities for high prices). The wine selection is nice however.","My husband and I came to Kilo for our one year anniversary and it was the perfect place to celebrate. Their wine selection was wonderful, the service was great, and the food was amazing. We ordered the mushroom tacos, the crostini, the burrata, and papas bravas. All of the dishes were delightful, fresh, and inventive. We especially loved the burrata with plenty of fresh summer fruit. I have to say, my only disappointment in this meal came from the dessert. We ordered the crack pie - and maybe my Midwest upbringing gave me unrealistic expectations of pie - but we got the saddest disk of strange sugar substance. It was not pie. It wasn't particularly good. And it was $8. I was so sad. Kilo is absolutely worth a visit, just go elsewhere for dessert.","Why all these 4-star reviews, I just don't understand it. The atmosphere in this restaurant is totally no-fun. It is basically a cramped corridor with some ungracious seating crammed in there. Extremely ungracious. If you are a single, furthermore, you won't even get a table but will have to sit at the bar, even though you've made a reservation. Sorry folks, one of the main reasons for going out to a restaurant is that the atmosphere ought to be uplifting/cheery/gracious, etc. etc. If you don't get that, you may as well pop a frozen meal into your oven. And it is of course a full service hole-in-the-wall, so it's not like you're eating $5 tacos at a Mexican quick-food hole-in-the-wall. The economics don't add up: it's not a good deal to pay full-service restaurant prices, when the place is just no fun and the food is not memorable in a positive way.Food was no great shakes either. I had a whitefish salad, which was okay. But the mushroom tacos were horrible, totally overloaded with some cheap, sugary, oriental sauce. Oriental tacos?? Sugar is not a good ingredient for tacos, but a sugary Oriental sauce is doubly wrong.","Small restaurant with lovely dimly lit ambiance and chill vibe. There is a communal table as well as a bar area and several 2 seat tables. Bonus that they take reservations and you can request where you sit if you have a preference. The service was impeccable. Our waiter was extremely pleasant and friendly. He took the time to ask if we had any special requests or dietary restrictions. When we told him, he worked with us to specially curate what we ordered, making slight menu modifications that suited our needs. I felt like we had our own private dining experience catered specifically for our needs. The idea of the restaurant is for sharing small plates, but accommodations can be made. Loved it and I will be back.","What Hell!Was just here the other night and the staff is an utter disgrace. First off when my boyfriend decided he wasn't in the mood for wine after sampling some the waiter (guy with a backwards hat) said in a degrading tone ""You can't just give up after trying one fucking wine"" Super classy.Next, they just hang at the bar and flirt with girls and neglect us when we want to order. Next, I try to order the branzino and they say ""oh we just sold the last one."" The guy literally takes all the menus and starts to walk away. My other friend didn't even order yet and I have nothing as well... I said ""Excuse me can I order something else..."" Like hello???? They then take new orders.We decide this is not worth it and ask for our bill. Then we tell the other waiter why (guy with the backwards hat) and he starts saying to us in a very aggressive tone ""I DON'T NEED TO HEAR THE WHOLE STORY WHY YOU WANT YOUR CHECK"" To top it off we get our bill with entrees on it still. Sadly the appetizers we had were very tasty. But the so-called humans who work here could care LESS about anyone. I will never come here or tell anyone to. It now makes more sense why it was half empty when we arrived.",I sat at the bar and the atmosphere was very nice. The woodwork was a nice rustic decor touch. It seems as though the emphasis at the bar  was polishing wine glasses. I had to ask for bread towards the end of the meal. It would've been nice if the service would have been more attuned to the people sitting at the bar rather than the wine glasses. After all Service is what it's all about and it was virtually nonexistent here. I did not find this place hospitable. but the staff was there to do their work that they were instructed to do. That is the impression I was given. The owner of restaurant had his fingerprints all over it and apparently that's what he wanted. More emphasis on showing glass polishing skills rather than serving the customer are engaging in the customer in anyway. The minimal staff seemed overwhelmed however my pasta was small served in a cereal bowl. Shrimp with pesto had four shrimp in it they were cooked tube rubber like texture and we're obviously frozen shrimp. Tomatoes should not blend well with pesto to begin with and cherry tomatoes at that if used it all should have been peeled. Tomato skin should never be used in a sauce for pasta. I would not go out of my way to return to this restaurant.,Kilo
846,"Very small place. And extremely hot! We told the hostess and the temperature still stayed in the mid 80s through out the whole meal. Not an intimate dining experience at all. The food was extremely salty- the food is really poor and sadly I mean really poor. Sad that since the ambiance is pretty great. Just can't justify coming here for the food which is too salty in some cases, and tasteless in others.Very disappointed with our meals. If that's a sample of the cuisine served in the coast of Spain well it left a lot to be desired. I would not recommend this place.","Food was pretty good. Setting very interesting.Service the worst I've experienced in NY in 3 years.This is not a place anybody should visit if you want a good meal, ruined by the unctuous rude help.Doubt they will change.","This place is very pretty and has good ambience but the service is unforgiving. We showed up 1min after the 15min rule on the reservation and they refused to seat us. The restaurant was half empty and there was no one else there in line or waiting. We said that we would eat quickly and skip dessert if they needed the table for someone after us but they would not budge. I have been here a few times before and the experience was ok. The food is not great but the pictures are very nice and there are tons of roses every where (which is great for dates). Given the price point though, it is pretty bad deal. Given the incredibly bad service, the blah food, the high price, and the fact that this is a NYC with tons of better options near by (e.g cookshop), I am adding this restaurant to my black list of places to every go to again!","This is probably the best Spanish restaurant I've ever been taken to in NYC. The service was amazing and our waitress went above and beyond to cater us. We ordered a bottle of wine (very pricey $150, but worth every penny), popcorn octopus, and steak. We were skeptical about trying the popcorn octopus but were happy we did because we wanted more when we finished it! The steak melted in your mouth and was very savory. At the end of our meal, we received a complimentary dessert (sorbet) and were satisfied. Will definitely be returning to this spot!!","Main takeaway: great atmosphere, great food, great service. Highly recommend.Details:1) Atmosphere: Salinas is a pretty cozy restaurant, There aren't that many tables, so keep that in mind as you make plans. However, the space that they do have is beautiful. I went tonight with coworkers and we were able to sit ""outside"" - they are able to retract the roof on part of the restaurant to create a patio. On a nice, breezy summer day, I would highly recommend grabbing one of those tables.2) Drinks: At our table, we ordered the house gin and tonic (gin and tonic with basil and grapefruit), and el comandante, el club desayuno. All cocktails were a hit. I personally had the gin and tonic and I can say, it is one of the best gin and tonics I've had in a while. It was a good balance of alcohol, sweetness, and herbs.3) Food: we shared the bread, the patatas bravas, the charcutero, popcorn octopus and grilled octopus (daily special). The popcorn octopus is a MUST. I've never had anything like it - it is a symphony of textures (chewy, crunchy, creamy) and flavors (octopus ink, corn, cream). For the main, I had the sarten iberica. It was delicious. It looks like it is Salinas' version of a paella. I wouldn't say it is a paella per se, but close to it, with enough unique flavors and components. such as the deconstructed rock shrimp and jamon serrano topping to make it stand out. For dessert, we shared the rice pudding and the vanilla mousse. Both were excellent.4) Service: our waitress was amazing. Seems like most waiters are fluent Spanish speakers. She would ask my coworkers to pronounce the dishes to the best of their abilities - not in a demeaning way, but a playful and respectful way that enhanced our experience.","The restaurant is beautiful and the food was delicious but as a native New Yorker that eats out several times a week, this was the worst service I have ever experienced.  Was at this restaurant a week ago with girlfriends and although we had a reservation they would not seat us until the 4th person arrived (even though we promised we would go ahead and order right away so we would not waste time). Then when they did seat us - they told us we had to hurry because there was a reservation after. As we finished our meal, we were asked if we wanted dessert, but we declined and wanted hot tea instead.  We were then promptly told they don't have any kind of tea (really???) only cappucinos.  To their disappointment, we ordered Cappucinos.  After they served them, they pulled my friend's seat cushion out from behind her without any explanation or a ""sorry we need this for who knows what."" note: she was sitting on the cushion!  The last straw was that they then proceeded to double charge my friend's credit card without explanation.  Luckily we noticed, and they corrected it with little apology.It's very unfortunate as it's in our neighborhood, and the food and atmosphere was exceptional - so we easily could be regulars.  But none of the 4 of us would ever go back or recommend it to any of our friends.",Salinas
847,"Faro:Tasting menu:Favorite:1.Scarpinocc (lobster, sauce Américaine)2.Turnip (caramelized onions, parmesan )3.Frascatelli (black pepper, pecorino, guanciale, egg)4.Sweet potato ice box pie (olive oil cake)Overall Faro is top-notch among all Italian restaurants in NYC!",The portion sizes are frankly insulting. $16 for three slices of a tomato? Seriously? $14 for one beet? Get out of town. There were only five raviolis in my main dish... and they were crispy. I'm not exaggerating. Our crab pasta was equally minuscule.There's a difference between al dente and undercooked. They should prolly figure that out. Very disappointed and ridiculously overpriced. Go to Otis and don't kid around.,"Came in for a quick rest stop and dined at the bar. Had the crab appetizer on the dinner menu. It was delicate, light, and well balanced in texture.","We had a nice Saturday night dinner at Faro. The restaurant is certainly deserving of their Michelin Star. After reading some negative reviews about the small portions, I made sure to ask our waiter for suggestions for our group as we had some eaters.  He did indicate some of the pastas that would be much smaller and made suggestions for larger portions that would be easier to share.We started with:- 2 portions of the whole wheat bread with cultured butter - yes, it's $6 each but a decent sized roll of bread with 4 pre-sliced portions - 2 pastas (these were probably my favorite and if I wasn't sharing, I'd consider just ordering one of these as my main as both were good-sized portions): Bucatini with Lamb Neck Sugo and Turnip Greens as well as the Chitarra with Chanterelle Mushrooms and Summer Truffle. For our mains, we ordered 3 dishes: I had the duck, my husband ordered the NY Strip special and our friend had the Halibut. We shared a nice bottle of Cab Franc that paired well with the mains and also with the the Bucatini. The duck was very nice, I asked to have it cooked medium and it turned out perfectly. I will say I felt the pastas were the star for me but tried some do the NY Strip and both were cooked perfectly. Was it a pricey meal? Yes. Did I leave feeling full? Absolutely. We did not have room for dessert. Nice ambiance, our waiter was helpful but not overbearing. We would definitely come back to try other dishes as the menu changes.","Food is great. But portions are really small. Also, the prices are insane. I don't know how this place can stay in business in such a young neighborhood. Pork tenderloin was cooked perfectly. Juicy and tender. It melted in your mouth. The squid ink pasta and lobster was great, but really small with very little lobster.I was hungry an hour after dinner. Probably won't go back. If you are a big guy, you will need to order two of everything just to be satisfied. If you are on a budget, this place is not for you .","Had dinner at Faro on Friday night. A delightful and understated Italian spot that deserves the hype it has received.Quality: Faro was a very nice dining experience. We decided to order a light red wine to go with our meal, and it worked perfectly. The first food item out was the Tuna, a crudo dish with radish, crouton, and an anchovy dressing. It was the only disappointment of the evening, with less than stellar fish. Next was the rich Duck Liver. A tiny bite, but one with wonderful flavor, especially with unexpected tart cherry verjus. For our mains we had the Bucatini and the Duck. I thought the Bucatini was incredible and wish I had ordered a second pasta. With perfectly cooked thick noodles, lamb neck sugo, and this tasty pesto it was simply excellent. The Duck was great as well. Two lovely pieces of tender meat, medium rare and served with tasty sauces.Quantity: As long as you opt for a pasta dish you will leave satisfied.Value: $16 for the Tuna. $16 for the Duck Liver. $24 for the Bucatini. $29 for the Duck.Ambiance: Faro is located in the Bushwick area of Brooklyn. An unbelievably simple restaurant, it makes everything about the food. When you enter they have a bar to the right and stacks of wood to the left. Simple wood tables fill in the dining room, and white bricks line the walls. In the back is the open kitchen, which invites all guests to peek as they anticipate their food. The tall ceilings lead to poor acoustics, but a distinct quietness allows conversation to continue anyway.Crowd: Reservations are recommended, but not necessarily required. We arrived quite early for our reservation and were seated without an issue.Service: Extremely professional and courteous staff. They did a tremendous job in pacing our meal and coordinating the wine.Parking: Street parking in the area.",Faro
848,"I went to go scope Smithfield out prior to the Women's World Cup, as I was told it was the place to go for soccer. I can see how that would be true, especially if there was a one-off non-championship match that you wanted to see and there are indeed TVs everywhere, but otherwise, I thought the atmosphere was meh. It certainly didn't seem like it was worth the 30 person line out the door that I had seen the week prior. As a general bar, I was not impressed, but perhaps I will try to get in at some point for a soccer match and then maybe I will like it better.","Worst service I've ever received at a bar. Asked for beer recommendation and our ""server"" said ""I don't drink beer"". Only came over to take our order, had to order remaining drinks from the bar. Tipped the bar 20%. Bojana, our server, was incredibly rude and disrespectful. After not giving a tip, she said to please correct because we didn't tip. I told her we didn't receive any service from her, tip is discretionary, and I've never had such poor service. I will never be returning.","Mediocre food, terrible service. So many other bars in the area don't waste your time here.","Favourite sports bar - There are two sides to this establishment; the left side has more high top tables for large groups and the right side has more table seating for smaller groups- TVs everywhere, no matter where you sit, you'll have a view- Definitely come early if a big game is on, you can bet it'll be packed- Get the Jameson wings and sweet potato fries!! I love them - Never had an issue with the service here","The place for all things soccer.  TVs everywhere, all playing a soccer game from somewhere.  Big bar with plenty of tables, all high top, all with a view of one or more TVs unlike some bars where you're out of luck if you sit in the wrong place.  My friend said he's been there when it was so packed you couldn't move though.The calamari appetizer was okay for what it was, frozen out of a bag and watery dipping sauce.  The burger was better though the server memorized my friend's and my order instead of writing it down and sure enough mine came with bacon which I didn't order, and got charged for.  All in all though, I would return.","Go-to sports bar for my boyfriend and teammates after a soccer match. Love the pub with the beer selections. On occasion we will order food which the wings are always to rave about. Definitely a cozy, friendly bar to watch a game or two.",Smithfield Hall
849,"I paid 24$ forgot the dish called ""grilled rolled eggplant, with cheese ..."". To describe you the dish and how much this is a scam, I literally had 4 tiny rolls, sized as my baby finger does. But this wasn't meant to be an appetizer, neither a gastronomic restaurant... I was choked and it didn't worth it at all.So I ordered to complete French fries with truffle oil (12$) as I was still hungry. The fries didn't get a truffle taste at all, neither the sauce !!! The weren't that good too !Also at the end the add us a 4% extra charge to pay with credit card. The put it straight on the bill without asking you, even if you pay by cash.On top of that the service was very long.","Beware! They have a CC processing fee!! They do not inform you that there is a fee when you arrive at the restaurant or is it explicitly labeled on the menu either. Which might not be going against laws but the lack of informing is just not cool. Our meal, experience and interaction with the waiter was nice but all turned sour with the discovery of this fee. Restaurants shouldn't just be passing along these fees but should be teaming up and fighting back against these interchange fees.  blog.goemerchant.com/can…I give them three stars because the fee really was not cool, which should have warranted less stars but that aside I did enjoy the food and the staff were nice, sucks that they have to deal with this. I imagine many angry customers.","The menu was surprisingly very vegan/ vegetarian-friendly, so for the folks who like meat, there aren't as many choices. The branzino, chicken, and mussels were great! Our server was also really nice but the price overall is expensive for the amount/quality of food. The biggest disappointment was that they charged our 11-person group ~ 3.7% Credit Card Processing fee (we only paid with one card)-- which is indicated at the bottom of their menu but I have never been charged this fee from any restaurant before, so that was a bit of an unpleasant surprise. With so many places in the Williamsburg area, probably won't be back.","I had a wonderful birthday dinner at Midnights. We ordered a bunch of food for the table to all share, the steak skewers and the truffle fries were amazing! The happy hour oysters were delicious. The drinks were great. Our server Elena, was awesome! Thank you so much for an incredible service. From the moment I made the reservation, I felt very special! Thank you again- my friends and I will recommend to everyone.","I had a perfect birthday brunch thanks to Midnights, despite all odds. We arrived half an hour late and we were extremely indecisive about food and drinks. One of us even changed his order after our waitress left for the kitchen. We also bothered our waitress to take photos of our reunion, which she happily obliged. Needless to say, the service here is outstanding. Pulled pork benedict - These are super indulgent and a modern take on classic eggs benedict. The eggs were perfectly poached and covered with a chipotle hollandaise. The slow roasted pork shoulder fell apart under my fork, and it was so juicy and tender. Truffle steak fries - I'm a huge fan of truffle anything, and these fries were bomb. They were fresh out of the fryer, so hot to the touch, and they came with grated parmesan. We ordered two sides of this and they were the first things gone from the table. Avocado toast - This dish was a bit disappointing since my friends' poached egg was more well-done compared with our egg benedicts. The bread was also ridiculously hard to saw through so my friend just started picking it up and eating it with his hands. They have a picturesque backyard outdoor seating, which was fantastic for a sunny Saturday brunch.","BEWARE!!! THEY CHARGE A 3.99% CREDIT CARD PROCESSING FEE. This charge is on top of sales tax. For example, our food and drink total was $383, the sales tax was $33.02 and the CC Processing fee was incurred on the $417 total. They now disclose this charge on the bill ONLY because of a new law in 2019 stating they they have to. Also the note at the bottom of the check is misleading, merchants are not forced to charge this fee, they elect to do so. Came here Saturday for a friends birthday and was underwhelmed. I had to cauliflower tacos, a Dolly's Crush and a Salma Hayek. Everything was fine, nothing special.",Midnights
850,"I went with my boyfriend and we both ordered the Farmer's Feast. It was underwhelming. Raw turnip and radish with butter as a snack? The vegetables weren't that special! Nothing I haven't tasted from the Park Slope Food Coop.Bad flavors overall, one of the worst pieces of steak I've had, and too damn expensive. Should've gone to Olive Garden.","You order the tasting menu and your first course is one radish.  ONE RADISH.  You look at it and you're thinking, ONE RADISH?!?  What the hell?!?  How does that count as an entire course?!  Then, even though you don't like radishes, you put that radish in your mouth because it's the only thing to eat on your table.Then your brain says... Ooooohhhhhhhhhhh.... it's not just ANY radish, it's the most flavorful bit of purple and white vegetable fiber you've ever put on your tastebuds.  Then you start to wonder how they put that much flavor into one radish, and why other radishes can't taste this amazing.... and suddenly you spent five goddamned minutes thinking about that ONE RADISH.Every course is a bit like that.  Every dish. Every beer. Every wine. It feels absurd, until you put it in your mouth and realize it IS ABSURD, because it's so damn good.I hate you Blue Hill, because it makes me angry how good you made a single radish taste.","The waiting period for the food is overall not worth it. The waiting period is such a long time and the portions that come after are very small and barely filling. However, the quality of all the food is very good.","This was outstanding. We went to Stone Barns for dinner a long time ago so it's hard to say exactly how it compares, but this holds up extremely well in its own right. We did the extended farmer's feast, which is their normal tasting menu plus two extra courses -- a pig dish and the pasta and tomatoes dish from their regular menu. (There were also lots of small bites in between, but it's possible that those all come with the regular farmer's feast.) This ended up being a pretty perfect amount of food -- we were full, but not sick at the end.We had a tough time deciding which courses were our favorites. The eggplant barbecue is pretty tough to beat, but the beef course (which came with amazing peppers, even more amazing nectarines, and a fantastic green sauce) was also amazing, as were the heirloom tomatoes (which came with a small pouch of homemade ricotta), the tomato/water shooters, the old and new corn, and their ""beet jerky."" Of course, there was also the bread and seeded butter, which I think I could eat for every meal the rest of my life and still be happy.Overall, just an outstanding meal. We really loved it.","Celebrated a birthday here with dinner. We opted for the extended tasting menu and I am glad we did as the two best bites were the surprise dishes. The tasting menu is 6 courses, the extended includes two surprise dishes from the chef (not on any menu). They started by bringing out a bunch of fresh vegetables. Cucumber spears with a dipping sauce, radish with tarragon sauce, a non-spicy habanero pepper, grilled shishito pepper, and a cooked delicata squash. Then the courses came out. First was raw tuna with nectarine and sake lees. It was very nice and light but still had flavor. Next was sweet corn with squid which was enjoyable. The first surprise dish was a ginger noodle (light ginger flavor in the pasta) with uni butter. It was divine, not like any other dish I've tasted. This was easily the best thing we ate. Next was sour dough bread with homemade butter topped with grains which provided a nice crunch. Really tasty, exactly what you want from bread and butter. The second surprise dish as a thin pastrami steak with wheat germ and lobster mushrooms. The pastrami was good, but the star was the wheat germ. So flavorful and very satisfying, the wheat germ is like a lentil but bigger and more spongy. Next was the beef which came as two slices and pieces of short rib. The slice lacked flavor, but the short rib was perfect. It was served with pepper, plum and a pepita sauce. My issue was that none of these things really went with the other. The next course was eggplant with jujube bean BBQ sauce. It came with grilled watermelon, potato salad, beans with salsa verde and vegetable chow chow. Again, everything tasted good, the jujube sauce with the eggplant was delicious, but again, none of the items really went together. The last two courses were grapes with ginger and a light yogurt mousse and a peach raspberry puree with lemon verbena yogurt. The grapes were warm which was a nice contrast against the cold mousse, but there was a bit too much ginger for my liking. The peach and raspberry puree was tasty and had almonds in it, the lemon verbena yogurt provided a sour note. The dish was nice and not too sweet and good end to the 8 courses.We ordered fresh mint tea and then they brought out a dessert to celebrate the birthday, a thin vanilla cake with a strawberry mousse on top. Very pleasant and followed by fruits they brought out before the check, peaches, white nectarines, figs, and a cherry that looked like a gooseberry.The service was phenomenal, very friendly and knowledgeable. The ambiance is nice, though the tables are quite close together. Overall it was a very nice experience. I will say though I think we would have been a bit let down though if we hadn't had the two surprise dishes. All of the courses were enjoyable, but only 2-3 really stood out.","NYC's favorite speakeasy, tucked 3 levels below street level is as FRESH as fresh harvests can get. We had a ""Farmer's Feast"" which is literally inspired by that weeks harvest from local farm and also the classic tasting menu.Experiencing UPSTATE NY potatoes with my Upstate NY friends was a rare moment of foodie pride for their kind. This with creamy, Non-goatey goat cheese was truly well executed.Montauk Tilefish on a bed of cantaloupe gazpacho was sashimi grade based on my Montauk experiences at Showfish and Blue Hill came very close to the freshness of being at the Marina and Yacht club itself by the water - even if the portions were not very comparableSome dishes were beyond inspired and creative which always wins over the foodie in me : the Sunflower Marrow - thoroughly vegetarian - served and plated to perfection with the illusion of being in a Half sliced celery fronting as an actual Bone Heirloom Tomatoes are in season and that was heavily reflected in the choices with Dill , plum and dishes but these were literally served with Fresh ricotta, with a consistency that was straight from the farm the heirloom cucumbers with Breaded yogurt was an early course appetizer but had the flavor of a hearty anglaise. There were a good amount of amuse Bouches which were sometimes even a bigger hit than the entrees themselves : tomato sugar water shots, The fluffiest warm whole wheat with the lightest cloud of puffed quinoa and roasted farro might even have stolen the show. Main courses: The potato potato was surprisingly great - smoked goat cheese helpedSmoked prosperosa eggplant BBQ: with the grilled watermelon - a little underwhelming , but otherwise very fresh Mocktails: PLUMS: plums, Thai basil, club soda CRANBERRY: hibiscus, toasted cardamom, whey ( meh - too Bloody Mary like somehow) PEACHES : peaches , mint and ginger ( my fav)Finally the desserts: Heirloom grapes with a cheese sorbet and the peaches and cream with a hint of raspberry, topped with maple foam was once again, inspired and creative while staying light and fresh. NV: they have a Garden Room supposedly which I look forward to coming back and exploring",Blue Hill
851,"Came to Dar for brunch on a Saturday afternoon and was not disappointed at all! They have $30 deals that are inclusive of bottomless drinks (mimosas, bellinis, bloody marys) AND a whole breakfast entree! The price is enough to make you come back, but the food, flavor, and service really topped it off.","We came as a group of 15~ for a birthday brunch celebration. Upon arriving at the restaurant, it looked like a good number of patrons came to Dar525 because of its $29.99 limitless drinks, which basically every table had ordered. Overall, I thought the food was all right, but the restaurant was quite cramped and wasn't well equipped to handle a full house of patrons.Food: 3.5/5Value: 3.5/5Service: 3.5/5 - they tried, but things just weren't smoothAmbiance - 4/5Overall: 3.5/5Food:I had the Mediterranean pizza/flatbread thing as well as the scrambled eggs with sausage dish. Overall the food was tasty, and decently priced (everything was in the $10-$15 range). The portions were a bit small IMO, but then again I might be too conditioned to expect big food portions in general.Service:We were in a big group, so it's understandable that it would be a bit rocky from the service perspective. In general I think everyone's attitude was very good - from the bartender to the waitress to the buser. What did bother me was when the waitstaff would pour mimosas for the group, he'd do it over my chair and the mimosa would drip down the pitcher and onto my coat. It's a small thing, but bothered meVerdict: I'd come here only if it's NOT brunch time",Very good Mediterranean food. Should be 4.5 stars. No wait and very attentive service.,I got here at 1.... I did not get asked for my order until at least 2pm after our party of 13 asked multiple times. Bottomless? Jokes. I didn't get my first drink until more than an hour after I arrived at the restaurant. VEGGIE OMELETTE: The egg was mixed in with a delicate consistency with the other ingredients- very standard and what you would expect to find at any brunch place. SWEET POTATO FRIES: good Service sucked. I asked for my coffee twice before I even got it,"Overall- a good experience! My family and I came here on a Saturday morning looking to do a boozy brunch . The atmosphere was very cool, with a sun roof in the dining area past the bar. Pricing was extremely fair for the 90 minute bottomless, and the options for the Mediterranean food items were plenty. We all thoroughly enjoyed our food, everything was made to order. I got the Mediterranean omelette which was very light and satisfying. My only complaint was the organization of the staff. I'm not sure if the restaurant is still in the early process of training people, but our table was always approached in pairs which I thought was a little strange. And I feel like every 5 minutes a different person would ask us the same question. They should assign each waiter to different tables just to make things run more smoothly.Overall I think I would return for the food and drinks. Not my favorite brunch in Williamsburg but I left content","The ambience is really nice. Its a dark setting with pretty lights, the decorations are very antique and beautiful. For a date night, or for dinner with friends, this place is apt for everything. Loved the food too, and the best part -- the bill for 4 of us was $60. Its so cheap, we couldn't believe it. Will definitely return to this place",Dar 525
852,My experience with this place is negative as the wait was unbearable. They should have let us know the wait was 25+ mins for a single order.  I found out the long wait after paid and nothing they could do. I was late to my next appointment as result. They are also expensive considering soda was $3.  Never again I will come here not matter how good the rice roll is.,"The rice rolls here are amazing, probably the best rice rolls I have ever had. It only loses one star because we had to wait 30 minutes for 2 orders. That is a long time to wait for the food, and all the seating was taken.I got the shrimp and added corn and green onions, it was amazing. It was so fresh, soft, sticky, and tasty. They added their own sauce to the top but I added some spice and some of their other sauces, not sure what they were because they were not labeled. I will definitely come back next time I come to NY!","I've always been a fan of steam rice rolls at dim sum, but Joe's takes it to a whole nother level.  The skin is so thin, and each roll is filled generously.  I'll never be able to go back to standard thick skin, 3 shrimp per roll dim sum again.  I noticed they also added jian bing (Chinese savory crepes) to the menu, but sadly they ran out when I was there, so I'll have to make another stop to try it at some point.","Literally came back 2 days in a row for these rice rolls, I am sooo sad that there isn't a place as good as this in San Francisco. I ordered Joe's Signature Rice Roll for $9, which includes beef, pork, shrimp, and egg. These rice rolls literally melt in your mouth, and have so much flavor. The texture of the rice roll is a perfect pair for the protein inside. It's a good dish to share with a friend, and it's the perfect mid day snack for when you work up your appetite shopping around the area! It's also a light snack so that you don't feel so heavy afterward, I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in NYC.P.S. I would add that chili oil that they offer, such a good extra kick!","The food stall is located inside Canal Street Market which has a lot of cute stores and food vendors. Service was relatively quick. My friends and I got a variety of things - joe's signature steam roll, shrimp steam roll, pork floss chinese pancake, and curry fish ball.Their signature steam roll was definitely the best and loved the contrast of in textures with the soft rice roll, filling and crunchy bean sprouts. I would pass on the curry fish balls as they weren't that good.","Food: 5Service: 4Cleanliness: 3Joe's Steam Rice Roll is located inside Canal Street Market right off the subway line. You'll always find people lined up to get this tasty snack, be aware to wait 15mins as they make it fresh to order. Might as well find a seat when you can too.The simple thing about Joe's Steam Rice Roll is how it can be customized to however you'd like it to taste. You get the tender texture of the noodle (which is super thin) with whatever toppings you choose. It's supposed to be light yet punch a flavor with whichever extra sauces you'd like to add. I'd say this is the kind of place where you either hate it or love it since it's a special texture... Slurp-Slurp.Special Roll $9: (I customized to beef, pork, egg, sesame seeds, corn, scallion, and cilantro). Tasty with the perfect texture!Would I come back? Yes!",Joe’s Steam Rice Roll

I went for brunch for my birthday and we had a lot of fun. They have bottomless mimosas! The one thing I didn't like was that for the outside they only had one fan which broke while we were there. Not great for a hot summer day but once we were drunk we forgot about the heat.,Came here for brunch. The food and service was AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG. The French toast was to die for. Would definitely come again. S/o to the chef man. I've never been to a place where I enjoyed every thing from the decor to the staff to the drinks to the food. If I could give this hidden gem 15 stars I would!,"I wish I took pictures of the food, but it was too good! We had crab cakes, turkey burgers and fried cheesecake. I would highly recommend the blue cheese infused turkey burger. It's late August and it's a little hot, and there is only one server running the bar and food. He is really accommodating however and aside from waiting a little the experience was great!","Iight so boom. *Sigh* I was really disappointed in this place. I must say the reviews were more in favor of the boozy drinks rather than the food but my goodness.It's the type of establishment where everyone has to be present in order to be seated. Cool. Our waitress was fine. Literally fine nothing exceptional but nothing subpar. We had the bottomless Bellinis and I will say the champagne was potent. Redeeming quality. As it was only two of us she did her best to refill our drinks in a timely manner and at the end, she sat down a carafe of bellinis for us to finish. That's a star in itself. Food.....lawd! I ordered the catfish and instead of home fries asked for grits. My homegirl had the omelette with home fries and my other homegirl had the burger. The omelette with home fries, again, was fine. The burger she said was dry. My catfish? NO SEASONING. Like the catfish itself wasn't seasoned and neither was the exterior crust. Like what?! I literally had to spread the remolaude sauce all over to get the slightest bit of flavor. SMH. The grits and side salad....fine. But that catfish was a HUGE disappointment. Idk if the chef was lacking that day or if that's the norm but per my review and my homegirls.....would not recommend any of these items.So all in all.....if you're trying to get drunk and don't mind subpar food then here's your place. However if you want to enjoy a quality meal with your boozy cocktails then you most certainly can find other places.P.S.--The music was good. It's not one of those day party brunch spots where the music is too loud and everyone's singing at the top of their lungs and you can't eat your eggs without somebody rump shaking into the back of your chair. So good for that. Also, the outdoor seating is VERY cute.","Cold Food...Saturday, September 7, 2019 2pm: friends were in town to celebrate turning 50.  After an intense searched for a brunch venue and after the process of elimination, everyone agreed with the Rustik Tavern.  Party of 5 arrived at 2pm, placed our orders and here is where the problems started.45 minutes later, no food.  When the food arrived, everything was cold.  omelets, burgers, fries, home fries, all cold.  We complained to the waitress and she apologized, that was it.  This was the first time for everyone and the last for everyone.",Rustik Tavern
854,"Killer burger here. Pork belly was also notable. Great service too. 10 dollar burger Monday's. Unfortunately, They close early some Monday's.","3.5 starsCute and cozy place an decent food, just not overly memorable or different.","Made a reservation for Friday dinner.. Get there Friday. Closed. Call and they advise they're closed for a private event and that all reservations are canceled. I ask why i wasn't informed of this prior and they didn't give me a reason and were not even apologetic. Waste of time, one star for customer service and lack of decency.","Their brussel sprouts are the best I've ever had. I didn't know I could enjoy this vegetable until I had it here. In fact they got me inspired to cook at home, however it didn't come out nearly as good. I gave up.The second dish I recommend is their burger, good quality. Not to mention they are only $10 on Mondays.I have tried their other dishes such as chicken, lamb chop, scallops, etc.. They are ok, not memorable. (that is just my opinion, you should try for yourself because other people like them. )In the end, I give this place 9 out of 10 stars because I have come here so many times and I always have a good time.  I love to drink here with my friends. I am not sure if the bartender Jonathan still works here, his presence at the bar makes you feel good.","Solid spot for drinks as well as food. Right in the heart of west village, The Warren offers a wide selection of food.I stopped by for a quick bite w coworkers and fell in love. The dishes in the photos attached to this review are delicious. The highlights:Poutine... YUM.Lamb chops... DELICIOUS.Brussel sprouts... OMGAH.Do yourself a favor and swing by.","What an amazing place! Love the oysters, the lamb chops was delicious. Wines are fantastic! The noise level of music is just right! Really enjoy the atmosphere and waitress. I already came here twice in a row in three days, will make it a routine for its drinks and food.",The Warren
855,"Toro Loco is a hidden little Mexican restaurant in the Financial District. Tables are plentiful during off hours. Prices are reasonable. Portions are plentiful. Execution of food and drinks items is there, but depth of flavor is lacking. For example, the chicken tinga on the tostadas is so lightly seasoned that it barely has a discernible flavor. Enchilada suizas is a standout dish. Service is spotty; we needed to ask multiple times for our check before it was delivered.","Only a fool would pay $65.00 for a below average brunch when restaurants in NYC charge $40.00 or less.  Run Run Run and do not look back!!!!There is a bottomless brunch at Lavo, Philip Marie, Pardon My French, Havana Central, and many other places. Patron anywhere but Toro Nada!!!!!   You have been warned!!!!!If you want to stay in FiDi try Broadstone next door for a bottomless brunch, Harry's Cafe & Steak, The Dead Rabbit, The Growler Bites & Brews.","Junior & SophiaThis place is total bullshit!!!!   Price change under the whim.  This place is always empty. It's really sad that they lie and flip the price on you.  The service is shitty - read all the reviews that call their bogus shit out.  I'm taking my entire brunch group to PhillipMarie. Due to their lack of integrity my entire party of ten walked out and found dinning accommodations of perfection at PhillipMarie. Do not waste your time with this joke of a restaurant and run to any other establishment but toro nada!    How did your whack ass restaurant which is always bloody empty go from $40 dollars to $65 overnight for garbage?????Before you lie about menus not being on premises and everything else fix your lame ill tasting food, and iron out your service.   There is a reason why toro nada is always empty and it's becoming very obvious.  I'll make sure to spread the word in my building and everywhere else I go.  So not approved!!!!!","A friend wanted to do happy hour after work so we came here. Unbeknownst to us, they don't have happy hour...bummerrrrrr!!! They had a Monday special, 2 for 1 margaritas. No flavor, just a classic margarita. He snagged that while I tried the cucumber jalapeño one, can't remember it's exact name...tasty but not the best cucumber margarita I've ever had.We ordered the nachos as our main dish to share and added shrimps...nowwww, those might have been in the top 3 list for best nachos I've ever had! Service was okay. Getting his second drink was almost like running through a group of marathon runners trying to get to the other side. Almost impossible! Other than that, pretty decent spot for after work vibes!","I don't remember how I found out about Toro Loco months back, but I'm soooo glad that I did! When I read that it was brunch with a burlesque show, I saved it in the back of my mind for a birthday celebration. I booked it a month in advance, and would recommend a res because it was packed.The restaurant itself is on a quiet block in Fidi, but the inside was BOUNCING. The music is super loud, but it really added to the fun vibes. The saxophone player was also INCREDIBLE he was so good! He was dancing around with his light up sax and the music was just such good vibes everyone kept raving about it. We opted for the bottomless drinks and mostly stuck to mimosas. They were really good and they kept them flowing. The menu says 90 minutes but they literally didn't stop refilling after that. The hostess was so fun and next to us so she kept making sure we weren't running dry. The margs were good too! We also got the queso to start which was delicious. The menu is quite extensive but we almost all got the taco bowl which was light and refreshing. And a friend of mine had brought a birthday cupcake for me earlier so the waitress came out with a sparkler and sang to me. Super cute!The burlesque show was the real highlight of the brunch so long as you're fine with a lot of skin showing. They were so fun and super engaging with all the customers. They even did a round of tequila shot musical chairs which was hilarious to watch. It goes for about 30 min, so it was perfect have our brunch start an hour before so that we could spend the time watching the show and enjoying our drinks.Just when we thought we were ready to leave, the AC unit started dripping on my friend and her chair LOL. So the staff literally brought us out a magnum bottle of rose champagne on the house as an apology. On top of all the bottomless drinks we still had. The bill came out to $61 a person, which is a steal for the amount of drinks we got.So overall, thank you Toro Loco for the best birthday brunch experience! I will recommend to everyone for celebrations and hope to come back for more!","Toro Loco was the venue for one of my best girlfriend's recent birthday. We had reservations for a large group at 2pm on a Saturday. We were shown to our table right away and the vibe was great - awesome music complete with a saxophone player. Unfortunately, it was also really loud. As in, can't hear the person across the table from you loud. Still, I liked the energy. The menu is filled with a mix of brunch-type items and Mexican standards. I wasn't feeling brunch since it was late afternoon, so I opted for the nachos, with beef. The 'chos were solid but I might have liked them more without the meat, which was really well done and didn't add much to the dish.  I wasn't drinking, but there's a house rule that the bottomless brunch cocktails ($25) must be ordered by everyone at the table. I drank a couple virgin margaritas but they weren't well balanced and were overly sweet/tart. No bueno, Toro Loco. As the day rolled on, the fun music/saxophone ceased and a burlesque show took over. Personally, not my thing and I would prefer the tunes, but that's just me. Overall, a fun spot for brunch in NYC and, for those who are imbibing, a pretty sweet deal.",Toro Loco
856,"I really hate writing bad reviews and maybe it was just this time. But we really hate a terrible experience here.The wait staff were truly awful. It took forever to have our orders taken. They said they do have iced coffee, but then came back and said they would have to charge us for two espressos as well because the coffee wouldn't be cold enough yet. How does that make any sense? And then we ordered just regular hot coffee. When the waiter brought it over, he noticed it smelled like vanilla. I tasted it -- it was vanilla coffee instead of just regular so it was very sweet. He just laughed it off and left, instead of apologizing and offering to make us regular coffee like we ordered. The food was also horribly overpriced. Two of our meals were just fine, nothing special, but still decent. One of my friend's meal though was absolutely terrible. No seasoning whatsoever -- it was like they forgot that part. The coffee that was messed up in the first place, was $4 dollars each with no free refills, which just goes to show how expensive this place was.Overall, they just didn't really seem to care very much about our meal or experience. Very disappointing since I had heard good things. Will avoid this place if ever possible.","3 stars. First off, everyone but two people got their meals on time. The second meal came out 20 minutes later and then 40 mins later, we decided to cancel the other meal after it hadn't come since everyone has already finished their meals. Needless to say the service was not good. No one was apologizing and they didn't seem to be bothered by it. Usually I give pretty good reviews, and I usually check yelp, as I did for this place to see. So I was disappointed. The food was good, but I only got to eat half of it since I ended up letting my friend eat some of mine since his never came. It was truly disappointing. I have pics of the food. Also we ordered a size of home fries and they came after everyone was finished, as well as the dressing for a salad. Just not a good experience for my friends birthday and engagement brunch. Truly disappointed.",This place is awful. They blast music and bass all weekend with absolute disregard for the neighbors in the building.,"Drag Brunch was one of the best meals of my 32yrs! Misty and Petty were amazing hosts and put on an amazing show. The food was also excellent, I had the frittata and my friend enjoyed the empanadas. We both thoroughly enjoyed it.I would advise you to beware of the bottomless mimosas! They are fantastic and strong and the waitstaff hustle to keep them full, but it was easy to over indulge. Thankful my friend was there to keep on eye on me.Tip: Bring cash to tip the queens, they're working hard for that money and they'll definitely give you a fantastic show for a little extra incentive.","Service: FairQuantity: GoodCleanliness: GoodFood: Moqueca Mixta $33I met up with friends on a Labor Day weekend which they have posted at the front entrance Labor day special 20% off.  I was like yeah! Let's give it a try plus all the good reviews on Yelp.I ordered Moqueca Mixta which consists of Squid, shrimp, mussels, white fish, scallops, soybeans, Spanish chorizo, bacalao, green coconut rice, and achiote oil. I was expecting seafood fish stew not expected cooking in a heavy cream-based soup. It was a bit overpowering the taste of seafood. I felt I'm eating a mouthful of cream sauce in addition to cream-based green coconut rice. This dish is way too rich for my taste.When we ready to pay, we realized the 20% off was not offered, I guess you need to ask before they apply the discount. I used the Yelp discount instead. They currently have a yelp promo 20% off when you check in on Yelp. I'm not sure if I will return, but still, do encourage you to give it a try since the hanger steak my friend ordered looks really good.","Solid neighborhood restaurant.We started off with the octopus, it was good and spicy.The guacamole is a must...absolutely delicious, i was hesitant because cilantro is not my favourite spice and it was pre made with cilantro so i soldiered on and did not regret it.We then tried the empanadas (cheese and corn)...they were very good, a little sweet but it made sense with the dish. The table also had the lobster taquitos, one loved it, the other person was not crazy about the pineapple that was in it.Then we had the mocaquo (cant remember the name sorry) and this dish was so unexpected but yet so good...i didnt care for most of what was in it aside from the mussels and the shrimp but that sauce...omg...perfect combination of sweet and spicy and creamy and it was everything. The coconut rice made the dish a little on the sweet side but it was still delicious.I was full so didnt go for dessert but the cake with fruits seemed good.",La Pulperia UES
857,"Got the bacon maple grilled cheese, and it's your usual American greasy grilled cheese, which a twinge of sweeetness. Personally, way too greasy for me, and afterwards my stomach did not feel good, probably because of all the cheese. Felt this place was overhyped and honestly not worth it at all. Disappointed.","Saw the reviews and walked 20 mins just to try this place! ( we realized that it was a chain so we were a little more cautious about the place) to be honest... we got 2 sandwhiches, 1 order of tots and 1 milkshake.. all adding up to around 35$$$$ for the amount they give you, it is quite pricey. The food quality is alright but a little salty and overly greasy. Its worth a try but I wouldn't be too excited for this place!!!","Loved the fried chicken melt sandwich. The bread had a nice crunch to it while the fried chicken was both juicy and crispy.  The creamy cheese and dressy made this sandwich a winner.The weak side was the loaded tots. for ~$5, you didnt get a lot tots or cheese.  the sour pickled peppers were not a welcome addition. Unlike the sandwich, the tots were on the borderline of soggy and crispy. not the most enjoyable thing.","The melt shop was one for the books! I thought this would be an average restaurant but the food was really great. The food was very cheesy and flavorful and the milkshake was amazing as well. I got the nutella and buffalo chicken grilled cheese which I highly recommend. The location was a little tight and not much seating if you go during a busy time, but this place is in NYC. The upside was the line was fairly short and the food came pretty quickly. I think if you want something light and not heavy this may not be the place for you. But if you're looking for something delicious for cheat day or yummy milkshake, check this place out!","If Yelp had half stars, I probably would have given this 3.5 stars.  The positives are that the sandwiches here are fantastic.  The fried chicken sandwich and the burger patty melt are delicious.  They have great flavor and decent sized.For the negatives, it's pricey for what you get.  A sandwich and a small tater tots ends up being close to $14 (more if you get a drink).  That makes it too pricey of a place for it to be a lunch spot if you work near here.  The tater tots aren't anything special.  They taste like frozen tater tots with some tasteless Parmesan cheese on it.  They're not bad, but to be served a small portion like that for $3 plus is a bit of rip-off.  I wish Melt Shop would put french fries or onion rings on their menu for sides.  Not a bad place for a sandwich, but a little overpriced.  If you have MealPal and Meltshop comes up, definitely worth checking out as it will be worth it for that.","Every now and again, I like to treat myself to something unhealthy to cheer me up at work, and Melt Shop has been a regular go-to for me since it opened here.I don't know what changed, but in the last years or so the food quality here has dropped dramatically. The chicken especially is tough and stringy, I'm constantly pulling sinew and chicken-cyst out of my mouth. The last time I thought this was a one-off, but it's just happened again and I threw away half of my sandwich. This place attracts mostly tourists, and of course business don't care how bad their experience is, but as someone working just across the street, I feel like I have to cross off my treat-list.",Melt Shop
858,"Nice restaurant, good service and food. But, blaring  indiscriminate music in small space. So many restaurants critics criticize for too loud poor music why do restaurants still do it.Though neighbors we won't go back.","Nice classy bar, but one of the bartenders is a complete dick. I would give 4 stars if the bartender wasn't so terrible.I usually don't leave reviews to complain about a bad bartender, but this is an otherwise nice bar that I will avoid as a result, since apparently he's a regular / main bartender. I was here Fri night 7/14/2017:At first service was fine, I ordered a pair of drinks, they were okay, and I left a generous tip. Later I ordered another old fashioned, but after 20 minutes, it never came. I ordered it again, waited patiently at least another 20 minutes, still never came.Eventually I walked over to the other side of the bar and when the bartender came over to me, I said something like ""Dude I ordered a drink twice, it's been over 30 minutes, what happened?"" To which he responds ""Are you just going to complain, or are you going to order another drink?""No apology or explanation of any kind, just the most douchey possible response..Needless to say I told him to go fuck himself, and we went to another bar.. I generally have a lot of patience and understanding to bartenders, especially on a busy night. But that sort of utterly obnoxious treatment, after I had been nothing but respectful and reasonable and patient, and tipped generously, is inexcusable. If I ever do go there again, I will make sure to use the other bartender, or just give zero tip- something I have never done before..","Very slow service - got there on around 7pm on a weeknight a few weeks ago and we were directed to a table by the hostess, got our menus, and waited. And waited. And waited. It took almost 30 minutes to get someone to take our order, and that was after I needed to flag someone down to get his attention. Getting a second round of drinks was equally difficult. Seems like a place where if you aren't friendly with ownership they ignore you.Also, its LOUD. The design of the place amplifies sound - if it's even half full you'll be yelling at the person across from you to be heard. Won't be returning","Just visited Highlands. The food was impeccable. We got the beer brined chicken and the fingerling potatoes, both were absolutely amazing. It also had a very relaxing and laid back atmosphere which we really enjoyed. We went around 5pm. The service is great and I will definitely be back with more friends. If I had one desire, it would be that the music would sometimes have some traditional Scottish songs-- of course not necessary just something I would enjoy ! I was very happy to find this Scottish restaurant since I can't seem to find many others in New York. Thanks for a great dinner!","As a scotch lover, I had to try Highlands for a dram after having had dinner elsewhere in the area. We got a nice seat in the window next to the bar which was very cozy although overall it was quite noisy. To be honest, I wasn't overwhelmed by their selection of whiskies, especially Scotch. They have a down to earth cut of the most common varieties from the well known distilleries, but I had pretty much tried all of them over the years at various whisky bars around the world - disregarding some of the very expensive ones. Also, they had run out of some of the more unique and rare ones such as Edradour that evening, which was unfortunate. Finding something rare to try within an acceptable price range was not easy in this rather standard selection. There would be potential here, if they would branch out to other hot & upcoming areas such Tasmanian,Australian and New Zealand whisky and more independent distilleries.I also have to say that I'd expect a whisky bar to bring the whisky booklet right away, but not here - we had to ask for it. To me, that's a sign that they are more catering for the general bar audience than trying to be a specialized whisky bar - too bad. Overall, Highlands is surely a nice bar to hang out if you don't mind the noise level, and surely a good starting point if you want to get into whisky, but if you're really into whisky, don't expect too much.","Love love love this bar. My husband and I found this place on the last day of our vacation while we were in New York City earlier this year. He had been searching for Haggis and this place came up so we decided to get it a try. I'm so glad we did! We got there early afternoon on a Saturday, and were the only ones at the bar for a little bit.My husband loved the haggis, and from the bite that I tried, I liked it too. I ordered the chicken sandwich with chips, and it was just as good.  Our bartender, Adam, was really nice and talked to us throughout our entire lunch. Any questions that we had, he was more than happy to answer them. My husband enjoyed the scotch/beers that he tried, and my cocktails were some of the best I've ever had.

859,"I normally don't bother to write bad reviews, but this server made me mad beyond words. After food arrived, he came by literally every 5 minutes asking how it's going. He interrupted my conversation 20 times and in the end asked if we are ""taking a last bite?"" meaning he wanted us to finish eating. Were were hardly there 1 hour. It was a busy night and they let people in waiting, even it was clear they have no tables. People stood crowded over our heads. The server came and took our plates away, NOT asking if we are done. We were NOT done. The most disgusting experience I have ever had in my life. Clearly it came from the top management. Don't go there if you want to have good time, not even if you want to have a normal time.Not to mention that place is over priced, very noisy and food is average to say the least.","Pretty eh meal. The service wasn't great (took a while to get a water) and not particularly friendly. The food itself was mediocre. -The avocado toast was the best. It was over nice toast and the cucumber was refreshing. The pistachio was also a nice touch-Beet salad: nothing special-Asparagus soup: not so good. Didn't really have anything going for it-Lamb: small portion of lamb and very fatty. The peas it was over didn't have any flavor.-The burger was pretty good, but tasted like a McDonald's burgerReally nothing special","Really downhill over the past year or so.  Met a buddy there for dinner on a Tuesday night and everything was ""meh.""  Giving it three stars because I had better experiences in the past.  The issues:- The restaurant was hot and humid.- Our server was very inattentive in general and also just didn't bring my friend's second drink.- Broccolini was awesome.- Buddy said the scallop was solid.- My steak was ... weird.  Partially on me for not reading the menu more carefully, but it came doused in some kind of salty, uninteresting sauce that smothered the flavor of the steak.  Strange, disappointing approach to a $38 steak.","Wow! This place is still amazing! As farm to table as it gets in nyc. We love the friendly vibe this place puts off. So welcoming and you want to be here. Our bartender was great and our server was also perfect tonight! A great menu with so many fresh dishes you will have trouble figuring out what to order. The clam strip salad was unbelievable as was the burrata. For our dinners the special black bass over all these amazing vegetables, a cod fish that was perfect and the chicken which also was amazing. The crispy zucchini , which we can't figure out how they made it, was crisp and meaty, not the slightest bit mushy. Desserts were also perfectly executed! It's so great to see such consistency in a restaurant after so many years! Go here for an amazing meal!","TalkAbout local and fresh? Talk about great service?Taste a wine before you buy? Flavors right off the farm? This is the place. I love market table. Salads are great, but make sure you order all the sides. they are so yummy from mint and almond green beans, to some of the best corn off the Cobb you will want to savor them all. Main courses you can't go wrong no matter what you choose. Great fish chicken and beef. I had a lemon pound cake with fresh cherries and it was a hit.","Six of us had dinner at Market Table last night and it was really disappointing. The food was great and it was STILL disappointing, which says a lot about disorganization, poor service and noise. We had a reservation for six. As we arrived, we could see a table for six (essentially three two-tops pushed together) set up at one end of the room. As the last of our party came in, they seated a party of two at one end of what was clearly the table meant to be reserved for us. We waited. They seated a party of four at the rest of ""our"" table. We waited. We were finally ushered to a four-top and shoe-horned into it. The three men could barely fit on one side and my brother-in-law was practically falling off of one end of the table. Meanwhile, my sister. myself and my stepmother were crammed into the banquet on the other side.  There was no way in the space to put a chair on the end.We waited. No bread, no service. Someone took a wine order, but still no wait person to tell us specials or take an order, or even bring us some bread. Finally, we practically had to tackle a random waiter to ask for bread for the table. Our wait person brought us a tiny plate with FOUR pieces of bread on it and a minuscule vessel of olive oil that was so small you could barely dip the bread in it. We had to share this tiny thing of olive oil by passing it around along with the bread, that we had to tear into tiny pieces so that everyone was able to get some. It was like some weird religious ritual rather than dinner in a (let's face it) expensive restaurant. We finally got to order food, and when it came it was good. At these prices, it ought to be. Fresh, check Tasty, check. Interesting flavor combinations, check. Beautifully presented -- not so much. Someone in the kitchen seems to think that dumping a piece of fish on top of a bunch of salad constitutes artful presentation. It doesn't. The plates were kind of a mess. Nevertheless, the place gets a few points for things tasting good.The noise level was another story. The restaurant was so loud that we couldn't hear each other even though we were packed in like sardines. However, the cacophonous noise level probably does this restaurant a favor as it prevents diners from complaining to one another about how badly they are being treated, and fomenting general rebellion.We had really been looking forward to this dinner and were seriously disappointed in our experience. This restaurant needs to pay some attention to basic management and customer service issues.",Market Table
860,I went there for the sundaes.They were very nice.The attendant was very pleasant.I will return for sure.,"This spot has been on my radar for a while, with their comfort food like burger and shakes. One weekend, we were nearby and looking for a place to eat, so we decided to check this place out.Inside was spacious, and since it was between lunch and dinner rush, it was nice and quiet. The décor was kind of vintage, with the simple black and white colors, shiny metallic, and some old, classic items on display.We ordered Chicken and Bacon Waffle to share. The portion was nice and big, with two fried chicken pieces on top of the sweet and soft waffle. The chicken was moist and tasty, but the bacon was horrible. The bacon pieces were so tough, we couldn't chew it off. We left the bacons on the plate, as they were not edible... The cheesy sauce was just a-ok, I wanted more kick to it.We also ordered Strawberry Shorty shake. It said that it is topped with a slice of strawberry shortcake, which I also saw on many photos from here. When it arrived, slice of strawberry shortcake was missing. When we inquired about it to our server, she said that they don't do that anymore, since they put them around the glass... Wait, they are crushed cookies, not shortcake... She said she can give us a cookie instead, and went back to the kitchen. Then, she cane back with, guess what? Slice of shortcake!!! Well, it was actually a slice of small pound cake. Seems that the kitchen staff forgot to put that on top, and the server didn't know that it was forgotten... The shake itself was good, but the strawberry that came with it was very sour, which was disappointing.Overall, this place did not live up to my expectation. The food was a-ok, mainly because of the horrible bacon. The shake was just a-ok, mainly because we had to work hard to get everything we ordered. The price tag didn't match the experience, nor the quality.",I had the jumbo chicken wings and it's damn good. I recommend this to anyone passing through 9th avenue.,"RUN, DONT WALK TO MOMS! They greet you by saying ""welcome home"" which is the cutest thing ever. They play cartoons every time I'm having brunch. The menu is AMAZING, super creative & I've never been disappointed.  If you don't like their extravagant options then you can make your own breakfast platter. The chicken and waffles are TO DIE FOR, I get the sauces in the side. The Texas Benedict is everything you need, Texas toast, brisket that melts in your mouth & coleslaw with pickled jalapeños. Their home fries are half regular half sweet potato. The only dish that's disappointed me is the steak and eggs because the steak was very fatty. I've been three times in the past two weeks. seriously, go!","One of the best places in HK to get comfort food and booze. We came here to get some greasy, fun food to soak up the booze after various happy hour spots in HK. Mom's is one of those places where you can go to get the party started or keep the party going. In addition to my Frisky Brisket, I went for one of the Big Ass Cocktails, which was served in a mini pitcher. I'm not a huge fan of sugary drinks, but the waitress allowed me to modify the beverage to my liking. Our waitresses (I do not know how or why we had two) were very energetic and had HUGE personalities. Oh, I remember why we had two. I think one of the waitresses was actually a manager who was helping out the other waitress.","Visited Mom's for a quick breakfast date with my best friend before her bus left from Port Authority. The wait was quick about 10 minutes and we were seated inside toward the back tables where cushioned seats lined the wall.She ordered the black bean veggie burger with fries which she said was good however, the burger was just a tad under seasoned. I had the cheesy grits and shrimp - very tasty and well seasoned! Grits were on the thicker side (if you're into that) still good just a little thicker than I was used to. Overall: cute spot, service and food was good, and our waitress was pretty attentive. There were some flies/gnats flying around once our food arrived. A little annoying to say the least but we were wrapping up at that point. I'd come back for their boozy brunch and perhaps to try dinner! Hopefully there will be less flying insect activity next time as well.",Mom's Kitchen & Bar
861,"I am shocked by the ratingThis place does not live up to the price that it charges as well as the rating it gotWe came on a Friday night and it was pretty empty, which is unusual given the location.  My partner was excited to have me try the beef shank wrap, which he had couple years ago and it was good.  It wasn't on the menu so we asked and the server looked at us like we're crazy and said he's never heard of it or seen it.  We showed him the photo ON YELP of this location and he said that's not our restaurant.  Definitely make us feel awful.  Until his associate came and said it wasn't available anymore.  If you don't know, you can just askWe ordered the beef short rib ($18), the chicken wrap, the chicken version of what we wanted...so technically it was available($8.5) and the chilled beef shank. ($8)The shank came first and it was so flavorless.  The beef had a slight funky gritty taste.  Almost likemeat gone bad.  And the chili oil...bland, no heat...nothing.  We were looking for something, flavor, just balance.  We asked for hot chili sauce, our server said chili oil? No, sauceGuess what, we got spicy mayo...what kind of asian place don't have hot sauce or chili sauce?! We tried the chicken wrap and it was so coated in peanut sauce, it was almost gross.  The sauce was pretty much 80% peanut butter and 20% other ingredients. The chicken felt dried and it was just messy eatsThe short ribs, which is sous vide, taste like just beef, which a slight hint of five spice and herbs....but....still...nothingSuper disappointed in this meal and for 30$ I expected better and more authentic.  I'm actually insulted that I paid 30+ on this meal.",We were here around 2pm and all the employees were sitting at the table and chatting very loud. They were still there chatting very loud after we seated until we had to tell the waiter If they can lower the voice. The food was great but the service and environment were not.,We went here on memorial day. Ordered the braised beef noodle soup and the scallions oil noodles. The noodle soup is good but we prefer the scallions oil noodles. Authentic tastes. We will probably try the scallion pancake next time.,"OH. MY. GOODNESS.I STILL DREAM ABOUT THIS PLACE!!! So I'm visitin mg from Orange County during the summer. The east coast is hot and humid. I know NY has an amazing food rep, so I had to try their asian food! I looked up chinese noodles and went to this place. My friends and I walked over in miserable heat and humidity and ordered the garlic pork dumplings, beef brisket noodles, drunken noodles, and oxtail noodles. Seriously! Omg! First, the dumplings! They were soooooooooooo good that it brought a tear to my eye! Even when I was full from my noodles, that last dumpling made me soo happy! Second, the noodles for the drunken noodles were great! Good texture, very spicy and you can really taste the chili. Third, the oxtail soup broth was the clearest thing I've ever had! It was so clean!!!!!! You got great flavor, but no oil or fat! SO GOOD. Lastly, the brisket noodles were delicious! I'm not good with spicy stuff, but this was a good mild in my opinion. The broth was good too! They are very generous with the meat. Even though I was sweaty by the end of it all, i will definitely come back here next time I visit!",Came here for dinner few months ago. It's a small eatery but comfortable space between tables.  Waiters are very friendly and attentive.  I ordered the Drunk Noodles.  The broth is very taste and I love the texture of the noodles and not over cooked.  Beef is tender and juicy with good portion to feel satisfied.Definitely come back again to try more dishes!,"Came here on a whim for dinner one night, and overall really enjoyed the experience! Service was fast and they were always refilling our waters and very attentive. I opted for the chicken soup with ramen noodles, and the person I came with got the Beef noodle soup. I personally liked the Chicken soup more, because it came with so much soup, chicken, and noodles, that I felt it was more worth the price ($15). The Taiwanese beef noodle soup is also good, but I found the beef hard to chew and the broth could have been thicker/more meatier and more flavorful. But all in all, it was a really satisfying meal and a pleasant experience.",The Tang - East Village
862,The dumplings I ordered were dried out and tasted old. The dough was chewy and rubbery. I ordered the chicken and vegetable and both were barely edible.,"I've always loved this place. I would order take out on a weekly basis for lunch. I recently recommended it to my Sis-in-law because she was in town. She said the food was delicious but for some reason she was seated all the way at the back of the restaurant by the bathroom even though the restaurant wasn't busy. She's African American, other people came in after, that weren't African American were seated at the front. The only reason this became an issue was because she was bitten multiple times by something that was located where she was seated. What a shame..... I can't recommend a place that treats you differently based off the color your skin and has a bug problem.","Ordered take out - wonton soup, sesame chicken and pork lo mien. Delivery came SO fast, chicken was still crispy, lo mien really tasty. Will definitely be ordering take out from here going forward.","Food: Amazingly good food! We were recommended by a friend to check this place out and we were not disappointed! All the dishes we tried were perfectly cooked and flavorful! My favorite dishes included the hot pot made with szechuan peppercorns adding a very nice kick to the broth. The spare ribs were also excellent which brought some nostalgia with the taste of char siu. The shrimp were jumbo sized and oooh so tender. Cannot go wrong with any of their dishes! Drinks: We did not explore their drinks though I saw others order a couple of cocktails that looked very yummy! They offer some wines and beer as well!Service: Very attentive and friendly staff from the minute we walked in and throughout our stay. They would be very quick on refilling our waters and checking on us every couple minutes. Vibes: Surprised at the upscale and classy interior which I did not expect coming from a chinese restaurant. The background jazz music and the hip pig themed decor is very unique to other chinese restaurants and even to the UES. Great for small or bigger groups, or even great for first or second dates. The atmosphere is not loud at all so you can enjoy eating and conversing without having to yell!","I was recommended to try restaurant recently by some trusted people in the food community. This establishment has quite a history and has been a fixture in NYC for quite some time. Pig Heaven is very upscale in my opinion and it is very apparent by the decor, the ambience and of course the quality of food.  The staff was very friendly. Extra points if you are fluent in Mandarin Chinese but if you are not they can communicate very effectively in English. As the name of the restaurant implies, they specialize in pork dishes but other options as well. I came with a guest and we came prepared to eat!  For the starters we got the Chicken Soong (minced cooked chicken) you can eat with crisp lettuce pieces and the ever popular Shanghai Soupy Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao). The chicken was flavorful and it was a new experience eating it like that with lettuce.  The soupy dumplings were delicious... full of soup and pork goodness. There were many more options for the appetizers but it was only myself and a special guest. So we had to save room for the main course!The main entree options were all so tempting. What was recommended for us to try was the classic barbecue pork ribs and another dish I was initially unsure of called Tomato and Tofu Soup. Initially.  But they were recommended by someone who was very knowledgeable about the food in this restaurant. Now the pork ribs arrived at our table glazed to perfection and these were what I consider might sized ribs for a Chinese establishment (compared to the standard take out ribs that people are familiar with). Regarding the soup...my guest and I were blown away at how savory and good it was!  The flavors worked well together as there was thinly sliced beef (similar to what is usually ordered for Korean bbq) and pickled peppers. The restaurant was steadily busy from the moment we entered and left. The pricing may be put off for some but I would definitely recommend this place for any special occasion dinner or any special ""just because"" meal. The whole experience was excellent overall at Pig Heaven.","First time having authentic Chinese food and Pig Heaven was an adorable option with it's decor of pig plaques all over the walls and a colorful pig painting. The plaques were a good way of letting customers write their experience there. I went with a group of people and we all thought the decor went perfectly with the name especially the flying pig. I thought it felt pretty spacious and not too cramped and noise level was at a perfect level.Food wise we started with the steamed seafood dumplings and popcorn shrimp. Steamed seafood dumplings were pretty good especially with the four different sauces it came with, but the popcorn shrimp was amazingg! It had a hint of wasabi and that gave it a very interesting taste. Would definitely order again. For entrees we decided to try the Hotpot fish fillets w. mixed veggies which was presented in a creative dish. This was really good but I would have preferred it to be more spicy with a bit more flavor. And lastly we tried the Steamed fish fillets w. diced red peppers which was one of my favorites as the fish was so soft and flavor was just enough. Also all of the fish entrees we tried were flounder fish.Service here was also Good we had the waiter checking up on us frequently, refilling our waters, and patiently explaining menu items to us. Overall it was a pleasant experience.",Pig Heaven
863,"I will fully admit, this is going to sound like such a useless review but......it's literally just chicken pieces in a waffle cone. Maybe I got the wrong idea about this place?  Maybe I didn't do enough research?  The chicken itself was good! Tender chunks breaded and fried, served hot. The buffalo sauce was tangy and hot.  But the waffle cone was a disappointment.  For some reason, I was expecting a softer and less sweet waffle. But this was just straight out of an ice cream shop cone. Not as impressed as I thought I would be, but still try it out of chicken and cones are your thing!","I visited Chick'nCone for the first time last Saturday around 5:00pm. Chick'nCone wasn't busy, but the food hall was. Chick'nCone is in the food hall. If you have never been to the food hall before then you might get lost/get confused. I followed Google maps and it kept showing me that I was next to it, but I didn't see it. I followed some signs towards the food hall and voila! The food hall is downstairs next to the subway turnstiles.I ordered the Chick'nCone with Kick'nRanch sauce. The waffle was delicious. The chicken was crispy and the sauce was saucy. My only complaint is that the chicken to waffle isn't 1 for 1. Personally, I'd like to have some chicken when I near the end of the waffle. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. I was left eating 30% of waffle with no chicken left.","100% overhyped, chicken should probably not be in a cone just my opinion after trying this tho.With Ritual I got a discount so it was worth it but I dunno if I'd pay full price for this unless I was really craving fried chicken or was taking a break from ice cream hah","Do you like Waffle Cones? Do you like Fried Chicken? If you do, this place is definitely a place for you to check out. Their menu is pretty self-explanatory so no confusions there. Their location is in the Turnstyle market - sort of like the urbanspace vanderbilt area, but instead of some warehouse, it's in the Columbus Circle train station. My Go-to right now is the traditional BBQ sauce. The amount of chicken they give you is more than enough for me for lunch and it also helps that you can eat on the go. Overall, a great lunch experience and I definitely recommend this place.","A clutch snack found in the Turnstile Underground, and doesn't feel overwhelmingly touristy! Crispy, crunchy, hot, tasty chicken with the perfect ratio of sauce to chicken to waffle. I believe what makes or breaks the chicken itself is the sauce you choose. The one to get here is the Kick'n Ranch, which has a slight spice to it. We also ordered the Buffalo Blue and Traditional BBQ, but these felt as if they had a little less thought to and wow-factor them. As for the cone, it was decent (but I'll be honest, the exact details of it have faded my memory!)Went on a Saturday afternoon, and there was no line. This place whips out the chicken cones fairly quickly, so I don't see wait time being an issue here. Service was good, and the cashier was friendly and willing to offer recommendations.Portion sizes were reasonable for the price, being in NY. Definitely made to share amongst 2 people per cone...Gimme chicken that's even more juicy and I'm there, and gimme an iced cold beer to pair with it and I'm there. But I'll end with this, this place is a solid 4 and worth the stop if you're passing through NY.","I have been to the Turnstile Underground a few times and trying Chick'N Cone was about due. They have a simple menu of chicken bites inserted into a sweet waffle cone with your choice of sauces. After some contemplation, I decided to order the ""Kick'n Ranch"" flavor.  I got a healthy portion of chicken pieces  inside a cone, drenched in a sauce, yummy, but licking your fingers in public is a NoNo!They give a foil covering for the cone so you don't make a mess and keep the chicken pieces from falling out.My friend ordered the spicy sauce and we traded pieces and it certainly is real spicy though not overbearing. The foil covering the cone kept the final pieces together as everything didn't stayed intact.I really like the moist chicken and the ranch was flavorful. If this is your first time visiting Turnstile Underground and want something for on the go I would highly recommend it, and they got Cajun Fries too. Just remember that it's supposed to be forkless food, and I use a fork for pizza but the chicken is finger size, by they have toothpicks if you want to get the last bits of chicken from your cone.The Sauces are ;Kick'n RanchYella BBQ     ( mustard )Traditional BBQCinna MapleBuffalo Blue    (has some blue cheese)Peri Peri   ( African Chili )The staff was friendly and willing to give recommendations. Definitely a must-try if you're ever in the area of 59 and Columbus Circle.",Chick'nCone
864,"I don't typically yelp, but when you mark up a bottle of wine 350% you just feel robbed. Cool vibe, but not worth that Tom foolery.Edit: the hostesses (yes both) had an attitude and our waiter left without checking on our table or explaining his shift switch, just found that rude and unprofessional. Take this how you may.","Worst experience ever - Don't GoIf you are looking for a terrible customer experience this is definitely the right restaurant to go! I had a terrible dinner (in a group of 15 people) due the poor Knowledge of basic math from our waitress. She reviewed the bill 3 times and at the end asked me for more money, saying it was missing 15 USD. The manager nothing did to solve the situation and actually put all the responsibility on me instead of understanding the scenario and finding a reasonable solution. Waiter/Waitress are responsible for 100% of bill's accuracy AND NOT the client. Bad service. Poor staff. You guys definitely are not prepared to attend any type of customer.","Grossly overpriced and small tacos for $16. Please feed your people. Lesson learned,  research the place before going in!!","The bar room is a very nice, quaint square room with a ton of natural light, a high glass ceiling, and seating all along the perimeter with smaller tables in the center. It has a surprisingly intimate and quiet atmosphere for being in such a busy part of midtown, and that's the main reason why I'd recommend checking it out if you're in the area. As for food, I highly recommend the lobster roll for lunch and definitely check out the burger if you're having dinner.","The Bar Room is a very pleasant gastropub. I went with family, which included kids, and we sat upstairs on the second floor.  This top floor, despite still having a bar, was the quieter more family friendly location. Service was awesome.  Our waiter was friendly and efficient.  The food was great, too.  I got a glazed salmon and highly recommend it.  The buffalo cauliflower appetizer was very tasty and I'd also recommend that. I'll be back!","This place beat my expectations. I didn't know what to expect. Service was great and the food was as well. Didn't order any drinks as we had plans to go to a comedy club where we will be drinking a bit. But this place seems like it would be a great spot for happy hour and/ or after work drinks. We ordered the chicken nachos for the 2 of us the server said it usually is enough for 4. Boy was he right. Good thing we didn't order anything else or we would've wasted food. Anyways, not sure if I would come here again to eat, but I would probably go for drinks. Oh yea, the only negative about this place is that during the summer time they blast the ac like you're in an igloo. Be prepared.",The Bar Room
865,Awful eggs Benedict with prosciutto. Tasted like cardboard heated up in the microwave. Really bad service. Packed on a Sunday and just overall not worth it. Coffee was bad. Just overall a horrible experience. This is the second time I go and it's just so bad each time. I really don't understand its poularity.,"I absolutely had the worst experience of my life at this restaurant.  I came here for valentines day dinner and saw a mouse under our table.  I couldn't believe my eyes because I have lived in NYC for 4 years and go out to eat often and not once have a seen a mouse in let alone one 5 inches away from me while eating.  I told my boyfriend about the mouse and he saw one about 3 minutes after so I am not sure if there were 1 or 2.  Since it was valentines day I did not cause a scene and privately told the host there was a mouse.  They moved us to the front of the restaurant and offered us a free cocktail and dessert.  Instead we wanted the check and all they took off was one appetizer. It is not about the money, but I think this was handled completely wrong and I will never return here and I don't recommend anyone else to either.","I was pretty disappointed with the brunch prix fixe menu. For the main course, I ordered the eggs benedict and substituted the prosciutto with creamed spinach as a vegetarian alternative. The spinach had an unexpected sharp, tangy taste that I couldn't pin and it wasn't pleasant. The hollandaise was pretty bland and skimpy. Rule No. 151 Thou shalt never skimp on the hollandaise. Poached eggs were done hard, so there went any last hopes of sauce for my dry English muffin. The star of the show was the pizetta from the first course. It was a dainty pizza with buffalo mozzarella. The risotto croquette was interesting, but not something I'd revisit. Overall, meh.","Really good italian food in W. Village. Also, they looked like they were the busiest restaurant around the area for happy hour. Service is great and food is pretty good. Happy hour drinks are pretty cheap but the food choices for happy hour weren't that great and they weren't that cheap either. The restaurant has great ambience with a little patio in the back and decorated with plants. Very cute and beautiful.We tried calamari and lasagna which can't go wrong, and cheese plate which was a bit small but still good. I hope I can come back for other pasta entrees like the eggplant which looked pretty interesting. Service is great as well. Friendly staff!","Had the most amazing lasagna.  In fact, it was the best I have ever had in my life.  Please don't tell my Italian MIL this!   We were promptly seated with our reservation.  Friendly service and comfortable seating.  The sangria was nothing to write home about.  However, who cares when your pasta dish is this delicious!!!!","We came here to look at the place to potentially use for an event.We walked in and we were able to get seated quickly in the outdoor patio. They've utilized the space well.We ordered and waited and the tables next to us got their food finished and got their checks and we still were waiting on our food. The waitress told us she was sorry, but there was a mix up of the orders. We got the croquettes, they were a bit overdone, but overall good. Didn't think too much of it. But, then the burger and fries came.  The burger was good. I didn't get the egg on it.  It is a good quality burger.The fries were extra burnt. At this point, we were just ready to go, so we didn't mention it, but we left a plate of burnt fries, maybe ate 40%of it.I'll give it to the waitress, she gave us a glass of OJ to say ""sorry."" But, I think they had a staffing issue or just plum forgot our order. We spent 1.5 hrs there.Overall, I am not sure if we would return, but that's due to the slow service and the fries. The true score is 3.5 stars, I gave them a 4, couldn't give them a 3.",Baker & Co
866,"Solid place to grab a quick bite in Chelsea Market. I got the mushroom pita, and the mushrooms are delicious! The pita is also the fluffiest pita I may have ever had, and it had a really delicious sauce inside.","Excellent.Got the intimate plate, the bag of green beans (it's a big bag!), and the self-proclaimed famous cauliflower.The cauliflower was good, but it wasn't as charred as I hoped on the outside and the inside was mushy.The green beans were chilled with olive oil and coarse sea salt. The latter which I wished I could get in each bite.The intimate plate had beef that was incredibly tender. Carrots, sauce, and salsa were tasty. Pita could've been warm.But overall, well done Miznon! I'll def be returning.","If you haven't tried the folded burger pita, you're not living. I was around Chelsea Market late night roaming around looking for dinner. I'd heard good things about Miznon, and figured I'd give it a shot. I was wavering between the rotisserie chicken pita and the burger pita, and ultimately chose the burger to go. 45min of train delays later, I finally got home and opened my room temp burger.1. I was not expecting this enormous wedge of fried cheese sticking 6in out of my pita2. It's big (not upset)3. It was incredibly delicious4. The ground beef was especially flavorful - tried to research where they source it from?I feel blindsided by how delicious it was, and I'm pumped to go back to try more of the menu.","Came here after watching a food review of this place on Youtube. We got ratatouille, folded cheese burger and lamb kebab, all in the pita. Everything was very good, my personal favorite is folded cheese burger - it's a bite of new york cheese burger and middle eastern cuisine combo, delicious! The pita was like a cloud, but I do wish the pita was warmer when served. We came on a Sat during lunch time, the long was a bit long and so was the wait.","Best Mediterranean burger? Best burger variation? Whatever category the sandwiches here fall under, it's going to dominate.A must have is the folded cheese burger, and the minute steak sandwich isn't far behind.The folder cheese burger has everything a traditional burger comes with but with the additional of a sexy cheese skirt. Also the fluffy pita is really an amazing bun alternative. The best part is you don't feel heavy or groggy after. The minute steak, so much tender meat stuffed into a fluffy pita. I ate both and could've went for a third. Both sandwiches were flavorful and light. Also hands together for the kitchen staff, everyone doing their thing and dishing out great food at lightning speeds. I really can't wait to come back. It may be my new favorite sandwich in NY.","i walk in without any expectation but there was a line and the menu does looks appealing in a way. i wasn't too hungry so I don't expect anything much either, but this place took me by surprise and i love it more for that. apparently they sell pita sandwiches. I got the ratatouille pita which is filled with egg, eggplant, and various sauces. it definitely didn't taste like regular ratatouille but who cares, perhaps it just got the name because it containes tomato-ey eggplant. despite of tasting completely different, what matters is it tastes delicious! i really enjoy it! what blows me away even more though was their pita bread! the pita bread has an amazing pillowy texture that is light, pleasantly chewy (not hard, just perfect bite), springy, and honestly I was so in love with the pita bread and it goes so well with the pita. to my surprise they gave us a free wild mushroom pita!!! i'd say this one has an Asian flavor to it with garlic, pepper, scallions, and the mushroom was perfectly cooked so it gives nice texture. i might have enjoyed this even better than the ratatouille but both are good!also tried the batata which are just baked sweet potato but it tasted simply amazing. there's not much modification or seasoning or anything, just pure old simple delicious roasted sweet potato that becomes super soft in texture and sweet, served with really fresh sour creamas if that wasn't enough one of the chefs suddenly come up to us (we were sitting at the bar) and offered us a small piece of chicken pita. it was great too. chicken pieces was tender and not greasy or heavily flavored hence it felt pleasantly light. however i still prefer the vegetarian fillings (really just personal preferences)it's reasonably priced. top notch service. i am in love with this place",Miznon
867,"Not Korean food, more like Asian fusion health food Pros:Good priceHealthyLots of vegan options!Nice serviceCons:Artistry lacking Not AuthenticFlavor was just okaySmallerOverall I would defiantly not call this Korean food.","In my opinion the food here is simply great. It's extremely well priced (my suspicion is their rent is very low because of the block they're on). The menu is set up in a way that makes it very easy for vegans, vegetarians or pescatarians to eat - though there are a bunch of meat options too.","It's been our favorite place, especially for bibimbap since 2015! But today's visit left us feeling disappointed to say the least... first - it took like 20 minutes for waiter to give us water and drinks.. and restaurant was empty. Also they changed the menu and bibimbap we got was lacking flavor, and when I asked where is the fried garlic, which we ordered as an additional topping, waiter told me - it's inside. Haven't found it though... still got charged for it. Missing the old Dotory :( kimchi and anchovies were amazing. The rest - disappointing","This is my favorite spot it williamsburg. Its so cute and cozy, perfect for a casual date. I love the servers, they are always kind and helpful.My go-to order is the kimchi, the bok choy, the japche noodles, and  sometimes  the vegan boa buns.This place is great for vegans and meat eaters.","This is my number one lunch special place in Williamsburg. Amazing lunch bowl for only $11, I come here at least once a week. Cozy place and very nice servers.","Pretty cutesy spot in Brooklyn, didn't expect it to be so cutesy but hey I really liked the vibe. I ordered their Kimchi fried rice and dukbokki, and was pleasantly surprised by both. They both tasted better than most of the same dishes I get at other places. The kimchi fried rice had a lot of savory flavor in it when sometimes the dish can come off as sort of bland at other places. The salad really complimented the dish as well. The dukbokki also was very spicy but to the point where it was delicious and not overbearing. I also loved the texture of it as it wasn't too soft or too hard, as some places can make it too much work to chew. It took a really long time for us to get the food though, which was disappointing, but the waiter did say that they were working on a big order, so it's understandable.",Dotory
868,The owner is nice and the place is homey. The prices are also reasonable for Manhattan. As for the food I thought it was about 3 stars - not bad but not great either.,"I have to say, they started out well.  Nice glass of wine, great appetizer.  I ordered bip bim bap with clams.  I forgot about the clams, and there weren't any.  I told the waiter at the end of the meal, I thought the dish was missing something.  He was into his chat at the bar and was unconcerned.  On my way out, I looked at the menu and realized my dish was supposed to have clams.  I asked him about it, he said they were in the sauce.....I didn't see nor taste any clams.  Too bad , really disappointing.  If he waiter had appeared a little concerned, perhaps I would not be so harsh.  Then again m y entree just plain sucked.  $18 for a bowl of greens, barley and don't forget the fried egg!","This was not a great restaurant. The only reason it gets two stars is because it was clean and the staff was generally friendly. I had to continually ask for more water. And it was not like the place was crowded - they only had one person working the floor. Our order came out completely backwards. Our entrees came out prior to our appetizers. All of the food was just OK. the bulgogi was very fatty and not even that hot. The chicken wings were not well done and the flavor was...interesting? The spicy ramen was horrible. They used freeze dried shrimp and calamari which is absolutely disgusting. The mussels had a very strong sea flavor - which they should not if they are fresh. It truly looked like the microwavable ramen noodles (I wouldn't be surprised if this is what they used). Our waitress completely forgot one of the menu items. But, since we did not enjoy the food we didn't even bother to ask about it. Definitely skip this place.","I've been to this place twice for dinner (about 1.5 years apart) and my experience both times have been great. The owner was very friendly and knowledgeable and passionate about wines. For drinks we had this mango moscato and it was fantastic. I couldn't drink enough of it. We tried a red that was introduced to us and while I'm not big on red wine, the one the owner had us try was very good as well.As for food, we had the thin cut beef and spicy pork, both gomi style (which adds cheese and iirc rice noodle). They were both really good. The spicy pork was not as spicy as other Korean dishes I've had at other restaurants, which I for one appreciate. It's strange that this place was practically empty both times I've gone for dinner. The food is delicious, the wine selection is extensive, and the owner was very welcoming and accommodating. Definitely an underrated place.","My friend and I ended up here after trying to dine at Thursday Kitchen.  The area has a plethora of Korean fusion places.  So Gomi is really just a restaurant with good wine and different plates that consist of Brazilian and Korean dishes.  No actual melding.  So the layout almost reminds me of a Izakaya and the tables are cool with the slight organic charm.  The bar has lots of cool selections.  However, I didn't like how my friend and I were seated at the end of a huge table that was a big ruckus.  It made it difficult to have a conversation. The wine selection is the highlight.  I originally wanted to order the St. Tropez rose, but was disappointed told they were out.  The owner later brought another rose from Provence that was very nice.  For small bites we ordered the pao de quejo, the cheese plate, and the beef brisket wraps.  The cheeses were alright, the pao de quejo was good, but the beef brisket wrap was so uncomfortably hard to chew and my jaw did quite a workout.  I felt as if they were small bites for a homo sapien.  No flavour or tender bites.  Also I wish there could have been some sort of sauce applied to complement the beef.  All in all, my curiosity has subsided and in the future I would only come back for their wine selection or brunch I've heard other yelpers mention.  The waitress who served us could also have had more tact instead of interrupting our conversation.  My rating is a 3.5.","I don't know why this place was so empty when I went with my friend for brunch on a Saturday, but their brunch deals are amazing! $10 for a mimosa (or coffee) + entree, which are mainly Korean dishes or Korean fusion. They had a mango + prosecco drink today as another option instead of a mimosa (also included in the $10 deal) that was great too.My only comment is that the food was a little underseasoned-I got the bulgogi, and it could have used more salt or soy sauce in its marinade. Otherwise, the portion size was good for lunch and the mango mimosa was great!",Gomi Korean Wine Bar
869,Food exceptional7/15/19Excellent service from the bartender assistant on the floorCheck your prices carefully.  Almost got overcharged 7 dollats,"I came in with friends for dinner on Chinese New Year for some slightly ironic dinner. The selection for happy hour is pretty boring, with very common beers available and low level wine. I ordered the white sangria, which is meh. Our group shared the bacon tasting to start, it is two slices of each- pecanwood smoke, maple, pepper and jalapeno. It was nothing particularly special. For my entree, I ordered the Barbacon Burger, the burger patty was flavorless and the bacon on it was a thick slab, completely impossible to eat within the burger. The pickles come on the side and you have to pick around pieces of onion to get to them. The ""BarBacon seasoned"" fries are just fries with too much Old Bay seasoning and are too salty to eat. Others in the group I came with had been to the other Bar Bacon location and were annoyed that the menu was different and they were disappointed that the food was so bad.Oh and the bacon cannoli is disgusting!!! Don't order it and you will thank me.","HOLY F@CKB@LLZ THE LAMB REUBEN!!!actually... everything is amazing!I cannot say enough good things about this place.  Brett was a great waiter and helped us pick excellent food (did I mention the Reuben? The bacon is, of course, awesome... but those bacon infused Bloody Marys?!?? Woot!This. Place. Is. Great!!!!","This place is an absolute dream come true!! I am a bacon lover. They have a bacon! Flight! A match made in heaven. Their sweet frozé only made me fall deeper in love.Our waiter was an absolute champ. Took amazing care of us and was very patient. Didn't catch his name, but he was a young guy with a beard and we cherished him. In addition to our plate o bacon we got the Mac and cheese, 50/50 sliders, and the pulled pork sandwich. Oh yeah, and another whole plate of bacon because we wanted to try the honey mustard one. I also ordered the Bloody Mary which was honestly pretty underwhelming. Skip it. Ok, on to the food though. Bacon was everything we wanted. The sliders are pricy but a decent size (you get two) and I would definitely recommend them. Mac and cheese also ended up being a good choice. We weren't a huge fan of the pulled pork, but only because it is Carolina bbq style and we were expecting the usual sweet, sticky sauce. If you love bacon, come and get it!",Service slow....sliders came out almost raw super rare.... potatoes greasy... waitress was told well done .when I went to the bathroom 20 steps down the basement 'I seen the kitchen on the right.the cooks were on their phones and joking around..Two orders of sliders 1 order of potato tots  Came out to 50.00 with tip I'd rather give the 50.00 to the homeless guy outside the bar this place is horrible!!!I should have told the owner lady who greeted us.,"I came in this weekend with a few friends to do brunch. We came for the $2 mimosas, such a good deal. Just a quick note that the mimosa special only goes until 2! After that they go to regular drink prices. Every mimosas we got was a completely different color so who knows how much champagne is in them, and if you hate pulp in your drinks this is not the drink for you. Food was amazing! I got the loaded tots that were covered in cheese and bacon. I was surprised about how crispy they stayed for how much cheese was on them. Everyone at my table seemed to like the food they ordered as well, except for the pulled pork on the Mac and cheese. My friend said it was so dry she couldn't eat it.The reason why this has such a low rating is because of service. The place never got packed, we were there from 12:30-4, so we didn't really understand why everyone moved at snail speed. We didn't even care about that because we were catching up but after 2 pm came no one came back to our table for over an hour! Not to see if we needed another drink, food, our bill. Eventually we got someone to come over to give us a bill but it was crazy how long it took for even that. It took 30 more minutes for us to get the bill and pay. As good as the food was and how cheap the drinks are not sure I'll be coming back.",BarBacon Union Square
870,"Like most reviewers here, we know of this place from our numerous visits to the Mckittrick hotel. Cute spot with nice ambiance, and it has a great location close to the highline. Branzino dish is flavorful, but needlessly drenched in oil and greasy. Ribs was quite bland and still greasy.They have GF clearly labeled on the menu, but I probably would not recommend this place for anyone with celiac/severe allergies - while service was friendly, eyes still rolled when you ask for utensils that have not been sitting on the table (they serve bread) in fear of cross contamination, even after informing the waitress of being celiac, and this makes me quite concerned about the food served to me as well (asymptomatic, but celiac nonetheless). It's been years since my last visit and I was really looking forward to this visit post-diagnosis, but sadly it turned out rather disappointing.","Came highly recommended, but reservation cancelled after we arrived with a weak excuse about ""something"" with the kitchen that couldn't be explained. Perhaps they wanted to go home... -\_0_/-","Food was probably 4 stars, as was the ambiance - we generally enjoyed this. Empanadas were great.Had a TERRIBLE experience with service. We came with an OpenTable gift card specifically to Porteno, and had a LOT of pushback from our servers on using it (even though the restaurant had specifically partnered with OpenTable to allow us to obtain said gift card) - to the point where our hostess started shouting at us to ""stop acting annoyed"" about it. They alleged some sort of system disconnect....though when they finally tried to honor the gift card, it worked fine.......Incredibly unprofessional and totally ruined the evening. Unfortunately, we will never be back. I encourage those who may be using gift cards or the like to think twice.","The most amazing beef empanada I've ever had. Empanadas (plural) - so good, I had to order another. Enough said...no need to read the rest of my review, just head to Porteno right now.But if you want to know why I loved this empanada, it's because unlike other empanadas, it wasn't deep fried and dripping with grease, it was baked with a perfectly crispy and soft crust - just phenomenal. The bife de costilla (16 oz rib eye served with cabbage, kale and three-bean salad) was one of the most tender pieces of meat I've had in a long time! Flavorful, properly seasoned, and good to the last bite (if you can finish this rather large piece of meat). I also had a taste of the milanesa de carne (pan-fried breaded sirloin) and loved it! I'm ordering this next time I come to Porteno. Great beer and wine (I had a great glass of the Catena malbec). Good service, cute and cozy atmosphere. Highly recommend you make a reservation, it's a small restaurant and fills up fast.","Porteno is a place that benefits from Sleep No More foot traffic (read my review of this incredible show here: yelp.com/biz/sleep-no-mo… You may see randos coming in with theater masks; that's Sleep No More clientele trickling in! It's one of the few places open late after the show gets out around 10 or 11 PM.So how is it? Like most foot traffic beneficiaries, it's running on fumes. Chicken breast was pretty uninspiring, could be made at home, and was pretty dry. Best thing was the tuna tartare, but it's hard to mess that dish up. My head definitely didn't (figuratively) explode over anything, including the chocolate dessert.I'd count on making dinner plans somewhere around Meatpacking a little south rather than taking the easy way out after Sleep No More.","Stopped by here before heading to Sleep No More. Got seated at the bar and received some very friendly service that humored me as I obsessed over the Grammy nominations.For my meal I got the following:1) Saltena Empanada: A solid empanada. Flaky crusty and a decently flavorful filling. I've had better for cheaper but it's solid (3.75/5)2) Bacalao w/ chickpea puree & crispy sweet potatoes: Another solid dish. Cod was very very very slightly overcooked. It was still flaky but lacked the butteriness of good cod. Also could've used more seasoning. The puree had great flavors though and the crispy sweet potato strings had a great texture (3.75/5)3) Dulce de leche flan: Gawd I love flan, and this was a great spin on it. A bit dense but I didn't get sick of it at any point. Strawberries offered some relief. Overall adding another layer of caramel flavor to flan really just knocks it out of the park. Great dessert (4.5/5)Overall, left Porteno quite content (besides with the grammy nominations cause Ed Sheeran did not deserve all those awards and Kendrick deserved more). Anyways...saltiness aside, solid restaurant, nice people, thank you for dealing with my emotions friendly bartender.",Porteno Restaurant
871,"I've always had good experiences at the Westville restaurants but had a recent experience at the W10th location that made me not want to return. The meal started with seeing a live roach in a dirty bathroom (which is connected to the kitchen) and ended with an overdone, tasteless turkey burger. The server was apologetic and offered to comp our drinks but overall it was a very disappointing meal.","Food: 4/5Service: 3/5Cleanliness: 4/5Decor & Style: 3/5Very cozy, cute place. Had the cobb salad and cheeseburger and it was pretty deee-lish. Everything else that I didn't try looks amazing. The sausage, lemon pepper chicken salad, and just about the entire brunch menu looks amazing. I want to come back and try it all. The inside seating is small just FYI.","I've been eating at Westville West since 2007 but in the last couple of years the staples seem to have gone downhill. I've had several made experiences in the last couple of months but keep hoping its a one off. Sometimes they have credited my account- if they give me the wrong item, or missing something from my order. But tonight I couldn't believe that I was actually given a burnt dish. There is no way anyone could think it's acceptable to charge for this- the food was black. Not like charred for effect- like burnt. I get the Mac and Cheese often and this was inedible. I'm so disappointed in what was once a great West Village option.","Westville can do no wrong. It is consistently delicious across locations for both lunch and dinner, with a large enough of a menu where there's always something new to try. This is the original location, as the name implies, and while it has the most character, it is tiny and not the most practical location to visit. I really like the egg scramble off the brunch menu. For dinner, I absolutely love the kale salad (add chicken), turkey burger, and the quinoa burger (vegan). The $18 market platter of 4 veggies of your choice is extremely popular and a great deal as well. The whoopie pies are good for fulfilling a sweet tooth craving.","3rd or 4th visiting this brand and I haven't had a bad meal. If you can, definitely come in during off hours since it can get packed here. There are literally only 8 tables at this branch. The appeal for me has always been their market side menu where you get to chose from over 20 vegetables. It's ok to be a little adventurous, try something you normally don't cook/eat at home. Go meatless even! The way they cook their veggies here you won't be missing meat. I have enjoyed the lemon grilled asparagus with Parmesan, roasted eggplant with cucumber and tahini sauce, sautéed Brussels sprouts with honey Dijon and green peas with shallots and bacon. I've also gotten the sautéed broccoli  but the last time it tasted pretty basic (the one flaw). They give you ample sizes for the veggies. I got 3 sides of veggies and I had to pack half to go. For those wanting to be even healthy you can also request no butter or oil with your dishes. My go to meat is always the grilled salmon, comes with a nice sear. Their garlic mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese are also great  additions to the table. For drinks, they also include wine. I've gotten the mango lemonade with added Prosecco. Fyi, It's very light, packed with ice, gets watery towards the middle. I wouldn't necessarily get it next time.","My friends and I were in NYC and they really wanted to go to Sushi on Jones (next door) since I don't eat raw I decided to eat next door (here). I came in around 530pm on a Sunday so there were some empty seats but I heard from another person next to me that it gets really packed and the wait can be long. I loved to see so many veggies on the menu as i haven't been eating enough veggies while on vacay. I got the market plate with all veggies and then a side of mac and cheese to get me through the rest of the day. The food came out really quick which I appreciated. The veggies were really flavorful, my favorite were the peas and the mushrooms. Mac and cheese was creamy and cooked perfectly. This was exactly the fuel i needed and the fiber i needed from this trip!P.s. their restroom is through the kitchen and it's very greasy on the floor. I slipped twice and i grabbed onto one of the cooks and I'm so glad he didn't get startled and throw an entire pan of hot food on me. It's definitely a hazard to have to walk through there so be careful or I rather hold it.",Westville West
872,"The Pilot gets 5 stars for it's ambiance and that's the only reason to go there. Note the boat does rock back and forth, so you may feel a little queasy. Nonetheless it's a  truly gem of an outdoor place to watch the sunset behind the Manhattan skyline. Now on to the food/drink. As a vegetarian the only entree was the Cauliflower with edamame for $18.50. The cauliflower was too hard to cut  and wasn't an interesting dish at all. My entree and appetizer were served at the same time. The cocktail menu was too bizarre.  I found the metal straw hard on my teeth. Tip was automatically added to my bill. Everyone that worked there was very friendly and I would have happily given 20% on my own, but it just left a bad taste in my mouth that my server decided on his own to add that to my bill.",Second time trying this place out. View and atmosphere is gorgeous. Every year I want to give them a shot (as I am local) but their drinks are terrible! Ordered a Bloody Mary with grey goose and was charged $50 for 2 that we couldn't even finish. The flavor tasted like it was canned tomato juice and the service didn't act on it at all. Will not be going back for the third year sad to say.,Amateurs. It took me 20 min to get a drink at 415pm. Isn't liquor their highest margin product. 1st at the bar being ignored by blond then at another blond took my order at oyster bar and she just forgot.Nothing against blonds although have predilection towards brunettes. Similar to grand banks it has potential.,"Don't you just want to add a little class to your life?This is a good way to do it.   A beautiful setting and amazing views.Good drinks and wine coupled with a pleasant staff.  The bar actually has more seating than you might think, but seems like the tight space behind the bar slows them down a bit.   No food at the bar, which was a little bit of a downer.If you're looking for a nice afternoon or want to impress someone, come here.","We came here to celebrate my cousin getting a new job, and this was by far the coolest bar I have ever been to!We got lucky and came on a gorgeous night. However, it does get a bit rocky when the water is choppy, so beware if you easily get seasick.Our bartender was 1. Super friendly and 2. Extremely talented! Our cocktails were some of the best I ever had! Super thought out and carefully crafted, and you could definitely taste it. It is pricey, but worth it if you are celebrating something special. The bartender even gave us a drink free since my cousin got a new job; so thoughtful!I will 100% come back next season when it warms up again!","Very cool concept. Restaurant on a boat. The drinks and food were meh though. The ceviche was probably the stand out. A few yummy strips of fish and pickled cucumber. My lobster roll was tasteless, which was so disappointing, as the season is waning and I was really looking forward to   getting in one more lobster-something before autumn. Like many people, I don't mind paying for good quality wine. The Sauvignon blanc was headache-inducing alcoholy forward I couldn't even tell you any other notes it was so bad. Spendy for what it was for sure: pub wine level quality. But I mean... it's not like they're out at sea. There's a wine shop a block away, so it wasn't owing to scarcity. Our waiter was nice, but kindof forgot about us for a while. We waited about 45min after ordering for the ceviche to come. I mean, it's a small boat, I'm not sure how they missed us. Cool instant check paying via a tiny tablet that the waiter had, like they do in Europe. Anyway, cool concept, actually very cool bathrooms (random, but thought I'd mention) and I'd do what our second neighbors at the next table did and skip dinner and just come here for a basket of French fries on a night with nice weather.",Pilot
873,"Mediocre ramen at best. I keep getting disappointed by the highly rated restaurants in Hell's Kitchen. Is it the tourists that amp these ratings up? Perhaps the ratings are just for the alcohol? My kid and I both agreed, Jin Ramen is better. Had the shoyu ramen which was more salty than flavorful. The noodles were not springy and quite lackluster overall.The California roll we had was fine but nothing particularly special. My top ramen joints in NY remain Totto and Tonchin.","Got the ramen (forget which one but it's one of the standard) and it was definitely below my standards. The soup had basically none of the satisfying ""broth"" feel to it. The noodles weren't very good either and there was spinach in the ramen which tasted odd.

You can also get a free ice cream if you check in on Yelp!",Cons: 1) leaves of the salad was old and not fresh; 2) salmon was tastelessPros: 1) have a lunch specials; 2) fast; 3) nice place.,Amazing Ramen!  Also great happy hour sushi and cocktail wine and beer specials. This is a really fun place to go highly recommend itWenti was so friendly and helpful.,"Super busy. We went around 6pm. Small place so not that many seats. They seems to have a very busy take out (who doesn't in downtown). We didn't have to wait too long for a table for two. We were totally in the mood for sushi  but the Raman bowls looked great. Next time. The sushi was fresh and very flavorful. We didn't finish all of them because each bite was a mouth full. We ordered salad which was large enough for two+ The miso was hot and tasted.

I've been here multiple times and always order the same dish - the spicy vegetable ramen, which never disappoints. I've also brought multiple friends here and while they've ordered all sorts of non-vegetarian ramen, they've always had the same reaction - AMAZING!

874,"Was the team at Pascalou having a bad day?I was surprised today, when I stopped at one of our favorite places in the UES. 1. I had to go to the kitchen to find someone who could seat us.2. The wedge salad was not a wedge at all and we had to ask for the bacon after realizing that there was none in the salad. 3. The duck confit was over cooked. 4. Nobody came by to see if we were doing ok. We had eaten our single piece of bread and could have used a second one. 5. We wanted a second glass of wine and finally had to get up to get a wine list and order from the Bus Boy. As usual, the restaurant was full, but it was unusual to hear a neighboring table rumbling about cold coffee and dishes being taken back. I hope it's only a bad day for the Pascalou team. We all have them.","Small intimate French restaurant with very good food. We had snails (sorry, escargot), iceberg wedge salad, sole almandine, scallops, and a great chocolate mousse. Right across from Islands on Madison. Only negative was an unfriendly waiter. Prices were reasonable, much less than S F.",We were treated so rudely that we left before even being seated!!  Hostess couldn't be bothered and not even in the chic French kind of way. Le Charlot is the place to go,"If I won the lottery this would be my diner.  I noticed that in other reviews the physical space of the bistro was commented on.  For us, however, that kind of relaxed casual welcoming atmosphere was what made the evening so great. We were guests of dear friends staying nearby.   The bistro is a cozy, unaffected and very neighborhood spot.  What I really liked was that the meal we had was spectacular and I didn't feel out of place eating there.  We ate downstairs and the closeness of other patrons was completely comfortable and normal.  This is NY. It's crowded. And Pascalou's a small space and they have made the most of it.The service was terrific - I don't need formalities.  Again, I felt like I was someplace I could relax. Our waiter greeted us with ""Hello beautiful people"". That's a neighborhood welcome to me.  No pretense no preening no unnecessary nada.  The young hostess - casual dressed - was graciousness herself and as the evening unfolded I watch her move around the tables with such elegance and warm.  And now to the food! We all shared the sesame shrimp salad.  I am always meh about appetizers and salads because they often are no better than what I can do at home - and I'm a mediocre and disinterested cook.  But this salad was a surprise and a delight and I regretted having to share.  I want to return and order this salad all for myself. I had the teriyaki salmon, my husband the grilled salmon and our friends the meatballs and the steak.  Again, I rarely find a main course better than my own attempts or cheap-eats but my salmon was so good.  I so enjoyed it.  It was like being introduced to teriyaki all over again.  I tried my friend's steak and my eyes rolled back in my head and melted.  (we know good steak because once or twice a year we splurge at the best Argentinean steak house in NY.)  My husband always orders salmon when we go someplace nice and it's always ""OK"".  This time he said ""Good!"" We hope to return to Pascalou again for a treat.  Or more often if we win the lottery.","My husband and I stopped in here for their prix fixe lunch last week and were very impressed with the food but felt the restaurant lacked ambiance. The prices were very fair and the quality is outstanding but they could make this place extremely special with a bit more thought to the comfort of the patrons.The three course meal gives you plenty of options to choose from. I started with the pate which was more of a terrine since it was a bit chunky and could have been smoother, but with great taste. My husband and I both had the duck confit which was very good indeed. Perfectly cooked with veggies and mash potatoes on the side. The dessert was either a coconut gelato or a mixed fruit crumble, both were fine but nothing to write home about. The duck was the star for this lunch which was fine by us!Our table was literally sitting on top of the other patrons, as were all the other tables. Not a very intimate or romantic setting. It was also extremely loud - not due to people talking or music but the air conditioning unit rumbling louder than a airplane in such a tiny space.","Came here because I found the twilight dinner deal where if you came around 5-630, you can have a prefixe 3 course meal for $28.Starting from the bread, it was very chewy and kind of hard to bite but the butter was great. The first course was pate and it was huge and filling but a bit too salty for me so i had to ask for refill of the bread to eat it with. The second course was lamb polenta but i was too full after the pate and the polenta was very filling too. I wish the minced lamb was less fatty. For the tiramisu, it was literally dripping water and the alcohol taste was almost zero and the cake was melting so was not that good. Last but not least, thanks to Yelp, there was check-in offer of a free glass of wine and that was a good bonus to the meal!However, I was really shocked by the fact that there was no AC on the second floor and it was like 90+ degree outside and it was hot and really hard to eat during this condition and the staff was trying to bring fans but it could not blow wind for the whole place.Overall, the price for the amount of food is still good but do not expect to have a good condition when you come.",Pascalou
875,"ordered sashimi dinner set (18 pieces), about 25 (+tax +tips).**three and half starsoverall is average quality, about bento box grade.expected quality with expected price.beautifully presented.as usual, this set come with rice and salad.with choice of brown rice (additional charge).**the variety of menu is great!plenty of seating.highly recommended for a small and large group.","Ehh, I can't say I loved this place. Big menu, lots of options. I have to say the service was great, I would give them 5 stars on that. The food however I felt tasted kind of ""fishy"". Prices are good, I got the ramen and didn't love it. My boyfriend had a spicy shrimp role and fired rice and both were good! Next time I come I would probably sick to sushi rolls.","I ordered a poké bowl for delivery from this restaurant. One of my protein toppings l, that I paid extra for was missing besides the sauce (the sauce is an essential component of pretty much any poké I've ever had, so not sure how anyone could miss that ). They also didn't follow the rather simple additional instruction to mix everything with the rice, so I had to do it. When I called to point out the missing topping, the staff rudely insisted that it was included. The picture shows that isn't. I have no incentive to post a negative review or to provide proof with a picture but this is an instance of terrible and patently deceptive service that deserves to be highlighted and given a one-star rating.",Came in on a tuesday evening and it was pretty empty. I sat down right at the sushi bar. I ordered a seaweed salad and a peanut avocado roll. Both were good. The service was quick. I want to come back and try a few more things on the menu. I liked the dark wood paneling throughout the restaurant.,"I figured it's time to give a review. Okinii is my go-to sushi place whenever I'm craving sushi, *alone*. It's usually pretty empty for lunch and the service is quick and relaxed! Price & quality wise, don't expect high quality sushi, but it's consistent and good enough to satisfy that sushi craving. It's not the cheapest, but the price to me seems very reasonable. I usually get a regular bento box for lunch since I enjoy eating a lot - with tip, it comes around to ~23$? But they do have affordable lunch options as well. I just really really like the regular sashimi bento box so... It comes with sashimi, shumai, rice, seaweed salad, and a choice of roll. The seaweed salad is probably one of the best, especially because I usually don't enjoy them much. As for rolls... I really recommend the shrimp tempura roll. It contains two whole shrimp tempura and so so so good!Anyways, it's a decent sushi joint for quick bites! Nothing too fancy, so I guess my advice would be don't expect too much?","Great spot in the Village. Stopped in for a quick lunch. Got sat immediately, service was friendly and food came out quickly! We took advantage of the lunch menu and got a couple rolls of sushi on top of our entrees. Very pleased with everything.Prices were reasonable, but definitely take advantage of the lunch menu if possible! Clean atmosphere but a little more lighting would be nice!",Okinii
876,"Il Bambino made for a great lunch spot on a holiday Monday. My boyfriend and I shared a Goat cheese and fig spread crostini, Speck panini and Roast chicken panini. I also got a Toffee oatmeal cookie but wasn't a fan - it was way too hard. We both had a sample of the brownie on the way out and it was incredible, should have gotten that instead.","Number of Visits: 2Il Bambino is the one spot that focuses on paninis and offers you a variety of melts that is pressed until the cheese is oooey hot. Quite frankly, I just wasn't too impressed with the sandwiches. Some were really strong in flavor and others not so much which all depended on the ingredient.The menu is broken down as simple as possible for you to understand it which is very helpful for first-timers. They tell you where each meat and cheese is from so you can find your combo. There is seating indoors and outdoors, but service is a tad bit slow in my opinion. The staff is busy out back where the crowd is so if you're the only one hanging out inside, there is a tad bit of neglect.","I have lived in Astoria for 11 years (!) and Il Bambino is still my favorite neighborhood spot. Everything on their menu is to die for, but their soups, potato salad and mimosa salad are highlights. I also almost always order the goat cheese and honey crostini and the black olive oil with tomato fresca and ricotta cheese crostini. Those combinations are just tops. Sit outside in the summer to forget you're in an urban area.","Astoria, Queens is highly underrated, since all the tourists are swamped in manhattan; and they are definitely missing out! Recommended to me by a friend who lives right around the block, I decided to go here as my first lunch trip with her and my party when landing in NYC. When reading the menu, I giggled at ""Pupu Platter"", yes immature, but I had a little laugh. I was wondering what it might be, and thanks to my fellow yelpers, it is a platter of those little slices of crostini they have. Since it was my first time here, I didn't want to go Wild, so I played it safe and ordered their goat cheese with honey crostini. It was a very unique taste, however, it definitely wasn't my WOW! It kind of made me regret not getting the platter to try other amazing crostini. Still not a bad choice! I will definitely want to come back here. It is a great place for a meet up, casual date, and/or small get together. It is cute, cozy, and friendly inside!","Love this place!Paninis are absolutely delicious!!! We had so many of them, but hands down our favorite one is the charred  broccoli. There is an outside patio in the back with excellent service.","Il Bambino is a great casual spot for paninis and crostinis. It's got a modern, pleasing aesthetic that's also comfortable and laid back.  There is a Toronto or Brooklyn vibe about it.  It has a particularly Toronto feel with its large back patio.  Service was friendly and efficient.  I tried two different paninis (split half and half with my friend).  One was a daily special with bacon, avocado, mozzarella, spicy mayo and onion jam and the other was a brunch option panini that also had bacon, bleu cheese, and some other stuff I forget.  Both were so tasty.  Highly recommended!",Il Bambino
877,"Went back again on a weekend. So disappointed that after 40 minutes we still did not get our food, which was just two arepas. We were told that our food would be put through before a large group but it didn't seem like the case. I loved their arepas last time, but I don't think I will be coming in for awhile. They need faster food prep time, especially if they can afford to have 3 people in the front.",I'm no arepa expert. I just thought it was flavorful and delicious. I split the chocolo queso and arepa de queso with pollo asado with my partner. I felt very full afterwards.,I really wanted to love this place but unfortunately it disappointed me. I tried the arepa for the first time in Boston so I might not know the real flavor but I was expecting something savory but what I got was something sweet. It wasn't bad but it wasn't as amazing as a lot of people have told me!,"A couple years ago, I went to the first Arepa Lady storefront location on Roosevelt Avenue after she had moved up from her cart. I heard that place had closed down but it had re-opened at a different address. Since we were in the mood for arepas, we decided to stop in.This location is much bigger than the old one and is about double the size. We tried three different types of arepa - arepa de choclo (sweet corn), arepa rellena (stuffed arepa) and arepa de queso (cheese). My favorite of the three is the choclo because of the sweet taste. But everything was delicious and had the same great quality and same great taste as before. There is a reason this place became so popular. Prices are reasonable too. Each one depending on what meat or filling you choose is about $5 to $8 each. Of course there are cheaper arepas to be had in hole in the walls, but in this case you are paying a tiny bit more for the quality and experience.","The ""Arepa Lady"" was a very popular Colombian lady with a street cart serving arepas in Jackson Heights. A couple years ago, she opened her own storefront and I decided to check it out. All I can say is that this place receives my highest recommendation.We tried a patacon (a tostone topped with meat and veggies) and two of the arepas. They were all very big and very delicious. The patacon we had with chicharron was a great combination - nice, savory taste  with the crispy bits of pork. I also especially liked the arepa de choclo. I recommend that type over the arepas. It is an arepa made of sweet corn  with such a rich taste to it. Everything here is very cheap too - around $5 to $8 for each offering..","Arepa Lady is fine. If you like heavy food, then get the cheese stuffed arepa. But be warned that it will also have cheese on top. SO MUCH CHEESE.Don't get the chorizo, because it's not ground sausage like I expected. It's just slices of sausage that was a little too reminiscent of hot dogs.The chicharron was top notch though.Note that they don't serve alcohol.",Arepa Lady
878,"The service was horrible; meaning our server, Marishka H, was very rude and not attentive. The food was a great experience, however, when you are spending almost $400 for a dinner you expect the service to be top notch. She ruined my whole dining  experience. We were celebrating my friend's birthday so we decided to do a short story chef's special and one of the meat dishes was oversalted. When I told our server, Marishka, about it she responded with an attitude instead of apologizing. The food was great but service was horrible.","Just a 1 star, because: we haven't been poisoned!We had the short story tasting menu and here's what I think about it:1st course: 3 smallest appetizers which tasted almost the same, can't imagine what you need to do with the caviar so it has no caviar taste2nd course: scallops, has nice taste of cider and horseradish, but no scallops at all, just a feeling you ate something soft.3rd course: quail -- in a size of a cotton swab, there were 2 pieces, one had crust and another one is not! Seriously, why so small???Grass fed beef was ok, but, additionally we ordered red deer, which tasted the same and had the same texture!There was nothing outstanding in the desert also.The bread with a butter is nothing special.In my opinion, the price is too high, for $95(should be $45) you get so little food. This place has nothing in common with Michelin starred restaurants and it's still a mystery for me how they got one. After all, food was edible, but tasteless, I've seen waiters every 2 minutes and they continuously tried to sell me and my wife wine, instead of sharing plate of a red deer they brought deer to both of us.I wouldn't recommend this place and will never go back.","I was quite disappointed by my experience at The Musket Room. While it is worth noting the food was quite well-prepared everything else fell well outside my expectations of a fine dining experience.  The meal was rushed, either by design (which would be disappointing) or due to the staff wanting to turn-tables. For example, we were never given the option to have a cocktail before our meal and were never given the option to have tea or coffee after. When we asked for a cocktail before dinner, it was of course served, but along with the first course as opposed to before like was requested. Further, the group I was with did the short form tasting menu and wine pairing. In their apparent haste to turn the table multiple times, we were not able to enjoy the full pairing before being poured another glass, making the table crowded with unfinished beverages. Again, I want to reiterate the food was quite good, it is just a shame that for such an expensive and purported fine dining established that we were treated to a fast-food pace.","Traveled to the city just for the Long Story tasting menu. Plate after plate was delicious. With each dish distinct from the last, I could not stop thinking about this meal months after the dinner. Any expectations we had were well surpassed, from the food to our waiter it was an incredible experience that we will never forget. Will definitely be going back and highly recommend.","Walked in without a reservation and opted for a tasting menu with wine pairing. 1st course was Broccoli soup with oxtail - Good but nothing amazing. Tasted of fresh broccoli soup and one small oxtail puffed pastry in the center. This was paired with a sparkling pinot noir rose. An odd pairing for my tastes but kept the dish light. 6/102nd course was Cold smoked scallops with cucumber black garlic and pear. Presentation of this dish was unique as it was cold smoked so it was presented under a glass dome that when lifted provided a beautiful aroma. Scallops were delicious and the cucumber was bright and refreshing on the palate. This was paired with an unoaked chardonnay for a nice bright, clean flavor compliment. 7/103rd course was Qual with blackberries and roasted onions. The Qual was delicious and the bread sauce that came with it added to rich earthy flavors. This was served with a big pinot noir that complemented the dish wonderfully. 8/104th course was Red deer with flavors of gin. The meat was tender and melted in your mouth. Unlike other types of venison this was not gamey at all. The flavors of gin was served as a meringue and was a pleasant compliment in small quantities. It also came with a celery root paste that helped to balance the flavors of the juniper and a Syrah to stand up to the venison. 8/105th course was a small palate cleanser of cranberry sorbet over lime flakes. The sorbet was pleasantly sweet and tart without being too tangy and the lime flakes added a nice crunch to the dish. This was paired with a very sweet Riesling that helped to balance some of the tartness of the cranberry 8/106th course was carrot cake, curd, and chai sorbet. Carrot cake was moist and dense less cake-like and had more of a flourless cake density. The curd added a crunch to an otherwise smooth dish and the chai tea sorbet helped to bring it all together. This dish was paired with a Madeira dessert wine 8/10We ended wanting to try the chocolate cake so we added an order of chocolate cake as the portions of the tasting menu were a little small (we finished the tasting menu feeling satisfied but had the room for an extra dessert) This dish was good but not great. Turned out to be a white chocolate cake with an Ovaltine-like crunch and raspberry drizzle. The cake was good but we were hoping for more sumptuous milk or dark chocolate than the vanilla flavored milk chocolate. I paired this with a Madeira again as I requested another port that they were out of. 6/10Overall it was a good experience service was friendly and attentive without being too intrusive. The Sommeliers pours were a little light until I ordered a port for the chocolate dessert and they didn't have what I wanted so he made up for it with a more than generousl pour.","Came here during the restaurant week but we got their short story instead.The appetizers were good and creative. Nothing too impressive but definitely delicious.As for the main, the seafood was very fresh. And I enjoyed the beef fillet a lot. The quail was nice too, cooked to the right tenderness. Their bread, which came with three different spreads was yummy. I especially enjoyed it with chicken liver! The desserts were a little sweet but good overall.The service as well as the speed which our food was served was fantastic! No complaint at all.",The Musket Room
879,"It takes alot for this international man of foodie to slam a place but when forced to I will succumb. On a dollar basis, one of the worst meals I have ever had. Am shocked the Liberian Delegation didn't split earlier, but from the perspective of Sbarro's, this may have been an uptick for them. The ""Seagram's Crab Cake"" looked and tasted like it was run over by an 18 wheeler. The $235 rib eye ($235??????) was like Coke Zero (no taste!!) and as hard as Manhattan pavement. $800 a person. Would rather have 275 Original KFC chicken breasts. Can't imagine when this place closes up.","A place that price gouges for water is not a place I'll be returning to. When they ask if you want ""still or sparkling"", beware that sparkling water will run you $9 a person... which we found out on the check.","Such a disappointment... wow!

Grasshopper Cake & Baked Alaska, not so much . Baked Alaska all you tasted was liquor. Won't be back!We'll stick to Gabriel Kneuther!","Dinning at The Grill is a phenomenal experience! Let me start by telling you this... I am certainly coming back again, and that says a lot for a restaurant in NYC.When you walk in the lobby, you are literally being greeted by a team of good looking and professional staff with a friendly smile. However you don't feel the pressure of getting rush with being seated. That's a very good impression on the first sight. The restaurant is located 1 floor up. The space and subtle yet classy decoration created a very welcoming and comfortable feeling. We were seated at the booth, and I have to say that is prob the best seat in the house as you get to see the full action of the scene.Before coming here, I have done a lot of research of the menu. To be honest, chef buffet is overrated as they are not quite the highlight dishes of this restaurant. What you really need to go for mains are the following:Pasta A Le PressFoie GrasPrime Rib with the devil boneAsparagus Jack's PieThis food portion is well full enough for a party of two. Foie Gras here is by far the best I have ever had. The main reason behind it is because the sweat sauce they seared the Foie Gras with, created a brown crispy coating that give the dish a nice texture; the green sauce that they paired with the Foie Gras also balanced out the greasy texture of the dish and really brings out the best taste of the Foie Gras. Pasta A Le Press is pure amazingly cooked. Once you ordered it, they will show you the sauce hard Press machine that used to only belongs to the museum, which the owner acquired and actually put it in good use, and would hard Press the duck meat with bunch of other ingredients into a highly concentrated pasta sauce right in front of you. That sauce is the most memorable pasta sauce that I will miss so much; I am sure I can't make it at home... Last but not least, the signature Prime Rib! It is stunningly  packed with flavors, topped with shredded radish. Instead of going for the dry aged steak, this is definitely more preferable. This prime is being slow roasted for hours which shredded at least 20% - 30% of the meat water weight to pack the beefy flavor tighter together. It is around 12 - 14oz, so I highly suggest sharing the dish to make room of your stomach for the pasta and Foie Gras. The side of Asparagus Jack's pie actually has a story behind it, so be sure to ask about it.Dessert is surprisingly good as well! The raspberry pistachio cake tart and the banana eclipse with Scott cream are a profound way to wrap up the meal. That sour sweet raspberry tart is Great for clearing your taste bud but still gives you a memorable after taste of the meal. Banana eclipse is one of their specials, so you should totally order it.I highly recommend The Grill! - End","Dinning at The Grill is a phenomenal experience! Let me start by telling you this...

The two doormen are all smiles, I don't feel like I've gone through Austrian security. The host is lovely, she shows us to a great table with a smile.Our server (the Rob Corddry look a like, but with facial hair) is a pleasure. We begin with cocktails, a negroni, vodka tonic, a grill sour and a Riesling for La Portena. The cocktails are well made and at $20 a shot are not all that pricier than those on offer in less exalted digs. And then that bread basket. Pretzel mini-batards, dark peasant bread and Parker House rolls. Herb butter. I've had better Parker House rolls (but these beat the ones at the actual Parker House) but the pretzel and dark breads are unimpeachable. You may want a refill.We order a bottle of the Monthelie, which seems affordable at $185. There are some less expensive wines, but a lot of the bottle action is in the $400-600 range. First up, our apps - a dozen oysters - Peconic Bay (if I heard correctly) in a mignonette ($4/oyster). They are fresh, they are tasty, but they could have been a little colder in my opinion. And I would rather have made the decision whether to add the sauce myself-sometimes I am good with what the oyster has left in the shell. The crab cake does not wear its remoulade - to preserve its crispness. It is very good, but small for the price. Winning this round is the goose terrine - a good size portion lots of flavor, and its a handsome devil as charcuterie goes.At our server's question our pasta a la presse serves as a mid-course. The duck press ritual is fun, but if you've done this sort of thing in France it's not mandatory. The essence of canard moistens some light home made noodles - two orders sufficed for four diners.About two days before our reservations, we received the phone call inviting a prime rib pre-order. I recommend exercising this option The piece of meat on my plate was not the largest, not the fattiest, it was simply the best I have eaten. Accompanied by horseradish cream and a bit of mustard, it is best in its own juices, but accept a dusting of fresh grated horseradish. The meat is of uniform temperature and color, well seasoned, absolutely tender. I will confess it is a bit too salty. The bone that came with mine seems too broad to have been a prime rib bone. And then I do the math - a full prime rib has 7 bones but might yield 13-14 slabs of meat - so if everyone gets a smoked bone, some of those bones must come from other cuts. So I think I may have received a short rib bone. It's meaty, it's tender and I have to share it with family. No complaints.The birthday boy orders a rib steak for two. The bit I taste is nicely charred, exceedingly well marbled. Roasted garlic on the side. La Portena and the feinschmecker opt for the standard sirloin strip - one of the ""bargains"" at $74 - there's Wagyu on offer at $145. No need to upgrade -- the  base model is tender, well seasoned and nicely cooked - between medium and medium rare, as requested. The Monthelie pairs well with our meets and opens nicely in the delicate stemware.For sides we had opted for the fried tomato rings and the potato dumplings. The rings are light, nice and crisp and not enhanced by their sauce. A few more for the price but might have been nice. The ethereal potato dumplings are the better choice. There are quite a few and the rich sauce means a little goes a long, long way.The server recommends the lemon chiffon pie, but it's not my jam so I order the blackberry shortcake - the feinschmecker orders the German chocolate cake. The cake is flourless and is more like a slice of chocolate pate. The blackberry shortie is not the best choice, but our waiter has things under control and has also comped us to a slice of the airy chiffon - it is indeed, the best dessert. A candle for the birthday boy....And where so many restaurants stumble, the Grill triumphs - a double espresso is perfectly rendered with good crema.Lux ingredients, great cooking, impeccable service, spectacular room. It ain't gonna come cheap. Never mind about that bill.",The Grill
880,"My two other friends and I came here on a Saturday night after making an 8:30pm reservation, but there doesn't seem to be a need for one at that hour as there were many available seats on the lower level, which is where we were seated. We had already had dinner but since it was early in the night, we wanted to stop by here for some drinks before going home. We ordered the Bashful Maiden ($16), the Drunken Dragon's Milk ($16), and the Kaffir Jimlet ($16) from the Fancy Cocktails list and a plate of the steamed Chicken & Pork Belly dumplings ($15).The drinks and dumplings were good, but my friends and I all agreed that $15 for just 4 dumplings is way overpriced. I also don't particularly recommend this restaurant if you are only looking to get drinks and a small bite, for our server constantly seemed to be pressuring us into ordering more food. Although it was nearly 9pm and there were a lot of vacant tables, and we had explained that we had already had dinner and just wanted some drinks, our server became suddenly annoyed because we were not there to be served a full meal. Past 9pm, the bar area downstairs seemed to open up for standing customers, so that is probably more appropriate for those only seeking drinks. But there are much better alternatives in the area for cheaper, so I likely won't be back to this place.","Stopped by work for a quick dinner with co-workers around 6pm. It really started to pick up around 6:45pm so I recommend making a reservation.The food is great, but the real appeal is the ambience~","Trendy locale for Asian delights.  Start with a glass of something then move on to croquettes, dumplings, whole fish, chicken and fried rice.  Don't forget to save room for dessert.","My crew had dinner a few blocks away at 1803 NYC.  Post dinner we were looking for a change of scenery, and happened upon Macao Trading.  The crowd is a nice mix of great looking, trendsetting hipsters, and the DJ played an awesome variety of tunes.  The drinks are a little pricey, but the selections are superb.  Seems to get a bit packed on weekend, but still a lot of fun.  Shoutout to the doorman with all the personality.  He was funny and very welcoming.  Take it from a guy who ran nightclub events in NYC for many years, that is a rare combination for someone in his position.","Came here around 11pm on a Friday night with a large group of humans. Somehow, they were able to accommodate all of us. The service was fantastic despite having such a large group. To drink, I had a vodka based coconut mint drink (the name I have no idea) which was pretty tasty. Not my fave but it was still good. To eat, I had the mussels. It took me a while to realize that all the mussels had fallen into the soup and the shells were just sitting on top. The bread was very dry and tasted a bit burnt, but dipped/soaked into the sauce, it was delicious. I had asked for more bread to dip in my sauce and had walked away for a second. When I returned, the sauce was gone and no bread. I was so sad. I could have used more of that sauce in my belly. I tasted the fried rice and that was hands down the BEST fried rice I have ever tasted. I would break glass for that rice for sure! I tried the eggplant side dish, that was pretty tasty. I didn't try the lobster noodles but they looked fantastic. Next time I would most definitely have that! The music was so fun. Different music upstairs and downstairs. Downstairs was more dance floor type vide, much different clientele too. It was both fun.I will definitely come back! Unfortunately, couldn't take pictures. My useless phone died even before I got to the restaurant","Went here with a few girlfriends on a Friday night. Despite having a reservation we were seated downstairs where it was really dark and loud, not ideal for our large group (would be nice for a date though). Our severs were a little over our group and it was evident, but I think it was really just a lack of patience and the loud environment didn't help (For these reasons I took one star off).I had the lobster noodle and LOVED it. Out of a group of 8 women, 7 people loved their food. I'd love to go back and have it again, but only if we can sit upstairs.",Macao trading
881,"Hipster hype.My first impression was ruined the moment I walked in and the host/manager asked if I had cash because they're cash only. Fortunately, I had just enough for a bowl of their surf and turf (lobster and beef rib) pho of $35. -Broth: they promote their ""crazy rich broth"" like crazy with the neon sign and all the staff uniform. Yes, it was rich. But sadly, it was flavorless. I couldn't taste the traditional star anise and cinnamon sticks flavors in a typical pho. It was quite bland.- Lobster and beef rib: Gotta say I feel really weird eating lobster with hoisin sauce. The Vietnamese in me just wanted to ask for me salt, pepper and lime. It was good quality meat, but I thought lobster didn't go very well with pho.- Noodles: Oh gosh, this was where it felt apart (pun intended). The noodles were so hard and sticky. They might have left it out for a while before pouring the broth in. I couldn't fully separate them so they ended up breaking apart in little pieces. It was such a shame I ate about a quarter of the noodles because it was so bad.Cute idea. But I'm not crazy and rich enough to go back anytime soon.","Overall: 3.5; Food: 3.5; Atmosphere: 4; Service: 3Food: 3.5Decent pho. Not that much better than some Chinatown places like pho grand, but with a higher price. Atmosphere: 4Has a really modern vibe. Full of young people. Wait isn't too long. Service: 3Service seemed a little scattered. Also, there's a lot of pressure to leave quickly. I get that pho is a quick meal and there are often people waiting, but it's tough to be asked multiple times if you're done.","I daydream about this pho! I can't wait to go back!I had the $25 surf and turf, short rib and half lobster pho and it was to die for. I would gladly pay $25 anytime. The meat fell off the bone and the lobster was cooked perfectly. Eat pho regularly and I have to admit this is my new favorite pho place of all time. I'm so sad it's all the way in nyc.","Amazing pho place. I'm from Houston, so I know pho and bun bo hue pretty well. Bun bo hue was super spicy, and I couldn't stop sweating. But it was probably because I added 5 lines of sriracha before tasting the soup xD. My only complaints about the bowl were the noodles and there wasn't enough meat. They noodles were too soft and almost fall apart once you slurp them up.Service was exceptional. Best service I've experienced in a while. Waitress was very attentive, but only when I needed it. Not too much in your space and always refilling water when low.Highly recommend for any bun bo hue lovers out there, but beware the spiciness.","This place is a sister restaurant to the uber-popular Saigon Shack. Ostensibly they opened this joint to satisfy consumer demand for Pho (i.e. Saigon Shack is always packed!)PhoBar has at least double the seating that Saigon Shack does and the menu seems relatively similar. So skip the ever-present lines at Saigon Shack and pop in here.The Pho here is solid - the broth is tasty and they pack in the meat. My go to is the Pho Tai (Pho with rare thinly sliced fillet). You can't really go wrong with any of their Pho bowls.They're cash only so don't forget to bring that paper! If you hail from other areas of the country that are Vietnamese hot spots (San Jose, Westminster, Houston, etc.) then you will be shocked by the prices. The cheapest bowl of Pho is $10. But remember this is NYC and the the prices are likely a result of an expensive lease for a prime location in Greenwich Village.I recommend this place for Pho if you're in Greenwich Village!","I have mixed feelings about this place. While what I ordered was very good, there were a number of things about this restaurant that were off putting for me. Let's start with the good first:Banh mi- awesome, I believe I had the catfish and it was really good. The portions were very large and came with shrimp crackers, which was a nice complement to the meal. Vietnamese coffee- this was interesting. I like the way it was served. They placed the filter thingy on top of the serving cup and you wait till all the coffee drips from the filter before drinking. The sweetened condensed milk really helped thicken the coffee. I'd say this was a hit for me but I didn't  find anything super unique about it besides the way it was served.Service and setting- so setting wise, I'm not a fan of this place. It's communal and bar seating . Unless you have groups of 3 or more, you probably won't feel too comfortable being seated next to strangers as your conversation can carry. Why can't they just have two seater tables?? Me and my friend decided to sit at the bar, which wasn't so comfortable. They had a cash only policy when we came. This was annoying, since a lot of their options (I think almost all of them) were 10+ dollars. We wanted to try two specific items from their menu but were informed they ran out of the key ingredients for them. We wanted to get the pho special that had the crawfish in it ( the main player of the meal, imo) but they told us they didn't have crawfish anymore and would just add more shrimp instead. Ummm, you are not pho real (sorry had to). You don't get to charge 17+ dollars and not have crawfish in it. Smh.We also wanted to try the coconut iced coffee drink but they didn't have anymore coconut milk. What the heck is going on with their inventory?? It seemed like such a common ingredient that you would always have on hand. So anyways, we didn't get to try the items that we came for. Service was meh. It wasn't that busy and it was still hard to get their attention. I shouldn't have to wave my hand profusely to get attention. It's soo weird for me.",PhoBar
882,"The only way to get closer to classic turn of the century New York is to step into a god damn time machine.Amber incandescent lighting fixtures, white tile and An endless wall of spirits make it hard to believe it's 2019.Or maybe Valerie was going for a European vibe? Frankly who gives a toss because the institution is a diamond in the rough of Gotham city.The cocktails do not need review, because yes they're dandy but you'd still want to go to this place even if only seltzer water was served.Top hat and cane are not mandatory but suggested.","My credit card was overcharged. I left several phone messages and e-mails and NO ONE got back to me regarding this matter. The manager would NOT speak to me and the owner seemed to be always ""busy"" or ""not available"". I'm so disappointed in the type of service they provide.","Stopped here with my boyfriend on our weekend getaway. The place looked busy but we got seated fairly quickly. They also took our coats to store in the back while we dined.The waitress was relatively slow at getting our order and food out. At some point we accidentally blew out the candle at our table but no one came to relight it (when we asked a few times because the restaurant was very dark). The food was delicious. I absolutely loved my braised short rib. It was very tender and all the elements of the dish came together wonderfully.We also ordered a burger with a different sauce and pickles. They brought it completely incorrect. No pickles and wrong sauce. They did bring the sauce and pickles in the end; however, when we asked for extra sauce they brought the wrong sauce twice so we just gave up on asking again.","I love this place the bartender in the pic was PERFECT. I told him what I wanted which was a sour drink and he gave me just that. He was very attentive, good looking, and everything you need in a bartender ! I got my happy hour drink for 11$ which lasts until 7 This place is a very laid back some what fancy bar.. I really love the vibe a great place for a first drink date ! The hostess was a beautiful woman as well. I really dig when the staff is presentable makes me enjoy the place more!","I visited Valerie on a Friday evening with a friend for happy hour. We were searching for a spot in midtown that would be new for both of us and that was also convenient to get to by train. This spot came up and we decided to give it a try. I'm happy we did because it impressed us both more than we originally thought it would. Valerie is conveniently located near Bryant Park and after arriving to the area via subway it only took us a short walk to the bar. We were able to be seated at a table right on the first floor near the stairway even though we were only there for drinks. As we got our first rounds we started to realize it got more packed as time went by and after an hour or so after arriving the bar area on the first floor seemed to be almost at capacity! I'd definitely recommend arriving early if you're trying to beat the crowd and snag a table.When it came time to order I stuck with the pilsner option ($7) they had on their happy hour menu. My friend ordered the white wine ($8). Drinks were good and portions were standard. Our server was quick in getting our drinks to us which was also appreciated, especially given how busy it got after a while.This definitely seems like the spot to go after hours for happy hour. Be prepared for midtown office workers crowding the space during the later hours, but also come to enjoy the nice interior and comfortable setting.",Wow! Everything was amazing.

883,"This is hands down the worst meal I have had in New York. The Finch is a neighborhood restaurant in Clinton Hill, with very few other options nearby. This is probably the only reason why it's still in business. It's ridiculously pricey and portions are so small that food gets lost in the plate.5 pieces of toasted bread costed 10$. Yes, you are reading correctly: that bread that every single restaurant on Earth offerts complementary, here costs 10$.We then got roasted chicken. Came in two small pieces, completely raw and gummy. We obviously sent it back and when the waiter brought back the plate he said that the chicken was ""sous vide"". Mind that the menu said ""roasted chicken"". ROASTED.the other plate we got was the pappardelle: literally three sad strips of tasteless pasta.Total: 110$ for one glass of wine, bread and two ""entrees"".Never again.",The front part of the restaurant is where you want to be seated - unfortunately we ended up at the other dinning room which disturbingly smelled like a living room that had no windows opened for years until the air-con was turned on. The food was ok - interesting dishes but I'm challenged when I have to chew sand with my mushrooms. The dishes lacked the finesse I had expected.,"Had dinner here for Valentine's Day. It was pretty unappetizing and, considering the bill at the end, not super pleased with this experience. Most of the food was luke warm - never warm or hot. The wine was super super funky, I can usually appreciate one or two different types of funk, but all 5 wines were strange. The food felt very one-note and overly technical; they missed the important parts - taste and texture. Service was consistently nice and friendly. I am sad to say I walked out feeling nauseous and disappointed.","Spotted this one star restaurant within walking distance from my new apartment - what are the chances.Dined on 9/22/19. The place was cozy, relaxing, with an open kitchen, not yet dominated by millenials (thank god, but jk).Food:Bread, butter, raw honey, radishes - never had the bread-butter-radish combo with raw honey before. The honey was funky in a good way, but the proportion of this starter was laughable - piles of radishes with only five tiny slices of unimpressive bread. We ended up using the radish slices to scoop up the honey and butter (we did not want to waste food; plus, it was $10). The radish was crispy, earthy, with nice watery texture, but our hands got sticky, concluding that we never had so many radishes in one setting and felt like rabbits. Lettuce with avocado squash - note that those delicious slices of avocado squash were buried in the bottom of a pile of lettuce, but if you dig them out and blend with lettuce (and even more radish!) and buttermilk dressing, this salad was divine, creamy, but still made you feel...somewhat healthy. Chicken with corn, tomato & chanterelles - a umami bomb. The chicken was charred outside, tender and juicy inside. My bf bet that the meat was sous vide first and then roasted/charred. I did not enter the bet. Tomatoes were extremely juicy, but salt seemed to have overpowered the lovely flavor of chanterelles. Generally delicious, even tho my fav mushroom was not treated properly.Trout with early fall squash and nuts was arguably more mild and pleasant - seem to resemble a golden harvest of the fall (after having too many radishes, my peasant-roots surfaced). The trout was tender, rather unsalted, but the crunchiness of seeds and nuts added nice texture and complexity to the fish. Saffron panna cotta - not my fav. The raspberries were not fresh, and the saffron flavor tasted more like unfiltered tap water, with faint smell of chlorine, strangely. Drinks: Bourbon based cocktail - strong and delicious, very curious with a lingering taste of pine nuts. Slovenian red wine - never had red wine from Slovenia before, very velvety, smoked peppercorn taste, interesting.$10 Tokaji - who needs dessert if you can get this golden liquid for $10? This one did not have the complexity as those with higher puttonyos, but still tasted like honey/honeysuckle/white flowers. Sweet but never overwhelming.","This is a wonderful restaurant with a view of the beautiful open kitchen where you can watch the chefs hard at work. The servers are friendly and helpful with any questions you have about the menu. I wasn't entirely impressed with their wine selection but liked that the menu wasn't large - just a few appetizers, entrees and desserts. We started off with the bread and radishes. I would never imagine that pair together but it worked very well, especially with the paired honey. A simple dish that's inventive. We got the heirloom tomatoes with cherries and bread - another fire combination. It's a very clean dish and since it's peak summer, there is no reason to skip over heirloom tomatoes. For our mains, we had the einkorn and squid ink pasta. The pasta's made at the restaurant and was rich in flavor while the einkorn, which I've never had before, was the most unique dish of the night. It was prepared with mushrooms and some green sauce - it had a touch of tanginess and the mushrooms gave it depth. Don't skip over the dessert at The Finch. We got an almond tart but every dessert looked divine. I'll try the strawberry shortcake next visit.","Not wowed. Would give 3.5 stars if it is an option.We started dinner with cocktails. When we took the first sip, we though - humm...nothing really is special about the drinks. Maybe the food will be better? Starters:The kale salad with pistachio was good. Chicken liver mousse was ok. The added fruity flavor kinda overtook the whole dish. Entree:The duck was good. The skin was crispy and the meat was cooked perfectly. I didn't get a chance to try the tile fish but my friend said it's good. DO NOT get the squid ink fazzoletti. The portion was so small - like a kids meal- and the flavor was just ok. I even tasted a rock or crab shell in my dish. Dessert: Yuzu tart was refreshing. But that's about it.We were all scratching our heads trying to understand how can this restaurant be Michelin 1 star restaurant.  Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes? Guess I won't know because I'm not planning to try again",The Finch

(My only complaint is the music that's blasting upstairs) You choose a protein and two veggie sides plus vegan mash or brown rice--this time, I got a bowl of chicken with acorn squash and broccoli on a base of spinach and romaine, but the salmon is delicious too! The vegan mash is some sort of sweet potato mix, and it's a good addition to make the meal more substantive. Overall, a great healthy lunch spot!",Mulberry & Vine
885,"Have you ever been to a restaurant so secret it didn't publish its phone number? That to get inside you had to walk through not one door but two? That you had to be blindfolded and led through a crawl space belan shuttered fish market? Well I've done the first two; the third sounds scary. Finding Bohemian is no easy task: you have to ""google"" it through the internet and plug the address into your smartphone. Inside Basquiat's one-time abode, transported into what could be the kitschy living room hosting your grandma's illicit poker club (the grandma who's a Japanese fusion chef) you'll have a pretty unique meal. Sorry, but I've redacted the photos out of respect for the institution. Among the standouts were the crudités fondue, the beef sashimi, foie gras sushi, mac and cheese, and teriyaki burger. The Little Devil cocktail also spoke to me. Unfortunately making a reservation is about as hard as locating the place - you need a referral from someone who's been.","Inside the unmarked door you will find this small, intimate restaurant. The food was decent, but not super ""wow."" My complaint about this place is probably that the couches are too low so it's very uncomfortable to sit, especially with the glass boxes as tables in front of us. Another complaint is that our dinner took 3.5 hours and the food took too long to come out course after course (our reservation was at 9pm and we didn't finish dinner until 12:45am).Food was decent and the portions are pretty big. We opted for the tasting menu and also ordered an extra course of steak and dessert. The matcha lava dessert at the end was very good.Check this place out if you're looking to try a Japanese fusion restaurant. However, beware that the tasting menu could take up 3.5 hours of your time.","One sentence to sum up of how our high expectation has been gradually eroded till utterly exhausted: service is unbearably bad.Service quality: awful. We were very respectful, but all we received is an indifferent attitude and a condescending face. We ordered beef steak, but she ""assumed"" that we would like it medium rare.Interestingly enough, we thought she happened to have a bad day and temporarily suspended her smile, yet she seemed to have a ""special"" attitude reserved for us. Again, my friends and I were being polite and patient throughout the entire dinner.Food: shop-koji lamb chop. If the restaurant intends to a restaurant of Asian fusion, it successively transforms that to be Asian confusion. Although I am aware that taste is very individual, the confusing mixture of sweetness and overcooked texture is stunningly bad.For those who have been thirsty for a referral, reconsider your desire. I mean it earnestly and seriously.","TLDR: Exclusive hidden restaurant on Great Jones. Modern Japanese cuisine with fantastic cocktails. Hurry, go find out which one of your friends have been here and book it!I remember the first time I went to Bohemian, I loved every second of it. Tucked to the side of a Japanese butcher shop in a nondescript hall - is Bohemian. If you've heard of Bohemian, you must be referred by a friend. Fortunately, I knew someone who had dined here.The cocktails as is common at many Japanese bars, are made with incredible detail. It's mesmerizing watching your drink be created.There is an a la carte menu but go with the tasting menu. It's roughly $70 pp but so worth it.The Uni Croquette is what croquettes should strive to be. Perfectly crispy, this creamy mushroom mixture with that mousse-like uni. The steak tartare here is probably my favorite steak tartare anywhere. Here it's served on this board with some greens and the tartare is already spread on your toast and ready to go. Fatty, delicious raw wagyu spread over cheese toast. It's the type of stuff you dream about.The pan-roasted branzino while so simple, is just absolutely delicious. In short, if you love great food - this is a restaurant you need to try.It's definitely gotten more difficult to book here over the last couple years.","We had high expectations after reading the reviews but were disappointed. We tried the tasting menu.Fresh vegetable fondue 3Good but not as impressive as the reviews say.Croquette3The uni was unpleasantly fishy.Beef sashimi5So flavorful and tender that it melts in the mouth.

Slider4Very tasty and quite big for a sliderSashimi bowl1Worse than any poke bowl I've ever had. Fish was dry and over seasoned. Rice was too sour. Please avoid!Matcha pistachio icecream3Very rich and textured but too heavy to my taste The vibe is definitely homey but the chairs are very uncomfortable.If I ever return, it's for the branzino.","My second time at this exclusive establishment and I will continue to come back. The price is not for the faintest of heart but for those who are willing to, please definitely keep your mind open and taste buds ready.Although small and quaint, I love the decor and environment. More of an intimate vibe. Now I'm not a biggie when it comes to vegetables, but the fondue fresh veggies was honestly AMAZING! I have never finished a plate of veggies so fast in my life. And let me tell you about their Washu Beef Steak! HEAVEN! Honestly, the best perfect combination of medium rare and simple seasoned steak I will ever taste. This is really grilled with love, blood, sweat and tears. To be quite frank, to each their own when it comes to this restaurant.

887,"The name is no alleged exaggeration as the dumplings are large and resonate good quality.  As a recluse I was promptly seated at a table and was serviced moderately.  I actually received a glass of water.  This cafe is located in Flatiron/Chelsea outside of Chinatown and accessible by F train at 23rd Street station.  As I sat near the window newspaper mastheads of past high praised reviews cited from New York Times, Zagat and Time Out New York are affixed to the window along with photos of various entrees.  Dumplings warms the heart and awaken the inner spirit as a simple lunch.  Takeout menu is available for grabs.蝦餃 (haa1 gaau2) $7.50Five pieces of large shrimp dumplings shaped in vintage Chinese sycee coin pouch but the thin skin was annoyingly sticking to the paper of the Dim Sum bamboo steamer.小籠包 (xiao long bao) $8.25Six juicy Shanghainese pork soup dumplings were a delight.燒賣 (siu1 maai2) $7.50Five large crab meat, pork and mushroom dumpling were filling.","Ehh more like ""just okay"" dumplings. For the Chelsea neighborhood they are okay but also they are simply waaaaay too expensive for what you're getting. I died a little bit inside when I realised I was paying $8.25 for 7 steamed seafood dumplings and $3.90 for a scallion pancake. The scallion pancake itself was oily, and not pleasantly so. There was no satisfying crunch when eating it and the flavour was a bit flat to me. While the filling of the dumplings was tasty, the dumplings themselves were not that juicy and their skin a bit too thick for my liking. Overall, I'd rather make the trek to Chinatown the next time I have a craving for dumplings/ dim sum.","It's unfortunate how rude and hostile the lady at the  cashier counter is. I came to pick up my food but she said it wasn't ready and told me to call Grubhub for a refund because the food I want is unavailable. When I called GrubHub, Grubhub mention that the lady refuse to give me a refund. How hypocritical of her! She could've simply just told me that she denies the refund rather than waste my time to call Grubhub only to go back into the store and dispute it. Of course Grubhub/Yelp side with her because that's the only way they make money - by charging the restaurant a fee per order.  I'm not upset that that the food is unavailable or the denied refund. I'm just disgusted at the lady's hostility but I see that she's nice to men thus most likely she's insecure about herself and treat other women like shit to compensate for her insecurities. I really hope she reads this review and change for the better so future customers don't reap the repercussions of an insecure lady. Good luck angry, insecure lady.","Just like their name, excellent dumpling house is absolutely excellent. Their pork soup dumplings are for sure their best seller and reason to visit.

It's one of the best desserts I've ever tasted!","Wow I don't think I've ever had such an amazing Korean fusion meal in my life!!! My fellow foodie friend summarized our experience here perfectly: it's memorable, it's affordable, and their menu changes seasonally so there's always something new to try.They only have one price: $46 for a three-course prix fixe menu. If you come here with a group of 4-5 people, you'll have tried everything on the menu that day. My 2 friends and I each chose different dishes. Ratings are as follows:* Leek: 5/5 (you can really taste the black truffle that's sprinkled on top)* Beef Tartare: 4/5* Yellowtail: 5/5* Egg: omg I'd give this 1000 stars if I could! The egg was so creamy and soft, almost like the texture of crème brûlée. You don't even have to get it with the fresh sea urchin which is $20 extra because there's some sea urchin purée mixed in with the egg which already gives the egg SO much flavor and texture.* Sunchoke: 5/5* Endive: 2/5 (only because the shrimp was nothing special and slightly disappointing when compared to how unique the other dishes were)* Pork Belly: 4/5 (the enoki mushrooms on top were the perfect touch)* Octopus: 3/5 (chewy and tender but not much ""Korean fusion"" to it - reminded me more of a Spanish dish)* Mackerel: 4/5* Sujeonggwa Granita: also would give this 1000 stars if I could. I never knew sujeonggwa could go so well with burrata!* Ginger Panna Cotta: 5/5 (amazing with the grapefruit they add to it but if you're deciding between the two desserts, definitely get the Sujeonggwa Granita!)Oh, and I can't forget about the seaweed chips they gave us right before the meal.

We opted in to start with oysters which came with a traditional mignonette and, the best part, a spicy kimchi sauce in a little bottle. Yum!! Stand out dishes were the crab and the octopus although everything we tried was great! You have a choice of rice with your meal, plain rice or the rice special if the day. Our rice special was a seaweed rice and we both got it and were very glad we did. It was accompanied by two kimchis, the broccoli rabe one was the most unique.

The first thing that came up in my mind was the Taco Shop.  Reservation is effortless since you can do it on yelp or their official website.  Their unlimited brunch for tacos or drinks is on the weekends only.  It was $24.00 for unlimited tacos and $18.00 for unlimited drinks for 1.5 hours.  1 taco here is about $4.00 usually.Food: I had about 12 tacos in total, and I was in love with the Baja Fish tacos and the pork belly tacos.  The Baja Fish is very soft, and it's delicious if you enjoy eating fish/seafood.  The pork belly tends to melt in my mouth, and it was so good.  I was not hungry the whole day after this bottomless brunch!Overall: I would come here when I have a craving for tacos.  But I would not come here daily.",This place was ok. Taco's were basic but they have a killer deal for happy hour:3 tacos + 1 margarita = $15I got a frozen mango margarita and it was pretty good.,The Taco Shop
890,"Ahh Boqueria, I wanted to love you.Let me start by saying this is a review based on my Boozy Brunch experience. The Tapas were all very good. I had the Pan Con Tomate Con Jamon, the Escalivada, Croquetas De Setas, and the Tortilla Espanola. Drinks (sangria) were spot on as well. Everything was almost perfect until my breakfast paella came out so burned it was blackened at the top. When I asked if this was normal I was assured that this is the way it's suppose to be. But in looking at others paella it was not nearly as crispy aka burned as mine. Needless to say I left extremely disappointed. I'm not sure I'd be willing to give them a second chance because when I questioned the appearance of my paella, I was essentially lied to. Not cool Boqueria, not cool.","I wrote a particularly crappy review some time ago. I was younger, an arrogant little douchebag of a chef back from 6 months in Spain, and angry at the death of my father.This review was a mistake and by all analysis a tantrum at nothing and no one in particular. I want to update the review since I've grown and snuck back in like a coward to eat again. The food is phenomenal, the service is great, and it made me feel like I was stopping for something to eat while wandering around Barcelona. The chef Marc Vidal even sent me a letter I ignore at the time through yelp, I also regret that. At no point in my incoherent ravings about authenticity should I have ever tried to analyze a chefs food as if I'm from the country he is from.Furthermore on top of that, authenticity is fleeting at best. My family's spaetzle is long, dense, filled with herbs and cheese and has teeth to it. Other people have spaetzle that is short, fluffy etc.. What I'm saying is food isn't quantifiable by authenticity, as it changes from person to person before it even approaches region to region. This place is great. Please don't be like me. Don't be an idiot and use this as a shoebox for your own insecurities.","I've heard lots of good reviews about Boqueria but unfortunately I was not very impressed. One, the service is mediocre in that they took too long and it was hard for us to get the server's attention. Secondly and more importantly I wasn't really impressed by the food. The portions are too scanty and the prices are too expensive given the portions. We ordered a cheese and charcuterie plate, patatas bravas, bombas de barceloneta, tortilla Española, and another dish with fried quail egg on top. Aside from the bombas they were all just average. Even the basic tortilla I've had so much better at other less known spots. I suppose I shouldn't be too surprised. Boqueria did sort of make tapas restaurants a bit more up to par with the usual Manhattan 'it' spots. But if you ask me, I'd rather go to El Quinto Pino or even Casa Mono.","I went here with a friend for lunch and overall, I can say that I did really like this place as long as you order the right tapas! I guess that is the fun part of tapas- if you don't like one it's okay because it can easily be replaced with another :). I was debating between 3 or 4 stars but the drinks were good and strong so I rounded up to 4. In order of most to least favorite, here's what we ordered-Croquetas Cremosas- 4.5/5- take note that there's 6 in total and 3 are mushroom and 3 are ham. Personally, I think the mushroom croquettes is significantly better (I've frequented the Bryant Park location before and remembered this). The ham isn't bad but they put this sweet jelly in it that makes it off-putting to me. Ham is always supposed to be salty in my mind. Luckily, you can order just 6 of the mushroom (or 6 of the ham if that's what your heart desires). They're creamy, the right amount of crunchy for the exterior, and definitely a great starter. Pinxtos Morunos- 4.5/5- in other words, these are lamb skewers haha. You get two with some bread and salsa verde (which tasted like pesto to me, though I'm not complaining). Though I wish the portions were bigger, the skewers were cooked perfectly and didn't even need any condiments/bread which is how you know that it was done correctly IMHO- no need for the fluff! Gambas al Ajillo- 3.5/5- I liked this dish but I can't say I loved it. It was served piping hot on a skillet but unfortunately that means that the dish can become very dry later on (which the shrimp did but luckily the garlic sauce didn't). There's more than enough shrimp and sauce and it's a great dish to get more bang for your buck but it didn't exactly stand out to me.Pan con Tomate- 3.0/5- literally just bread with tomato. Very average, not sure why my friend insisted on ordering this. The bread also got very hard very quickly (no pun intended). Datiles con Beicon- 3.0/5- I had high hopes for this but unfortunately was left disappointed. Dates are great, bacon is great, but they're not meant to be together (at least for me).","Incredible, incredible experience! Went here for an impromptu date night and they fortunately had one table left for two on a Saturday night. The service was very good, in case that matters to you- super attentive. Now onto the food:WOW. Neither my boyfriend nor I have historically enjoyed tapas because of the expense for a small amount of food, but these dishes were phenomenal! Ranking:1. Garlic shrimp - I've had a lot of garlic shrimp in my time, and this is BY FAR the best. The oil is incredible and spiced to perfection. I ordered more bread to soak it all up because it was that good. The shrimp was tender and not stringy at all, and packed with flavor. The show stopper!2. Peppers - this was such a fun dish! Delicious large flakes of salt and no spice at all in the peppers. Just great flavors and a fun little snack.3. Spinach - lemony and full of pine nuts. Delicious! But not super unique, although it was a pretty big portion which was nice.4. Lamb meatballs - this was undeniably tasty, but the meatballs were kind of dry even when heaping on the sauce. A little disappointing.Other call outs - the drinks (cider and draft Spanish beer) were incredibly smooth and very tasty!The flan was incredible! I've never liked flan but I would 100% get this again because it was not overwhelmingly sweet as some others I've had.","This review is for Churros only. Because... when you walk past this place, who can resist?!We have had the regular ones and the ones with nutella. I work a block away so we'll pick up food somewhere and drag ourselves by to order churros to go.The wait is long for them, so order ahead if you come.While waiting, I perused the menu and it looked delicious but it was pretty pricey. The place was adequately busy for a mid week lunch, so I'm sure its a great spot. Seriously. Get the churros.",Boqueria Flatiron
891,"Dinner alfresco would've been perfect without the sidewalk performer who situated himself next to our table. His guitar amp was state-of-the-art powerful, but he only knew ""Killing Me Softly"" (mostly knew). None of the other diners was gonna break first and confront him. I was ready to stick a fork in my ear, so after two glasses of courage, I mustered the wherewithal to do what should've been done an hour ago (ask the manager to ask him to stop).Packing up, he mentioned overhearing me talk about wine and informed me that my disdain for merlot was ""so five minutes ago."" I'm into writing this Yelp review right now hearing/not hearing him, and my date just returned from the powder room.","Loved the cauliflower appetizer, which oddly tasted like a pizza with the sauces used, but was absolutely delicious. Didn't love the shakshoukas - the Mexican one had a weird sour sauce to it, but the one with sausage wasn't bad.Was able to walk in for a Sunday brunch and no reservation around noon without a wait. All the outdoor seating was taken already but there was plenty of indoor seating.",Was amazing food ! But me and my sister was forced to seat down and order fast and we were hurried to get out of the place ! The person who welcomed us and I'm sure it was manger too with glasses were very rude and judge-mental ! Food is good but service terrible ! They think they 10 star restaurant or something !,"I passed by this place nearly daily for two years before finally checking in and was immediately upset I had waited so long to stop in! It's super cozy and warm inside and has this open oven where you can watch them cooking your food. The menu is standard Mediterranean fare and pretty good. If you're in Hell's Kitchen, this place is worth checking out and makes a good spot in the fall/winter thanks to its cozy atmosphere.","That lamb kabob pot pie...wow. As a 1st generation middle eastern, I've never had quite such amazing spiced on a kabob like that. The bread was AMAZING and I loved the knafeh...some of the best I've had in the states. The only reason I'm not giving Taboon higher than 3 stars is for service. We made an online reservation for dinner before seeing a Broadway show, and the morning of, I called to ask if they had any later tables other than what was online. The woman on the phone told me it was okay as they had 1 table near the door that they could seat me at 1 hour later at my desired time. No problem! Our taxi got stuck in traffic and I called to let them know I was on my way but 10 min behind. The woman on the phone said it was not a problem...however, when I got there, she informed me I missed my reservation from an hour before, and said it was never modified! Even when I asked why she didn't mention it on the phone when I called to say I was late, she said she was confused so she didn't say anything. She then told me they had 1 table near the door she could seat me at that was available...yes, that's the one I agreed to...Besides the fact that she said that we have to get up within an hour and a half because another reservation was after us (pressure), our waiter was nearly nonexistent. You'd think that if you want to push people out quickly that you'd be super attentive? THIRTY MINUTES for wine is just ridiculous. If you can succumb confused and inattentive servers and want amazing food, then this is the place.","I've been to Taboonette a few times but only recently found out that they have a higher-end spot, too. Taboon was absolutely amazing. My party of 4 shared:+ Taboon trio - awesome + saganaki - incredible, and it arrives on fire + Braised oxtail Scarpinocc - awesome+ Shish barak - awesome+ Lamb merguez - great+ Crispy fresh squid - great + Terra cotta lamb kebabs - awesome + Crab shawarma - only thing I didn't like + Silan - I'm not usually one for halva but this was like cotton candy that melted in your mouthGreat service. This place really is a gem.",Taboon
892,The only thing good about this place is the music...I ordered the lamb Biryani...the lamb was really dry. The service was unfriendly and unprofessional. I told the staff about the lamb but he completely ignored my comment.,Nice cozy Indian Gastropub in the heart of West Village. The drinks are really good but the food is average.,"I would give zero stars if Yelp would let me. Horrible service, strange/inconsistent gratuity policy, and unreasonable prices for what you're actually getting. We were here last night, and the place was freezing so I asked for my old fashioned without ice. It should have been easy, but the server was rude and judgmental about my simple request. She didn't seem to want to give me a drink without ice for some reason. When I got my drink, it was basically a small shot of whiskey. Someone else in the group ordered the same drink (with ice) and said his drink tasted very watered down, in addition to having a ton of ice in it. For $16, I feel like we should be getting more. This place charges as much as the real cocktail places and gives you way less. We went to The Garrett and got a real old fashioned afterwards. Food was okay but portions were very small for the price. If you're with a group of four or more, I definitely recommend checking your bill for added gratuity. The menu indicates that 18% gratuity is automatically added for groups of 6 or more, which is standard and totally reasonable. But we were a group of five, and we saw that our bill said we were a group of 6 and added 18% gratuity. Our server was awful so I really wanted to leave 15% or so rather than 18-20%. We pointed out that the menu stated only that gratuity would be added for groups of 6 or more, and we were only five people, and the server started arguing with us that they always charge gratuity for groups of four or more and that ""it doesn't really matter."" Umm yes it does. She eventually agreed to take the gratuity off and we left a smaller tip to reflect the poor service received. She then kicked us out at 11:40pm, telling us they were already closed, even though their closing time is listed as 12am. You can't be ""already closed"" 20 minutes before closing time... that makes no sense. After that, I honestly wish we had left zero tip. Our server was awful, and we won't be back.","DELICIOUS FOOD AND GREAT SERVICE !!!And I loved the ambience a lot !  Dunken Munkey is a cute , small and functional place to have dinner. It's Perfect for a Date because the atmosphere is Cool and Cozy , or simply enjoy good food and cocktails with Friends.The Food is Very Tasty, and the presentation is very Nice !  Plus the idea of giving a Welcome Amuse  makes me feel appreciated as a Client and it was a very savory bite.  All the Cocktails are Creative and they look very  Fancy!  Drunken Munkeys is Matchless.  I will be visiting often because they have lot of things  in the menu to pair with the Drinks !  GIVE IT A TRY , You won't regret it !","Very much enjoyed my dinner at Drunken Munkey, food and drink were top notch.  The paneer is a high point on the menu, it is delicious. I won't say it's the best Indian food I've ever had, because that wouldn't be honest, but I certainly have no complaints. This is a small and nicely decorated space. Would be great to bring a date here and hang for a few hours while enjoying your meal and your company.  I would definitely come back again .... but if you are purely about wanting the best Indian food possible in the city, this wouldn't be my destination. I know this sounds like a mixed review, but it's not intended to be.  I would definitely recommend Drunken Munkey without hesitation.","Night out with my husband. Found this ""not your average"" indian cuisine restaurant with quite an atmospheric interior. Food is great: flavourful and well seasoned. Had Dahi Pani Puri, fun to eat traditional street food; Chicken Samosa wrapped in flaky and crispy dough; for main course - Whole Branzino, fresh and simply delicious. Special shut out to bartender Gabriel. We requested drinks that were not on the menu: Benediction, The Last Word (mezcal classic) and he made them perfect.  Overall, had amazing time; would definitely come back",The Drunken Munkey - West Village
893,"Standard Vietnamese in Chinatown. We shared an order of the spring rolls and summer rolls to start. I had the chicken pho and the BF had the pork chop vermicelli. The meat on both dishes wasn't very good and the bathroom wreaked of moth balls, hence the two star review.","A disappointing order...I ordered the calamari, which I had already gotten previously, and it was definitely overfried and the texture was a bit soggy- it definitely tasted like it had been sitting out a while. They had run out of bahn mi so we had to order chicken and vegetables over rice, which was extremely tasteless and dry- had to add sriracha just to make it taste like something. The pork noodles were alright but different than the last time I ordered- more like a pork loaf than real grilled pork. Overall, a disappointing order...",Pros: 1) brought food very fast; 2) nice decoration; 3) in the rainy day they have a separate basket for umbrellas Cons: 1) too expensive for this quality of food; 2) waiters doesn't smile at all.Will not come back to here.,"This is our go-to Vietnamese spot in Chinatown. Usually once a month return customer. Quick, not super crowded. Reliable service and clean restaurant. Take out is surprisingly fast.Usually order the bun with grilled pork or beef, can't go wrong. They even add the fried spring roll to the order for an extra $1 or so. Also pretty much all the pho with beef. I especially like the tendon and tripe.","I'm used to going to Baxter street for phos as the street has mostly vietnamese restaurants. They may be okay for the sandwiches but I was never able to find a place that serves good pho so I stopped going to that street. And someone recommended this restaurant for having a great pho and I fell in love with it.The restaurant is spacious with very flashy decor and really friendly staff. I had no complaint about the pho. The soup was not as greasy and had less MSG than most other vietnamese restaurants. The noodles were really fresh and I didn't feel heavy after having their pho. Also, I ordered vietnamese coffee thinking it was served like iced coffee but they actually brought out the espresso thing with a cup filled with ice along with condensed milk. It was totally authentic! I had never seen anything like that before. It was freshly brewed espresso and I had to wait until it finished dripping and mix it with ice and condensed milk myself. It was so good. This authentic vietnamese restaurant is now my go to pho restaurant in the city.","Maybe cuz I was hungry or just wanted to crave Vietnamese food...this place really hit the spot.  Service was better than most and at the least, more attentive.  All wait staff can service you, it was not specific to one server.  But remember, we're in Chinatown so that is not what they are known for in any place -- just saying.  So this place is sufficient and pleasant.It was close to 8:30PM on a weeknight, but that didn't seem to matter.  They were not rushing to close and in fact, was serving an almost packed house even at this late hour.  I passed by here a few times before but never visited until today.  I was in search of quick / casual dining and wanted to stay near the train station.  It is 2 mins away from the Grand St. Subway - prime spot.  The menus had your typical Vietnamese classic fare - Pho and Rice plates.  Done and Done.  Hubby ordered the Pho - there were quite a few beef options when it came to picking the type of beef but overall, same broth/same noodles - all were good selections.   The Pho we tried, the beef brisket was more on the rare side which we liked very much.  Great broth too.  I opted for the Grilled chicken over rice - simple and easy.  It was juicy and tender enough to not have to cut with effort.  Both dishes were solid - this surprised me given it compared to the fav haunts I venture to, usually over on Baxter Street.  I had to order the classic soda w/ egg yolk...my favorite in Vietnamese drinks.  So bellies full and satisfied.  Very good eats here.  No complaints; I shall return.  :-)",Pho Vietnam
894,"This is purely for take out. Stopped in to get a scone. Included was a tiny container for cream and jam. Asked for another, was told extra was $.25 more. I get if I was asking for 4 more. But really felt like they were buckle and dining. And considering RE scone is $4. Can't imagine, would they charge extra if I sat in and asked for more condiments as well?Not sure the extra $.25 was worth an unhappy customer and a bad review. But that's the choice they have made.

We got a pot of black tea, two glasses of wine and scones while were there.The wine we got free thanks to the check in on yelp!! The scones of the day that we picked were a plain and I can't really remember what the other flavor was. I do remember that they were both very good. I would go back for the scones alone.","Alice's Tea Cup  (ORIGINAL LOCATION) OVERALL: 6.7/10I would rate @teaandsympathynycbetter than this location.

My husband and I took our daughter to the Natural History Museum and this was nearby. Unfortunately, we did not have an opportunity to eat here due to our stroller. The place was almost empty when we arrived as we came midday. We had our small travel stroller and was asked to fold it up prior to having them put it away. While the babyzen folds up well, I wasn't in the mood to take everything out of the stroller just to have tea and scones when there were other more stroller friendly places to eat nearby, so we went elsewhere to eat. However, a search here on Yelp shows a picture of a stroller stored that wasn't folded up? Anyway, just wanted to add another note about their stroller policy for anyone who is looking for a ""kid friendly"" place.",Alice's Tea Cup
895,"1-star only for the environment and views, nothing else to complement. Usually, I provide feedback out of good experiences for other people to take a chance and adventure something new, yet this case is the total opposite. I was fooled when I saw the 4-star on this restaurant, so I just wanted the consumers to be aware. Fish is not necessarily fresh and was flat in quality. My salmon was clearly defrosted. Then, other sir start whispering to the bartender on what was fresh (I was shocked since due to te location and specialty I would've thought everything was fresh). The asparagus badly cooked and even the fries tasted bad (I could taste other seafood been fried on the same oil before). Overall service horrible: 40 minutes to get I tricking grilled fish and fries. And not even a comment on the status. Never coming back. So many good places in manhattan, this is just below average.,","Had dinner here. Ordered a glass of wine and the PEI mussels. I have had PEI mussels numerous times and what I had last night was anything, but PEI. They were thawed very small, flat, dry mussels. Very little white juice (not sure if it was reduced with white wine). Wine was not the wine I know. Too sweet for piniot grigio. Bread was served with packaged butter and olive oil. No salt/pepper. The bill came with a $2 added to the price of wine. I was expecting additional charges since this is the norm in the restaurant industry. It's a waste of money.",Shrimp and Chicken was burnt. The place was hot. The privilege customers got what they wanted! All customers should be treated the same. Will not recommend this place for anyone visiting New York,"Excellent food !  Excellent service !  I had the steak and lobster meal ...  The steak was wonderfully cooked and taste of real meat and no added sauces or too much salt or pepper to the beef.   It was definitely one of the best steak I ever had !  The lobster was cooked to perfection and tasted fresh from the ocean ...  The price is exactly right for the venue, location and food quality, but the service is truly the best !","The location is nice and if you want to sit out near the water and enjoy a bit then this is your place. However, the food was just ok. The best part of the meal was the French onion soup, which was really good. The portobello mushroom was good but it was not fresh mozzarella as advertised. It was pretty chewy and the spinach needed seasoning. The dish could have used some garlic and salt. The stuffed shrimp was good, not great and also could have used some seasoning.All in all, an ok restaurant, that I would grab a drink at with the soup and enjoy the view.","This place was a last minute choice. My friend and I knew we wanted to sit on the water and find something healthy. We sat outside and was served a hard, but soft bread with butter packets. We also had the choice of dipping our bread in extra virgin olive oil, but there were no seasoning to mix it with. For our appetizer, we started with the Miramar spicy shrimp for $18. It only came with 6 butterfly shrimp surrounding arugula leaves. What a waste of of money. It literally tasted like shrimp thrown into buffalo sauce. Don't get me wrong... it was good, but definitely not worth $18. For my entree, I ordered the seafood kabob. It included shrimp, scallops, salmon, a piece of red pepper, a small onion slice, a few whole mushrooms, and plain white rice. I thought it was delicious, but was it really worth $31? Nah. But I probably would get it again LOL it tasted really good with the yogurt that is primarily used for the beef kabob. My friend ordered the stuffed shrimp. It was literally fried crab cakes, stuffed into shrimp, sided along asparagus, and on top of eggplant. Thank god, I didn't order it, because I did not find it appetizing. She only ate it because she did not want to waste another $31. I don't think she will be back.",Miramar
