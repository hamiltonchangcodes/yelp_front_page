0,"Mominette was a last minute brunch pick in Brooklyn after we realized we weren't really ready for Bagatelle's ""enhanced"" presentation. If we're ranking strictly on food, 4 stars largely because although the food was a bit lacking in seasoning/flavor, it was certainly prepared well. The steak and eggs were decent; got the eggs poached and they came, well, poached (most places end up with this bizarre kinda-hard-boiled thing), and the steak itself was tender if not exactly the most exciting to my tongue. And although bacon is bacon, this bacon rocked... don't know why; it just did.Minus one for charged refills per short glass. No cans or bottles delivered to the table, so we had no idea it was canned/bottled until after I questioned the check for having four diet cokes on it for one person (me). For all I know, one can yielded two glasses delivered to the table (seemed that way. Fresh ice each refill in an 8oz glass, standard cans are 12oz).Minus one for service defects more generally. Largely just tone/approach with a larger party, but I suppose I might be embittered by the mishandling of drinks above.Two stars. Probably not coming back, but I'll check in on reviews the next time I'm in Brooklyn and see if it's worth a repeat trip for me.",This is a cute little place in Brooklyn. They were out of several items. Service was rushed.,"The worst!!! Everything!!! Food, service atmosphere dirty!! Employs hung over ""messing up orders""","Came here for a dinner and first thing I want to mention: they charge 3% extra if you pay with card. This information came out only once we got check, which is kinda unfair to the customers. You should write down this anywhere, so ppl know. I would highly recommend to make reservation if you planning to come, this place is pretty busy. I like that French ppl were around, good sign as well. We were welcomed by the very nice host, since we came earlier then our reservation, we were offered to say next to the bar. The bartender was very nice attentive and skilled. I got their signature cocktail with mezcal ( smoky garden, not sure), loved it and the presentation , that goes with little dry rose in it. For the starters we ordered escargot, delicious!- not mushy , not chewy , perfectly done with well balanced amount of garlic, herbs, and oil. We also tried salmon tartar, which goes with potato chips and little arugula salad, what could be better fresh and well seasoned fish. My husband tried lobster bisque - I would not recommend, it should goes with pieces of lobsters, we found non. The taste is too fishy. For the main course I got pesto pasta with portobello mushrooms, mushrooms had ton of flavor , but their pesto would be better if they add some Parmesan for sharpness. My husband went for a burger, which was ok, good quality meat, but nothing to brag about.  For the dessert, we shared a creme brulee with extra ""fire"". The presentation is beautiful as well as a flavor. I would prefer it in a little bigger portion, though. It seemed like they are too greedy. Overall, good experience, little surprised with the information about cash/ credit billing.","So, after my large party experience here, I am like meh about this place.My dear friend hosted her bridal shower here and it was just poorly organized.We had reserved the patio for 20 people. However the party (like half) arrived early and some of us were NOT permitted inside due to ""slowing down service"" by standing In the bar area while our tables were ready. We had to wait outside in the heat for nearly 20 to 30 minutes. There was also another large party occupying the back patio. If we knew we had to wait outside, we would have notified our entire party to arrive later. We were not allowed to be in the area, like the backyard until it was the exact time of the reservation. Once we sat down, we had to pick up the tables ourselves to rearrange the party and seating the way we wanted to. Not only that, but the staff took forever to take orders, even with water! I was just confused to why everything was moving so slow? 20 people is not tooo bad. I have worked in the restaurant industry so having 3 staff to suppose 20 ladies is not bad but everything like beverages came out late. Slow to replenish water jugs and even mixing up food orders. Just seem a little sloppy for a large party in my opinion. Food was good, but not anything great. Like your typical brunch spot. Anyway. That's that.","Great French place that wasn't intimidating. We were seated outside in the back courtyard area that was really beautiful and had a lot of nice greenery and exposed brick. I started off with a cheese tasting plate that wasn't anything extraordinary. The presentation was beautiful with fruits and nuts accompanying the cheese, but the cheeses were all pretty standard things that I could have found in my Trader Joe's. I was expecting more spectacular French cheeses basically. I had a few glasses of one of their roses that was really tasty and refreshing especially on a summer night. For dinner I got the Coq au vin blanco (chicken with pasta and veggies) and it was really yummy. The chicken was literally falling off the bone. The veggies were well cooked and the pasta didn't really have sauce, but seemed to be enveloped in the chicken broth, so it wasn't super savory. As this was my first time having French food, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was satisfied with my meal overall and the restaurant was super cute. The meals are a little pricey, so I would recommend this place for a special occasion.",Mominette
1,"I know I am late to the party, but it was my first time visiting this establishment! I took my mom for her birthday and let's just say, now I know why everyone raves about the FOOD! We even took ordered food to take home for later!",Pros- just about everything on the menu taste amazing. I have no complaints at all when it comes to the food.Cons- way too smallDrinks are weak (atleast to me)Long waits Honestly everyone should give this place a try. Its def not good for large groups.,"First time trying Nashville Hot Chicken and boyyyyyy when they say hot, they mean HOTTTTTTT. Place was very busy on a Friday morning so we sat at the bar. Service wasn't that friendly but in such a small place that packs out easily, I can get it being stressful. Their brunch drink specials were nice and affordable. I got a Nashville hot chicken sandwich while my boyfriend ordered some sort of breakfast platter with fried chicken as the main, he got his extra hot. Food was tasty but we both wished they gave us bigger plates, had to remove dishes in order to eat our orders more comfortably. Meals were a bit pricy but worth it. We had terrible stomach aches at the end of the night, but also ate elsewhere during the day, so we're unsure of where we got it from. Just mentioning it in case someone comes & has the same issue.","How did they get it so perfectly crispy?? What is IN the aioli? It's so good. The buns are also perfect, they don't get soggy while you eat the sandwich, and I felt like I was finally an adult capable of eating a real burger / sandwich without it becoming a sloppy mess.We waited about 15 minutes for a table, and got the perfect cozy corner by the window. Everyone seemed to know everyone else. The sweet potato fries were my favorite side. The ""hot"" chicken was the perfect amount of spice. The cornbread was dry, but we felt like the sandwich made up for it. Our server was great. The only issue was that I couldn't stop eating because the texture was just too good. It's sort of expensive (ah, NYC sandwiches for $17) but hot damn it's worth it.","Saturday evening at about 7pm with a party of 4 we did not have a wait.  Seated promptly and the service throughout was nice and attentive.  The food however was a let down.  The breast on my chicken plate was dry (not brined?) and bland as was the cornbread.  The worst part also is that I was provided a wing as well one I asked for a mixed plate.  Word to the wise: wing is white meat, not dark.  Best part was the sweet potato fries.  My friend's mac and cheese was gritty, as if the roux has not been whisked enough.This is an example of why people like Anthony Bourdain enjoys places like Popeyes as they are consistently good when compared to hyped up places due to mass media coverage.","This place is good if you like Nashville hot chicken!Loves:+ No or short wait for Sunday dinner (some of us can't be waiting hours for brunch, ya know)+ Chicken is tasty (hot = hot!). I'd splitsies with a friend one regular and one hot.+ Nice staff.Not so love:- Mac & cheese was underwhelming- Cocktails could have been strongerI know people who live and die by this place. I'm not one of them, but still worth a visit here if you love chicken.",Peaches HotHouse
2,"A GEM. This restaurant was, simply put, amazing. The service, the ambiance, the decor, the FOOD. Oh my God- the FOOD! The flavor was nothing short of mind blowing. I haven't enjoyed a meal like that in many years. The drinks were also delicious. I literally can not wait to come back here. I'd give this location 10 stars if I could.EDIT***WE CAME BACK FOR THEIR BOOZY BRUNCH!It was AMAZING! The wait for a refill can be a little extensive (the wait time overall is something that can use some work but ‍) but the food was to die for.Can't wait to come back.","We were hopeful, but were twice disappointed. The first time we were informed the kitchen was backlogged at least by 45 minutes, so we didn't even stay. The second time, we sat the bar for drinks and one dish. The only redeeming factors are the drinks and the bartender - they are delicious and he appears to be the only one working hard. We ordered the brick chicken, and it took over an hour and three rounds of drinks before we asked them to put it in a to go container. That took another fifteen minutes and when we got around to eating it, it was bland and unimpressive. To rewind, once we got the food, we were considerably surprised by the bill.While the itemization was correct, we were shocked that a vodka soda was the same price as the specialty cocktails. Especially as the soda in both drinks were almost entirely flat and oddly poured from a 2-liter bottle. Seems a bit odd that an otherwise functioning bar wouldn't have a soda-dispensing machine. Will not be returning, plenty of other places to try.","Under sad (and joyous) circumstances, we'd noticed Baron's driving to a friend's passing memorial nearby coupled with music and knew that after the event, Baron's was it. They put those digs to good use. Transforming a (supposedly) former law office into a swankish but cozy-cool eatery. With the exception of a few folks at the Bar, Baron's was strangely quiet on a Thursday night. So we figured, we'd have all the service to ourselves. Menu is short, but man... it had a bit of everything and room to tweak a few items if I had to. My 'French 73' cocktail was delicate and packed a real nice punch. While hubby's Old Fashioned, was also expertly made. We shared a Mushroom Flatbread minus the pancetta. That sucker was so freaking thin---all the Mushrooms, Truffle Oil and the Parmesan made for it- bite after bite. Since our appetizer was heavenly we somehow knew, Entrees would be just as great. But here's the problem...We waited at least 40 minutes to start eating our Entrees. And during that time, Fabrice our server- blamed ""the computer"" for not sending the order to the kitchen. We made the best out of that night. And 2 drinks on the house later, we were still bopping to a funk mix of Jamiroquai, Chaka, Kool & The Gang's, ""Summer Madness"" and Depeche Mode. Mushroom & Ricotta Ravioli dish with Mint-Citrus sauce in all its simplicity- was banging and knew the chef put his foot in it. While hubby raved about his Brick Chicken with bacon and Mashed Potatoes. Fabrice threw in Dessert of my choice but at that moment I felt, we overstayed our welcome and wanted to skip having my Molten Cake there- plus, we had to trek back up to White Plains. So here's my 2¢ in all this, I feel the whole situation would've been downright awful if: (a) our server Fabrice was uptight, (b) food was dreadful, (c) Cocktails were weak or (d) the place wasn't charming. But that wasn't the case. Almost everything made for a solid setting....except for that long wait. And seems that based on reviews, that's Baron's only downfall......so why not do anything about it? My Chocolate Molten Cake? That bad boy was freaking oozing delicious. In the end, it was real nice checking out Baron's on the fly. If I'm in the area, I'd come back.","A GEM. This restaurant was, simply put, amazing. The service, the ambiance, the music, the decor- the FOOD. Oh my God- the FOOD! The flavor was nothing short of mind blowing. I haven't enjoyed a meal like that in many years. The drinks were also delicious. I literally can not wait to come back here. I'd give this location 10 stars if I could.",From (9/13/2019)My fiancée and I came in at 10:03pm (I know this specifically because when it hit 10pm on the dot we decided to walk next door and grab oysters and drinks) and left at 10:40pm when our self-respect and common sense kicked in and we realized we had no food or drinks .  In the almost 40 minutes the lowlights included:-sparklers going out in champagne bottle like a nightclub to a 15-20top with flutes.-the people next to us got their check closed before we were even approached for an order after initially sitting a solid 5-7 minutes.-and of course the breaking point of seeing another couple walk in almost 40 minutes after and get cocktails before us.We want you to succeed but you really need to step your POS (points of service) up.  Your floor manager needs to manage and your server should be more attentive in his section.  It wasn't that busy; 6-8ppl at the bar tops and 26-30 guests on the floor tops.  Highly unacceptable for a slow Friday date night.  Ended up having to drive to Moloko and got my food to go within 20 minutes of being there.  No wonder why this place is always barren.  Do better.  I emailed them in hopes they would be professional and try to rectify the manner in some capacity but a week has passed and no response so you earned your 1-star.  This place is literally attached to my building and I would rather get dressed and drive ANYPLACE else than stay in my pajamas and walk next door for this kind of treatment.,"I really was not expecting to give such a low rating.My fiancé and I made a reservation here for 530 pm tonight to celebrate Father's Day with our parents. We were excited to check this place out after seeing the high ratings and pictures of the cocktails and food. Upon entering, the restaurant was empty however by the time we were leaving every seat except the bar seats were taken. (Tables are decently spaced out so you can't really say that it was so packed and there were soo many people-- in hopes of trying to find a reason for the extremely slow and poor service.) I loved the ambience right away and we were initially warmly greeted. However, the quality of the service quickly declined. We waited way too long for each round of drinks, our appetizers, and our entrees. We received the wrong drink for one of the drinks we ordered and when we brought it to our waitress' attention she said ""Oh"" and walked away. We didn't know whether to expect a new drink or what? Maybe 15 minutes later we finally got the right one.While we were eating our entrees our empty and dirty plates from our appetizers were still standing on the table. We ordered coffee with our dessert but ended up finishing our coffee and then waiting another 15 minutes afterwards before we canceled our dessert order. Once again, our waitress said ""oh, okay, sorry"" when we asked to cancel our dessert and just asked for the check. Really didn't seem like she was bothered much.We also couldn't help but overhear a couple next to us also sound annoyed and cancel their order and ask for their check as well. There are some positive aspects of this place:- Happy hour from 5-7 pm with great discounts on cocktails - A free house wine (red or white) when you check in on Yelp- Food was great, with the exception of the duck being totally burnt and you really couldn't escape that flavor as much as you tried to enjoy it (all you can taste was the extremely charred outer layer ) - Interior decor and ambience However, the service was ridiculously bad and they really did not seem bothered by it at all.",Baron's

Supa Dupa Fly",A peice of home in Brooklyn coming from Louisiana this by far the closest taste of home a southern girl can get,A taste of Louisiana comes to Washington Avenue and I'm here for it!!!!!  This place and the food is legit!  The chef is from Louisiana and he has bbq shrimp on the menu.  That is my dream food and the chef does it justice!!!!  Oh and that dessert cup -  what?!!!!! Hell to the yes!!!I can't wait to come back and try the gumbo.  I hope one day they will add chargrilled oysters!!,"Came here before a comedy show nearby in an extremely hot summer day. Luckily, we didn't have to wait too long!I ordered the fried oyster platter and there was an ABUNDANCE of oysters on the plate. The fries were good and crispy. But the star is the oysters - these were the best fried oysters I've ever had! Perfect batter, perfect cook time. These things were crispity crunchity on the outside and juicy succulent on the inside. I'm salivating thinking about it, tbh.My boyfriend got the fried shrimp plaster - perfectly cooked as well. One of our friends got the gumbo and she's from NOLA and have it two thumbs up, a high praise since she makes gumbo herself on the reg.Definitely want to go back cus now I can't stop thinking about them oysters!!!!","If you are around the area, I HIGHLY recommend coming by and trying this place out! The place itself is really small (it fits maybe 10/14 people at once) but the food was bomb! My boyfriend and I got the following:Half a Dozen of Oysters: the oysters were bigger than average and it was really FRESH! Seafood & Okra Gumbo ($16.00): the portion of this was a bit on the smaller side but the taste was definitely there. There were blue crabs, gulf shrimps, oysters, okra and steamed rice in the gumbo. If you absolutely cannot eat spicy, I would not order this since there is a kick of spice in it. Crawfish Etouffee ($20.00): this was def the most hearty dish of the night! The sauce was cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this! The portion is good too.Barbequed Shrimp ($22.00): It is kind of pricey for 6 shrimps but it is worth it! The shrimps are high and the Worcestershire butter sauce is to die for! It comes with a side of bread for you to dip in the sauce. Must try!When we got the bill, they gave us complimentary cafe du monde panna cotta which was delicious! Besides the food being amazing, the service was great as well. We are definitely coming back to try the other items on their menu!","Very cozy spot with extremely personable employees. It may have been the day of the week or happy hour, but we got a great deal on oysters. Drinks were cool. Loved the food. At first the bowl with my gumbo looked really small, but it's actually quite filling. My friend and I were joking about how good the food was, yet it felt really light on the stomach. Somehow the chef figured out how to make tasty, Southern fare that fills you up but doesn't leave you feeling sluggish.",Lowerline
4,"This was the worst experience. I spent almost $300 just to get unwashed and smelling shrimp and crab legs. Food arrived way too fast and was warm. When we spoke to the waitress, she did not apologize or get us help. I was sick to my stomach. No one from my group finished their food.",Horrible service and rude guard at front door . Very strange makes you feel like there is a dicey bar inside with fights happening not the boil place Would not advise to go to this location especially if you don't like the loud music,My daughter and I was in the mood for some seafood and saw that Claw Daddy's was close to Target. We didn't know we needed a reservation and the hostess was not frat all. She sat us by the bathroom which was not a good impression for a first timer. We asked the hostess if there's was another table and she said no. So my daughter and left to find another place to find goos sea food.,SO much fun!  Went with 4 people for the Claw Feast!  Be ready to work and crack and splash and get some great stains on your clothes!  THE FOOD IS SO DAMNNNNN GOOD!  I recommend 110%,"Not very interested in their food menu for the price, but the happy hour is great. Adult capri suns are tasty (albeit sweet) and they really sneak up on you so be warned! Way stronger than we anticipated. Good spot to grab a few $1 wings, a couple capri suns and kill some time before dinner or an event at Barclays. Unfortunately, due to the popularity in the neighborhood, it's increasingly hard to get a seat and/or is very crowded. Enjoyed it much more when it opened. Heads up that they don't have a full liquor license. So beer, wine, and Korean vodka only. Don't come here if you're dying for a craft cocktail (for that, hit up Sweet Polly!).","I came here with my gals to catch up. I can't recall if we had reservations but it was an early Saturday afternoon and we were seated pretty quickly. We ordered a collage of crab legs, shrimp, oysters, clams, and crawfish with a side of potatoes and corn. Unlike your other seafood boils where each person gets their own sharing; at this location, they placed everything in one bag for the table.We then ordered the adult Capri suns and I personally feel like they weren't good. It tasted like sugar water and bottom shelf vodka; it almost tasted like syrupy medicine. Maybe if they mixed it a little better it would've had a better taste on the palate.I must say the fried oysters were really good; I think they had them as add ons on the menu for $1-2.Although the food was good, the experience was underwhelming. If I ever come back it would only be to try the fried oysters again.",Claw Daddy's
5,"So sad. Walked forty minutes to find out the kitchen was closed. Had a vegan fix I needed and I thought this place could do it. They would make so much more money if they kept their kitchen open. It's a silly looking bar with a sillier name. Middle aged men pretending to be 23 serving drinks. Cheap. Not too cheap though. The crowd definitely is what you'd expect; an eclectic hodgepodge with one thing in common, alcohol and ostentatious standoffishness. Must be something in the water!","5 star brunch atmosphere!!-(but our experience was just fine.) Walked in at 11am on a super busy Sunday, tables filled with people and a live band! We took an open table and ordered coffees while looking over the menu. While ordering our meals, we were told Brunch menu items can't be modified, and that we'd only be able to add things, so I'm assuming things were not made to order(?). Sucks, as I was having brunch with a vegetarian and someone with multiple food allergies. They did have a few vegetarian options, but we wouldn't be able to customize items without meat, so choices were very limited. (tragic.) My friend with allergies originally wanted to order an item, asking it be made without avocados- but they couldn't do that for him so he ordered the biscuits. My boyfriend (vegetarian) ordered a breakfast burrito, they offered the chorizo add for meat eaters. I ordered the mushroom hash and added two poached eggs. For being pre-made or whatever the case, the food took a bit of time to come out. The server accidentally brought my boyfriend the burrito with chorizo, which he wouldn't have realized it had meat had I not tasted it first. Would've been unfortunate. :( My food -the mushroom hash- looked boring and plain with the arugula and greens on top, HOWEVER, the flavors of the beets and runny eggs and hashbrowns (with a ton of hot sauce) is something I still dream about today!! And with all the greens on my plate, it made it seem guilt free. hehe. My meal was very filling. If I ever have the time to make it back to Father's, I would order the hash again and try the chorizo patties add on. Thanks, Father's !!!","Not ADA accessible. To enter there's a step, should have a ramp option to get in. Once you're in, all the tables are high top stools. There is one lower table in the back...but it's on a platform. Not helpful if you're on crutches or in a wheel chair like myself.The food is fine, but took forever. We received appetizer after our entree - no attempt to make it right from staff. Drinks were good.  We left early as it was uncomfortable for my injury. Won't be back until it's ADA accesible.","As good as it gets for a professionally ran edgier spot in a gentrifying neighborhood. Vibe depends on the day/night, the place is popular with hipsters outspriced of Morgan/jefferson, those that priced the hipsters our and the locals that think hipsters are weird as hell.Staff is lovely. Drinks are good and fairly priced.",Fathers is such a staple in the Bushwick community. I couldn't imagine this place not existing. The food is exceptional and the people are so warm. The vibes are cool and the music is great anytime of the day! Highly Suggest!,"I might be dating myself here but you know that song that goes ""Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name and they're always glad you came..""? For those not born in the 80's, that's the intro song for the hit show Cheers. Well that's what plays in my head each and every time I walk into Father Knows Best. I've been coming here at least one night a week, for the last three years. This morning however, was my first time 'working from from home' so I decided to bring my laptop here and grab me an ice coffee. I was a bit nervous thinking I wouldn't be productive but to my surprise, I felt like I walked into a hip WeWork as there were about 15 others doing the same, all locked in their zone, and typing away on their laptops. Whether it's a Monday morning or a Saturday night, I highly recommend Fathers. Pro tip #1: Ask for Greg, he makes a mean Old Fashion. Prop tip #2: Located right off the Wilson stop on L train and they have a digital sign that tells you how far the next train is (I need one for my apartment!).",Father Knows Best
6,"Oddly, I marked this lobster place not for its lobster but for its Burger. So naturally, I had to order the burger. My wife ordered the lobster - so we could get a taste of both. Cutting straight to the chase, the lobster roll is a low return on investment. Its a lot of $$ for a small amount of lobster meat. Admittedly, neither one of us is a connoisseur of lobster meat so we couldn't really comment on the quality of that. But the bread was to die for.  BUT I strongly recommend that when you visit, at least 1 person takes the burger. It was incredibly juicy. I definitely rate the burger over the lobster meat. There. I said it. And you get 5 stars because thats not even your main dish. Red Hook Lobster *whispers, and burger* Pound","Really upset.My parents made a reservation for them and my husband and I for their lobster dinner special over the phone, took her credit card info, and did not tell her there would be penalties if we cancelled. My dad, who's almost 70 and has health issues, woke up feeling very sick so we called telling them we needed to cancel. Their response was that they were going to charge my mom's card $100, $25 per head, because of the cancellation. I've never been in this situation before with a restaurant, especially when they failed to mention this policy upon making the reservation. Finally, after an hour on the phone, they agreed to move the reservation to another day, which doesn't work all that well for any of us but we don't feel like we have any choice. Who wants to spend $100 on food you didn't eat? So, I'm going to have to re-arrange my plans and eat at a place, for the last time, that I have really enjoyed in the past. We even had their food truck at my wedding! I understand the policy, but the not mentioning it is inexcusable. And believe me, if they told my mom when she made the reservation, she'd remember because that's just who she is.This sucks.","This restaurant was incredibly dissappointing. We have a place near us in Burlingame, CA which is roughly the same price, larger, and is much much higher quality.  $26 for something half the size of my fist is crazy, especially with the sheer oiliness of the bun. The service was nothing to write home about, and the bathrooms make up in design when they lack in functionality.I was so excited. And this was overall a big let down. I wouldn't return.","MMM seafood.I had their food truck at my wedding, but wanted the ""full"" experience.  Everything I tried was delicious, and if you love lobster, you've come to the right place.  They even have a bloody mary with a lobster claw!  I tried the shrimp appetizer-pretty good, the fried oysters rockefeller-excellent, fish and chips-very good, key lime pie-totally wow, and the funnel cake-awesome...and I thought I didn't like dessert : ).  They also do a full lobster dinner for $25 (great deal!) all day on Wednesdays, which both my parents had and thoroughly enjoyed.  Oh and just a heads up, the portions here are huge so come hungry, like I did.Shout out to the waitress who, when I asked for tea, came back with a glass of warm water with fresh mint and lemon because they didn't have actual tea bags-you rock.","So I went here the other day, Tuesday (9-24-19) for what turned out to be a surprise Dinner for my up and coming birthday and was pleased. Before coming here, I had seen this restaurant on television a few days prior on one of the food networks and mentioned how I would like to go here and so to me surprise, ended up here. Now I would advise before going here to make reservations because even on a Tuesday night, this place gets crowded to where a line is waiting outside of the establishment. Due to not having a reservation, we had to actually wait until they gave us the option to eat outside where a few tables were available. One of the things that surprised us was how attentive our waiter was towards his customers, he really showed interest. Enough of that, you want to know what we had and here it is. We ordered the Connecticut which is a Buttered Lobster Roll which comes with a few different side options such as fries in which I chose, a Baked Potato, Spinach and others. The Lobster Roll was pretty good but it comes only buttered and not with the Mayonnaise and celery and other goods that you are used to seeing on Lobster rolls. We also had the Crab Dip in which we saw on the show was well liked and highly suggested but unfortunately when we had it, it was first too salty to the point where we had to have our waiter take it back and when the new one came around, it lacked Salt and a bit of flavor and the chips it came with was wrong for it due to it being too burnt and with Old Bay Seasoning. Oh well, I guess you win some and you lose some. We had these fried Oysters with Spinach on top which was an interesting mix together which was only OKAY, not the best and probably due to the Spinach being too strong. The Star of the night and the last dish that we had was the 1.5 Pound lobster which was Huge for a 1.5 pounder and even could have passed for a 2 pounder. This Lobster was cooked perfectly and tasted great and BEST OF ALL WAS FRESH! A lot of the times when you go to Seafood Restaurants, the Seafood doesn't always taste as fresh as it should but here, that wasn't a problem. The lobster came with potatoes, and sausage in which we had the option in adding. The Sausage in which they used was good too. As for the price, this place isn't cheap so if you are looking for a cheapy but goodie, this isn't it! These items plus 4 glasses of wine ran us to about 150. Overall, I'd definitely go to here again and on a scale from 1 to 10, I'd give it an 7.5.","I've also been to some of the Red Hook Lobster Pound's outposts, but the original spot is definitely the best. I really liked the poolside cocktail to start, and enjoyed the New England clam chowder, Lobster cheese fries, classic lobster roll, fish and chips and Clam strips. The fish and chips in particular were simply perfect.",Red Hook Lobster Pound
7,"My girlfriend and I selected this spot for our biweekly brunch tradition in her neighborhood~ Right off the bat, you will notice that their menu prices are suspiciously expensive for both food and drinks. Although the coffee was good and their décor charming, tables are positioned wayyyy too close together - you can't have a conversation without the people next to you hearing every single word!Our waitress was snooty and impersonal, and the food was just alright? Definitely not worth $22 each for my shrimp & grits or my friend's chicken & waffle. And who in their right mind charges $13 for a weak mimosa that comes in a tiny glass? Uglyduckling... sit down, be humble.",The food was so subpar. The service was incredibly subpar because they had one waiter for the whole restaurant. We sat for nearly 20 minutes and had to ask for the menu because no one came to greet us. We had to pay for bread and butter AND it came out AFTER our meals. My friend was told that she would get 'English Breakfast' tea and they brought her Lipton. Anything we asked for took more than twice as long as usual to get. The chicken lacked flavor and was cooked too hard in some spots. It's a beautiful space so it's really a shame it's so subpar in every other way. I see why it was empty....I recommend maybe going for drinks but keep your expectations to a minimum for nearly everything else.,"Not sure what happened since I first came here. Recently came back with friends and ordered the chicken and waffle which was bland. Chicken was overcooked, dry and tough to chew. Waffle was deep fried and had resembled more of a funnel cake than waffle. This wasn't bad...just different. Friends orders were mixed up numerous times. No one really enjoyed their food. Notable was the mac and cheese which was very watery and lacked flavor, very bland.Perhaps I'll give this place another shot down the line, no time soon thougb.","I really really love the layout and design of the uglyduckling and the tall window french door at the entrance is breathtaking, I love it!Came here during the week for lunch with a good friend of mine and both enjoyed our time here. The restaurant has lots of seating with tall wooden chairs and tables. They have a wide range of items on their menu with the option to eat by both land and sea. For our drinks I had Rosemary's Mule and she had the Aperol Spritz both cocktails tasted good. Rosemary's Mule has ginger in it and at the same time not overpowering the entire taste of the drink. I then had a Salmon with a cucumber salad, avocado, roasted corn and tomatoes. This was a perfect meal sizing , salmon was well done and the salads to go along with it was a perfect pair.  My friend had the grilled chicken sandwich and curly fries, it looked so good and she enjoyed it as well. I mean how wrong can you get with a sandwich ‍This is one of the stand out restaurants on the busy and popular Smith Street.Definitely give them a try! I will be back!","Good selection of beers. The best lagers and ales. Friendly bartenders and an owner who always had a smile.The service was lacking, however. When at table with service I've had to go up to the bar to get further rounds.","Took my friend there for brunch...had a reservation for 1PM, but it was unnecessary as the place wasn't hopping yet.Food was the perfect mix of homestyle and upscale.  Staff took great care of us, gave me lots of water refills.The rain made us stay for dessert and we had the lemon cake with blueberry compote...much to our delight.",Uglyduckling
8,I went twice and it was quite inconsistent.The first time was seriously impressive from a creativity and flavor standpoint.The second time was not great. It seemed like the dishes were rushed and didn't taste that good.I hate inconsistency for restaurants in NYC. There are too many sure options to waste $60 on a failed experiment.,Yo this place is so fire. The moment I ate the berry crumble I had to go outside and take a fat hit of my vape and chuck some clouds,"Easily five stars for food, alcohol, service, ambiance ... except the cake was fucking dry. So definitely eat here, but get a glass of wine (or some Tony's/Archie's) for dessert instead.","Wow is all I could say, this spot is the real deal, food is amazing. Small menu but definitely on point, try everything and drink everything.  Eat, drink and drink some more","This place is absolutely unmatched to other restaurants in the greater NYC area. Incredibly friendly and responsive staff and the food is exquisite, unique, and insanely tasty! Secondly, the restaurant is conveniently located just off the Morgan stop on the L (30 second walk) and close to a lot of cool bars in the area.To top it all off, the place is not expensive at all and the dining atmosphere is top notch. Hats off to these guys.","There is a solitary neon sign marking literally the only thing open on this block. You will have to struggle with the stuck door to get in but that earns you the right to sit at the bar and watch everyone else struggle as well. This beautifully designed and friendly restaurant named after the owners dog is by far and away my favourite eatery in the entirety of bushwick. I sat at the bar with friends, having a somewhat flux number to our party they accommodated us as every turn, we began our journey with the muscles, I cannot overstate how wonderful this dish was, it has a velvety cream sauce with chunks of chorizo that is so good I would re-dip every bite before eating it.We followed that up with the house bread (three different spreads ranging from fig jam to honey butter), a lively green bean salad so fresh it brought us back from a food coma before we dove into a pork pasta so good that a gentleman at the end of the bar said it was better then his Sicilian mother's before apologizing profusely to her. I cant help it if it is true.",Otis
9,Chicken and waffles - Burger with egg -Catfish and grits- .... (do not eat that biscuit) Drinks - does the job  Recommend spot for brunch !!,"Giving this 4 stars due to the vibe of the restaurant. Came here on a Saturday and the dj was pretty good. I wouldn't recommend this place for a large brunch as ITS VERY SMALL. I will day that the unlimited mimosas and bellinis get the JOB DONE. So if you're looking for a place with mediocre food but a way to get a little drunk, this is it.","Was pumped to come to this restaurant. It's been on my list for quite some time. I'll keep this review short, mirroring the service that was provided; rushed and unwelcoming. Our waiter seemed to be annoyed by the questions I had regarding the menu options. I'm assuming it was the end of his shift. Since it was my first time, I wanted some kind of direction; failed to receive that. Waiter had also billed me for an extra drink that I didn't order and made it seem as if I wasn't telling the truth. My food was okay. I chose the chicken and waffles. The chicken had a nice crisp and seasoning to it. I believe my review and experience would have been a bit different if we didn't have this waiter.UPDATE: owner had reached out to me in response to this review which meant a lot. I'm going to ""re-do"" my experience the next time I'm in Brooklyn!",I love this spot! The bartender is always cheerful & smiling. The food is on point & I have yet to be disappointed. The drinks are pretty & potent. And the music is on point with different events going on all the time. You gotta love it.Nice bar all wooded out to boot. Diverse & fun & that's what's up! Come thru!,"My first experience wasn't good one thoughtful Sunday, but was recommended to attend on a Saturday night by a DJ. Glad I did & had a ball! Drank beer & whiskey, so not versed on the mixed drinks. It can get crowded but not overwhelming. Near transportation if you've had too many.","Came here as a group in mid July. It was great! The catfish was delicious but what really got us were the shrimp & grits! The sauce on the shrimp was perfect and the grits were 100%. Organization/seating could be way better. Patrons standing throughout the restaurant. Be prepared to sacrifice any breathing space. I'm not joking... you gonna be so close that it's gonna be inevitable that people's spit unintentionally lands all up in your food and water. I know ya know exactly what I'm talking about too smh. They try to squeeze in as many people as possible not taking into account that they don't have enough seats. The DJ's are amazing, the best music selection. Only issue is the spot is loud af because they have the music blasting to the point where you might start wondering about premature deafness. Don't you dare try to have an actual conversation during brunch. One of us ordered a drink at the bar where we were sitting. The Bartender gave us something entirely different but we assume it was because she couldn't hear us clearly over the music. Who knows. Regardless, my boyfriend and I left the place yelling that we found our new spot! For days we were tryna come up with excuses to come back ASAP.Fast forward abt 1 month: We went back at the end of August excited to order the shrimp & grits again and try the Endless Mimosas. Everything was terrible. The Mimosas left an aftertaste and might as well have been virgin Mimosas. The real disappointment was that they seemed to have changed up the shrimp & grits recipe or they got a new cook, who knows, but they were both NASTY. They changed up the shrimp sauce so it was milky and thick. All of our shrimp was over cooked. The grits were chalky and pasty. Hellll noooo.The waitress came over started cleaning off our table and grabbed our plates without asking if we were finished or saying anything--my boyfriend was still eating. There was clearly still food in both of his bowls, but she just grabbed them away. He tried to tell her he wasn't finished but the music was so loud that he literally had to scream it her even though she was standing right next to him. She apologized.Now on to paying for our bill... Meanwhile the waitress really tried to overcharge us by saying ""didn't y'all order a Riesling too?"" After that entire 20 minute meal we both looked at her like ""Really bih? You gotta be kidding yourself."" Yeah right, not after that nasty mimosa. They misleadingly say that they do a mandatory 20% gratuity for groups. But the truth is they do it no matter if it's 1 person or 2 person. We understand why now. The place is so relaxed to a fault when it comes to cleanliness and service. The hostess we had in August was leaning her elbows and arms on the tables while she was helping people.  Both times we went on a Sunday. They seemed understaffed based on how the staff was hurrying everywhere and they all seemed stressed out even the hostess. I can't even front we would've given this place a solid 4 stars and disregarded everything else if the food quality was the same as it was in July. July it was 4 stars, August it was a forced 1 star. Never in our life have we been in and out of a restaurant  so fast, let alone a Sunday brunch.",Sweet Brooklyn Bar And Grill
10,"Dear 5ive Spice,This is not a NY deli/cab. Please pay for Spotify premium. Also, please lower the bar stools. We are all hunched over and I can barely reach my bowl, and I'm only 5'6,"" the national average. Otherwise I really like your Pho.","Came here on a Saturday afternoon with my friend. Two waitress led us to our seat and gave us our menus. I love the chill music that was played.I ordered vermicelli, pho and a coffee. The vermicelli had a portion but they could have provided more fish sauce. There was more salad than there was the noodle. The pho was very flavorful. The viet coffee I ordered was a little bland. Compared to other pho spots, the coffee at this spot was not worth it. It does not taste authentic.",I first came here when I was suffering from a head cold and was craving some pho to help out. The place is small and personable with a quick staff. The food is always on point and the prices are fair.,"This week I went back to 5ive Spice after having a good experience a few weeks ago. After my second visit this has become my favorite restaurant on 5th Ave.I had the grilled corn and chicken pho. The pho hit the spot with perfectspicing, tender chicken and soft tasty noodles. The service was again friendly, helpful and quick.","Myself and a friend who both live in the neighborhood ate here today. Several times a month we get together for lunch and we said today, we wanted to try a place we never ate at before.Between the two of us we have tried most of the places on 5th Ave. and some how missed this place. It was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I had the brussel sprouts and pork chop sandwich. My friend had their classic sandwich which had ham and pork. Everything was nicely spiced, tasty an extremely satisfying. The bill, for both of us, was $23 and at any other restaurant in the neighborhood this would be the price for one of us. The place is adorable,  comfortable and close to everything.The staff was friendly, professional and helpful in addition to getting us our food extremely quickly. I cannot wait to go back and want to try everything on the menu.","their pho is more sweet then savory. you can get a better bowl on canal st . but their pork chop tacos are great , a bit overpriced but it's the rich part of brooklyn",5ive Spice
11,"#I'm not sure why my friend and I were so pissed when we were here. I think it's because he was touting the free #Yelp check-in mozzarella sticks and that's why we came here. But they said the offer didn't apply to that day we went (I think weekend). I didn't really want to eat the #mozzarella sticks myself, but for some reason I was still mad about it.The #burger and fries were just okay. But maybe it's because I had a #bad taste in my mouth.","Short Story: The atmosphere was alright and the burgers were extra tasty! Would recommend. Long Story: my husband and I were in Brooklyn on a vacation and needed somewhere to eat. I found Juanchi's on Yelp! We each got a burger, his was something spicy and mine was something with an egg in it and they were both very good. The egg burger situation also had honey on it - I was originally apprehensive about it but decided it was worth risk and MAN WAS IT.  My only complaint was the fries - they were not great - soggy, and it seemed like the end of the bag because they were all so small and short. All in all - would recommend.",Burgers were fire and don't miss the truffleFries. I'll be coming back here everytimeI'm in Williamsburg,"I'm sitting here in post burger consumption heaven... yummmeeee. If you're a burger connoisseur then you must transport yourself to this Venezuelan burger heaven in WillyB - stat!!! Im a burger snob and this is one of the best tasting burgers everrr --- mostly locally sourced ingredients.Medium rare burger cooked to perfection... my friend and I split the Tears and The Original (one with crispy onion rings the other with caramelized onions) nestled on a Lightly toasted bun, branded with the Juanchi's logo (cute touch) oh and truffle fries to boot.Cozy casual environment playing great chill 90s hip hop ... come here - you'll leave happy and will want to return. PS happy hour till 7 even on Saturday/ maybe make a reservation too.","This really pains me to leave a 3 star review but the flavor just wasn't there. I had this placed bookmarked for over a year and couldn't wait to try it, but after last night, I wish I had. Headed there on a Friday night about 10 pm and was immediately seated. Our server Noah tended to us quickly and was overall great. We started off with a strawberry lemonade and iced tea, they were regular nothing spectacular. For an appetizer we ordered the chicken tenders again regular nothing spectacular, although it did pair nicely with a curry sauce.  I wanted to unlock the yelp offer for feee mozzarella sticks but it's only done Mon-Thursday. For our entrees we ordered a heart attack burger and a Spanish Queen. This is where things went south. My fries although Juilenne cut we incredibly small like maybe 2 inches in length, I guess I got the crumbs or the broken pieces at the bottom of the bag. My burger (Spanish Queen) although cooked perfectly lacked the flavor and seasoning it NEEDED, it was so bland. I was so disappointed but I pressed through. I then tasted my husband's burger instead of a bun it was fried  Mac n cheese. Again no flavor. Can you imagine the disappointment. I searched for depth of flavor but found none. I wanted to sink into my seat. No this place couldn't have been such a let down, I dreamed of eating here for a whole year! Overall the food was less than subpar and honestly I wish I would have spent my $60 elsewhere. I guess all that glitters really isn't gold.","Cool place in Williamsburg for a casual dinner and beers at fair prices. Came here for a Yelp event, so to be transparent, got my meal fo' free. Don't hate the Yelper, hate your lame reviews ;-)Started with a sampler of appetizers - plantains with cheese is never my style, wings were solid, and arepas were okay. I liked the mozzarella sticks the most. Anywho, tried the Spanish Queen burger with avocado, pico de gallo, and chorizo on top. Super yummy, but it's thick -- be prepared to stretch that jaw and get very full, very quickly. That said, really tasty. I will say that the sweet potato fries stole the show. Those lil guys + Cajun mayo just sent me over the moon. Honestly, it may have outshone the burger. So good!!Would definitely come back to this spot, though at $17-$19 per burger, this ain't no cheap burger joint. Expect high quality ingredients and casual atmosphere, and enjoy!",Juanchi's Burger
12,Brunch is tastyIts surprisingly empty for a Saturday at 1pmservice was goodenvironment is cool,"Saw really good reviews so I wanted to give it a try. We ordered soup of the day, foie gras, risotto and meat stew. Everything was mediocre. We returned the soup because it was too salty. Maybe it's because I had a high expectation  on this restaurant, since I was missing French food in Paris. If you've ever had authentic French cuisine, i wouldn't recommend you coming here.","What kind of twisted trend is this? Yet another European restaurant pops up in the hood. And the irony is far from lost on me, a place that celebrates social antagonists located on Malcolm X Blvd.Well, despite its very presence reminding me of imperialism, the food is just ok. The service likewise. I've been here twice now. We will not be back. Certainly not worth the hype. But hey, the Emperor has some new clothes.","A Neighborhood GemWe have eaten at L'Antagoniste since its opening in 2015 and have had exceptionally good meals every time. The tasty and innovative food is arguably the best in Bed-Stuy. There is an extensive and finely chosen wine list as well. Just when you think you cannot eat any more, the restaurant offers a range of special desserts, including the Paris-Brest that would make a French pastry chef swoon. The atmosphere is sophisticated yet homey, making L'Antagoniste a very pleasant dining experience. The garden/outdoor seating keeps me coming back and is one of our favorite outdoor areas because it is partially covered and full of plants. The wait staff are attentive and knowledgeable. It is always nice when a restaurant succeeds because of its staff and not in spite of it. L'Antagoniste has been consistently good for some years and it gets better. Prices are relatively modest, especially given the quality. Come here to impress a date, have Sunday brunch with a group of friends, or hangout at the bar by yourself. L'Antagoniste is unpretentiously perfect and definitely worth trying-again and again!",My favorite date spot dot com.Been here more than 5 times!! Each time is a hit.I always walk into a vibe of soft spoken individuals with romantic music in the background. It's always a candle light dinner at its finest. We always start with the dozen of oyster with a bottle of dry red. Menu changes and I love trying their specials and it's never a let down. Food quality is truly amazing. This place made me love French bistro even more.,"This place is awesome. My father and I had a great meal here in the outdoor space which is super nice. I got the burger and loved it. Very well-run establishment. We also loved the neighborhood, which was tree-lined streets with beautiful brownstone homes.",L'Antagoniste
13,Everything is good. I know this is short but when everything you want is offered by a restaurant there is nothing more to say.Large portionsGood amount of meat to rice ratioFast deliveryFriendly people,"Couldn't give them 5/5 and I'll tell you why. I can't say I'd recommend here but it is definitely a healthier option opposed to getting the traditional Jamaican restaurant greasy food. POSITIVES:- Staff is really friendly - Restaurant has a nice chill vibe - Fast / never crowded - I'm indifferent about the food because the flavors weren't great but overall it was ok. Didn't wow me away NEGATIVES: - EXPENSIVE (spent $20 on jerk chicken & bottle water) / ($4 for broccoli, plantain, other sides) - Very very few menu options (fish, jerk chicken or oxtail) - Not always open","This place descended from heaven on the eighth day. I swear, you will die and be reborn after eating here. Had the Jerk Chicken with red beans and coconut sauce. Nothing could have been better on a cold day lost in Brooklyn.Take a trip out of the way to visit these guys. You will not regret it.","Been waiting to go here for some time, but between my schedule and theirs, it took some time to work out. But when my big bro and I wanted to hang out, the universe brought us all together to The Food Sermon.   While smaller than I expected, the food packs a wallop.  We're both vegetarians, so my my bro had the Tofu Veggie with chickpeas in the coconut ginger broth with brown rice, I had the Veggie (which also has sauteed kale, mushrooms, and broccoli) minus the tofu, also in coconut ginger broth and brown rice, but with read beans. I have to say, we were both floored.  We were catching up on stuff, but half of every time I tried to talk my food kept calling back at me.  As we were sitting in the window seats (the place got packed really quickly) it did make my rudeness with chomping down my food mid-convo a bit easier, LOL.  The sorrel was also on point, which doesn't happen to often.  The only complaint is that they didn't have any ice, which to me is an easy fix, but the drinks were cool upon serving.  By time we left the place emptied out a bit and so we got to chat with the owner who is a very cool, personable guy. The staff is also on point, lending to my 5th star, which I do not easily dole out.  And the mark of a great meal for me is its heartiness...that you're satisfied for some time after. We ate close to 4pm but I wasn't really hungry again for the rest of the night. Being born and raised in Brooklyn, Crown Heights and Lefferts Gardens were always two of my favorite neighborhoods, so I'm glad a spot like Food Sermon exists here.","Really tasty and hearty bowls.  We had the oxtail and the jerk chicken.  I recommend adding the sautéed kale even though it makes the dishes a bit too pricey.  No alcohol and fairly slow service but they are a small space and seem to do a lot of takeout and delivery. If you get stuck behind those orders it takes a while to get your food even if you are dining in. Still, the good is good and you get large portions. I had two full meals from my one bowl.","THIS  IS  THE  BEST  MEAL  I  HAD  ALL SUMMERI have always struggled to pass by this place while it was actually open. Today was the day. Let me tell you about how the clouds open up, God reached down and said ""lemme get some""I had the salmon with brown rice, red beans, and the coconut ginger dressing.It was literally magical from the first bite to the last. And that was take out so I imagine there is an additional layer of joy and heaven if you are eating it freshly prepared.I don't like how the space is set up for seating but other then that it's a win for me.",The Food Sermon Kitchen
14,"Like it's name, the place is eclectic and a trip down memory lane.  The place is a tribute to the 90's and your eyes will swish back and forth to take in the details of the quirky place.  I almost felt as if I was transported back to Haight Street in San Francisco or a hipster's den.  I just needed a place to hang while waiting to catch my train.  They have cool drinks and happy hour, but the drinks are still on the pricy side.  The decor and stickers in the bathroom and at the bar area make for good distraction, but in the end the follow through just wasn't there for me.  The wine was a disappointment and the service wasn't that great.  The girl who took my order wasn't that friendly and I don't know if if she was having a bad day, but she seemed jaded and then I thought maybe another hipster sick of her job?  Honestly, it was cool for a one time stop-over, but this place isn't my cup of tea.","Fancy Nancy has a small menu, the food is boujee and expensive, and they no longer sell the tater tots in the yelp photos!",Fancy Nancy... it's more than just a name it's a food experience. Now that I got that out of the way if I had to put a rating on the food it would be a 5 star. Ratings on the service would be close to a 5 (I haven't really put them to a good test). This is a place that if I lived closer I would probably live there.. sadly I'm in the sticks(maybe a good thing cause I don't want to be an addict or do I?!) Either way check them out except for Monday's cause they currently are only closed that day. Sadly I don't have a photo to show of their food because it disappears in my stomach when it arrives,"So I was looking for a late night bite that wasn't terribly unhealthy and stumbled into here. I was planning to do a take out order and head home, but upon entering this establishment I was greeted with smiling warm faces. Usually when a business is close to closing they have that evil eye for anyone that comes in and places a order, but this staff was kind and inviting. I enjoyed the fun conversations about where is Waldo books, lol and goose berries. The entire staff was professional and attentive. The veggie burger was delicious, and accompanied by amazing garlic fries. I had a Kale salad to start and that tasted extremely fresh/tasty. All in all I was happy to be there and will definitely come back again. Seating is limited, but comfortable. Small, but very nice decorum.","Fancy Nancy was just alright. I'd go back for a drink, or the amazing garlic fries! However, the combo of the food, the service, and the hefty price tag left a bad taste in my mouth.I got the famous veggie burger, but I really didn't care for it. I don't fault them much for that (I guess I have different taste preferences than others) but it definitely wasn't worth $17!The service was also pretty bad - the waitstaff was inattentive and seemed like they'd rather be anywhere else. Overall, the vibe was cute and probably a nice place for a glass of wine, but I left pretty disappointed and it wasn't worth the cost.","Came here for brunch and it was PACKED. Once I stepped inside, I understood why. The space is small (cozy) with an awesome design. We sat at the bar while we waited for the rest of the party. The bartender was attentive and poured us the delicious seasonal mimosa. Since the restaurant was packed, some of the staff was very frantic about the waiting time. We were told multiple times that we would have to leave the bar and wait outside, then told to keep sitting, and then the cycle would repeat. The reason why it was especially frustrating was that we had cocktails that we had to keep finishing only to find out we could stay where we were - resulting in us drinking more than we would. It felt pretty silly, but hey, they were swamped so I didn't think too much into it. Also, once we sat for the meal, everything fell into place. The meal was tasty and I can't wait to come back when it's a bit more quiet.",Fancy Nancy
15,Ah... we returned with much higher expectations this time. And now of course I have to unfortunately take back everything I previously said. This place has gone way downhill. I no longer consider it a legitimate BBQ contender in NYC or anywhere else.,"As an addendum, the turkey breast was perfectly moist but took an expected backseat to the spare ribs and brisket in savoriness.","Another visit revealed a more luscious iteration of the beef rib; everything else maintained their consistent quality.  As leftovers the next day, the spare rib, brisket (most) and beef rib were still moist and satisfying.","Omg, talk about game changing BBQ!I came on a Tuesday with the fam because I heard during the weekends this place is packed. It was fairly quiet, but there were still a lot of people coming, and as it got later there were actually items selling out!We got a bit of everything: beef rib, pulled pork, brisket, and sausage. Sides were beans with burnt ends, collard greens with bacon, cole slaw, and corn bread. Oh boy, there was not one thing on that plate we didn't like! Everything was so well cooked and flavorful. My personal fav was that beef rib, I higgggghly recommend!!!!!There is also a bar in the same area so we got some cocktails and beers that perfectly paired with our meal.If you are in or near Brooklyn and you have a hankering for some BBQ, this is a MUST!","I have mixed feelings about this place. First, the inside is a bit ""smokey""...hey that comes with the territory and is what they do, but if that kind of stuff bothers you, or bothers your eyes, etc... then consider that.Next, the food.  I've been here once before on a weekend, and it's crowded.  Again, sometimes I travel with people who don't want to wait.  That was a problem on my weekday, mid-day visit recently.However, I just wasn't wild about my pulled pork sandwich.  With the slaw mixed in and the juices, I really couldn't taste the pork. (it tasted like butter to me)  It's almost too ""creamy"".  I'll get it just naked next time.   The other thing I was looking forward to was the potato salad.   This is more like ground up mashed potatoes that are cold, with a kick of spice.  Not what I was expecting and the consistency I just don't like.   I'd go with beans next time.In general, I should probably be thankful to have my taste buds challenged from the norm, but I thought, if this is supposed to be ""comfort food"", it's not giving me any comfort.  That's just me.Anyway, the staff is friendly and efficient, but overall, I'm going to need to re-visit before I'd recommend it to others.","First of all, I cook meat myself. I grill it, I smoke it, I kebab it. I've enjoyed a couple of Dutch oven roasts. I've got my butcher on speed dial haha. Anyway, I'm not a pro but I think I know meat.Now I know lines too. Grew up in Russia. But this one was WTFL. Way too fnckiug long. That's subjective. But objectively it really built up the hype. And honestly disappointed. Though I'm all about brisket. The other meats we tried were ok, my point is I won't judge those, BUT THE BRISKET WAS OVERCOOKED.And the bill was definitely not a pleasant surprise.Enjoy!",Hometown Bar-B-Que
16,"I go here with my girlfriend almost every week as is our tradition. There is enough of a selection and good portions to not over eat. But it is easy to get sick of it if you do over eat.The server is a hit or miss, sometimes they get all the scum out, sometimes they even get all the chili oil out.The music can be random at times","Came here on a monday with my mom because it was her birthday. I joined the waitlist about 40 minutes before i even arrived (7:40pm) and i still had to wait. Initially i wanted separate pots but the receptionist said that is only available after 9 so i just settled to share a pot. I did hot pot and bbq but the combo isn't worth it in my opinion because they use the same weird seasoning for all the skewers and they came out cold. The staff is very attentive which was nice but one of the waitresses splashed hot soup on me while passing by with the refill pots and didn't even apologize. Although a lot of people i know seem to vouch for this place, I think it is quite generic.","This place gets busy on the weekend so be sure to make reservations! You have the option for hot pot, BBQ, or both! I've only been here for hot pot and was able to have individual pots as not all tables have the smaller burners. There's a 2hour time limit, which is plenty of time to fill your belly with unlimited meat, veggies,and seafood. The cuts of meat are pretty good and the vegetables are fresh, but you're not guaranteed to receive everything you ordered and you'll most likely forget until your belly remembers you've been waiting for it. Then you order another round of fatty beef.","Just ate here and left very happy, bloated x2 and satisfied. :) Tip: Join the waitlist via yelp to avoid waiting over an hour to be seated. This place gets filled up fast and very busy because of the great food and the great music. Kudos to our waiter, I don't know his name, but he was great, very attentive and polite. My boyfriend and I were very impressed with how efficient he was in serving us. Customer service at this place for the last three times I've been here have always been top notch. The food is always fresh, especially the fatty beef.... and the soups are better than a lot of other places, I usually get the pork bone broth and I sip on it while waiting for my food to cook in the very beginning.Last thing I want to mention the mango milk tea dessert. It is one of the best I ever had and it's almost one of the favorite parts of the experience at Laojie.","I mean Jeremy Lin was here so of course, I had to come try this AYCE hotpot restaurant.  I read from previous reviews that the wait can be long so on a Friday night around 7pm I put my name on the Yelp waitlist.  I was glad I did this because when we got there even though I was on top of the waitlist we still had to wait about 30 minutes for a seat (however, I was a little annoyed that we had to wait even putting myself on the list).  This was much better than the quoted time for people who were asking without the yelp waitlist they quoted 1 hr and 30 mins to 2 hrs!  I think some people were willing to wait, which is crazy to me. The music in the restaurant was quite loud and played old school Chinese Pop.  There is seating upstairs and downstairs.  The downstairs area is much larger.  We were seated downstairs and right away the waitress came to take our order.  We decided to get the black chicken and pork broth.  Both were flavorful!  This hotpot place is definitely much better than others in terms of service.  The waitress actually gets your order right and does not forget any items you listed, unlike 99flavors who always I mean ALWAYS forget one thing or is skimpy when you ask for more.  Also, they have a lot more variety here, there is a lot more seafood options including crab which you do not need to pay extra for.  The waitress will come once in a while to add broth and remove the top layer of the soup that is no longer good. And at the end, we were given a delicious jasmine tea pudding. Overall a great AYCE hotpot restaurant in Brooklyn. I will definitely be back!","I'm always down for hot pot regardless of the season. It's such a simple concept in theory, but there's more work and effort that goes into it than you might think.Laojie Hotpot is one of the best AYCE options around. They have so many great broths to choose from, and really fresh, quality ingredients, especially the seafood. The gargantuan clams look like they're on steroids, in the best possible way. I'm a sucker for the cuttlefish balls and Fuzhou meat-filled fish balls. They also have fish balls with fish roe filling, which I've discovered are one of the best hot pot ingredients known to mankind.Bonus points for the free bowl of pudding with milk tea that you get at the end of your meal. It's pretty damn tasty.The space is large and very clean, even the sauce station, which almost always attracts spills. The service is friendly. The ingredients are incredibly varied and very good. Really, the only downside is its distance from the nearest subway station, an obstacle I view as getting my steps in and clearing up more stomach room.",Laojie Hotpot
17,Zero star... Worst brunch ever! The waiters and waitresses have million pounds of egos with no accountability and actually got angry when I asked for water and hot sauce.Everything in here has changed for worst not our old happy spot anymore.,"Honestly I am so disappointed with this visit (Saturday brunch) that I can't remember if there was anything good about this brunch.First of all, what's up with asking for the tip before we get the food and received the actual service? Wait for it...I ordered the wild salmon salad (16$) which was suppose to come with baby spinach and grape tomatoes. To my surprise baby spinach looks a lot like giant old spinach (picture reference). ALL of grape tomatoes were spoiled. Each and everyone of them! In a few minutes, I find a piece of chicken in it. W*f! Let's just hope I wasn't finishing someone else's salad. It is more then just disappointing for the most expensive item from their menu.The toasts came with weird frozen/spoiled strawberries and blueberries. First time in my life I see a cafe/restaurant use not fresh berries during summer season when the prices are at the lowest in Brooklyn.The plates are carried with waiter's fingertips in your food. Yumm!Ordered some ice tea. Received it with no ice. Asked for some ice. Were told to go to the corner of the cafe and get ice ourselves from some pitcher.Asked for some napkins. Were told to go and get it ourselves. You see... I might be ok with all that ""go, get it yourself"" if they were busy, but everywhere I would look around, the staff would be just standing around and talking. And just 4 tables, including ours, were occupied. So remember how they ask to pay for the meal and give tip in advance? Tad-aam! That's why!",I can no longer patronize this restaurant die to the consistently rude and callous behavior exhibited by  the waitstaff with the exception of 2 people.  In short 95% of the servers there are rude and act as if you are wasting their time.  T,"Love love love this place. Come here at least once a week! Avocado and egg option heaven. The hot egg skillet dishes are my fave. During the week it's a self-serve type of place, but they do waiter service on weekends. It's usually busy even mid-day weekdays but tables free up quickly.I highly recommend","No Milk and Definitely No Honey.  We arrived for an evening cup of coffee and ordered two cappuccinos and a large cup of coffee.  I was told that there wasn't enough for a large coffee that I ordered.  They poured the bottom of the pot and told me there was only enough for a small.  Who would give a customer the bottom of the barrel and not make a new pot of coffee?  Strike one and two no thank you.  I don't want your small cup of old coffee at the bottom of the barrel.  Then my mother in law asked if she could get a little bit of extra milk as her's was to strong.  I went and asked for a squirt of milk... That's a latte sir from the two year old making the coffee.  We will have to charge you extra.  For what, a shot of milk.  Seriously???  We have come here several times before and have enjoyed the experience... Never again... Rude to say the least.Furthermore, the staff including the manager were picking veggies out of the salad cold tasty and eating then right in front of customers with their bare hands.  If your hungry, I'm sure you can make yourself something to eat and either sit in the front or go to the back and eat, but please don't pick food that will be used to make customers food with your bare hands.","Tl;dr up front because this will be long: Too much effort into being trendy, not enough into great food and service.At first sight, everything about Milk & Honey appears aesthetically pleasing. However, the warm, modern farmhouse decor and (trying too hard to be) trendy menu is juxtaposed by mediocre service and painfully disappointing food.Our party of 4 arrived on a Sunday, around 1 pm. While we waited for a table, a couple arrived behind us and were pointed to a table. As they turned to head over, the host taps the man with menus and says, ""don't forget these."" Maybe I'm not milennial enough to not take note of that, but I digress.We were seated after a short wait and given menus. And then waited longer. The restaurant was busy, but not overly so, and even with staff constantly walking by no one came over to greet us. After flagging someone down, we were able to order, but had to ask twice for water. I don't recall seeing any member of the staff ever smile.You pay and tip right after ordering, they take your card at the table, with the ipad used to place the orders. I guess no one ever adds on to their meal.We ordered the steak panini, pastrami stack, chicken flatbread, poached eggs with corn fritters, and a mango tango and Cosmo to drink. After receiving the food, I'm convinced that they don't know what culinary terms actually mean and are just using them to sound trendy. The cocktails are non-alcoholic, which it says on the menu but still means it's not a cocktail. The Cosmo for what it was, was good, but the mango tango, which was described as a mango punch, tasted like watered down mango juice from concentrate.The panini used sliced bread and was not grilled, i.e., not a panini. The corn fritters weren't fried... I think you know where I'm going with this*... and the ""hollandaise"" was just not. Also, the pastrami stack was ambitious but executed poorly. The sandwich was so uneven- some spots had the slaw, some had pickles, some onion ring, but never had a bite that had everything. Mysteriously, the stack was served a la carte while the steak panini came with a modest serving of roasted potatoes. The flatbread was very one note, that note being chipotle mayonnaise (it says aioli but couldn't taste any garlic).All of that being said, the food wasn't necessarily bad overall, at best just inconsistent and not what it was supposed to be.*side note: sauteeing fritter batter how it was done here doesn't fully cook it and leaves it quite sticky.",Milk & Honey Cafe
18,Let's just say I've had betters I've eaten a great deal of Cajun/Creole style food and this just didn't peak my interest. I had high hopes for this place :-/ The host/waitress could have been a little less into her phone as well. It's one thing to do it out of the service areas but another to do it right in front of guests when staff is short and things that need tending to.,-The food took ages.-They prepared the wrong order.-The portions were small.-The food did not taste good.-All round epic fail.,Had the take-out of blacken chicken and it was quite flavorful. The chicken was moist and flavor was just right along with the sides it provided. It was located in the corner of the block. I was at location to pick up my order the the atmosphere of the restaurant was super cute and had the Nawlins feel about it but quaint and not overdone. Definitely a good place to try out this cuisine in person. Staff was also friendly and attentive.,"What a gem in Bed Stuy! Yummy, delicious Cajun food at very reasonable prices. We had the bisque (a must), jambalaya, and shrimp and grits (AMAZING). A lot of the food you have in NYC is sandwiches and pizza- how about a real, home-cooked meal?! This is the place just for that. Bruce, our waiter and the  epitome of charm, greeted us so kindly at the door (none of the typical Brooklyn hipster BS of other establishments happens here). I would highly recommend! Can't wait to try brunch!Note- they don't serve alcohol, but don't pass this place up bc of that- there are plenty of watering holes nearby but nowhere with food like this.","This is a fairly new restaurant in the bed study area serving up New Orleans/ creole style plates with a matching decor. We visited on a Sunday evening and only saw one other table of guests which we didn't mind at all. Service was quick and kind. All the food was fresh and took a little while to reach out tables being that it was obviously made to order; this is a plus in my book. We had the craw fish sliders, Mac and cheese, crab cake, and shrimp gumbo. Everything was yum. There aren't many restaurants serving up New Orleans style dishes in brooklyn or even in NYC so Biyou is definitely worth a visit if you're a NYC dweller and looking for something different and tasty.We'll definitely revisit for brunch and their yummy looking beignets!","I've recently learned about Biyou and decided to check it out with my mother. The decor is simple and delightful, and it felt very comfy here. My mother and I ordered the fish with just the greens and a side salad. It was good and had a nice taste to it. We watched it down with a ginger drink I can't quite remember. I'd definitely return to try something else on the menu.",Biyou
19,"I really wanted to like Sweet Chick. I've heard so many great things about this place but it may be overhyped because Nas is part owner. It's really dark when the sun goes down and you're forced to eat by candlelight - a tea light candlelight - that continuously kept going out as I tried to pour syrup in the dark. My boyfriend and I were seated at this cafeteria-like bench with other guests which was different, but I would prefer to sit at my own table. I could not decide on what I wanted to eat from the menu because as creative as the food names are, it's just overhyped Southern style food. The food came out before the drinks which is usually a slight irritation for me but I managed. The chicken was good but the waffles were ...not all that. Would I return? Umm no but I wouldn't urge someone not to try it. Maybe it'll be your thing.","It was OK. The wait was incredibly long, so don't go hungry. The food itself: We got the fried chicken and waffles, of course. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. I have a rule for myself: if I can make it better, then place is not worth a repeat visit. This is such a place.",I have to rewrite my review because I dined here this evening and was so disappointed in the service and the staffs uniform. I understand that this is a comfort food place but the hostess was wearing sweats and our servers stomach was out. I was a bit confused by the dress code. It's also hard to determine who's our server when they're all dressed so casual. This is the same problem with the way they talk. It's like they were acting like we were friends. I just think at this location they took casual to the next level. Our food was cold and the lack of service really made this an unfortunate experience. For that I have to go from 5 to 3 stars. -@agirlsgottaeatt,"Been to both locations and absolutely love their fried chicken and waffle. It's a perfect balance of sweet and savory. The waffle is light, warm, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. The chicken is fried to perfection. Crispy and juicy. Perfect seasoning. It comes with three types of butter. Sweet, savory, and plain. Their house bacon is great too.",Amazing chicken and waffles. Id recommend the chicken bucket.Maybe skip their General Tso's...the sauce they use for that is more akin to savory teriyaki than sweet/spicy General Tso's sauce. The pecan waffle is dope.,Good food AMAZING music selectiongood draft beer selection I am def coming back ! Also cute male bartenders,Sweet Chick
20,"First, service. I mean they do smile but the guy just loved to flirt with their customers while forgetting we sat there for a solid 40 minutes. This is record-long wait time for me in any restaurant in the city. During the wait, nobody even bothered to ask us anything(yet have time chitchat with our neighbors). Then food came, no apologies whatsoever. Then, food. French toast are not supposed to be a brick where outsiders is burnt while inside is not fluffy. This is the exact opposite of french toast. Then, they put creme cheese and preserved food on the side. Yes creme cheese instead of whipped cream- your typical ""I am trying to be different but failed epically"" try. The preserved food(peach and berry) is also horrible, extremely syrupy and lack the taste of the real fruit. They do put a ton of maple syrup on top of the burnt bread, but guess what, the bottom layer just got none of the syrup and you are serious just eating a burnt toast brick with creme cheese and preserved fruit.PLG doesn't have that many good brunch place, I get it, but to hell this place deserves a decent rating.","I tried this place again because I remembered that at the very least it had good food. Well now it's after new management and truth be told it's a whole lot worse.Let me start by saying that the restaurant was empty only one other seated couple. I waited 15 minutes to place my order. I took maybe 6 minutes decided what I was going order and after telling the waiter that we were ready to order he continued to serve water glasses to all the other 15 empty tables before he finally came back to take our order.This should have been the signed for me to run out of this place and after everything was said and done I wish I had left at that moment.I waited for 45 minutes for a Montrealer which pretty much is a fancy way of say a croissant, egg and cheese with a bed of arugula and hash and a Portobello Mushroom and Kale Scrambler which is a fancy way of saying scramble eggs with mushroom and kale.45 minutes and during our wait not once did the waiter come over and check in to see if we got our drinks or need more water or to say hi. Nothing!!!!Why this took so long I have no idea. Our drinks Matcha Latte and Regular Latte took 1 hour to be served. At the 55 minute mark I told the guy to take it off the bill that I didn't want the drink. His excuse was that there's two new people being trained and that the girl making drinks hasn't been trained to pull the drink orders from the POS system. Funny because she had no issue pulling all the other drink orders after mine and make her own drink. After he said he would comp the drinks and bring them anyways the manager walks over and says that they will only comp one drink (that they would get in trouble if they comp the two drinks) for the wait. At this point we had already finished our meal and told the manager if that was the case we didn't want them. She said gladly with a terrible attitude and took the drink back and walked away huffing and puffing ""that she didn't need this"" ""that she's 5 minutes away from walking out"". At this point I asked her for the bill I just want to be gone.5 minutes later she walks back and slams the drinks and says here you can have them I figured out how to comp them. I tell her I'm good I am not about to drink a drink that was served, taken out of view for five minutes and then brought back out and reserved. That is just disgusting, restaurant 101 you know you are not suppose to do this. This people need to watch a chef Ramsey show to learn how it needs to be done.   At this point I asked for my bill again. After anther 5 minutes I asked my waiter for the bill again and he just ignored me the manager from the bar scream ""you still haven't gotten your bill, unbelievable"" and she huffs and puffs again. She did apologize and I told her about the long wait time for the food and the drinks and she point blank said ""those issues have nothing to do with me. Those are other people issues and you should take it up with them"" why does this place employe a manager that doesn't take any responsibility. She did mention that there is only one cook cooking and that he must of been backed up and I pointed out that the restaurant was empty and there couldn't be any other orders. She then changed and said that since I got hash browns that all the potatoes are picked and peeled and shredded per order and then fried and counted. Are you kidding me he portion side was one potato and your telling me that it took 45 minutes. I hate people that lie and try to make you feel stupid.Finally after waiting for 15 minutes my bill finally comes and it's for $28.31 I sign it and give No Tip! They run my card and I walk out... and that should be the end of it but it's not because when I get my card alert I see that the ran my card for $45.18!!!I had to walk back to informed them that they over charged and and she stated that the man who took my order had left another ticket open and it was not her fault that she ran my card against that ticket and there was nothing they could do about it. That they have a new system and that she ""can't be bothered with this bullshit"" that ""she frustrated and have been working 9 days straight and today was suppose to be her day of yet she's here and she wasn't suppose to be here"".Are you insane you overcharged me and there is nothing that you can do about it!!!! She says that only the owner Lillian can do something about it yet no one knows when this Lillian will show up. I ask her if she can please contact the owner and let me know what her ETA is and she says no if I call her she's going to say ""stop calling me your slowing me down"". Are you serious!!!!","Good internet. Weak menu, poor lighting, uncomfortable seating in front. Nice seating in back. Baristas are usually pleasant but their personal conversations drift throughout the space.","This place is absolutely AMAZING!!! Came here for brunch on Labor Day. It was pouring rain so we didn't want to stray too far from the apartment and found this gem. The ambiance was wonderful - music was on point (soundtrack was like Buddha Bar for you native New Yorkers). Servers were very sweet too (don't remember her name but the blonde girl with glasses was a sweetheart).We ordered the salmon pastrami on olive toast: A MUST!!! I've never had something more delicious in my life. I've been craving it since the moment we left.My boyfriend ordered the chocolate chip pancakes topped with blueberries: these were delciousssss. Super moist, and the chocolate and blueberries were the perfect combo of sweet and tart.Portion sizes were nice and big so come here if you're feeling hungry! Def want to come back again and try all of the things on the menu.","Came here for a late lunch and was generally happyish with the food. Nothing to rave or complain about. The customer service was what made one star disappear and the saltiness melted off another star. Our dishes were overall too salty, but we initially tried to just enjoy the meal and make the most of our date. When we got to the octopus dish, we literally could not swallow without involuntarily cringing. We called over our waitress and let her know casually that it was a little too salty but that the meal was still going okay. We politely sent the food back to the kitchen. The waitress could have been professional about it but her face just looked unimpresssed and unengaged the whole time. We got the dish back, but lol it was still... You got it... Too salty. We gave up and just finished our meal. I think if you came here for the outdoor seats with friends/casual outings, it is still worth coming. The vibe is good for hanging out with mates with some drinks. If your intention is a slow date i.e. talk and enjoy good food, I think you could go somewhere else for sure.","Everything you've heard about this place is true and then-some!  The space itself is railroad style.  For those not familiar, that entails walking into one space or room that leads into another, and yet another.  You encounter the dining area as soon as you come in.  To the left is a cozy bar, and past the bar is an additional dining space which, furthermore, leads right into the kitchen.We settled in toward the rear dining area, warm and intimate for a date.  Started with the wine menu, not sure on which bottle to order, we had some tastings.  Our gracious server, Jay, offered up another tasting, of his choice, and we decided to go with that one.  It was a wonderful and complex Sicilian wine which suited both our palettes.We started with their simple cheese board.  It's sufficient for a starter, however, don't expect more of an abundant board, it's simply a tasting board.  We both very much enjoyed one particular cheese, the other two were fine as well.  The pear jam was interesting in a great way.For our mains, my date immediately decided on the pappardelle which I had a strong eye on, alas, I wasn't quick like a fox.  Moving on, I couldn't decide what to select, so, I left it upon our server, Jay's, discretion.  Ended up with the ravioli - though it is whole wheat pasta, don't sleep on it folks.  It is quite delicate and luscious.  Think doughy soft pillows, encased with the most soft creamiest filling.  Nailed it! After devouring our respective meals and finishing off the last of the red, Jay, our server, poured us another one, on the house.  That's what I call customer service!  Kudos.  Both of us were so content with the meal, we had little room left for anything else.  Will return sooner than you know!",Bonafini
21,Every bite was sensational. We ordered:Smoked Pork Spare RibsHouse made CavatelliFriesSpoon Bread (so good)Brownie Sandwich I can not wait to go back.,"Sometimes they are good, lately it's been not so good. The kitchen staff has changed and they mess up food for sport.  They can not get a simple egg dish right. Your not supposed to say anything, instead, smile, pay and come back again.

22,Eh. Pizza was average. Dough was chewy. Sauce was minimal. Oh and this was my $14 caesar salad. With no croutons.,They lure you with their famous burger then take it off the menu at 7 pm so that you get to sit next to everyone eating the burger but you're left eating pizza. The pizza is ok but ultimately just pizza with too little cheese and too much sauce.,"Hands down, best pizza & burger! Came here with a group 5 for dinner and had to wait a bit over an hour for seats. It was last minute for us to head down there,  so make reservations if you know you're planning to try this place out. I watched an Insider video on Facebook on how bomb the burger was, but still hesitant to try since most of these videos hype up the food more than how it actually tastes. Not this one, I can say that without hesitation that Emily is a must try. When we finally got seated, the waiter informed us there were only 4 burgers left and immediately ordered 3. It was only an hour and half of opening and only 4 burgers remaining. On top of the burgers, we ordered a Colony (red sauce, pepperoni, pickled jalapeno, honey) & Emily (mozzarella, crushed pistachios, truffle sottocenere, honey) pizza. Who would've thought adding honey can enhance the flavor of a pizza? There wasn't too much honey; just the right amount to give its pizza dough an extra level of goodness.","Even though this place does a large pizza business, I came here for the Emmy burger. I was not disappointed. The burger patty is extremely quality and the melted cheddar & Emily sauce make it very decadent. I ordered medium and my wife ordered medium well and I'd say they both were less cooked than requested but we both really enjoyed how they came out.  They only make a certain number of burgers per day. I got there a little after 6 pm on a rainy Wednesday and got the last burger of the night!  Less than an hour after opening!  The fries are good shoe string and come with ketchup and an aoli. I looked around and everyone was getting a burger but they were still pumping out pizzas for their delivery business. The pizzas that I saw did look good. I wouldn't recommend this place for a group. Two is ideal but they do have a few tables for four. Every table is filled. Bathroom was clean and the staff in general was friendly. Good, but limited, beer on tap. High end wine list. The burger was a little pricey but was definitely a top burger I've had in NYC. Will definitely go back.","I have to agree with the person who was here on the same rainy Wednesday I came. I sat at 5:45 so I didn't experience running out of burgers an hour after opening. I have to imagine running out of the signature dinner an hour after opening just feeds the hype. No way in the world the Emily burger is worth the 28 dollars it costs! It's rare to see a restaurant mobbed at 5:45. They've got their hype factor machine working overtime! Thank social media for this nonsense. This experience is on way too many top ten lists. It doesn't bode well for top ten lists...I saw a couple share one of their small pizzas and a have a burger each. They were early thirties and had a baby along. I was surprised they went for it! Each had two cocktails @ 14 dollars each. So, they went for about $150! I know this sounds like a lot but It is entirely realistic. I had the burger (no substitutions) and two cocktails for $58.69. plus a 10 dollar tip with no pizza. That much money could have netted them so much better value! Arguably better food as well. The place is cramped. The chairs were just wood, no upholstery. The staff was aloof. I don't get it. The idea that this is the best burger in New York is subjective and it was lost on me. The pretzel looking roll was not particularly pretzel tasting. The grease factor made it a self inflicted wound, especially as oversized as it was. Tiny little gherkins just upped the snob factor. The waffle fries in earlier reviews are gone. Too bad, I'm a fan of those! They've been replaced by a much less festive and less labor intensive shoe string version reminiscent of McDonalds. I would be guilty of being caught up in sheer hype if I recommended this experience.","The ambiance and service were great. The drinks were great. The pizza was amazing. But the burger here is arguably the best in NYC! We split 3 pizzas and 3 burgers as a group of 5. We tried the signature Emily which is a sweet, delicious truffle explosion and also the The Big Ang and Olympus Mons. The latter of which were both savory but not too heavy and not greasy. The crusts are crisp and thin-- perfect starters before our burgers.The burger is sweet, soft and melts in your mouth... the party is absolutely delicious. Definitely make room for this!We finished with a snore calzone and a banana pudding-- again both delicious. The banana pudding in particular was great for me as I don't have much of a sweet tooth.Visit this place!",Emily
23,"I'm obsessed with the Spicy Ramen here. My boyfriend also loves Ramen but doesn't eat pork, I'll update to 5 stars if they add a Spicy Ramen option without pork because then we could go all of the time!","The food taste average, the quality of food does not match the price at all though. Customer service was horrible, no smile, no thank you, no please at all. Just purely rude and impatient. The server seemed to have an attitude and was on her phone all the time behind the counter. The experience we had was way below our expectation. Overpriced food and terrible service are the reasons I am giving this place a two-star, and I'm being generous because I like the interior design of the restaurant and the cleanness of the place.","The food was ok, but beware they are going to charge you a crazy amount of tip without notice.At least 27% or more.","I love this place. The ramen dishes are so delicious here, especially with the spicy oil sauce. If you are into spice then definitely order this oil with your ramen dish, it really adds flavor. So far, I have tried the tonkatsu, spicy miso, and the curry ramen. I really did not like the curry one but the tonkatsu and spicy miso are delicious. I have also tried the shrimp shumai and highly recommend this appetizer. My date and I ended up ordering two plates of these. Also try the creamy mango soda, it is delicious. I love that this place is so close to my house. The neighborhood needed a restaurant like this.","I wanted to love or at least really like this place because it's pretty close to home but unfortunately it was a disappointment. The interior is cute and cozy. The service was fine. They only take cash which in this day and age can be a tad annoying but not a dealbreaker.On to the ramen. I ordered the Black Tonkotsu. The noodles weren't over cooked which is good but the whole dish was just bland and one note. There wasn't the depth of flavor that I am used to from a bowl of ramen. The broth should have a ton of flavor (not just salt) but actual flavor whether from pork, miso, meat bones, soy sauce  etc. With so many delicious ramen spots in NY and in Brooklyn specifically I'll probably stick to some of the other places I've been.","It's not easy to find delicious, flavourful, filling vegan ramen that's not loaded with veggies and tastes earthy. Be here we are! The curry ramen is incredible, but be sure to ask for it to be made vegan if that's what you want. I was hesitant to try this, as when I think of curry ramen I think of a bowl of thick Japanese curry over noodles but I was very pleasantly surprised. I always always add the spicy oil to this to elevate the spice. I can't speak for any of the meat based ramen, but my friends seemed to really enjoy it having left barely any broth behind. One thing though, I do really wish they were available on Postmates. I'm just happy that there's great ramen within walking distance of my apartment. Ah, gentrification. Can we love AND hate it? Yes. Yes we can.",Nana Ramen
24,"I'm not sure if I remember Buttermilk Channel very fondly (ate here many moons ago), or if my experience this time was meh, but I left unimpressed. Wife and I reserved dinner at about 5:30p on a weekend, and were seated in a dark two-top right at the kitchen pass. This has happened so often lately (in other places) that I'm beginning to think it's a thing - give rezzies the bad table b/c people over-reserve due to FOMO. I can't fault restaurants for doing that per se, but if that's a problem, then don't take reservations. That's just guesswork, but the takeaway is that our seating left a lot to be desired, and there were better options.Speaking of the kitchen, it was slow. Which would be fine if the food was worth the wait, and sadly, it wasn't - my steak was unevenly cooked. To be fair, the seasoning was on point, but that's the hard part, or it should be ...I will say that our peach galette dessert was perfect. Not sure if it was made in house, but it tasted like it.Lots of vegetarian options, too. I'm not a vegetarian, but IMO a restaurant should have plenty of veg options if they want to be taken seriously.I think it's noteworthy that there was a ton of kids here. Like, eating usual everyday dinner (must be nice, but then again, this is Carroll Gardens).I have two of my own, so I'm used to kids, but there were so many that it was almost odd.Buttermilk Channel was not as good as I remembered it, but I remembered it as being phenomenal. Our dinner was fine I suppose, but not outstanding, which is what I expected.Five stars with a loss of one star each for bad seating/poor lighting, and a slow kitchen with uneven cooking.","Just ok is not ok . Not bad , a very nice space and the cocktails were good . The chicken was a bit salty as was the corn bread.",The Pecan Pie French Toast is outta this world The pricey eggs and bacon as a side  not so much. If you charge 15 bucks for french toast you should make breakfast staples like eggs and bacon cheap if your going to charge to have them as a side my only complaint.,"You're always going to have a quality meal at Buttermilk Channel whether it be brunch, lunch or dinner. You'll pay a Brooklyn premium for it, but it's actually worth it. The food is always mouth watering no matter what you order (though the fries and popovers are TO DIE FOR). I'm also partial to their pickles (which they sell to go too). Drinks are well made, if not a little small on the pour/price ratio. Bonus on kids' meals are the clown sundae (upside down ice cream cone with ultra premium ice cream). Service is consistently friendly and upbeat (read no snobbery) and water is continually filled throughout your meal (extra helpful as fries can be salty). I'm so glad they've been able to stay in the hood for a long time as they're certainly a staple. If you haven't checked them out ever - what's wrong with you? If it's been a while, make it a point to head back while the outdoors are still perfect!","Drive by here a lot back then, remembered there was always a long line. So i decided to give this place a try with couple friends. Got seated pretty quick on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. Not too impress with the food, more towards the plain side, no seasoning. Drink is disappointing. Thought i ordered an cup of ice or something. 80% ice in my drink, and 20% i don't know what it is. Shouldve follow my mind, not to order drink and stick with tea or something. Or maybe its me, im comparing the drink to cocktail bars. Overall, mehh experience. Nothing special. Only think good is i got seated quick, food came out pretty quick, and the servicer was pretty nice. Done.","Recently came to Buttermilk Channel for Restaurant Week and wasn't disappointed. The ricotta was out of this world. I would eat that for breakfast, lunch and dinner! The fried chicken and waffles with balsamic syrup were delicious. You don't taste the cheddar in the waffles and the slaw didn't have much flavor though. The pecan pie sundae was the perfect way to end the meal. We brought our own wine since there's no corking fee in Tuesday's, but they also have their drink menu available. The restaurant is typical of what you find throughout Brooklyn, limited space and a lot of tables in close quarters. The exposed brick makes it feel cozy and inviting. However, they could use some extra lighting at night since it got fairly dark inside. Service was a bit slow and we got a new waiter half way through dinner which was unusual. Overall, we had a great meal and will definitely be going back to try some of the other dishes.",Buttermilk Channel
25,"The chicken got me sick ! ..Me and my wife was out last night and decided to stop in for some chicken and waffles. As we are eating I notice my chicken was a little reddish inside and turn me off to eating anymore. Not thinking to much of it after , we get home and both of us are in stomach pain , both of us fighting for the ""office"" (restroom). Now it made sense , the chicken was undercooked ! I would like to go back but at this point I do not want to risk getting sick again.","Fried Chicken Box Brunch.  Things missing from my  order= mac and cheese, jelly(which they charged me extra $1) so 50% of the items are missing. Moral: dont trust them. Break the staple open and Check ur order yourself  or it will ruin your lunch And thats after u wait 15 min for someone to attend to ur order for pickup.","Came here to try the fried chicken and pie and did not leave disappointed.Chicken was crispy outside and very tender and juicy inside. You could even see the juice leaking out as you ripped the meat apart. The cheese grits side worked well with the jalapeno sauce on top. Even the biscuit was soft and savory. I just wanted to devour everything.As for the pies, our group had apple pie, pecan pie, and banana cream pie. My favorite was the banana cream pie simply for how light it was after the heavy entree and how it wasn't too sweet, but the other two were decent too. The pecan pie was a bit too sweet for me, so I ended up leaving a bit of it. Hard to go wrong with the apple pie and can't say anything bad about this one.Definitely worth a try if you're in the neighborhood.","After a night full of drinks and good company, my friend and I were hungry so we decided to get late night food at Pies 'n' Thighs.Within seconds of being seated, our waitress came over with a big smile and asked how our evening was going. We gave her our orders and the food was out within 10-15 mins. I ordered the chicken and waffles and it was good. The initial bites were delicious but as I progressed through the food, the flavor became more and more tiring and I got full after eating half of my plate. That is probably a personal problem because my friend ordered the same thing and crushed it.Great service, great food, and great vibes. Check them out!","We took the family to an evening in Williamsburg and I wanted to find a place to go that everyone would like. Pies-n-Thighs caught my eye because they had good reviews and their menu included something that would appeal to everyone in my party. I wish I would have done the waitlist yelp thing because when we got there it was about 45 minutes for a seat. No biggie, we weren't starving and that gave us more time to explore. But if we were any hungrier it might have been a problem.They seated us in the bigger section in the back by the window and our server was taking care of us within minutes. My daughter got the lemonade which she though was too sour but I though it was good. We ordered the pulled pork, chicken and waffles, the hamburger and catfish basket. The food took an average amount of time to come out, and looked delicious. They happily accepted my request for no bun with my pulled pork, so I got a healthy portion of pork in a cup. It was so good and had so much flavor, my mouth is watering just thinking about the vinegar based bbq sauce. The greens were obviously fresh and not canned, and my husband and I fought over the last little bit of them. Everyone else really enjoyed their food, and they let my mom special order thighs for her chicken and waffles. There were hardly any leftovers. Oh, and we highly recommend the fried green tomatoes appetizer. The remoulade is super good and has a little kick. I would definitely go back to Pies-n-Thighs, and I would use the waitlist feature to secure a place in line.",The chicken here is pretty good! It had a nice crispy texture with a good juicy inside. They also provide you with both hot sauce and honey for all of your flavoring needs. The cole slaw wasn't that good though so I'd pass on that. The biscuit was good but a little heavy and condensed tasting.,Pies-n-Thighs
26,"The food here was great. We loved the vegetarian dumplings and chicken wings. Our waitresses were sweet and wonderful too. My review is not for the food. The food was great. The owner on the other hand, treated several people horribly. The way he spoke to them was loud, aggressive, and well within ear shot of us as we dined. He told one delivery guy ""I don't give a f---- what the app says, it will be 15 minutes for the food. Do you want it or not?"" To another one he yelled, ""Shutup. Either wait for the food or don't."" Now, the restaurant was very busy and perhaps they were backordered, but we stopped our conversation several times to hear him yell at the delivery staff. Horrible horrible experience and we felt really bad for those at the end of his wrath.We could not wait to leave. Would not ever give our money to this guy again.",It's a bit pricey but food came out quickly and was delicious. Downside is that if your a solo eater don't get the sparkling water they only have one size which is about a liter and will cost you six dollars.,"As mentioned before, food is still *puts palms together in the air*I stan for this restaurant. I requested my husband take me here for my birthday and I ate my face off (after my camera ate of course)Yummmmmmmmmmmm","Regardless of what one may think of ""Asian Fusion"" as a cuisine, Hunger Pang certainly breaks the mold; they use quality ingredients in their dishes. I ordered the Pang Fried Noodles with pork, and it was delicious. Unlike the cookie-cutter Asian restaurants that tend to use low-quality frozen vegetables, it's obvious Hunger Pang takes more pride in where they source their veggies from; they were fresh and prepped in-kitchen. The pork was also extremely tender. Yes, $16 (plus tax, tip, etc...) for a noodle dish is more expensive than your average Asian place. But the premium of quality ingredients is worth splurging for. This place is a gem. I'm excited to explore the rest of their menu. (I ordered via Caviar, and I was not let down.)","We came here this past Saturday for dinner. The place itself is pretty cute and cozy. We made a reservation on OpenTable and we got seated right away. There was never a quiet moment here, which is always a good sign!We ordered the cheddar and chive pork dumplings for appetizer and it was good but not really my favorite as it was kind of heavy. My husband ordered the General Guan's Roasted Chicken and the chicken was super juicy. I ordered the Homemade Wide Egg Noodles with veggies and the noodles were cooked to perfection -- you can definitely tell that it is homemade. I'm inclined to dock a star because there was one waitress who looked so overwhelmed and was running around like crazy and there was another waitress who was dillydallying around. We couldn't even get either of their attentions when we wanted to get the check -- it took us about 15-20 minutes to get the check and that's only because my husband got up out of his seat and asked for it from one of them. Not a strong finish but would come back for the food.","This cozy and savory spot was introduced to me by friends who couldn't stop raving over Hunger Pang's brunch menu. On our attempt Labor day morning, it had been closed for maintenance but was to reopen for dinner @ 5pm. We had called later to reserve a table for 8pm, which we were happy to have done since it is quite small and large groups had already taken up a majority of spots. (I'd recommend you do this for groups larger than 3). The room was dimly lit with red and yellow hues making the environment feel warm and homy. We were immediately seated and despite there being only one server present for the entire restaurant, we were attended to adequately. The menu included a lot of Asian fusion dishes which all sounded delicious, as well as some dessert options. We started with an order of well seasoned Charred Broccoli ($8) and perfectly fried Herb French Fries ($5) that we dipped into Houssain ketchup and spicy mayo. Not long after, we were given our main courses: Fresh Handmade Wide Noodles w/ Shrimp and Lobster Essence ($21), Pang Fried Noodles with Braised Pork ($16), and Braised Beef Short Rib over rice ($19). The portions are quite substantial and we all ended up boxing leftovers. I personally ordered the handmade wide noodles which came with vegetables atop noodles and covered in a subtle shrimp/lobster sauce. The dish tasted similar to an Asian version of shrimp scampi, which turned out to be delicious and definitely better the day after. I tried a bit of Pang fried noodles, as well, from my friend and it was the right amount of crispy noodles to vegetable to meat ratio with all the flavor. However, I will say that particular dish can get a bit salty after a while. We unfortunately had no room for dessert. Overall I'd say if you're experiencing some real ""hunger pangs"" and are in need for some Asian fusion food this is the place to be. ***one of my friends personally knows the owner who had  recently told him that the menu will be changing shortly as we transition into the Fall season in order to include the richest ingredients to the menu. A great reason to come back for sure!",Hunger Pang
27,I went here and on a hot summer day. I didn't stay long and only had 1 drink. I think it was on happy hour. Something with ginger and a dark spirit. The bartender was friendly but it was extremely hot in there. They have indoor and outdoor seating. I didn't try the food but other people ordered and it looked tasty. I'd go back but not on such a sweltering day. Maybe the AC was broken and I just picked the worse day. I'd give it another shot.,"I wanted to give this place a better rating but the service was completely ridiculous. I came in with a party of 6 and there was a lot of empty space to put the small three tables together.  The waiter told me that it was an inconvenience for HER because then she would have to walk around the tables to get to the two other guest that were in the place. Please note that this place is very spacious. It is not small or tight at all. The tables would not be in her wayMaybe it's just me but I'm not interested in going to a place where I'm going to be treated poorly because the employees don't want to work. Lastly, a group of four came in after us and the waitress immediately moved tables without any issues so they can fit. I don't know if it was a race thing but it seriously felt like one. This place will never get my business again, nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone.","Came here for brunch a few days ago.  I had the chicken quesadilla with a salad, 2 sangrias, and a coffee.  The food was nothing to write home about. The quesadilla was plain and dry (and didn't come with salsa on the side or even sour cream). I found the prices to be a bit overpriced considering what you got.  The server was only ok and I find that she was overworked and they need to hire more staff on Sunday.  I won't be back.",Had the best burger Ive had in some time. Brunch is amazing and I love the whole vibe of the place.,Stopped in for a quick breakfast and stayed for a beer & shot! Who doesn't love a good drink combo for less than 7 bucks?! While here I gnoshed on a simple breakfast of eggs and bacon. If a clean plate is any indication of goodness...well then my plate was cleant. Yes I said cleant. LOL. Stop in and have a laugh with Jess. Will visit again.,"I love when I come across local neighborhood restaurants. I came to this spot on a Saturday morning and sat myself at the bar. Both bartenders/servers were super sweet and friendly. I ordered the French toast with berries and whipped cream with a side of bacon. They were extra generous with bacon too! The food portions are great for the price as well. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience. I can see myself returning again for Saturday brunch!",Salem's Hour
28,"This is the spot is the holy grail of happy hour. It's in the weird desert of Williamsburg where there's nothing and it's in the middle of a intersection. The restaurant has a lot of character with dive bar roots. The bartender was a Renaissance Man, educating the previous crowd on something real estate related. He walked me through the menu they had a 10 dollar burger/beer on Happy Hour and 1 dollar boneless or bone-in wings. I was initially turned off by the price but got 5 boneless wings- it was everything I needed in life. I devoured it before I could take a picture. Too bad i don't live in the area I could see myself being there everyday after work. Can't wait to go back.",It's old. Like historic old lol .. but that's the charm.Walked in on a Sunday for some food and sat at the bar with high chairs.The vibe is chill and food hot.,"Food was bad. Ordered delivery, waited for an hour. Called the restaurant, no answer, called second time, voice mail was full. Another 45 minutes later, food finally came. Salad was all mushed, fries were all cold. Won't order delivery again. But will try dine-in and give it a second try.",Super good drink deals and they have food! I had the wings which were perfectly spicy and tasty. They also were playing jam after jam on the radio so needless to say it was hard to leave.,"BEST chicken and waffles ever!  Love the dive bar/hipster vibe of this spot - they make a good Bloody Mary (very spicy!) but the star of the show was the chicken and waffles.  I think they deep fry the waffles so it is crispy, chicken is amazing with the peppers and scallions - we asked for extra but they never came around to give us that.  100% would come back on a hungover Sunday for brunch!",Super delicious food but very shitty service. Our server forgot our stuff multiple times and we waited over an hour and a half for our food. They have a super cute patio and the place is never crowded which is a plus. If you come here expect to be here for at least 2.5 hours. Service time took this long both times I've been. Their vegetarian chicken and waffles is the best.,Hard Times Christmas Liquors at the Sunset bar
29,I will be back. I went in for a fried chicken to go. Not disappointed but not satisfied as well. It need some sort of acidity. And some bits only had the crumbs of the flour. Not a good indication for a perfect fried chicken that just tell me there was excess flour on the chicken before it got fried. Flavor was good. Love the red cabbage but needed something to cut the fat.,"I was excited to try this place but after checking it out,I've decided it was over-hyped. My sweet tahini oat milk latte, one of their specialties, was boring. I tasted no cardamom and any tahini flavor was lost to the oat milk...a waste of SIX DOLLARS. The brew Parlor coffee, whose retail shop  I enjoy going into when it's open to customers, their coffeess never wow me. Golda serves the same pastries as Konditori and the made to order food I saw was lackluster in presentation...we can all take half an avocado slice it and sprinkle chili flakes on top. One and done. Back to the unpretentious and reliably good, Daily Press across the street.",I've been trying to visit this place-- noone picks up the phone and its been closed during the posted-hours. Is this business still open???,Amazing friend chicken sandwich Perfect amount of crispy with ideal softness from the everything bun. The sauce on the bun gave the experience a zing to the crunch that will one having coming back again and again!,"Have been a number of times and am only now getting around to writing a review. Golda features delicious, made-to-order food with heavy Middle Eastern/Eastern European flair. From the fantastic coffees to the flavorful mains, Golda is the type of place where you can't go wrong with what you order. Just came back from having breakfast with a friend and we both commented on how good our meals were. I had the eggplant menemen (pan-fried? eggplant, crisply egg, saffron yogurt, Jerusalem artichoke chips, etc.) and my friend had the egg sandwich and each was prepared perfectly. The only downside to Golda is the space/layout. Real estate in NYC is obscene, so it's not Golda's fault that the seating is limited, but it's not a comfortable place to sit and no matter which seat you have you feel cramped and slightly uncomfortable...which probably helps ensure quick turnover. That said, the food is the star and the seating is something you can overlook while you devour your food.","This niche cafe is tiny with a few equally tiny tables but as my friend pointed out, it's quite photogenic. Very nice decor details. You order your items and pay for everything at the counter and then find a table. That being said, while the dishes were very prettily presented, they lacked seasoning. This, especially for a bunch of Middle Eastern brunch items. I just wanted some more tinge and spice in the cauliflower since it was so beautifully colourful.",Golda
30,"I'm from the culinary capital of the world--New Orleans, so I know delish.  SOCO has nice decor, ambience, and ample street parking, however, tables are cramped together, service lacked mere basics, and food was very bland. Fried pickled oysters ($12)--bland, seemingly 3 oysters cut into halves, though the pickled pineapple salsa was tasty; cheesy jalapeno corn muffins ($5) no cheese or cheese flavor and too sweet; pecan crusted pork chops ($19), tasted pre-boiled, bland and no sign of pecans or pecan flavor with too-sweet collard greens; pan fried (or rather seared) very lightly-battered catfish on a bed of veggies and black-eyed peas--all bland. The Mardi Gras cocktail ($14) tasted like punch, even the remake. The food at SOCO is OVERPRICED for LACK OF TASTE. It looked good, smelled good, as if it had been well-prepared, but... was terribly bland.","Let me start by saying the food here is delicious. I've been before and loved it which is why I brought my mom, who is visiting from out of town, here for Mother's Day dinner. It will also be the last time I visit. The stars are for the food and our replacement waiter that did the best he could. But even he couldn't make up for the owner's poor service. 1. The owner stood off to the side of our table the entire time overseeing the dining room but never once came over and asked how the meal was and ask how we're doing. Basic service I get even at Applebee's but fine. I'll move on. 2. After receiving our appetizer it was almost 20 minutes before anyone came to check in us. Why? Our waitress left mid shift and no one bothered to send anyone over to our table to fill in. And yes the owner is still standing there unapologetic saying nothing. Not checking up on his guests. Not apologizing for the oversight. Not comping an iced tea for the wait nothing. But again, moving on. 3. The kicker: I spilled my iced tea on the table. It spills all on me, the table, the floor. There is a puddle on the floor and I'm scrambling to soak up the tea on the table with my 2 napkins and still he does nothing. Servers step over the puddle on the floor. I see him look at me as I'm trying to blot my pants and nothing. Finally he comes over. (Yay). He picks up the lemon that fell on the floor from my glass, hands it off to a server and returns to his post to watch the dining room. WTF!!! Didn't grab extra napkins for me. Didn't even ask a waiter to grab me napkins. Nothing. Worthless. He has a customer trying to dry herself in front of him and the only thing he cares about was a damn lemon on the floor. Pork chop,while delicious, wasn't worth the money paid for crap service. I'll take my money elsewhere.","Soco, Soco, Soco...After tonight I doubt I will return, use to be one of my favs in Brooklyn. Everything was going good until my friend saw a roach crawling on the wall next to her, we called a waitress over, she grabbed a napkin and came over and killed it. We were starving & drove all the way from Queens and decided to stay , no manager came over to apologize or to accommodate the situation. Please get an exterminator asap. Then our waitress disappeared on us for 20 mins , I waved my napkin in the air to cause attention , a bus boy saw me and came over and helped us with doggie bags and our check. I gave yall 3 stars because the creole pasta was good. Customer service is 0. God bless your business though.","Haven't been here in a few years and decided to come here for brunch during Labor Day weekend. I personally love the ambiance of Soco and the staff here is very friendly! My boyfriend and I opted to order the rum punch carafe. Wasn't a fan too much of the cinnamon flavor, but it wasn't too bad.As for our meals, I ordered the steak and eggs which came out in a huge portion. My boyfriend ordered the soul food chicken sandwich which was amazing. Of course, we ordered a side of Mac and cheese which is one of the best I've had!","I hope my mom never reads this butttt Soco has the best Mac and Cheese Ive ever had. I'm not sure who Aunt Cruz is but bless her soul. Ive been to this location twice and have yet to be disappointed, I just wish they were closer to my home. The service is amazing, staff very friendly and hip. They have an awesome music selection that'd have you ready to buss a wine one second and ready to sing your heart out the next. My first time here, I had the F-Que Wings and a side of collard greens. The wings were alright but nothing to get excited for. The greens were great and packing flavor but they were even better on my most recent visit.I'm not sure how much I can stress it but if you ever come to Soco, the Mac and Cheese is a MUST. It was so good I took some to go but nothing is as good as it coming out fresh and hot in the little cast iron skillet. The collard green have delicious as well with a little sweet kick to them. If you think the Popeyes Chicken sandwich is good, YOU HAVE TO TRY Soco's Soul Fried Chicken Sandwich. I can go on and on about my experience here but you have to try it for yourself.","I have no complaints.I have been dying to try this place, and finally. Made it happen. I know this place is a staple in the neighborhood and finally got to try their famous Mac and cheese recommend by the waitress. We ordered: jalapeños hush puppies, Mac and cheese, shrimp and grits, and jambalaya.I CANT EMPHASIZE HOW MUCH I LOVE THE SEASONING OF THE DISHES. Shrimps were so freaking good. I should also say this is my first time having grits, and you know what? It's popping. Everything was perfectly made and just hearty. I think my fave was the jambalaya though. The shrimp was def more type of flavor than the lobster and shrimp and grits entree. The lobster needed a touch of lemon or something. But great dish nonetheless. My boyfriend inhaled it...Where have I been?! (Apparently not to the South or eating right!)Oh, and the music.... R&B ALL DAY. Damn. I was dancing the entire evening in my booth.",Soco
31,"Man, I love this place's food usually but the service here on the weekend was just horrendous. We arrived thinking we'd get 2 or 3 drinks before our night out and have a nice dinner. Waitress sat us down, took our drink orders and took the drinks menu away (we wanted to keep it, but whatever.) My bf ordered chicken and waffles, I ordered vegetarian chicken and waffles. I was careful to check that she had written down that it needed to be vegetarian.30 mins later, our food arrives (a young pre-teen/teenage boy brought it out the kitchen?!), I take one bite and I realize it's not vegetarian. I flag him down and ask, ""Is this vegetarian?"" He looks at me like I'm crazy and goes, ""No, why?"" ""Because I ordered vegetarian."" He sighs, rolls his eyes and takes the plate away. No apology. It takes about 20 mins for them to redo my food, during which my boyfriend's food went cold. We tried multiple times to flag down someone - anyone! - for a drink in that time. We couldn't get anyone to stop. The restaurant was only about half full, with lots of servers - it just seemed like they'd forgotten to properly assign our table or something.Eventually, my food comes out with the correct order. They'd evidently rushed it because it was all undercooked but I'm starving and my boyfriend's food is cold so we eat. Again we try and flag down anyone for a drink - no dice. At the end of the meal, a completely different server again comes and whips the plates away. No ""How was your food?"" or ""Sorry we fed a vegetarian meat"" or ""Let me comp you a couple drinks"". A completely new server brought the check.I don't know what happened here but I just keep thinking, what would have happened if I had had an allergy? Not only was the whole experience really rude, but it was a potential food hazard and nobody seemed to think it was a big deal.","The lack of customer service was so bad tonight, I just walked out. If I could give them no stars, I would.  There was only 5 tables open and 3 of those were waiting on their checks.  I waited 20 minutes and no one came to even offer water.  The manager stood around, on his phone and doing nothing... The manager with the beard is the worst! He has no customer service skills.","This was a place that I've always wanted to try. I had their infamous chicken and waffles and I have to say, I wasn't impressed. The chicken was dry but the waffles were okay. I honestly don't have much to say about this place. I came early enough so the wait wasn't super long and they had a lot of tables and outdoor seating as well. The only problem with outdoor seating was when I was watching a couple battle a bee that kept coming towards their syrup. I think that was the main highlight of my meal.","Delicious! Great service. Went for brunch on a Sunday at noon and didn't have to wait long-- I like how they use the text service to let you know when your table is ready/you can see the queue.Had the chicken and waffles and it was the perfect portion! Waffle was light and fluffy; chicken was cooked perfectly. Loved the berry, lemon, and herbed butters that cake with it-- the lemon was my favorite. Would come back again!","PLEASE BEWARE WHEN USING CREDIT CARDS HERE! Maybe bring cash.  My experience was straight crazy!  It kinda messed up my experience a bit. Just to recap.The spot was perfect!! The set up was cool. The bar was eye catching!  The music was hot!! The food was Awesome, the chicken n waffles with the different butters..the biscuits with the different spreads..the mac n cheese..our bangin drinks, everything was soo good!!  The service was aight, tried to rush us a bit wasn't havin it, was enjoyin my biscuits..got the good,  now for the bad...I used my Amex card that I use like once a month and within 1 hour of paying and leaving,  I get a notification that my Amex card has just been attempted at Rainbow clothing store for like $300 and at Ulta beauty online for like $200 and were declined thank GOD for AMEX.",These were the best pancakes I've ever had in my life. And the butters!!! The freaking butters... was amazing. My hubs got the chicken and waffles and was highly satisfied. We came for brunch so the menu wasn't the full menu. However I will definitely be coming back to try the other items. Oh yea the home fries were amazing as well.,Sweet Chick 2
32,"Bunsmith was one those places I walked into not sure what I was going to experience. I can tell you this place left me wanting to come back for an excellent meal that was not only affordable but packed with flavor and style. This place gave my tastebuds a much needed kick in the mouth compared to places in the South. We first ordered the  kimchi which was shocking refreshing even with the extra kick of spice as well. Then, I ordered the spicy Korean Ramen with Pork. I was worried that the American cheese would be that fake nasty cheese that looks and taste plastic but I was so wrong! I couldn't even taste the cheese because it blended so well with the meal. My meal was spicy but not overwhelming to the point that taste was sacrificed. That perfect tenderness of the pork and cooked just right ramen makes me want to keep coming over and over. Go ahead and try this one of a kind experience! It will not disappoint!",The food was just ok. The two plates we tried were missing stronger flavors.,"Delicious, affordable buns. Came late night on a Saturday, dark-lit, hip ambiance. Can sirt at the bar or hightop for a casual bite, or sit down at a table for a little bit more of an intimate experience. The bar looked good for drinks too. Tons of craftsmanship here all around.Where they lost a star: ""sticky fries"" - $7. Not worth it. Rice syrup and some paprika. Nothing special whatsoever. Basically a large order of McDonalds fries spread on a small metal sheet pan. Felt sort of gypped here.","Bunsmith is the best! They always have an IPA on hand which I appreciate and the buns are amazing...I agree with most of the other reviewers, pork jowl is definitely the best. Their fries are amazingggg, but the Korean Fried Chicken Nuggets were just ok. They come with a standard BBQ sauce that I wasn't impressed with. I'd love to try a bowl here but I'm not sure that I can convince myself NOT to eat a million buns.","Food was good. We Had the brisket, spam and cookie, and fried chicken bun. The brisket bun was very tender and flavorful but fried chicken bun could've have a bit more flavor. Ironically, the spam and cookie butter was really good sweet and savory. The fried could've used a bit more seasoning or salt with the honey and seasoning the fries had no taste.We came on a Sunday evening and it was pretty quiet. About 10 mins later the seats did start to fill up. We sat the bar and the bartender was very informative and attentive.","Food was good. We Had the brisket, spam and cookie, and fried chicken bun.

33,I've got two words for ya...Clobster Roll!,"Havent been in some time but ummm when the young lady gave me my lobster roll it looked like it was thrown on the bread. She said ""it looks a mess but its good"". Ok over looked that cuz ive been before and had no complaints. I opted to stay and eat. Get to the end of the roll and its cold. Like if it was taking from the fridge/freezer and not throughly cooked . I hope this isnt going to be one of those business that gave good service when they 1st opened but then turns to shit once they get a name for them selves. Im so annoyed because ive had a hankering for a lobster roll for a minute and came out my way here. In a rain storm ‍‍. Was gonna get another drink & banana pudding since its #winedownwednesday but im Throughly disappointed. Thats time and $30 wasted","Super over-priced for the portion size. I got the crab roll and it had about the same amount of crab as a California roll(a little more). $16 (after she added garlic butter on her own for $1) Crab Mac was $12 with a tablespoon of crab in it, so sad. Overall it was a let down of an experience. Automatically generated a 15% tip with no service required.","This is hands down in my top 5 fave foods this summer! Service was fast and friendlyFood was extremely deliciousDining area is really comfortable w beach-like vibesThe crab grilled cheese is a solid 10/10. I would drive 30 miles just to come back for it again. It's flavorful, with a crispy exterior but still soft and juicy on the inside. It has the perfect crab to cheese ratio so there's a great cheese pull. Surprisingly not overly greasy. Unbelievably delicious. Perfect thing to share between 2 people. The crab rolls are a 9/10 because it's a little smaller than we expected but mainly because we ate the grilled cheese first and that is just unbeatable. The crab rolls are so fresh, served on a Martin's potato roll. The crab tacos just ain't it. 2/10 Not worth the money. Sauce and portion of crab wasn't hitting the spot. Save your tummy space for other things on the menu Lemonade (not in picture) had a strong basil taste to it. Wasn't our thing but if you're into that, definitely get it. It's homemade! My girl and I came here 10 min after they opened and they already had served multiple people + sent out orders for delivery. This place is awesome!","Came here on a rainy day for a small dinner. I really loved their sandwiches. Me and a friend split a combo that they have every Thursday. For $20 you get three items; we got tomato bisque soup that was really great for the rainy day weather, crab roll, and a crabcake slider. The two rolls were super tasteful. In addition to this we also got a 1/2 bound bag of spicy shrimp. The shrimp was tasteful, however it wasn't the best boil and shrimp wasn't the freshest. I underestimated this place, the vibe was super chill and the server was very helpful in helping us choose which to try and even gave us two different sauces for the crab roll. Anyway, 7/10 would come back here for the rolls!","The food is great, but that place is small. That's the only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star. The prices are moderate but there are a few items I personally think are overpriced. The crab legs, broccoli, corn, peach cobbler, banana pudding, lobster roll, and crabby combo tacos were all great!!  I will definitely be going back!",The Crabby Shack
34,"I've been here three times and it slowly gets worse and worse every time. The food is delicious which is why I keep coming back, but the customer service is severely lacking. The hostess is not friendly whatsoever. Acted like I ruined her day when I asked for a table. The worst was my server. Short blonde haired girl. Came to the table 10 minutes after we were seated and said ""what do you want?"" There was no ""how are you"" ""have you been here before"" ""Can I start you with something to drink"". Super unfriendly. Never came back to our table to check on us or ask if we wanted another round of drinks, which we would have if she had been more attentive. It's a shame because I really like the food, but I just can't get over the rude customer service.","This is the best Taiwanese restaurant in New York, but the owners are confused about the heritage and cultural identity of the restaurant.The food here is great. I love the lu rou fan, beef roll, zhajiangmian, and pretty much everything on the menu. It is the only place I know of that serves stinky tofu within 30 mins of Manhattan. In fact, it's one of three full service Taiwanese restaurants around Manhattan. The cocktails are an exciting fusion of Asian herbs and western liquor. The decor here is modern Scandinavian crossed with Brooklyn hipster.What's missing is a feeling of Taiwan. Food is a HUGE part of Asian culture and it is very evident in Taiwanese daily life. From the night markets to the 7-Elevens, there is amazing food on every street corner and every block. Sadly, the only connection to Taiwan is the Chinese characters on the cans of Taiwan Beer.The restaurant opted to dumb down Taiwanese culture to make American diners comfortable instead of creating a dialog. The menu is completely in English with no Chinese while a lot of meaning is lost in the translation. What in the world is a ""nutritious sandwich""? The waiters and waitresses completely butchered the pronunciation of ""zhajiangmian"" and warned me that the sticky tofu is stinky. (Yeah no shit, that's why I want it). Am I supposed to pronounce the Chinese ""lu rou fan"" with an American accent so the wait staff can understand my order too?Dear white people: When the Asians at the table next to you order stinky tofu, please do make a disgusted face and add a snarky comment about how strange it smells. Your opinion is definitely appreciated.The missing star is for the missing soul of this restaurant.","It was good, wouldn't say great. Wait times for a table can be rather long, grab a seat at the bar and forgo the torture of waiting.Jeff was great for service and attentive to both his dining and drinking customers plus mixing for the rest of the restaurant.Portions are mixed bag for size and can feel overvalued. Pea shoots are done well with the fried garlic toppers. Turnip cakes are very dense and don't quite scratch the itch. Make a reservation if you care for a table and enjoy the L train!Interestingly they are inconsistent about naming their dishes on the menu and how they serve it. The zhejiangmian (lamb noodles) were tasty but served with a different label. The same likely goes for any Chinese named dish. Cultural neglect? Maybe.","This is a very solid Taiwanese restaurant. I came on a Sunday night and it was pretty packed. There was already about 10 people waiting outside. They have both inside and outdoor seating, in addition to the bar. The food is very tasty. I ordered the sesame noodles, scallion pancake, and the pork buns. Everything was very fresh and flavorful. The scallion pancake was crispier/crunchier than I'm used to, but still wasn't bad. I would definitely come back if I'm visiting NYC.",Win Som is a brooklyn gem and great for dates and experimenting with unconventional dishes. The drinks here are bomb and the beer is a great pick for first timers. The wait is usually a bit long on a prime day like thurs - sat however worth if it u order a great dish. The fried chicken dish was very messy and a little disappointed.Oh and the music is always good!,"Came here on a Sunday around 11:20am and waited maybe 10 minutes to be seated for 2. They have a small bar at which you can wait and order drinks. We ordered a small iced green tea, which came in this home-brewed canister, large enough to share. It was delightful!For food, we ordered:Tian Dou Jiang (sweet soy milk) - B+O-a Jian (oyster omelette) - A-Sesame Noodles with egg - A-I'm giving them 4 stars for the TASTE of their food alone. However, expect to pay a lot if you like to walk away full, because their portions are much smaller for their prices than in American brunch. Sesame Noodles was a good sized dish (no meat.) Also the Big Chicken and Waffles looked sizable.I probably wouldn't come back for brunch, but still interested in trying their dinner menu!",Win Son
35,"I don't know what all the fuss is about. The pizza was just OK in my opinion. So was the service. The guys make your pizza with no hair nets or gloves which creeped me out a little.... am i the only one ? Anyways it's hella expensive, three meatballs were $14.00 just for starters. Pic of the receipt so you guys can see for yourself.","Great pizza solid 4.5 stars. Thin and crispy and fresh sauce and just the right amount of cheese. Dried Italian herbs may be a hot or miss for some. Worth the long wait but not the best pizza. Sorry. Salad was quite ordinary and lame. Worth half the price. Calzone is served without sauce - you have to order the saicenseparate. No big deal - but it is meat based Ragu sauce and we are vegetarian. We asked them to give us whatever sauce they have - pizza sauce for example. They said that they cannot do that and there was no other alternative. Really - no tomatoes sauce at a pizza joint! After a minute of dumb staring, we gave up and ate the calzone sans sauce - a good one btw. Packed the rest. Time for dessert - cannoli. It was a bit of a let down too - something you get from a store ... hmmmWe say just come for pizza, skip the salad  and have dessert elsewhere as there is plenty to explore around",Not impressed especially after waiting an hour on the line. The bottom of the pizza was slightly burned as if the oven needed to be cleaned. Won't be returning. The setup and design of the restaurant was nice,"Of course it's absolutely incredible! Don't you see that line! Yes, it's worth the wait! And when you're finally in, just sit down and enjoy yourself. Enjoy the legacy of the original pizza makers of the United States, conveniently presented to you in the form of a masterpiece of pizza pie.I'm betting they're all good. But you can't lose with the ""No. 4""- tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto, and arugula... Can't lose...This is in my top 5 of all pizza places in the world (Italy included)...",Great Pizza from the previous owners of Grimaldi's!If you are looking have a nice day/night out in dumbo this is a great spot to get a thin pizza that is delicious.I came here 2hrs before closing on a Saturday and it was perfect as I got a spot right away infront of the pizza oven. This was the best as I'm waiting for my pizza I get to see the pros at work. It was really hot out so the waiter kept pouring the water which was great cause I was dehydrated.We got the Marinara pizza to keep it simple and it hit the spot. It's a nice size pizza and was perfect for 2.In short:- Good Pizza- Great location- Nice waitstaff,"Was at Juliana's pizza on a Sunday. The place is usually considered a competitor of Grimaldi's Pizza right next door. Both places had long lines, but a word of mouth around the neighborhood was telling us that Juliana's pizza is way better than Grimaldi's so we decided to give it a shot. It was a party of two and we waiting on line for about 15-20 minutes or so. We sat by the wall on the right hand side as soon as you walk in. We were greeted by the host who was very kind and professional although she was busy taking care of the crowd outside she still managed to keep her professionalism and attention to the customers. A young server helps us taking our order, apparently he was very busy which we understand, they want people in and out. He rushed us to order, so we just ordered meatballs and a medium pie. The meatballs were perfectly cooked with the perfect amount of garlic and parsley in it, a juicy and tender flavorful meatball with a very well made sauce, I decided to cut one and add it to my slice of pizza and I've got to say: PERFECT COMBO. The pizza was thin crust and was well made. The medium pie comes with 8 slices so we had 4 slices each, they are very thin so won't really fill you up as I thought it was. We asked for parmigiano cheese and the waiter was a little resistant about the request  although we wanted cheese on our pizza he replies :"" are you sure?! This pizza usually doesn't need cheese, the parmigiano ruins it"" We just ignored his opinion and still went for the parmigiano and it was excellent on top of the pizza so we were confused of what he was tried to prove. ‍. Overall we only saw our waiter when we asked for cheese, we had to ask for straws to the buss boy who replies "" I can't, you have to ask your waiter"" For straws?!  strange So I decided to get up and ask the host who was the only polite staff that we've encountered and she brought us straws in a heart beat. I definitely recommend this place if you'd like to try their pizza. It's different from others for sure.",Juliana's Pizza
36,"We came to Sunday in Brooklyn after seeing it on Instagram lol. The Yelp reviews seemed promising but overall I wasn't impressed by the flavor or quality of any of the food. I got the avocado toast and the portion size was tiny, bread wasn't great, and the spices were lackluster. The breakfast potatoes were similar, potatoes in most forms taste delicious but it was very bland and even hot sauce didn't help it much. The wait staff was great, and we were seated quickly on a Saturday morning. *Please note they are a cash free restaurant.",The pancakes were not cooked properly and the fruit bowl was 14$ which is too much for the small plate.,Ok...so I really do love the food here( although way too pricey and not reflective of the service provided) but I sadly wont be coming back. Once again the atrocious service is almost comical.I made yet another attempt to have a decent experience at Sunday in Brooklyn unfortunately this one was the worst before it even started. 15 minutes waiting for water and a drink order. No attention... literally one other table outside who was also being ignored. After a total of 20 min I walked across the street to 12 chairs and was greeted and served immediately.  I hoped Sunday in Brooklyn could have possibly gotten their act together...sadly this restaurant practices the polar opposite of hospitality.,"Finally got into Sunday in Brooklyn and now I know why. The food was on point and the service was great! It has a great environment setting and unique cocktails as well. I came here for brunch and would definitely come back again (if its not a 2 hour wait haha). I do want to check out the dinner menu too eventually.Things I ordered:- Avocado Toast / Whipped Ricotta, Toasted Seeds- Smoked Salmon Tartine/ Whole Wheat Sourdough, Everything Spice Creme Fraiche, Cucumber, Tomato, Capers, Onions - Skillet Potatoes","I was SUPER excited to come here for breakfast or brunch.  My wife loves pancakes so I had heard about it on a couple lists of places to go.  We both had a light morning on this Friday so decided to check it out ahead of the normal avalanche of people on the weekends waiting for brunch in W'burg.  We immediately noticed that the menu was fairly limited but had enough for us.  She ordered the pancake and I got the egg sandwich with bacon.  She got a chai latte and I got a drip coffee.The food arrived fairly quickly which was cool.  I looked at my sandwich and immediately noticed the bun was a bit burned which turned me off but I decided not to complain.Her dish looked pretty solid and she was excited to try it since the person next us had one too.  I have seen my wife try a TON of pancakes so I was excited about this one.  She took a bite and didn't really have a reaction.  We kept talking.  I had to ask her how it was.  ""Good"" she responded but not great. Oh well.  I tried.  She did like the butter which she described as ""amazing.""I LOVE bacon egg and cheese sandwiches and go all around the city to find the best one.  I have tried basic ones from the bodega or bagel shop and I have had high end options.  This sandwich was easily the most expensive I have ever had.  It was like $15 or $16 which is absurd.  I bit into it and the bun was definitely overcooked (see photo below) which immediately ruined the experience for me.  I expect a brioche bun to be tender a fluffy.  This was hard and almost crusty.  Booooo.  Finally, the bacon was greasy, really too porky and really salty.  Honestly, I have had better BEC at the local corner store for less than $5.The decor was nice and we enjoyed the open kitchen and layout.  That was really the best part about the spot.  The bar also looked cool.  We may consider coming back for that but likely not for the food.  We waited nearly 10 minutes for our check and I had to go to the hostess to pay directly because our waiter was nowhere to be found.  Whatever.    The bill with tip was nearly $60 for a pretty mediocre meal.  Give me a BREAK!!!!!  Sixty BUCKS!!!  For that???? No way we are coming back to eat here.  Seriously, save your money and time.","I usually tend to only write reviews for places I really like. Rarely for those I don't. I feel the need to write a review here as I feel the reviews don't match the quality of the food. It's simply one warning, one data point I wish I would've had before going here.I went here with my 14-yr-old daughter for brunch. We were both excited to eat here based on the reviews.In short, the food across the board was very average. My daughter and I were both disappointed. We ordered the pancakes, the breakfast sandwich and the side potatoes.On a good note, the atmosphere is great, the service was very solid and food presentation was good.However, the food itself was bland. It was not bad. It just wasn't good. I would never go back or recommend it to anybody else. There are just too many other good places to try.",Sunday in Brooklyn
37,"My daughter lives a few blocks from this Peaches and so I try to stop in when I'm in town. This past Friday,  however, was a real disappointment. The food was good but the service was very poor. Our waiter just did not care! Everything required multiple requests (like who bring French fries without ketchup and ""forgets"" it three times?). Plus he screwed up one part of the order (Hint: ""no sauce"" actually means NO sauce, not the sweet one instead of the hot one!). I will not dine in there again, especially not on a busy night. Carry out is much easier and you get better service.","Sitting with a few colleagues, I read through the menu quickly as the continual conversation had questions directed towards me, so I decided quickly.I'm not sure what makes a chicken wing a Brooklyn wing not having enough menu nor waiter time to ask, but I know a bit about Alabama White sauce. Unfortunately it was served as a tiny dipping sauce on the side, I had thought it would have been prepared into the wings flavor. As it stood by itself, the flavor did not impress me, I did not get a hint of vinegar, horseradish, cayenne, mustard powder. I did however get the mayonnaise taste, but without the other ingredients whisked together, it was not anything special unfortunately.When I see grits, I'm a buyer and there is rare occasion that I'll stray. Oven Baked Grits oddly does not appear on the websites lunch nor dinner menu, but was on the passed menus. The quality of the slow cooked braised ribs was quite good, as were the additional cheeses  inside and on top.However, the  portion was small for the money and after the meal I was gnawing the chicken bones for the marrow, I was still hungry.Eight dollars for a twelve ounce imported pear cider hit my eves hard, but I tried it anyway and the served temperature hurt the taste.A employee conversation was going on jyst to my left about how one hit another then told him ""yo yo something something"", completely low in vocabulary, quite inappropriate and was detracting from my groups time together.",Went to. Peaches for lunch. Brooklyn wings are delish! Add the shrimp po boy and catfish,"The first time I came here, I forgot what I ordered with my cousin and didn't care much for their food until my recent return.I recently returned when I was invited out for brunch by two friends. We were seated outside, which was fine because indoors was packed. I'm not a drinker but my friend ordered a pitcher of dusse and lemonade for all of us. I definitely enjoyed that mix lol. For my meal, I ordered the shrimp po boy with fries and a side of granola French toast. I enjoyed it all!!! It was delicious and very fulfilling. Now I understand why my cousin always raves about Peaches and I'm glad my second time there made a different impression. The only thing is that the service is slow, the food took a while to be brought out but it was worth the wait!","So this place has been around for a while and I never stopped into check it out until today. I decided toTry the blackened catfish witih grits. It came with onions and chopped tomatoes which mixed together with this fish tastes pretty good. However, I know grits and these grits I receive will not on point at all. It's a possibility I may have come across the grits in the afternoon which were not the best but grits should be  thicker than what was presented to me. Yeah I think the  chef's recipe  has to be tweaked on this one. The the decore of the place is nothing toobrag on. Just the typical tables and chairs plain wall nothing fancy. I must admit I did like the bathroom sink although it has a leak in the faucet I like the small sink and the turn handle. I guess I will have to try another dish and I will let you guys know what I think about it I saw some one with salmon maybe that will be the next dish I try and if that doesn't hit the spot then as per my opinion this place maybe a little overrated and possibly for no reason other than a black person doesn't own it.","Very cute brunch option if you're in the Bedstuy/downtown BK area. I've now been twice(for brunch only) but both experiences were great. The wait was about 20 minutes for a table of 4 on Sunday at around 12, which was great!Definitely gives you chill neighborhood vibes and if weather permits, there is an outdoor eating option. The food is definitely southern inspired and very tasty. I had the salmon hash & farmers breakfast(on different visits, you only need to order one because the portions are decent!). Everything tasted good! The cheddar grits were great & I'm usually picky about grits. The service was excellent, even with how crowded the restaurant was.Would 100% recommend this to anyone.",Peaches
38,"Good food and the drinks are great too but there is a really douchey hipster(ish)bartender he has  dirty blonde hair above the shoulder length  probably wearing some pattern button up the day you walk in...just avoid him and you're good. Our friends ordered drinks and they sent the wrong ones and the bartender left them and when she left to go get new ones and this guy came in and only said ""vodka tonics?"" Pointing at the wrong drinks she had brought before and we answered yes and he proceeded to just take them and walk away. It was so rude and just uncalled for. They were the wrong drinks but that wasn't the issue it was the way he inserted himself into our space just to take drinks back and then he literally looked at us as he poured them down the drain. We really didn't care about the drinks but his whole attitude was unnecessary and petty and ridiculous but anyway we generally love this place we haven't been in weeks this guy is new so don't let him stray you away. Still leaving 2 stars though because this experience was not ideal at all.",Have to go back to this spot! The food was amazinggggg. I have a video of the corn on a cob but no pics-- delishhhhh lol.. the bales were so small but that was fine by me. Def going back!,"We were told to put our Haribo gummy bears away and I was really enjoying eating them because the intensity of the five fruit flavors, lemon, orange, pineapple, raspberry and strawberry paired well with the robust tannins of my glass of vintage dated Malbec.Apparently gummy bears are forbidden in low lit cocktail lounges with brick walls but what else can you expect in this day and age of The Lord of the Hipsters: The Fellowship of the Artisanal Mac & Cheese Gentrifiers?","Haven't had Moloko's breakfast options enough, so my girlfriend and I visited this past Saturday for brunch. We started with a couple cocktails and their deviled eggs. Their deviled eggs are unique and delightful. For the entree my girlfriend had the breakfast burrito which is delicious but it's portion was too much for me. Maybe ordering this dish depends on what kind of day you're having. She couldn't finish it so I had to help out with the second half. I should mention, there was a regular-sized man at the other end of the bar that ordered this same meal and finished it, to my astonishment, in its entirety. Then he ordered a bloody mary. I wonder what kind of day he was having?I myself had the classic eggs benedict, with the sautéed kale instead of meat. The dish was served with a salad in a vinaigrette, radishes and onion that seemed pickled, and potatoes. I think this might be the best eggs benedict I have ever had. All of the parts of this dish were perfectly seasoned, and made sense together. The potatoes had a wonderful crisp/crunch on the outside and cozy softness on the inside. I love vinaigrettes so the salad really hit the spot for me. The sautéed kale, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce all completed a sound and splendid meal that I now long for next time I go.Thank you again Moloko for being amazing.I hope to see you again, and I hope to see you soon.","Moloko has been my favorite New York City bar/restaurant since I found out about it soon after they opened. Over time I've seen the menu grow, and hours expand. Their product and service has always been excellent. Always consistent. I love their cheeseburger, and I love their lobster roll. Yet, their mac n cheese, their fish and chips, their french onion soup, and deviled eggs are oh so savory as well. I wish good things for this business, and I hope I'm around to see them come.","This place actually is cozy, eclectic and tasty. I would have not guessed that the food would have been as good as it was. I have to tell you to try the deviled eggs. OMG  Yummy! They are not your normal deviled eggs. I had the fish and chips, extra crunchy My daughter had the pulled pork sandwich my son and husband shared the double cheeseburger and it was big enough to fill up both of those big men. We enjoyed chatting with the staff, they were very friendly and made us feel very welcomed, and we are tourists, and we felt right at home. Oh the only reason why only a 4 star rating is because the menu was somewhat limited. Which I'm guessing is only because of lack of space to keep all of the extra ingredients that it would take to fulfill a more extensive menu. It was all very good.",Moloko
39,Spicy beef is good. Unfortunately their service and mistakes on orders (twice) remove any kind of positive experience.,The food was great. But the service was a bit poor. At first they were attentive. We got drinks and orders I at a decent time. However after we were served we didn't seem to exist. Not to mention they made me the wrong dish. I received beef over rice but ordered noodles. It was too long of a wait and I was hungry so I just took it. The food was great and tasty. My fiancé ordered the boneless chicken wings with the truffle fries. I even placed an order for fries to go. But they messed that up and brought out beef over rice instead. So I just left it.,"Bomb dot com.No joke, it's so good. I'll for sure be back!!! Good ambiance, somewhat slow service (our guy was a little distracted and generally missed my non verbal cues), but the food really makes up for it. Sadly I don't remember our order details as this was a few weeks ago but, c'est la vie. Try everything. Bon appetit mon cherie xx","So I've been going to this place for a while. They keep changing up their menu. Previously they used to sell really good dishes. Now, they are predominately a fried chicken specialty restaurant in my opinion. I do have to say Even now I still enjoy their food especially during their happy hour where the prices are amazing. Their selection of flavored fried chicken is Also very interesting. I would say  that one of my favorite flavors is called ""yellowing snow"" which I have no idea what it is LOL. In conclusion I would still recommend coming to this place. The prices are great the food taste good and the staff is very friendly.Edit-  FRIES ARE ADDICTING.","This is my favorite go-to bar! I brought my boyfriend here a while ago and he loves this place just as much as I do. THE PROS* a lot of seating area * happy hour is a steal! * chicken wings!!!!! * French fries during happy hour!!! I tried the kimchi fries and the garlic fries at two different times. I love both but my favorite is the kimchi friesTHE CONS * none yet so far! Keep up the good work (:A little tip: Come during happy hour, appetizers + chicken wings with whatever flavor you pick and choose, wine plus beer  uhmmmm yesss!!!","Went here one rainy Tuesday night a few weeks ago with my boyfriend. We were looking for restaurants in Williamsburg and came across this place on Yelp.When we arrived, we were greeted cheerfully and seated promptly. It was pretty much empty inside beside us and another couple. We ordered the silver factory platter (soy garlic) to share between us. The chicken was delicious and my boyfriend enjoyed it a lot. The platter was filling and we had a lot left over. The grapefruit drink my boyfriend ordered was very cool (as seen in the video) and tasty. It was a very chill spot and the service was great. The art was urban and appealing, the vibes were great and so was the music. I would definitely return and recommend.",Silver Factory
40,"$150 bill with horrendous service. The waiters didn't even ask if the food was okay or anything(which it wasn't). All they did was bring the food out. They seem to have the pricing of ""fine dining, "" however, the service and quality of food is the farthest from that. I will never come back here, but it doesn't even matter because nothing will be rectified.",Food was delicious. Service was terrible. They really made us feel unwelcome. Incredibly rude servers.,"Taci's Beyti has been around my neighborhood for years and it used to be really good. However, I'm not sure how this place has so many positive reviews as the food was horrible and the service was even worse.When we first sat down, it took the waiters 10 minutes to come to our table (mind you, the place was empty besides a total of 3 tables occupied). When we ordered our appetizers of Shepherd's salad and hummus, the salad had NO Dressing and no spoon to scoop it on to our plates. The hummus was served on a HOT plate and the hummus was cold so it started leaking. It was DISGUSTING and took our waiter 5 more minutes to bring out more utensils. The bread was also stale and not how we remembered it.For the main entrees, we shared lyulka kebabs and chicken in yogurt sauce. The kebab was fine but the chicken in yogurt sauce was so dry.. I've never tasted anything horrible. The dishes took over an hour to come out as well, and only came out as we flagged the waiter down.This was a horrible experience and I will NOT be coming back. Go to the many other better Turkish places in the area like Opera or Liman.","We like this place a lot.They have great variety of Mediterranean food, very tasty.They are pretty busy in the evenings, so we prefer to reserve a table.Service is good, but a bit slower at busy times.

The food is well seasoned, and this is actually one of my favorite places for tacos. The staff is great as well! It's also really cute inside :)","First suggestion. If you are starving, don't come here expecting an immediate order and delivery of food to fill your aching belly. This is one of those take our time to deliver some really good food, kind of spots. You've been warned. I got a steak, chicken and jerk pork taco with chips and salsa and my spouse got steak quesadilla. The wait time... Oh that wait time... I was told that it takes a while but geez it really does. I'm speaking about that starving suggestion because that was me. I am the person that had an aching belly. I was so happy when they finally called my name. We took it to go and had a nice picnic style meal in the cool of our home ( this was one of the hottest nights of the summer, we usually eat in the living room but with no ac, that room was an automatic no.) The chicken and the steak are good but that Jerk Pork... I don't even have the words but it's all positive. I wanted to go back out and get more. They have a pineapple ( optional) in it and it is my new jam. Really looking forward to craving tacos. Really going to call and order ahead instead.",El Jeffe
42,"Great streak grilled to perfection. Ordered New York strip steak, it was . It was 14 oz, but I can finish it all! The sauce is not a highlight actually, it didn't add much more flavor to the steak  as I think.","I came to this spot and really wanted to take out my cousin to eat some A5 Wagyu+Uni. Unfortunately, the day I went in they were out of Uni-how sad is that!!! I went for lunch in the daytime and they already ran out of Uni?! SO EARLY. We got the Wagyu sandwich and was good-but i'm not a good ""meat"" judge. Was really looking forward to their other sandwich","Though we've lived in the neighborhood for awhile, we hadn't made it to Salt and Charcoal yet. We decided to go when we met a couple at a restaurant in LA who said this place was their favorite restaurant in all of NYC. To be honest, this place is decent, but maybe not quite worth the price compared to some of the other Japanese style steakhouses in the city. The sushi was actually the star of the meal, with the steak tartare as a close second (though not sure the portion was worth the steep $34 price tag). Unfortunately, the NY strip was the disappointing part of the meal. We asked for it medium rare, but it came far closer to medium well.","Salt and Charcoal is a delicious Japanese steakhouse.  The place itself is small and has an open wall where some diners can see the chefs and cooks in action.  There is also some outdoor sidewalk seating.  Service was polite but not always efficient, and it took a very long time for our food to be served, because our waiter didn't put our main order in.  Fortunately after my wife inquired our food was out in 15-20 minutes.  The food itself was delicious.  The gem salad was unique and worthwhile, and our Wagyu steak was tender and flavorful.  Recommended!","Looked this place up because mt friends wanted to do a steak dinner for a gathering.Price is a little fancy, but the service is what you pay for so that balances out. Staff is super friendly.Originally I thought the wagyu was gonna be the star of the show, but even though it was nicel marbled it was lacking in taste and had some tendon toughness to it.I would definitely recommend their aged porterhouse. Their baked potato is solid as well.","I wanted to try this restaurant for long time and my friends and I was just hanging out in the area. We saw tons of good reviews about food in this place so we didn't feel disappointed at all after we had dinner. Highlight of this restaurant is beef. There are so many kind of beef preparations. We had....- Uni Fillet Mignon : excellence! 10/10- Grilled Bronzino : delicious 9/10- Assort Sashimi of the Day : very fresh 9/10- Kaisou Salad : only one that we weren't crazy about 6/10Service is great, server kept checking our table, kept cleaning but waiting a bit long to add up some more orders.",Salt + Charcoal
43,"I just want to say first that I love the food and drinks here...normally. Last Friday my friends and I tried to eat here and had a really negative experience. Not sure I'll be coming back.We got to the restaurant around 5:30 for an early happy hour/dinner. Waited in line to order for about 30-35 minutes. Got to the front of the line, and was told that there was a big take out order placed, so they will not be taking any orders for the next 30 minutes. Wouldn't even write down our order, we were told we'd have to wait on line again. We figured we'd get drinks at least--then were told the frozen mojito machine is broken. We left. I understand the restaurant is busy which is why I'll wait on line to order for 35 minutes, but to be told that because they took a take out order on a busy friday night instead of serving customers in the restaurant is just poor planning. Again, love the food here, but last Friday it was poorly staffed and badly executed. Don't recommend coming here on a weekend, I guess?","This place is designed so well on the exterior! So cUte! The interior seating feels a bit gross. My gal pal and I ordered the nachos, which you pick up at the ""decorated food truck outside"" They were ok. NOTE: this restaurant is cash only. The menu advertises that they have movie nights on their outdoor patio and dj on some nights. The music was very low at conversational level tonight. I don't think I'll return. Food, ambiance, and vibe didn't peak my interest.",Food was extremely bland.. no taste whatsoever. I had chicken and guacamole burrito.  Chipotle tastes better.,"This spot is cool. Music is good and so is the food. My partner had the chicken plate and I had the chicken and guacamole burrito, we both enjoyed it along with a bottled beer and a frozen drink. I also had the waffle sticks 1/5 stars. Cons: the frozen drink could've used a tab bit more alcohol. The beer could've been colder.The waffle sticks were not made of pancake mix at all.. maybe cornmeal? DO NOT try these, they're inexpensive but kind of salty and really just a waste of energy. The only good part of it was being able to have syrup with it. They should honestly invest in either replacing the metal tables with something that doesn't absorb heat or more canopies/umbrellas. Common sense. Also maybe some bug repellants? Why four stars? The first dj did a great job with playing a variety of Spanish and English music of all several genres, and aside from the waffle sticks, the food is really tasty and affordable. And the place is powered by the sun so that's a plus.","So we got here on a Friday evening so the line being long was understandable. There are two registers: first you order your food at one, then you order drinks and corn at another. We waited about 10/15 minutes in the line to order and then waited about 35 for our food ‍. We watched as the same numbers came up on the board multiple times within that half an hour. By the time ours came around we were STARVING. There was music blasting which was kind of nice but the whole waiting situation was a bit ridiculous. We ordered the chicken plato and chicken burrito. The plate was worth it with a large serving of rice and beans but the burrito was small and nowhere near the same portions of the bowl. We didn't take any photos of the food because we were starving. While I enjoyed the simplicity of the meal, it was not worth the price. The frozen drinks are small and are $11!?? Oh and they're cash only but they have an atm inside! Seems like you're paying for vibes and history but is it worth it considering you wait for most of the time you're in there?","Visiting on a Sunday summer afternoon, there was a slight line as to be expected. There's only one menu posted to your right as you enter. So make sure you STUDY IT CLEARLY.1st misstep - there was a fly on the top of my margarita! I chalked it up to being an outdoor venue and left it alone.2nd misstep - the plantains taste like they've just been sitting in oil for hoursss. They're so oily/gooey.3rd misstep - ordered a cheese quesadilla... came with sour cream, quac, olives, just a ton of stuff I did not want. I spoke to a manager to see if I can get it rectified and get just a plain quesadilla. She said to me ""since the menu lists everything the food comes with, I would not be able to get a refund (which I wasn't asking for) and if I wanted a new one, I can get one, but I would have to pay 50%""... the audacity. Are making sure customers are satisfied not the priority here??!I'm not too sure how this place categorizes itself but a restaurant IT IS NOT based off its service. Any other manager would have understood and fixed the food, it's just a $5 quesadilla! You're not paying for the subpar food ($11 for a pre-mixed basic margarita... blockheads pls come show this place how it's done), you're paying for the music, the ambiance, the vibe. Grab the Cuban sandwich and get out of dodge.",Habana Outpost
44,"Small location but very flavorful Caribbean menu options. I had the jerk salmon with parmesan grits and my husband had the steak with eggs. We also had a side of Mac that I could've done without. My sparkling rum punch was not enough for the price. However, the overall service was good. I would definitely return for both brunch and dinner.","LaLa is the absolute WORST!It was after 10pm and you're unable to place over the phone orders; thus I came here to place an order in person. I was notified that it'll take 20 minutes. Considering that the restaurant is the sizeOf your basic NYC apt and it was very warm, I stepped outside for the 20 minutes.  20 minutes later, I asked the same waitress if the order is ready and she goes ""Oo I thought you didn't want the order since you left."" Im not sure where LaLa expected me to stand and wait. There was no space at the bar and the place was packed. If this food wasn't for someone else I would've left. Piss poor customer service. LaLa you need to do better sis. Don't lie and say you thought I left when I told you when I walked in that the food was for someone else.",Went here for brunch for my birthday and I really liked the fact that the bottomless drinks were given in individual bottles. I didn't enjoy the food at all. My friend and I ordered a burger and it was absolutely disgusting. I wanted to place a side order of fries and I was told that fries are not made there.,"Sunday brunch with my mom and nephew.  Cozy restaurant, tasty food, yummy cocktails and attentive staff.","Sunday Funday!!The official end of the summer has come upon us. I was greatful that the weather was nice today, so I took advantage of it and BRUNCHED!!Upon entering I didn't see a host, so I sat at the bar while I was waiting for my friend. There was a DJ and he was great. Playing all the necessary Brunch vibe tunes. When my friend arrived we were seated quickly. The seating area is a bit cramped. We were close to both our neighbors and when we had to get up it disrupted them.  They have a 22 dollar unlimited brunch drink menu that included tropical flavored mimosas and rum punch but we opted against it. I had just the mango mimosa which was just ok. For our food.  I got the chicken and waffles It was ok. I didn't finish it so portions were a good size. The reason for 3 stars is my friend wanted salmon but the menu only had it with waffles (18)  and in a tomato sauce. She asked the gentlemen if she could get it with plaintains instead. He stated he would just charge it separately because there was no substitutions. We expected just one small piece of salmon with nothing else on the plate to be maybe 13 bucks. When the bill came it was 17 bucks. No where were we told how much it would be. If that was the case we could've just gotten it with the waffle for 1 dollar more. We wanted to talk to management but apparently no management was there according to the waiter. That's  weird. So fyi a small piece of salmon with no side is 17 bucks here.  Definitely not worth it. Nothing was over the top  in flavor. I like the sister of the establishment  more. Zurilee . I'd rather go there","I had high hopes for this place but ....Ehh not impressed to say the least.Very small restaurant. 2 high top bar tables about 10 actual dining tables and few seats at the bar. Came on a Saturday night around 9:30 and was seated right away. The place wasn't too busy. One bartender and and about three servers. The server took our order within the first 10 minutes of us being seated but, it took us (party of 3) about 30 minutes to get our drinks. We watched about two or three groups who arrived after us receive their drinks before us. I honestly think our order had been forgotten to be placed with the bar.  One person ordered the passionfruit rum punch which was pretty good and strong another order the sorrel sangria don't even bother it came with one measly strawberry not to say I was going to eat the fruit but it's suppose to be a sangria right? The menu is extremely limited in my option their aren't many options. Thanks God I had eaten and was full because had I not been I would've been upset that we even came here. The people I was with were hungry so we stayed ( I did have intentions of at least getting an appetizer).  The options are again limited and basic. Ex: one item as and appetizer was ""wings"" literally that's all said like nothing special about the wings not honey habanero jerk pepper wings nothing just ""wings"" .  It is so typical of Caribbean American infuse restaurant to have the same menu items and to be honest it's pretty boring! There's nothing on the menu that stood out to make this place feel special. That's where my disappointment comes from because I had better expectations for this place.  Anyway one person I was with ordered the spring mix salad with the salmon I believe it was a jerk salmon I don't recall and the other ordered the fried chicken sandwich. Again nothing special. The salmon was too spicy and so was the chicken sandwich.  And that's a lot coming from Caribbean people because we like spice. Service was ok. Servers were attentive. Bartender at some point caught himself being really loud in the middle of the restaurant (again small space) he was greeting a group of people (I guess friends) this may not have been an issue from others but as business owner myself I took notice to this.....Would I return to give this place another chance?  I would say a strong maybe.  I believe in second chances and I would like to try their brunch.",MangoSeed Restaurant
45,"We ordered delivery so maybe take this review with a grain of salt. On the other hand, our criticisms have nothing to do with the freshness of the food. So I take that back... you can 100% rely on this :)...We had the chicken, paella, meatballs, potatas bravas, etc. All A-OK but nothing to write home about. Perhaps the homey ambiance that I've heard so much about in the other reviews makes the food taste much, much more special...But prolly, nah... strictly okay food...","This place lives up to the hype. We ordered the dip platter, brussels sprouts, Spanish style shrimp, and pork paella for the table. Everything was killer the food here is delicious. A heads up that this place does get busy on weekends and they do not take reservations for smaller groups so be ready to wait.","I have never written a review for a place I did not actually get a chance to eat at, but I really have to comment on the rude way my gf and I were treated there today. I guess since the food is apparently good the staff feel they can just be plain rude. If you still fill the tables and get away with that, good for you.  We tried to grab a table around 3 and I guess they close for an hour form 4-5. We asked to put our name down without asking how long the wait would be. First the hostess said ""Well the wait is going to be very long, prob 30 min.""  We didn't care we said.  ""Well, the kitchen will close at 3:50 so that would be cutting it close.""  I'm not sure how that's cutting it close.  We put our name in anyway as we saw other names on the list only minutes in front of us. The host huffed and wrote our name down. There were 2 seats on the inside by the door where the host took our names down to sit down, so we sat down. The hostess said nothing. We had walked about 6 miles and my gf was exhausted and just wanted to sit for a few minutes. About 5 min went by and the hostess came back and said in a frustrated manner ""Excuse me, we have chairs outside for you to wait at"".  No please wait outside; no I'm sorry we need to keep this area empty. Nope, just ordering us out the door. Then another party came in and asked for the wait and she said its too long for you to wait-again trying to shoo them away.   Here's the thing:  1. I get it. You apparently close for an hour from 4-5 in between brunch and dinner. You don't want people to keep coming in so they're still there while you shut the restaurant down. Here's a tip: Just say you're not letting anyone in anymore after say I dunno, 2:45. That's better than trying to talk people out of putting their names on the list.    2. Perhaps even though you have 2 chairs in a waiting area by the door, you apparently don't want people to wait there.  You could say in a gentle manner, I'm sorry we're really crowded, would it be ok if you waited at the chairs outside?  That goes over a lot better. Again, i get it. You're stressed out. You're busy on a Sunday.  But I worked at restaurants when I was in college and I would never have spoken to a customer in this way or gone out of my way to use every excuse to talk them out of putting their name down.  That's simply not done.   I'll chalk this up to a stressed out hostess with no tact and maybe try to visit again sometime since apparently the food is top notch. I suppose it must be.",I can legit say that I ate at this spot every week during the summer. My good friend whose a regular there put me onto this spot & I am totally obsessed. Everything is good there from the French toast to their arugula salads. I have no complaints!  I came here yesterday & had their smoked salmon pasta & it was delicious. This place is a gem!

It was super crowded so we had a bit of a wait and they wouldn't seat us until the whole group was there which is one of my least favorite restaurant policies. We got the bacon wrapped dates, dip trip with hummus, feta cheese/roasted red pepper, and beet dips and they were all good. Especially liked the feta and roasted pepper dip. Also had the patatas bravas and puréed cauliflower as apps. The bacon wrapped dates were a little overdone but I still ate them and would have eaten more lol. For our main meal we had the paella with pollo which was delicious!!! I absolutely loved the flavor of the rice and the chicken was well seasoned. Heads up: my friend I went with has a severe gluten allergy and could not have the bacon wrapped dates because they were made in the same fryer as items with gluten. We could also not get the chorizo or chickpeas in the paella for that reason, and likewise could not order the fried Brussels. Hopefully helps anyone who is GF and looking for tips.",Olea
46,The oranges are molto freschi.Best and freshest Oranges in town. They are also decent soccer players,"The food was above par but overpriced and the portions are very small. The music is exceptionally loud and heavy metal so I would not go here for the ambience. Trendy, overpriced, and full of hipsters.",Square plates. Effing square plates. Overpriced nonsense. Crap service. Full of nerds. I hate this place.,"Absolute favorite place in the neighborhood and I've lived here for 3 years and have tried them all. Calaca's elote might just be the best I've ever had in my life; their tostadas are the perfect balance of spice, vinegar and flavor. My favorites are the tuna and shrimp tostadas. Even better this week than when I first came by in February 2016. Get yourself a mezcalrita, and if you know what's good for you, move to the neighborhood and become a regular.We miss Calaca each winter when they go south for the warm weather. Do not miss out!","First off. CASH ONLY.secondly: tiny spot, but hella cute.Now let's get into the menu. It's simple. Tacos, tostadas, quesadillas, and some tapas (chips and guac, corn, the staples ya know?). I was a little sad to see how small the menus was, but damn was it banging. We ordered the sampler ($20), three tostadas. And it's worth it. Decent serving size. A quesadilla (Goner-something on the menu) and chips and guac, which is chunky and just the right amount of salt and lime y'all. It's SO rare to find in New York City. And I am a snob when it comes to Mexican food. Especially chips and guac (I do not play with my Mexican and Vietnamese food). I love they had a tasteful presentation approach, but also so much flavor in their food. The fish and shrimp in the dishes were fresh AF.The gentleman who assisted us, assuming the owner, was so kind and making recommendations. Not to mention friendly and interactive with us! We also sat at the bar so saw the kitchen and bartender hustle. I will be coming back. Glad I was able to dine here on a casual Thursday night. Oh, because it is small, there may be a wait. We sat outside for a bit for 5-10 minutes before our bar seating.","So dang good. I love everything about this place from the divey inside bar to the tasty taco truck out back. We grabbed an assortment of tacos (all delicious) as well as some tortas and tostadas. The tostada was good once you removed the mile-high pile of shredded lettuce, but the torts was SO wonderful. The bar also has tons of options and pitchers to choose from. The margs are a little out there and sweet, but overall good and cheap.",Calaca
47,"I walked and got seated right away at the bar.  The inside was pretty busy since it's Sunday and the brunch rush is here.  The interior is brick and wood with random hot sauce bottle and other dive bar decorations on the walls. Since it was brunch I felt like a Bloody Mary was in order.  I ordered the voodoo Bloody Mary since it looked enticing with the shrimp and crab meat.  I was also recommended the catfish po boy since it was my first dish here.My Bloody Mary came out and it was on the bland side.  Being a Cajun place I would have expected a strong flavor from the drink.  I ended up adding some Cholula hot sauce to give it enough zest.  The crab meat didn't really do much for the drink, maybe gave it more texture and a slight Unami flavor.  The po boy was legit. The fish was cooked perfectly and the sandwich came out looking very delicious.  Only negative comment would be is that the bread is a baguette.  Just like my banh mi, I prefer the bread to be soft and flavorful.  Usually a po boy would be in a lobster roll which is soft and buttery.  Catfish is a nice chill place.  I would come back again to try more food and other drinks.","I haven't been paying much attention to the wife, so I decided to take her out to this southern restaurant: the country fried steak and the shrimp and grits was really good. The only reason I left out the other star is because I couldn't get the crab cakes and jambalaya for brunch . We will be going back. Sorry; no pictures to post; we ate it all.","Very disappointing, especially for the price.   I ordered the Country Fried Steak, and Jalapeno Cornbread.  It was my first time using the Caviar app. and it worked just fine. The main course, however, was virtually inedible and not at all enjoyable.  I didn't really enjoy any of the food, but the fried steak was so overcooked and dry that it was almost impossible to chew.  I didn't enjoy the grits or the green beans at all, though the preparation was ok. The flavor just didn't do it for me.   The cornbread was also not at all to my liking.  Considering that this meal was well over $30 for just the entry and bread,  it was a major let down.  I could forgive the fact that I didn't really find the flavor enjoyable, but fact that the primary part of the order, the steak, was EXCEPTIONALLY DRY TOUGH AND OVERCOOKED, I can't overlook. If I happened to be out, and friends wanted to try Catfish, I would be ok with that, there seems to be a lot on the menu I might consider.  However, I would never order delivery from Catfish again.  If I had received something this bad in the house, I would have returned it and asked for something edible.  It's to much trouble to do that with delivery, so I just ate some of it and trashed most of it. Two stars only because the other items were edible and the preparation and delivery time was accurate. I have to believe the steak was cooked hours before I ordered it, because it was very very cold and dry, even though delivery was pretty fast.  If it had been cooked when I ordered it, I don't think it could have possibly been this dry and cold.  As you can likely see from the pictures, this does not look like something that was cooked within the last 2 hours.","Catfish is a great spot with even better service. I have frequented a few times for the shrimp & grits plus the crab cakes. The bartenders are always welcoming with smiles & dandy drinks. I love the wood and exposed brick. I tell you what, if you want hot sauce it's definitely in the place. Music is usually in point & I'm big on that. Check out out! You won't be disappointed.","Loved this spot. Ask my boy if he knew of any awesome places I might have not been too before and he suggested this. Since we are both beauties we rode a revel scooter there together to check it out. That's right we rode together. Me manning the sticks while he hung on tight and helped navigate. The food for the dopest! We got NOLA BBQ shrimp and craw fish Mac n cheese to start and it was sooo good. Crawfish Mac is essentially a cheaper lobster Mac but even better in my opinion. We then split a catfish po boy considering the place is called catfish, because how could they fuck up they nametheir restaurant after. We were right, because the sandwich was bringing the noise. Absolutely delicious. Sure sure the food is money and worth the trip already but the drink specials. Go with the beer shot combo if you're looking to crank things up. Pro tip: do the tecate. They give you a 16 oz beer instead of 12 oz that they serve otherwise. Finally if you really want to up the ante, polish off a sazerac or two. Nothing gets a night going better than a family style meal at Catfish with some beers, shots and sazzys!","So been debating over a 3  or 4 star, but unfortunately, I'm gonna have to call it a 3. Been meaning to check out this place, and honestly, I think it has great vibes and the service was amazing. Just don't think that the food, and drinks were worth the price? So a friend and I ordered the catfish po boy, and the banana pancakes. I think the catfish po boy was pretty good, although I wished that it was seasoned a little bit more (just a tad bit bland imo), but my friend wasn't really pleased with his banana pancakes. He thought it was just a little too doughy and soggy. He also ordered a drink that was $15 but we were really surprised how little it was. I mean it was just half a small cup. I get that some drinks can be expensive, and as good as it was, it was just a little sad that it couldn't even be a decent amount. I just wished that the food was a little bit better, and although the portions were good for the food, wish I could say the same for the drink rather than a sad half cup.",Catfish

And the outside area smells like garbage juice and urine, how can anyone eat out there??",I waited 40 MINUTES for FISH TACOS!!! Don't eat here if you're hungry or if you have somewhere to be after. They really are unconcerned about getting your food out to you in a timely manner. I even waited to pay the bill!!! Ridiculous!! And the bill was WET!,"The aesthetic alone sets the mood before you even sit down. There was a wait but they handle it efficiently. Didn't get to try the brunch but the dinner was on point. They have great music selection also (that matters to me) Tye playlist was on point! I had the lobster Mac, shrimp roll and clam strips, all were tasty, would definitely revisit. The 4 stars is only because they messed my order up initially. But the place is GREAT!","Dogs everywhere. And you might think...OMG...I love fluffy and giggles! But this turned me off. And I'm fine with places that are dog friendly but this is on another level. Dogs sitting on chairs, putting their paws on the table where people have to sit and eat. I saw a dog lick a napkin. Nah bruh. People have serious deathly dog allergies. For me it feels very unsanitary unless you're wiping down each table and seats with some sorta all natural vinegar cleaning agent or a bleachy mixture. I know all the dog lovers are gonna hate me. But this is like a person putting a dog on the subway seat. Ya feel me. No. I'm cool with your support animal but they belong in a carrier or on the floor. Next thing. Had to ask for utensils...after the first round of food was on the table. Small but annoying. Now let's get to the food and drinks.I went during happy hour and had the painkiller, which reminded me of a Pina colada. Sweet and refreshing but not boozy. It was only $6. I shared a dozen $1 oysters with my friend. They were juicy, sweet and not too briny. Nice size too. Yummm! I did see this weird worm on the back of my oyster shell. Kinda freaked me out. I get it! They come from the ocean. I've sent countless oysters to their grave but never saw a worm on it. I don't have bubble guts today so I guess it's not a problem. Yay! Everything is awesomeeee.I ordered the steam pot with the added lobster. Spent $56 bucks on it. I am going to be honest and say it wasn't worth it. I've had better lobsters. I've made better lobsters. It was overcooked and not seasoned. Guess it didn't get an old Bay/salt bath. It was underwhelming but trust I ate my money's worth. Shells everywhere. Juices flying. Shells cracking. It was a glorious show. People were staring. I should've sold tickets. Lmao. The overall steam pot flavor was delicious. It was a rich red sauce, well balanced with tomatoes, tons of fresh garlic, and thyme! I could've just had that and been satisfied. But my mood was Treat Yoself YOLO! The clams were plump, juicy, and flavorful. The mussels were also succulent and sweet. The cod was bland. It had no flavor at all. I had to spoon it with the broth. The andouille was nice and spicy. There were also fingerling potatoes. You get 2 large half pieces of toasted bread to soak in the beautiful sauce and all those drippings. My friend had the Sea Wolf which is a burger, shoe string fries, a pickle, a small arugula salad and half a lobster. She thought the lobster was going to be draped across the patty but it was on the side. FYI. She loved it. If it weren't for the dog thing I could've given them a 3/4. It's a very popular spot. Outdoor and indoor seating. Gender neutral bathrooms. But I think it could've helped to have an additional person on staff. They need some stricter dog friendly rules. It was my first experience and probably my last.","I had there fish and chips( shoestring chips with herbs).Fish was fresh, and good batter but not oily, as you would get in Maine.My husband had the fish taco, looked really good, it came with guacamole which was good, nice grilled fish . The taco was softshell, which is flour and prefer over corn (which I find to be gritty)Their  signature drink , to me is  cross from daiquiri and pina colada There chicken wings looked good and almost every table ordered, next time Illl try.   They also had cauliflower  wihc appear to be same batter as chicken wings.Only negative is the seats inside are not comfortable.",Sea Wolf
49,"I had a terrible experience on Sept.28,2019 at 7:00 pm at the Black Nile.  The reviews at the Black Nile were great and the food really looked good on their website.  We called the Black Nile before we arrived just to check if they had any catfish, their response was yes.  When we arrived and was being seated, we asked the owner, are they serving Catfish today, his respond was yes!! Note: we didn't know he was the owner (Hakeem) until we had an issue!!The only two fish on the menu was Whiting and Catfish.  We order our food and waited patiently.  Once we received our food, we were looking at the fish and saw that the fish didn't look like what we ordered.  We asked the server about the fish and again they was still saying it was Catfish.  After tasting it to make sure we were right, we decided to tell the server that we ordered Catfish and this is BASA.  The sever informed the cook and the manager about our issue.  At this time I'm disgusted and hungry and wondering why would they try to sell us something that we didn't order and then LIE about it.  Why couldn't they just say we don't have anymore catfish, but would you like to order something else? So we quietly got the manager who sat us down when we first came in and let him know that the fish we had was not CATFISH BUT instead BASA FISH.  He acted like he was surprised and said he was going to talk to the cook in the back to see what's was going on.  We were waiting and waiting for him to come back to explain what happened..... he never came back but sent a server who didn't know what was going on. The server came back and said we can order something else or get our money back. It just seem like it was a bunch of confusion going and I was surprise that a owner and the staff will continue to lie about what they was serving us.  Not only that,  they didn't even have BASA listed on the menu at all.  I I I I was so upset about the deception, the time we wasted in this restaurant (Black Nile), and that no one seem to be on the same page.Finally we made a decision to get our money back and leave because we were disgusted about the whole situation.  After of all of that, the owner (Hakeem) of the Black Nile claims that we couldn't get our money back  and the manager and the server never spoke to him nor were they authorized to say that he will not return our money.  So he said we can order anything else on the menu and they would cook it fresh.  My response was I didn't really want anything now because my appetite was gone and I was disgusted.  I just wanted to know why: his respond was that they ran out of CATFISH and the cook didn't let him know.  I'm like the order says CATFISH and you knew and the cook knew but you still served me BASA FISH thinking I wouldn't know the difference.  This was a BLACK professional establishment and you TREATED US LIKE THIS.  He said he was sorry and wanted to load us up with all kinds of sweets and food, I really wasn't interested because of his DISHONESTY!! He did our orders over again,we spent  2 1/2 hours in this restaurant and didn't enjoy it.  We got our food to go to only to come home and tried to eat what was given to us and to only throw it away!  What a waste!! After this ordeal, I was exhausted and never will recommend nor return to BLACK NILE... Only one star!!","I was disappointed! I'm from the south, Memphis to be exact,  so I know what good soul food is suppose to taste like and this just wasn't it for me. I ordered several different items because I couldn't make up my mind.  I entered the doors hungry which you should never do... Anyway, I had to toss most of my food in the garbage. I hate to give a bad review but I also feel other "" Yelpers"" should have real honest reviews before spending hard earned money...","I left 4 stars and then a critical review because I didn't want to affect a new business like that even though I had a terrible experience. I said I'd try again in my last review and I finally did. Same thing happened. Waited 45 mins for a SANDWICH with maybe 8 people in the place. I'm done. You guys should turn it over to someone who will enrich our neighborhood. I've managed many bars in nyc and I can tell you bar none, you're sinking and sinking fast. Sell it before you lose everything.",Food is legit here. I've been here twice. I am now realizing I never made any reviews.My first time here I had: 5/18/191.Hot Honey wings. Perfectly sweet and spicy in flavor2. cornbread stuffing (real good)3. Whiting with yams and Cajun Alfredo. (The pasta was nice and creamy)4. Lobster pizza. It's not tomato based but it was still good. Second time 7/18/191.I tasted the Two grilled lobster tails with red rice a tomato based rice which was very flavorful but spicy (so yummy)2. 3 pieces of whiting with a side of Mac and cheese and mixed veggies.All their food is well seasoned bursting in flavors. The food has a wait but it's worth the time. Come check it out whenever you're in the area for delicious food. They give generous portions too,"First time there.  I was not disappointed   We ordered the shrimp and chips, a catfish sandwich with fries, seafood trio with seafood mac and cheese and collard greens.   Everyone loved everything.  I will definitely return. The quality and preparation of the food was optimal.   This will be my new go to place for seafood.","Hello all and thanks for reading my review , for those who follow me , you already know I'm a foodie ... A soul food place that serves coconut candies yams  you may think ahhhhh WTH,   Guess what !! Amazing, delicious and different . Must try it. I ordered fried chicken dinner w/Mac & cheese ,greens and side order of the yams & fried  shrimp. Fried shrimp - amazing and seasoned wellFried chicken - good Yams ,Mac & cheese and greens were also delicious , needed to be temperature hot. Fried chicken leg needed to be more crisper for my liking , overall I will come again and try other items on menu.... well done Black Nile....",Black Nile
50,"Octopus is incredibly fantastically salty. If it were olden days and salt was currency, this octopus would pay your rent for three months. Usually never ever send the food back, but the octopus was just so fantastically salty we had to. The female waitress or manager seemed genuinely bewildered and quite unprofessional when dealing with our mild mannered complaint. Wanted to ask her politely to taste it but refrained. It came back a second time, also fantastically salty, but one salt cube less. Gluten free options on their pastas. Had the truffle and butter pasta that was really nice. Can bring your dog for outside seating.","My boyfriend and I rave about this spot to anyone who will listen. Everything I've ordered is tremendous, I seriously think they can do no wrong. Great spot to bring guests for a nice evening out.","Inedible duck, mediocre pasta, enough said. If you're going out to a restaurant there's no point in going here","Every single bite here was delicious. The bread with olive oil was delicious, and the special of the day which was spinach ricotta ravioli was so good I was literally lapping up the brown butter sauce with the remaining bread we had. Ate every last bite. Service was prompt and friendly and the ambiance was cute, especially for a date.",Location/vibes: super chill! They have outdoor and indoor seating.Staff: They make you feel like family! They're super welcoming and always ready to give recommendations. Our servers were always attentive and incredible! The bartender is so sweet and also great at what she does.Food: AMAZING! We've tried multiple dishes here and never leave disappointed. Everything is fresh and delicious. My fav dish is the salmon dish.This is a perfect date night spot. It's also great for kids as they're very accommodating. 100% recommend!,"My partner on the way out of Mariella: Well I'm officially obsessed with this place. I tried Mariella on a whim while looking for a brunch spot with outdoor seating. They sat us immediately in a shady table on their outdoor patio (surrounded by trees and flower boxes, btw). I was sold on the ambience before I got my food, but luckily, each dish held its own. We shared 3 dishes, the truffle burrata and prosciutto crostini, the Portuguese octopus with zucchini and arugula, and a delicious steak panini with fontina mushrooms and caramelized onions. The truffle burrata was a standout, the octopus was some of the most tender I've had, and the steak was so well marinated and tender it was hard to stop myself from plowing through my sandwich. I realized afterwards that they advertise that they use local and farm sourced ingredients and I think that freshness really shines through in their food. All in all a perfect and low key brunch spot. I'm looking forward to trying it out for dinner.P.S. while we were there, the waitress picked fresh basil from the flower box outside. How great is that?",Mariella
51,"Solid late-night stop. I was drunk so I only had water and bread/olive oil, but man it was exactly what I needed. Ridiculously cool vibe. Doesn't feel like NYC, in the best way.","Service was chill and relax, they don't check up on you that often! I ordered the bacon egg sandwich which has a lot of mustard on it that I hated. I also ordered the Bread pudding French toast which was slightly burnt and was more like a dessert option to me. I miss the old menu and the old chef but it was decent.","I've been meaning to make this review... I visited this spot on my birthday this past September 1st to have a early dinner with my mother. It was about 5 or 5:30. When we seated and gave the waiter our orders, they asked us to prepay for the food before it arrived. The waiter stated that it was part of their policy for dining after 5pm... being a New Yorker and dining all over Manhattan for years, my mother and I both looked at each other in bewilderment. - we canceled our order and left.",Beverly Crosby sang there today for their Sunday Gospel Brunch. I stumbled in and was taken to a another place. The food was great and Beverly and her band were even better. Call to make sure she'll be there the next Sunday you go.,"I had a lovely experience here! A friend recommended and I had no idea what sort of vibe I was walking into, but I was really pleasantly surprised. I ended up getting a gin cocktail -- the Mrs. Robinson -- and my friends and I sat in the back area until it was closed. Luckily, as the back was closing up, the live music inside was starting, and we got to see a bit of the set before heading out. Really sweet servers, a great drink, and an all around great wonderful evening.",Very wonderful venue with great food and drink selection.  But even more wonderful if you are having cocktails next to the stage and a band is playing lovely jazz. It is a great way to end the evening and have a cheap date night out.,LunÀtico
52,"Would love to review their food but these clowns stiffed us on delivery after waiting for TWO HOURS, claiming they were too busy to complete the order. If you're too busy - DON'T ACCEPT THE ORDER.We were refunded the cost by Seamless, but the resto never contacted us.Utterly incompetent and total FAIL.",Came in on a whim this morning and got the spicy pork breakfast sandwich and am blown away. Will definitely be back.,"Waited over an hour for delivery, tried to contact the restaurant 3 times with no one picking up, contact Grubhub and they find out it's going to take another 30 minutes. Cancelled my order and will never order from this joke of a place ever again. From previous orders the food isn't even that good, it's just close by and convenient. Garbage.",This is my fave lil cafe in Bed-Stuy.The spicy congee is actually spicy (read: they use sambal). But the prana chai is the showstopper.

The coffee was nice and strong and the congee provided a modern twist on the classic rice porridge dish. The service was extremely friendly and welcoming. I'll be back to try out the sandwiches. Overall I recommend stopping by if you are looking for a cafe with a laid back atmosphere and in the mood for some delicious Asian classics with a modern spin.",Bed Stuy Provisions
53,fell in love with this restaurant 2 years ago.Today I was craving sancocho. So I call & ask if they are serving it today I was told yes.. so now here I am starving been working since 6am wait at the restaurant for my sancocho walk back to work & I'm surprised & disgusted! The sancocho had no flavor & the chicken was tough & no color to it! I honestly feel that they threw everything together in a pot warmed it up & gave it to me!! I threw out the chicken ate only the root vegetables & broth what a disappointment! Never ever will I eat here  again! I should've had pho instead of this amateur sancocho!!!,Two words:Coconut caipirinha!Which is probably one of the best drinks I ever had in my entire life. It's soooooo good. They had a bomb ass ceviche which unfortunately has been taken off of the menu. Bummer! Please put it back.Otherwise I don't really order food from Bogota unless I come with someone who wants food. There's no need. The caipirinha is all I need.,"I was honestly a little disappointed. The food was expensive and it didn't really taste Colombian to me. It's good if you're looking for a more generic Latin American taste but if your heart is set on Colombian food, don't come here.",With all the options in NYC I rarely go to a place more than once but I've lived in BK less than a year and already visited Bogota 4 times - twice for brunch and twice for dinner.  I've always loved Colombian food but once I became vegetarian it became difficult except but Bogota has several vegetarian/vegan offerings and are able to work wonders with their impossible meat!  I've had the migas with the impossible meat substitution as well as the vegan bandeja paisa... both delicious.  The drinks are not as great as the food but still good and they offer bottomless mimosas with brunch!  They also offer extended happy hours most days.  One thing to note the portion sizes are very generous so come hungry or consider sharing an entree and pairing with an appetizer or dessert between two people.  If you're going on a Friday night I highly recommend you make a reservation or any time for that matter just to be on the safe side.  The manager is super attentive as is the staff.  With so many options I'll definitely be back for more.,"Love the fun atmosphere and delicious food!The empanadas are so yummy - I particularly liked the vegetarian one. They are a decent portion size; although, I recommend getting the empanada sampler since it's a great deal (4 for $15).  The yellow sweet corn arepas are also so good!Overall, great place to chill with your friends :).","Fabulous - have the plantains with queso!! Friendly staff,fun atmosphere, great drinks and fun options forthe designated drivers too!",Bogota Latin Bistro
54,"I came here as a recommendation from a friend. First of all, I should have put myself on the waiting list because we got here and was told the wait would be 30-40 minutes. Well, 1 hour later I came back to see how much longer the wait would be and it appears the host forgot about us. We (3 of us) were seated and it was about 5-10 minutes later we finally received water...btw...the water was warm so I asked for ice (didn't get that til 20 minutes later). Also, may I add that we didn't have any utensils. The food came and this is the only reason why I gave them 3 stars. The food is definitely delicious but the service is lacking. I don't really want to blame the servers so much but I feel Management has to recognize the fact that they need to hire more staff, especially if you know your establishment is always busy.","Decided to come here since its 1 block away from the library and we only had 1 hour to spare. We were seated within 5 mins, placed our orders within 5 mins and received our meals in about 20 mins. Let's discuss the drinks 1st. Khalil had hot chocolate which he thought was good. I had a mimosa that came along with my meal and a rum punch. It was really really good. I was tempted to order another but didn't have the time. Now for our meal. I ordered the poached eggs (actually requested it scrambled) with salmon hash and it came with toast grain bread. The bread was toasted a lil too well. Smelled and tasted burnt. The salmon hash and eggs were decent. Had to add black pepper and ketchup but I ate it all. My son enjoyed his fries and tenders but he said it wasnt the greatest. If you're looking to have a private convo, look else where because you will hear everyone's conversation. The service was alright. Our waitress wasnt the friendliest but I didn't go in there for that. Just wanted fast service with a decent meal and that's what I received.","Only got a picture of the menu because they don't serve food until after 9am, why even bother opening at 8? Disappointed to the max. The water was barely decent.","Awesome brunch spot!! The food was delicious! And those pancakes are second to None! Small spot and always a wait, but definitely worth it.  There's also the cutest little outdoor garden to enjoy your meal at in the back! The workers are friendly and accommodating! I truly enjoyed my visit to Cheryl's and totally recommend it!","I would really prefer to give 1 star but the food is decent and the service is okay. I just don't think this place is for me. I don't like how disorganized they seem to be. A few tables were seated at the same time as us, and when it came time to take orders the server just asked ""who's first"" lol. Bruh, what?! You tell us. I ordered coffee and a mimosa with the brunch special. But my coffee and mimosa came out as the same time as my food. The water was served room temperature, and it's particularly stuffy in the joint. That's the other thing... the heat. It's so hot inside. I'm sure the garden is nice. Overall it's nothing I feel like I have to have, and the atmosphere just isn't for me.","I love this place! A small and unassuming facade with a cute interior with great art, and an outside multi-level garden under the trees, and a really great menu!I was in NYC for the Frida Kahlo exhibit at the Brooklyn museum back in May. I found myself at the museum early and wanted to get something to eat in the neighborhood before entering with my timed ticket. Cheryl's came up on Yelp and Google, so I walked the couple blocks over and was fortunate there was space for me in the garden out back. The brunch options were all appetizing, and because I couldn't decide between sweet and savory, and because I figured this would be my one big meal of the day (because after walking around the Frida exhibit for hours I was planning to jump in the car and drive all the way back to Rochester, NY), I ordered two brunch dishes: the pancakes with fresh berries and fresh whipped cream, and the veggie quiche with a side salad. The pancakes were just how I like them - a little crisp on the outside and pillowy soft on the inside; they also tasted really good even without the addition of the fresh berries and cream. Which, there was plenty of (which is notable since most other restaurants I've experienced seem to scimp on the cream or the berries or both)....The quiche was also delicious - fluffy and creamy, nice subtle flavors enhanced with herbs, and then spring mix on the side with a nice dressing. I managed to eat it all, and then walked it off at the museum!I highly recommend this place and I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area. So many other great looking entrees I still have yet to try!",Cheryl's Global Soul
55,"Overall, if I lived nearby, this would be my go to pasta takeout! The pasta is fresh and cooked deliciously. We got the cacio e pepe dish, which was a big hit. It has the perfect mix of cheese and pepper and is a respectable portion. The other dish we tried was a special: truffle fettuccine. This was good (pasta was cooked perfectly), but it has a milder flavor, and I would try something different next time.Be aware that there is no official waitlist. It depends on Lillo to remember who came first, which makes it difficult if you want to leave and grab a drink somewhere during the waiting time. **there is NO BATHROOM at this restaurant, so plan accordingly.","Come on people. This hype is absurd. The place is decent. The food is nothing special. The most unique thing about this place is that there are no reservations, no list to put your name on, and no one to tell you how long until your table may be ready or where you are in the queue, because none exists.  So if that gets you going and really jazzed for some average Italian food that you could easily replicate at home, I get your 5 star rating. Bottom line: Don't believe the hype. If this spot wasn't in BK, but was in say the east village, it wouldn't get so much dap.","As an italian that just got back from visiting Rome, it gets all the thumbs up!! Molto Bene!",I love this place because they make it their priority to serve simple and delicious food. It's totally no frills and they make due with the space they have.The menu is simple variations of similar pasta dishes. Everything is delicious and you can't go wrong with anything. I had the speck with zucchini and the rigatoni with eggplant. Definitely start with one of their salads too - I had the white bean and tuna salad.Can't wait to go back to try the tiramisu with an afogato.,What a great find! The food and service is irreplaceable and amazing! Meatballs and spaghetti Ragu are to die for!! Will return soon!,"I was visiting New York and found this dope Italian restaurant right next to where I was working. From the outside it looks like a coffeshop but from the second you walk into the joint you know it's a great restaurant. The owner welcomes you like a friend and you get the sense of being home on some fancy ish. Its beautiful inside, light streaming through small windows that making you feel like you're in Genoa siting by the sea side. But most importantly, the food is great especially the Cacio de Pepe. The portions were served on large rustic ceramic plates and at the end you always want a little bit more.At the end I ordered a Cappuccino that was off the charts!Mos def coming back here again!",Lillo Cucina Italiana
56,"Came here without reservations on a Friday night. The wait was 40 minutes so we decided to sit at the bar. We ordered 2 cocktails, an appetizer (the spicy hummus) and each had the salmon with eggplant as an entree. The hummus came out before the drinks did and it was really good, probably the highlight of our meal. 20 minutes later and still no drinks (the bartender was slammed and there didn't seem to be a bar-back helping him). Our entrees arrived and we were disappointed to see the $27 per-plate salmon alongside just two-bite-size pieces of eggplant and the remaining plate supplemented with roasted onions (which honestly didn't compliment the flavors of the salmon whatsoever, so I'm wondering if they were out of eggplants and just threw in the cheapest veggie they had on hand)?Our drinks finally arrived when we were about halfway done with our meal (womp womp). We finished with the chocolate brownie with ice cream which was good but nothing to be impressed about. Unfortunately our experience was lackluster and I don't expect we'll be back, despite living only a few blocks down.","Really can't believe the high ratings for this place.  But hey, it's Fort Greene, home of the $15 schmear of hummous!  I'm not even kidding. 4 plates and 3 drinks cost over $100, and then we had to go to another restaurant since we were still hungry.  Warning: the skewers ($10-15) are ONE skewer.  The various hummi come on tiny plates and are about 1/4 of a small Sahadi's container. Sure they're good, but not THAT good. Adding insult to wallet injury, when the 3 of us (having ordered 4 plates) asked for another pita (having been given one, cut into pieces) we were charged an additional $2!  SKIMPY  is the only word to describe this place. Oh, and the service is just as skimpy.  Really loved how the bar/bus person left the water tap on so that it poured over the bar, menu and into my lap.  I had to turn it off, mop up the mess, and no one even noticed.  Since I did your job, can I have my tip back?",I came back a couple of weeks later and the food wasn't nearly as enticing.The pita bread did not seem very fresh and the whole meal was rather average.,"Holy moly. There have been very few restaurants that have left me speechless and this is one of them. The hummus/dips are to die for. I think I even sat there in awe for a moment as I had my first bite of warm pita with each accompaniment. We ordered the sweet potato hummus and whipped ricotta and WOW. It's difficult to even describe how delicious each of them were. The sweet potato hummus was a perfect combination of slightly sweet and smoky while the whipped ricotta was a literal dream--the sweetness alongside the slightest bit of saltiness was complex and had a beautiful depth to its flavor. I cannot rave about these two dishes enough. We also had the Sabich and Malawach. The sabich was very good, but not as stellar as our small plates. I would probably opt for something else if I went again. The Malawach, on the other hand, was so amazing and flaky. Also, my boyfriend said that this was the only place he was able to find it this far. Incredible restaurant, very nice people, beautiful atmosphere. They were very accommodating to our large group and I cannot wait to go back!","We came back to Miss Ada a few weeks ago. We came earlier in evening and was able to grab a table this time. It was a lot more comfortable.  We ordered a bunch of enjoyable dips. The sweet potato, the veggie, baba. All were amazingly flavorful and addicting.  We also order two short rib skewers and a shawarma hummus which was on the salty side.  Everything though is great with the warm pita. I def enjoyed this visit better and love the food here. The staff is pleasant. A table is def the way to go.","We were in the mood for Mediterranean and I saw Miss Ada on yelp. I tried getting reservations for a whole week with no avail. I called and the hostess on the phone, she said to come in there shouldn't be a problem getting a table at that time. The longest we would have to wait is 30 mins. Well not to bad I thought, right? We show up walk in and the restaurant is packed.  We ask the hostess how long and she tells us 2 hours but the bar is about 15 mins. I mean, I guess okay.. Repeat with me.. Bars are for drinks, Tables are for food! At least that is the case here, because they added an extra 4 bar stools to this bar so you can't really lift your arms to eat anything or sit properly!!  The restaurant is cute but small. There isn't a area to wait for your table/bar stool.  Where ever you stand you are in the way of a server or on top of a table that is eating. Also, There is suppose to be a garden dining area but it looks like they are not using it anymore.  We were finally seated at the corner of the bar. A very awkward seating arrangement. Remember I told you about those extra seats, well we were the lucky winners to get them! Our legs were entangled and we were both trying to figure out how they would fit our food on this small amount of space in front of us.  Plus we had some immature, obnoxious drunk couple to the right annoying us through out dinner.  Moving along...We looked at the menu and decided on a few dips, apps and a entree. The dips we ordered were Babaganoush, which is a roasted eggplant dip. it was smooth and creamy. It had a ginger aioli which made it so special. It was absolutely delicious. We also had the ricotta with brown butter, honey and sage. Which also was super creamy and amazing. Another great dip to try. Our last dip was an Israeli salad hummus. It was roasted veggies on top of a classic chickpea hummus. it was also extremely tasty. All dips come with freshly made hot pita.  For an app we ordered falafel which came in lettuce leaves. It was three to an order. It had olive and a green tahini dressing. This was def an interesting take on falafel. It was moist and seasoned beautifully.  This app is for one person not to share!For an entree we had the hanger steak-medium.  It also came with a succotash and peppers.  The steak came under done more of a rare and a little over seasoned.  The dish overall was good, it just needed to be refined a bit. The food at Miss Adas especially the dips are especially delicious.  The staff here is very nice and try to please..  After saying that, There are a lot of mishaps that go on with seating mainly bc they don't have a waiting area. A group of two adults and a child walked in and invaded our space while we were eating in our already small cramped area at the bar during dinner. Staff consistently told them they couldn't sit or stand in the bar area. That it was reserved. They ignored them, squished and bullied there way into the small two person area with the small child on the left side of where we were seated. After 10mins of not getting their way they got the hint to leave. Or maybe it was because they told them enough times someone was coming for those seats. The bartender apologized to us for the issue. I would only come here if I had solid reservations for a table. If we didn't have issues with our seating I would had given Miss Ada 4 stars. There were so many issues that made us feel so uncomfortable here.  Maybe they should fix the lay out and give a waiting area. Also, take out some bar stools so patrons can feel comfortable while eating there dinner at the bar. Parking is a tad difficult (321)",Miss Ada
57,"If you're on your way here - go to plan b. Never tried the food until now - ordered for delivery.Burger was absolutely horrendous and not edible. Hard and stuffed with large pieces of onions inside the meat. It was weird The Mac and cheese was bland but had a nicely-flavored bread crumb topping. This too also had large pieces of onions in it. Large UNCOOKED onions in the Mac and cheese. Someone was lazy today....I love onions but if I wanted the amount of onions provided, I would've ordered a French onion soup.This place is not for me. Two stars because food was delivered on time.","If you order take out from here, use Seamless only. Their delivery service is solely bike messengers, and the food will always arrive late and cold.","Yum. Came here for brunch and had a hearty, homey meal. I ordered the meatloaf benny, which I thought was a creative comfort-food take on eggs benedict. The parmesan home fries were delish. My brunch date had the chicken schnitzel and waffle and thought it was alright, but not better than regular chicken and waffles, I think. As far as vibe, this place has a very casual feel and is not overly cozy. Next time I'd order takeout or delivery :).","The food: The chicken in the chicken schnitzel sandwich is juicy, flavorful and crispy. They really made it with love. The bread was crispy and buttered. The portions are very fair for the prices. The tahini dressing is house made you will definitely want extra. The salad portions are huge considering the price. The fries taste great on their own without ketchup and light yet crispy and tender on the inside. The service: All of the workers are happy to see you. If you dine in the bring your food to your table. They are all extremely helpful, patient and kind. The ambiance: Very homely, flowers are on the table in old coca cola bottles. Has a hole in the wall gem kind of feel. The art painted on the walls is a nice touch as well. Bathroom is clean and nicely decorated. The music selection: I thoroughly enjoyed the playlist. Its chill yet funky. Really matches the place well. Definitely would recommend. 5 stars :)","Hearty and healthy meals here at the Brooklyn Tree! Came here on a Saturday afternoon at 5pm right before an event. Came in a group of 6, and the restaurant was pretty full. I ordered the meatloaf with two sides ($15), and had a spinach and quinoa salad and french fries as my side. I also got a Moscow Mule ($9) to pair with my meal.Food was great! Meatloaf was baked fresh, portions were big! Meatloaf was seasoned very well, and I really liked their french fries. They were light, airy, crispy, and seasoned really well. The quinoa spinach salad was also a surprise hit. It was slightly citrusy and acidic, has a slight hint of sweetness. Pairs very well with the meatloaf and the fries!Moscow mule was also made really well. I was afraid they would water it down here since it doesn't seem to be a full on bar, but that was a surprising hit and was a great drink to pair with this hot summer day. Lowkey, non-pretentious, good portion sizes, and great prices. BK Tree defines hearty, healthy, and high quality affordable food.","People need to RELAX on drinking so much haterade. Brooklyn Tree is not bad at all so I'm extremely surprised to see two star reviews in here, especially ones that seem like they've only eaten here once. I usually always have to eat at a place AT LEAST 3 times before adding a Yelp review (unless I'm just visiting). I've never actually dined here, I usually just order takeout & by the time I come back home, yes the food has already gotten cold, but it still tastes delicious -- which obviously is a sign that the food is good, even when it's cold!Their grass-fed burger is SOOO on point. It's so on point they were like, ""Screw the toppings! It's all about the cow, baby!"" Ok, they didn't actually say that when creating this burger, but that's what I imagined.Bold move if you ask me, to not to add your traditional onions, tomatoes & greens, or any toppings matter of fact. But also smart because you can tell they wanted to highlight the quality of the beef & let me tell you...GRASS-FED makes a HUGE difference in quality. I usually come for their burger, but I've definitely had their chicken cutlet & mac & cheese. Their chicken cutlet is nothing extraordinary & I will agree with some of the other reviews that their mac & cheese has way too many (thick) onions in it, but it's definitely not enough for me to give them a 2-star review.  Come on people!Their healthy options are quite tasty (haven't tried their veggie burgers though) like their kale & quinoa salad & their sugar snap pea slaw, which is soo delicious & refreshing. Next time I think I'll dine in so I can get some pictures!",The Brooklyn Tree
58,"I mean it's good, but I thought it was strange that there was kale in a vegetarian pho.Kale is not really in the Vietnamese food group. Also, the chicken pho was only served Monday through Friday. Why the restriction, Little Mo? However, I was very impressed with the broth. Very impressed actually because it was really flavorful and not using chicken broth or some basic veggie broth like most places who serve a vegetarian option. I got the chicken char su vermicelli dish. I don't know if the chicken was bad or what not, but I had a really bad stomach ache shortly after dinner. Didn't have lettuce in this! Which is weird to me too. Usually some greens in addition to the daikon and cucumbers. But this is me being nit-picky as a Cambodian-Vietnamese person. That's all!","This place is so painfully mediocre. The broth just kinda leaves you wanting for more. And by more I mean flavor. I got the weekend beef pho, by the way. Sucks. Ive had the catfish banh mi. Sucks. The only thing that was okay were the wings with the carmelized fish sauce but even then they just like... drizzle the sauce on so there isnt much to it.","Originally from San Antonio, trying pho is always my go to when traveling. I have never been so disappointed! Originally I wanted to try everything off their menu, especially the bao pork buns and their bulgogi cheesesteak sandwich and I'm thinking maybe I should have stuck with that. The lemongrass chicken pho had absolutely no flavor and the noddles were over cooked. Oh well! Onto the next one","I've lived in Seattle and Orange County, two places where there's a big Vietnamese population and an abundance of pho restaurants. Growing up, I'd have pho with my family every week and had a childhood friend who's parents made it.This place's pho doesn't taste like anything I've had and it doesn't satisfy my cravings for pho. If you're a pho lover I think you will be disappointed but if you're new to it, it's a decent noodle soup overall.They got good sandwiches too.",All I had were the wings and I got the sweeter ones with a nice glaze on them. Small menu but everything looks fantastic. Next time I will try more but I wasn't that hungry. My buddy got the veggie pho and it was a huge bowl which could definitely be two meals,I love trying out new pho places when I visit new cities and this shop was great! Cool interior and food was delicious. I was surprised that they had Austin Eastciders since I'm from Austin but glad to have that with my pho. I was able to get it customized because I only like specific meats and glad they were able to accommodate. Cool coffee shop next door too. The broth was a tad heavy for me but I would definitely come back again.,Little Mo
59,So good,"I really expected more given the rating that this place has. It's really not good. The mac and cheese tastes like it came straight out of a box, and my pulled pork sandwich was okay but had some fat chunks in it. Definitely do not recommend.","I should begin by saying that Mabel's Smokehouse was a disappointment.  The waitress was more interested in cleaning underneath the tables than attending to customers...the whole restaurant setup was disturbing, so you go in you look at the menu after you decide what you're having from the menu you take a walk to the bar and place your order, second I think that for a bbq establishment there should be wet naps on the table for messy hands and mouth we had to walk to the back of the restaurant where they had a large farmhouse sink, I could just imagine in their busiest night the line at the bar to order your food and the line just to was your hand and wipe your mouth. The food was bland, the drink was good I had the San Antonio Sling...We didn't bother to order desert.",Far from touristic points but worth it.The attendance is pleasant.Ambience clean and different.The food is excellent.Not expensive.If I have a chance I will come back.,"Mable's Smokehouse has to be for people who don't like seasonings.A phrase that comes to mind is ""Williamsburg Mc-BBQ""I split the 3 meat sampler with my boyfriend and it was a let down.The macaroni and cheese was on Kraft straight out the box level.  The yams had marshmallows in in...like is this food for adults??  It was way too sweet and not even good tasting.  The collard greens were undercooked so they had a weird bite to them.The meat itself... everything came-out luke-warm.  For a smokehouse they seemed like they were afraid to use the smoker on the ribs.The brisket was okay and edible.  Not tough, not tender.The pulled pork was the best of the three.  But pulled pork is really easy to make, so I wasn't impressed.You pretty much have to serve yourself.  You go up to the bar to place your order, you get a number and the food arrives.  You have to grab your own drinks and your own water.  The staff doesn't ask you how you think the food is, but it's Williamsburg, so I'm sure they expect a tip for ""something"".","Pros: Very good location. Friendly customer service. Gorgeous cashier (he has impeccable style). I met one of the owners and she made me feel very welcome. The bartender made sure I had everything I needed and she was a beaut! Cons: the food coma ain't no joke. It will happen to you!Overall: I definitely recommend this place. Their ribs, brisket, Mac n cheese, and yams are amazing!!!",Mable's Smokehouse & Banquet Hall
60,"I'd rate this place a 5/6 out of 10. I've had better steak before. I ordered the Atlantic Salmon. It was a nice size but I mean, it tasted like the salmon I get from Black Angus  No joke. It was whatever. Nothing special. Same with the steak. My group ordered the steak for three and I tried some. It was whatever. They're known for their French fries (I don't know why) but they were basic. Thick cut fries. Again nothing special. What I disliked was that their soft drinks came in little bottles. I hateeeeee restaurants that do that. Like why can't you get a soda machine. I honestly felt like I was in the Titanic. The place looked old (which it was and I guess what they're known for). The bathroom was tiny. Our waiter wasn't all that great either. Not enthusiastic at all. He was so bland. Mostly older people as waiters. I saw one shaking his head to a family. I won't be back here again. Sorry!",Want a good steak? Come here and you'll get served a pretty damn good steak! Rib steak is my go-to cut. I've tried the porterhouse. It's good but the rib steak is where it's at. You need to make a reservation. Tried to walk-in the other day and was told no.,"This place was fairly expensive and oily. We went as a group of four and got a Caesar salad, three slices of bacon, steak for 3, creamy spinach, and onion rings. It was A LOT of food and we were unable to finish them all. The Caesar salad was not very special but was necessary due to the amount of grease everything had. The bacon was very good--even better than the steak-- but also extremely pricey. The steak for 3 was extremely oily. I believe that they just soaked it in a lot of oil. It was really difficult to finish three servings even when splitting between four people. The creamy spinach was delicious and would highly recommend. The onion rings were really oily and they give you a mountain of it, which quickly became cold and gross. The dinner was so greasy one of my family members ended up getting a bad stomach the following day. We made a reservation 1 month in advance. However, when we go to the restaurant at our reserved time, the waiter still made us wait for almost 30 minutes, which made me wonder why we made a reservation in the first place.","Having grown up in Chicago, I have eaten many a good steak locally, across the United States at very well known establishments and around the world including the magical Kobe in Japan.After almost cancelling our reservation due a great but exhausting few days in New York, we decided to suck it up, fight the traffic and make the trip to Brooklyn to the renowned Peter Luger steakhouse.  What a terrific decision.It was already hopping at 5:30pm, but we were promptly seated in a ""quiet"" corner.  Aloisius was our server, and he made our evening special ~ courteous, helpful, a great sense of humor and most of all, his love of his job.  We started off with their famous thick cut bacon which was unlike any bacon we had ever enjoyed.  Offered by the slice, one apiece was a terrific appetizer.  It was absolutely delicious and full of flavor.  We ordered a mixed green salad with Russian dressing (no collusion) and chock full of crumbled blue cheese ~ scrumptious.We had already decided to split a Porterhouse, but tried to preview the menu which front and center had Steak for 2, 3, 4, but except for a ribeye, had no other cuts offered, and a few fish dishes tucked at the bottom.  Aloisius explained Peter Luger dry ages its own Porterhouses, which is their signature steak, so our decision was simple.  Also ordered were the German potatoes which with the grilled onions, was very good.  A big surprise was their creamed spinach which arguably was the best we have had.  It reminded me of the old Berghoff in Chicago.The Porterhouse was simply prepared, but utterly tender and delicious, not overpowered with spices or butter.  It looked regal sitting front and center, nicely carved and tilted so the butter/oil could flow into its own pool.  Their steak sauce was also a nice accompaniment, not too powerful and really brought out the delicious flavor of their prime meat.  Of note, their dry aging did not add ""that"" extra scent or taste which detracts from the pure flavor of the steak.Aloisius gave us some complimentary Schlag which is a heavy pure German whipped cream with a chocolate drizzle.We joked with Aloisius saying we were eating ""like we were going to the electric chair!""  He countered with a story about two men who ordered steak for three which would be their last meal before going up the river to prison for a few years.This truly elevated Peter Luger to the very top of our all time favorite steakhouses and experiences. We cannot wait to return for another wonderful meal.","Read so so many amazing reviews before coming here and I was surprised at how good the burger was than the steak (in my opinion!) RESERVATIONS: RESERVE! We reserved a 11:45AM time and thought we were really early - who eats steak that early?? But we were wrong. There was already a huge line for when we got there, and those who reserved were seated pretty much immediately. It was basically full house! Can't imagine how long the wait took. I would definitely recommend booking wayyyy ahead. FOOD: We got the single steak because we also wanted to try the burger. I can definitely see why everyone loves the steak, the medium rare came with a slight crispness on the outside and extreme tenderness when you bite in. Dip it in the sauce Peter Luger gives you and it's not a bad combo!Personally, the burger was better! Maybe it's because I can't just eat meat only... we added all the add-ons: onion, tomato, and bacon. The burger patty was sooo juicy and flavored. The sides made it even better. Slide the bacon onto the burger and it's perfect! Also, the bread that comes before the meal.... wow. I had to force myself to stop eating the bread, because otherwise would've been too full to eat the steak! They ask if you want to take it home at the end of your meal if there's any left, or they toss it away. I thought asking you before throwing it away was a nice touch. SERVICE: excellent. One of our waiter's, Felipe, recommended a couple pretty dope places around Brooklyn, and even told us the best way to get to where we wanted to go. Earlier, we wanted to go to the vessel but because we looked into it too late, there were no more reservation times. Felipe pulls out his phone, tells us to take a picture of a QR code, and it was the Vessel admission for same day! Shoutout to Felipe for hooking it up :) Definitely made our day and the meal experience even better.","i've been to the luger location in greatneck and must say the brooklyn one is so much better. maybe its just me? LOLmy boyfriend and i came here for lunch for my birthday. i picked lunch because i really wanted to try their burger! i heard such good things and WOWOWOW. legit the best burger i've ever had. must get the bacon too and put that in the burger. mind blown. so juicy, and meaty and just honestly the perfect bite. burgers dont need to be fancy this was just a simplistic burger and it was done so well! and lets be honest how do you go to lugers and not get a steak? so we also got a porterhouse for 2 and shrimp cocktail. you can honestly never go wrong with the shrimp cocktail cooked to perfection and so meaty. peter lugers has always been my top 3 steak houses, because it's so tender and buttery. but for the first time, i tasted the that ""dry aged funk"". in the great neck location i never did, it just tasted like a fresh piece of steak, but in the brooklyn location my boyfriend and i were like wait WHAT, we loveeee that funkyness of dry aged steaks and wow it was SO GOOD. we normally go to delfriscos because you actually taste the dry aged in those steaks, but wow we were blown away that we finally tasted it at luger and it was delicious. ive been to lugers quite a few times, and never have i tasted it the way, maybe cus its brooklyn vs long island? who knows but makes me only want to go to the brooklyn location from now on =P",Peter Luger
61,"Been wanting to try this place out. Nothing overly impressive, it's ok.You don't get a lot of bang for your buck. Had the fried green tomatoes.. it's basically one tomato cut into 4 or  5 slices.. it was delish.. just not enough. For $16.00 you get a tomato with a bit  of ricotta and berries. A measly piece of basil too. Had to order a side of herb sausage which was amazing to fill up. I understand it is summer and humid, but flies buzzing around the bathroom and while you eat is not cool. I like the ambience and decor, just dont think I will go back..","Very disappointing $100 meal. The worst offender was the ""fava bean salad"". This $18 ""entree"" was a 12 ounce bag of green peas (not even fava beans!!), some cubes of deli ham, and a few spoonfuls of Creme fraiche. It was actually offensive. See photo. I'm not one to send things back to the kitchen, but should have considering that the food I received was not close to the food described on the menu. The homemade ricotta had a sad, dry, crumbly texture- not even close to the silky texture it should have been. A seltzer was $7.  Our bill was over $100 for  2 drinks, two apps, two entrees. The place was packed and I know they've commanded quite a following from inside and outside the neighborhood since opening, but I felt sheepish and used upon leaving. We won't be returning. The server did not ask me how my food was at any point, or I would have shared that it was actually really disappointing. We've had great dinners at La Puerto Roja if you're looking to not be ripped off and lied to.","Came here on a weekend for brunch. The wait was about 30 minutes long. VERY BUSY. By the time my friend and I  got seated we were starving. When we were walking to our seat, we realized the workers knew most of their customers. I'm guessing all the locals go there often.We ordered a burger with a side of fries and salad. The burger was very filling. The side of fries were to die for! They have a special dipping sauce curry mayo just for it! Totally would come back again for the fries.","Only tied two dishes, the trout....was ok but my dish the glazed pork belly was sensational.Its in the small dish list so probably best served with something else but we were in a rush and just grabbing a bit before an event at Kings Theatre.Id probably come back again just to eat this dish again.","We are SO glad we went here! We almost missed a great experience because when we showed up around 3, they were serving their happy hour menu (which featured an awesome mix of options) and we were worried it wouldn't be sufficient for a meal.  First of all, the atmosphere is so cute. Great natural light and adorable big gold pendant lights adorn the bar.  Second of all, the service was so nice! My 2 girlfriends and I chatted nonstop for 2+ hrs which was complemented nicely by the bartender interjecting recommendations and small talk. Third, what great drinks! They use real, fresh ingredients and they were all so good! The gin fizz and another gin based cocktail were delicious. Lastly, the food! Definitely the highlight of this really fun afternoon. They have unique flavor pairings that are so on point! The cheese plate was well portioned with amazing bread. The chicken liver mousse was perfect. So was the pork cube dish. And the burger served on English muffin. And the addicting fries I could not help myself from demolishing.We had a great time chatting, eating, and drinking the afternoon away and I'd go back here any time!  The surrounding neighborhood also has beautiful homes and was fun to walk through afterwards towards nearby Prospect Park.","I grew up in Brooklyn, and while I was not born there (that distinction goes to Manhattan) I try to visit there as much as I can.  On a recent visit to Southern Brooklyn, I wanted to find a spot to have brunch.  A Yelp search revealed The Farm on Adderley, and it sounded exactly like what I was hoping for.The Farm on Adderley is a very charming looking establishment.  The restaurant is long, starting on one side of the block and going to the other side of the building.  Wood shelves and floors, art hanging on the walls and light flooding in from the front and back makes for a very welcoming space the beckons you to enter.It will not surprise you to learn that during peak brunch times this place can get packed, complete with people waiting outside for a table.  I wound up sitting at the bar.  Fortunately, I enjoy sitting at bars so it was no big deal for me.The bartender was super nice, and she was very happy to answer questions about the menu.  I wound up ordering the Roasted Monkfish Sandwich (spice roasted, fennel slaw, fresno chili mayo, brioche bun, handcut fries).  The fish was cooked well and not dry at all.  The chili mayo was very tasty and the sandwich actually held together very nicely.   I have to give huge kudos to the handcut fries.  They were fresh, crispy on the outside but soft on the inside and if you dip them in the signature curry mayo it was fantastic.A wonderful setting, friendly staff and good food, what's not to love?  I look forward to visiting the Farm on Adderley again!",The Farm On Adderley
62,"KENNY D IS A MOTHERFUCKING SUPERSTAR Depending on whose here I usually come in get ignored, get annoyed and leave. Kenny was prompt and my food came before I finished my order. Now that's service! He was attentive but not overwhelming. Don't know who hired him but y'all better watch out because I might take him to come work for me.","I met up with my girlfriends here to catch up. We pretty much ordered everything. The food was ok. I actually was disappointed because it didn't taste like Caribbean food. Maybe because I know better and I can make a mean chowmein but there's wasnt ""Guyanese chowmein"" as they labeled it. Even the pepper shrimp had no kick to it. The plantains were good. The jerk wings were a joke. Our waitress was a doll though. She was full of energy and even sat down and talked with us for a bit. Inside is really small so I wouldn't recommend large groups.","Not good if you know anything about Caribbean food. Tasteless gentrified appropriation food. I ordered the jerk wings, which were not flavorful and came with a side of... sweet chili sauce? Nah, try again. Wifey ordered the goat, tough as leather. Homie ordered the jerk pork, cardboard. I also ordered the pepper shrimp, which did have some flavor (hooray) but were completely entombed in shell, which I know locks in moisture and taste, but were too small to make the struggle worthwhile. Consider the source of these ratings.Then our server messed up the balance and had to charge my card twice to make up the balance. Still hungry..","Just a super real refreshing taste of Caribbean food!Super great service, excellent and fast in serving the dishes!The kitchen is under your eyes and you can see how they cook your food.Clean .......and well light with all glass windows.Try it out!!","Really great place in Crown Heights for dinner and drinks. We had a plate of the plantains (yesssss so good! Like my Puerto Rican momma makes them), spicy fried chicken sandwich, and the jerk chicken. Amazing all around. In terms of drinks - tried the Jamaican punch and the Painkiller, both good, though my preference was the latter.Only reason I took a star off (begrudgingly! I really like the place) is that it took a looong time to get our food. A few other folks at the bar got their entrees before us, and my stomach was grumblingggg. So yes, I was a little salty about it. But that said, the bartender was very sweet and I'd go again in a heartbeat.","Super yummy Jamaican spot with communal table and cute decor. We stopped by on Saturday night and were seated pretty quickly. My boyfriend and I ended up getting the Veggie Bowl ($14), Jerk Pork ($11), and the House Fruit Punch ($5). The fruit punch was super refreshing as it was sweet and slightly creamy from what I believe was guava or mango. In addition, the combination of the Veggie Bowl and Jerk Pork was amazing. None of the jerk dishes come with rice so it was perfect to order these two items together. The pork was tender and flavorful alongside the jerk sauce while the veggie bowl offered a great combination of fresh, savory and sweet. I was actually quite surprised with how much I enjoyed the Veggie Bowl and would definitely get it again!",Glady's
63,"2 stars for food, 0 stars for service. We got the curried goat, plantains, and curried vegetables. Curried goat was subpar at best. Had lots of inedible meat that we left on the plate. I didn't enjoy the raisins and canned corn in the curried vegetables. We tried ordering the fried chicken but fried chicken and BBQ chicken are not available on weekdays (which is not noted anywhere on the menu or on their website online).***Unbelievably bad service, I will never be back here again. My boyfriend and I came in around 8:30pm tonight (Thursday night). The restaurant was 1/4 full (not busy at all). While we were dining, we only asked for 3 things 1) hot sauce 2) the check 3) a takeout container. Our waiter took over 10 minutes to deliver each one and ended up never even giving us a takeout container. We were so done by that point, we just left and didn't bother to ask again. We saw our waiter play on his phone and sit down in a chair doing nothing before he remembered to bring the hot sauce. We were tired of waiting for the check, so we went up to the counter to ask for the check but he sent us back to our table telling us he would bring it over. Then he walked around other tables before grabbing the check from the counter and coming by our table. I understand waiters could have bad days and other things on their minds but this was over the top, worst service I've experienced.","Ok this used to be my spot but, Something isn't right. I've gotten bad food from here before but it was confirmed yesterday again. When the restaurant isn't crowded you best believe your getting old food, they like to microwave things. I absolutely hate that!!!! I got my made to order food. But the rice and macaroni and steam veg were old... the food stank by the time I got home and once in the garbage it stunk up my entire house... I will not support their establishment anymore. I tried but soon after eating their food my blood pressure spikes. They cook with too much damn salt ... get it together please.","I started eating here because of yelp but I'll soon stop eating here because of the food, and maybe the somewhat standoffish service ......I eat from here religiously but I've realized this restaurants seems to microwave things a lot..... That's not cool...,I ordered Mac & cheese and I swear it wasn't made that day..... Never took the time to eat there because the place is smallllllll, ordering over the phone is depressing, they suggest what you should get instead of what you want (rude),.... Idk but I'm looking for a new love,... Cause the islands has lost it's flavors for me","The Islands is so tasty!! The jerk chicken is absolutely delicious. The roti, plantains, and rice and beans are very tasty. It's a fairly large space and it seems family run and very authentic. Definitely a good dinner spot and one I would recommend going to for great flavors.","The best damn curried goat I've ever had, and the portions are just the right size. I like especially that, when you order from Islands, the curried goat is mostly goat MEAT and not goat BONE. I often feel a little let down by a lot of places that give you a couple choice morsels and then a whole pile of soup bones and cartilage to gnaw on. That unfortunate circumstance NEVER happens at the islands, I cannot stress enough that I have never left there feeling any less than very satisfied. The rice and peas have a wonderful subtle spice to them that makes for a great snack as leftovers. And the service is quick too!","The food is absolutely delicious .... I mean , The BEEeeessssssT  Jamaican food I have ever had in my life ,  the food had so many favorable spices . My husband and I are definitely hooked on this new spot and we will return before the end of our vacation. If you are from out of town , in-town , or next door Please come to THE ISLAND ... trust me . You will not be disappointed",The Islands
64,"Bad service! We spilled something on the table and we tried to use the napkins for our fork and knives to keep the liquid fall on the ground but the server (white guy, with facial hair and kinda matured looking) told us not to use it as its expensive. For a thin white paper? Really! Food came so late. Server was not even welcoming. For a $400 bill with a shitty service? Would anyone come back? Nah!","Tried to sit down for food and wine with two friends. Was told we can only sit if we order dinner, at 9:15 pm. We're about to spend $35 - $55 each and were told to leave because the bar was full ... incredibly rude service and for no reason. We'll see how long they last, turning customers away!","Just moved in the neighborhood and after eating here once, I can already see this place becoming one of my ""go-to"" spots. I tried the veggie burger - very tasty and filling! I'm a fan","Good brunch vibes - bright and airy on a sunny day with a slew of vegetarian options. I had the veggie burger, the best part of which was the delicious blend of aioli and a type of beet chutney hiding underneath the buttery brioche bun. Homefries were adorned with sweet caramelized onion, but seemed like they could have used a bit more salt.","This place is completely and totally overrated. The setting is nice and that could be a reason to come here (good place to bring your  date and have drinks) but Do not eat here, bodega food is honestly better.Ps: the tortellini dish is really not working. Campbell soup would be cheaper and possibly tastier and the gnocchi is unnecessarily soupy.","On a recent trip to New York, I ended up at this location because it's one of my brothers favorite places. We had been exploring all day, went home to pick up my sister in-law and then headed over to Eugene & co.The space is awesome, this is a Midwesterner saying it and I could be easily amused but I just loved the look of it, open modern, yet homey/creative.On to the most important part, the food and drinks, I had the de-colonial with gin, grapefruit, honey, lime and butters. It was refreshing and the combination of honey & grapefruit was light & flavorful, I had to make sure I didn't chug it.To start we had the deviled eggs, to some this may be something you think of as an Easter or a picnic side, these, oh my god I can see what my brother has been raving about since he moved there. The eggs were savory and I ate mine in one bite, they came on top of chicken cotnfiet, which melted in my mouth. Thankfully I'm not one who thinks too much on consumption, but if you really think about that dish it's mildly dark, but the amazing flavor is what needs to be experienced. Now because you can't subsist on just gin and eggs.My main course was the mussels I always have to get seafood when I'm not land locked. It was perfect the Manila claims mixed with chorizo, clam stock, jalapeño, cilantro and lime. The perfect medley of flavors and just the right amount of spice. Loved everything about this place can't wait to go back!",Eugene & Co
65,"Inedible food, combative staff. Why bother?Came for a weekend Brunch. Waiter couldn't have cared less and seemed like he wanted to be anywhere but there. Seemed annoyed that we had questions on the menu. Got eggs and a breakfast pizza and two iced coffees.I'm not sure how you mess up an iced coffee that bad, but holy heck that was terrible. Probably the worst iced coffee I'd had in my life. Watery, off-flavored.Waiter drops on our table a ""bread basket"" that was TWO end pieces from the loaf. Pretty sure you're not supposed to serve that piece at all, let alone two of them.Food was cold, but also somehow overcooked. Not just un-hot, but cold. Would have loved to flag my waiter down and tell him that it was cold... but he left the building. Like just got up and went outside. For fifteen minutes.When we decided we had enough and wanted the check, I had to flag down the bar tender to grab our waiter from whatever he was doing outside the restaurant.Told the waiter our food, bread, and coffee was way, way off and bordering on inedible. Halfway through me talking about it, the guy just ran away to the bar. Like partway through my sentence, he left. When he came back, he was incredibly combative and asked us ""what the hell do you want me to do about it"" and that ""we should just pay and leave, we're not welcome"". Suffice to say, I paid for my overpriced, crappy food and left.This meal was so bad it made me want to get a Yelp account.I had actually really wanted to go here for a while, shame that it was so bad. Never going back, would tell anyone and everyone I know to avoid it like the plague.","The food was good, but the service is another story.Not only did the waitress make a mistake in our order, but imposed a 20% gratuity on us (for a 2 person brunch...) AND THEN proceeded to short change us. Will not be going back.","I have been here six or seven times. The food is pretty good and the ambience is cute and cozy. Happy hour is awesome, great cocktails for 8 bucks.I will not be back because the service, at least from the ladies on the wait staff, ranges from cold and surly to flat-out awful. Most recently the person who had our table barely spoke to us, spilled water on my belongings (no apology), wasn't around when we needed her, and was all-around unpleasant and rude. I'd say it was just an off night, but this is a frequent occurrence whenever we have one of the women waitstaff. I don't know what the deal is, but if you don't like people, food service is a hard job to master.Our other waiter was very nice but very drunk (which he told us immediately upon coming to our table) and spilled about a quarter of my friend's drink all over the floor as he brought it to over. His whole hand and arm were dripping with it when he put it on the table with a flourish. Then he neglected to put one of our three dishes in as an order. When I told our grumpy server she said ""Oh yeah, looks like he never put it in."" That's it. Uh, ok. No problem. It's fine, we didn't want it anyway.Honestly, she was so rude it kind of ruined the evening.Bye-bye, Bijan's. I will miss your yummy random pasta dish, and the salads!",Amazing food at a reasonable price. Relaxed atmosphere. And the cocktails are awesome. I've been here for both dinner and brunch and both were great! Highly recommend!-Dominique,Stumbled across this gem of a place when searching for a place to eat at the odd hour of 3:30 on a Sunday. The ambience was super cute/vibey- the $20 special was awesome (cocktail plus entree)- and the owners Sepideh and Bijan were so warm and friendly! The food was awesome! We got the burger (meat was juicy and delicious) and the chicken salad sandwich. Definitely coming back here next time I visit Brooklyn!,"Delicious food, grossly overpriced. We got the Persian noodle soup ($14) and two side dishes of roasted eggplant and garlic yogurt ($7 each) and were very disappointed in the portion size. The soup was super yummy, but small for $14 and the two sides were RIDICULOUS for $7. It was basically robbery, it was almost disrespectful to give such little food and charge so much. Cute place, but probably won't be back due to high prices and small portions despite the food being good.",Bijan's
66,I did not have a good experience at Cafe Rue Dix. I ordered a Manhattan straight up with Jack Daniels. It was all vermouth. I ordered the lamb dish and it was all bones. The appetizers were good. I ordered Jack Daniels on the rocks afterward. The bill came for 3 Jack Daniels. We told the I only had two. They then brought me another Jack Daniels  saying I ordered it. I would not go back.,"We went with Cafe Rue Dix because they offered vegan options. I liked the vegan stew, it felt right for the season, very hearty and comforting. I also had the hummus which was herbal tasting but bland and the pita that came with it was scarce for the amount of hummus we received. Mostly everyone enjoyed their meals but no one really liked their drinks. I found mine to be too citrusy and bitter (almost all their options had ginger or citrus in them). I do not see myself returning here.","I gave this restaurant several chances, today was the last time.The first time I stopped in, it was good. I had a burger with fries and a South African beer I can't remember the name of. I raved about it to friends and even brought one with me to brunch. The service was awful then and the food was bland, but I figured maybe they were just having a bad day. I went back again and learned the horrible service is pretty much the norm. Today, I was one of maybe 5 people in the restaurant when I arrived. It took more than 10 mins for me to get service at the bar, because somehow, the restaurant scheduled just one person for the cafe, bar, tables, etc. I ordered a coffee and received it lukewarm, black and no cream; before I could ask for a fresh cup and cream, the bartender/waiter, who was extremely rude and curt I found, was whisked away again. It took another 40 mins before I could order food. By then, the restaurant had gotten fuller and I was fed up. I asked to pay for just the cold coffee I hadn't even drank, and was told there was a $15 minimum for card purchases. The nerve! Rather than wait another hour, I fumbled through my bag for change and thankfully had it. But never again will I go back to this place nor recommend it. Absolutely horrible. (The second star is for the anomalous time it was good.)",Love love love been going to this spot for a few years been a while and still enjoyed the food and experience. Born and raised in the area. Love the food and the owners are amazing ! Congratulations on being in the neighborhood for so long. Love and respect. Tyler,Dinner was delivered tonight. And it was great. First the delivery was exactly on time. But the food was wonderful. Salmon with delicious mashed potatoes. The salmon was wonderfully spiced. A real winner. It also came with crispy kale. Very tasty. Snapper slightly spicy but really really good. The food was hot. Our new go to take out.,"Excellent food!! This was my first time trying Senegalese food and I loved it! I would suggest you go on a Wednesday just like my boyfriend and I did because they have a prix fix menu on Wednesdays and you can get an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $32. Totally worth it!I loved everything about my meal. I ordered the beef fataya as an appetizer and I really enjoyed it. It's just like an empanada. I didn't try the sauce it came with, but my boyfriend did and he warned me that it was super spicy.For my entree I ordered the Dibi Senegal (lamb chops), which comes with a serving of rice and fried sweet plantains. It was delectable.For dessert I got the creme brûlée and it was delicious, but the portion is huge so don't expect to finish it! I'm not complaining though because I love sweets.Overall I really loved the food here and I'd definitely recommend and come back to try more of their food. I heard they have good brunch selections so that's on my to-do list.I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the music was really loud and I felt like I had to yell at my boyfriend the entire night and also the restaurant is really dark so you can't really see your food well. I loved the music selection here (Afro beat), the only thing is they should turn down the volume a little.",Cafe Rue Dix
67,"So disappointed with the menu section, the small portion sizes, and taste of food.  Not what I expected.  Before we were seated they left us outside waiting without menus for over 15 minutes.  When we were finally called inside to be seated they made us uncomfortably wait inside and in the way of the fire exit for another 5 minutes.  There was only one thing on the Menu that caught my attention and they were completely out of it by 8:15pm.  We were not told what they did not have when the waitress arrived at the table.  The only other options the waitress could suggest were their Tacos (very small and expensive...$8 each at dinner) and a $32 Steak dish.....What? I can't eat cheese which obviously was a problem for this establishment.  The chips were hard round corn tortillas which would have been okay but they only gave us 6x for our guacamole and there were 6 people in our party.  The food was tasteless and the corn tortillas completely overwhelmed the dish, I didn't think that was possible.  The vegetarian in our group was at a loss for what to eat.  She ended up getting some corn tortillas, rice, beans, and lettuce.  The dessert menu was lackluster and our entire table agreed to go elsewhere.  I do not recommend.  6 of us were seated at a 4 person table next to the kitchen and I felt in the same way the entire time.  Expensive with a one stall bathroom in the back.  The worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been to.","2.5 stars if I could. It's hard to rate this establishment. Went there this evening. We were immediately seated outside, which was great. Especially because we were walking around forever trying to decide what to eat. Although we were seated immediately, the waitress took a very long time to come and take our order. We ordered 3 drinks and guacamole to start. The guacamole came after about 20 mins of ordering. The drinks did not come at all we had to inquire about it. The drinks were good and so was the guac.  Again, we had to wait a reallly long time for the food. I ordered 1 Tinga and 1 queso quesadilla. I did not like either. My cousin ordered chicken enchiladas and did not like it. My other cousin ordered the salmon special and did.  I asked the waitress to change my quesadilla for something else. She was very accommodating. However, after thinking about it and how long it took for everything to arrive I passed.  I like the vibes but I will not come back.",Had brunch there. It was ok but nothing special. No idea why people wait in line for this place.,"Margaritas made just how you like it.  Should I say more?  Why yes!This is a nice spot in Brooklyn with a vast drink and food menu.  It's a lil tight but the ambiance is very relaxing and great for a date night or a bite with a small group of friends (like under 4).I would definitely suggest a margarita.  I had the classic, however, they do offer different flavors, if that's you thing.  Plus I'm all about the sugar rim and they gave you plenty.The guacamole is freshly made and they give you extra chips if you need it.Service was great and quick.",Excellent tequila mezcal selectionExcellent mole and chilaquilesPork in the haruche could have been a little warmer and more tender but great other than that.Cute atmosphereWould totally come back,"Mexican food is how you win me over.So, I know what you're thinking. Is this place like legit. Is it authentic. How do I know what's authentic or nah? You try the gauc and chips. Chavela's nailed the perfect lime proportion to the avocado smash. It was chunky enough and freshly made. Just the right amount of salt and citrus! Now the rest of the menu: my boyfriend ordered the shrimp enchiladas and i had the don plato with pescado and camarones aka build your own fish and shrimp taco. Our verdict: AMAZING. Tip: ask for habanero sauce for that extra kick if you like spicy food. I honestly thought they were only gonna for me like 5 tiny tortillas but NO! They were kind to provide more but they should given how big the platter is. (Picture attached). Ugh, it's so good.The Spanish rice was a tad dry but not too bad. Overall, the food was good. The enchilada was good too! The green sauce really was authentic and brought the dish together. We had dinner around 7p and not long enough of a wait and seated outside. Staff was on point with checking in and providing extra requests like sauces and utensils.Def gonna heads back! It's a little more pricey than I would like for tacos but it's a nicer place. If I had to vote who served better Mexican compared to Rosie's and Chavela's. CHAVELAS WIN.",Chavela's
68,"191 Knickerbocker 5-starWonderful service and food. The owner of the bar is extremely nice and attentive. The actually environment is a small bar area and some tables that make for a very intimate setting. I ordered the beet salad and a side of Mac n cheese and it was amazing, and the perfect amount of food. We also grabbed a slice of the pumpkin pie to go and it was a perfect add on. Nothing but great feedback and I look forward to more people learning about this place!",The fig berry mimosa is on point!!!! And the French toast sticks are everything you want in French toast and then some with an extra crunch... Very churro like.... Not to be missed!!!!!,1st time here and beyond my expectations everything we ordered was delish. The Chicken and waffle with bacon inside was on point. We ate the Nutella French toast before I could even take a pic sorry lol,"This place was honestly Ah-mazing!Service was excellent!One of the best chicken and waffles we have ever had. California Benedict was delicious. The home fries were seasoned so well. Mac & cheese was perfection. Everything was honestly great. Sangria was great. And $5 mimosas, how can you beat that?! Can't recommend this place enough. We will return for dinner.","Popped in for a late brunch with some friends this past Saturday. Place wasn't too packed - just 2-3 other small parties besides us. The place is very laid back and they play such an interesting mix of music (Jay Electronica, then Jazz, etc)The server (who was also the bartender I think) was super friendly and got us started with some drinks. I went with the white sangria, which was delicious but very strong (tasted like some sort of apple liquor). For the food, we ordered the Mac and cheese to share, and I went with the French toast sticks - both were amazing! The Mac and cheese was super cheesy and came with a nice hardened layer of cheese on top. The French toast sticks were actually pieces of Texas toast dipped in corn flakes, that came with powdered sugar and maple syrup for dipping. Absolutely delicious! Great neighborhood spot for a casual catch up with friends.","I hardly write reviews but I HAD to for this place. Tiny bar/restaurant in BushwickBae and I went here on a rainy Wednesday night. Super chill space, cute music and Avengers was playing on the tv at the bar. We were promptly greeted and told to sit anywhere we wanted; 3 tables occupied and few couples at the bar and only but only bartender/waiter. She came to the table with waters, dropped off menus and told us they were out of a the Reuben sandwich (which made me want to order it more) and told us the dinner special. Even though she was working the floor solo, she was energetic and super nice! Within a few minutes we ordered drinks and food; mini Mac and cheese, West Indian fritters, beet salad an chicken and waffles--we were hangry! My margarita was bangin, strong and not too sweet. Just as we started playing a game from one of the books in the front, like 10 minutes, our apps arrived it was crazy fast. Mac and cheese is stupidddddd fire, esp with the West Indian hot sauce. Perfect amount of salt and the grueyre gave some earthiness. Fritters were spiced and the spinach was the best pairing. Beet salad was bomb asf Esp with that fried feta--go awffff.5 mins later while we were balls deep in our apps, our big ass platter of chicken and waffles appear. Yoooo sweet chick is in trouble!!!!! Yes i said it!They use white meat so their portion is bigger, the breading is helllla crispy and that hot sauce makes I go harder! Their waffle has bacon in it!!! Oh and their maple syrup tasted artisan af, like made on site! I wanted to hug the cook forreal! We'll definitely be back for the awesome service and the ridiculously bomb food.",191 Knickerbocker
69,"The soup dumplings are stuck together, so that when you pick them up all the juice falls out. Woman calling out the numbers was rude. Bad service and bad food. Person taking orders was rude, too.","Growing up in a Shanghainese family, I spent a lot of time eating shanghainese food in both the Bay and in Shanghai, so I'm always trying to find places that serve my favorite dishes1. Crab xiaolongbao: Skin thick and gummy, crab flavor more of a hint than actual crab pieces or roe, meat not quite as fragrant as I would have liked...Would not return for the xlb really since their xlb are definitely worse quality than the ones at the bao or the ones at the old nanxiang xiao long (and maybe even worse than that of tourist chinatown)1/52. Meatballs over rice: I adore lion's head meatballs (shizitou) so was excited to see it on the menu. It was pretty good! Flavor was good: sweet as a lot of Shanghainese dishes are but not too sweet, savory in a lip smacking way. The sauce was thin, but I infinitely prefer that to places that use starch to thicken the sauce into a sad gloop. The meat was light and fluffy and didn't have the pork ""stink"" that marks ill-prepared pork in Chinese cuisine. The vegetable side choices confused me--lions head meatballs typically are served with green bok choy (aka qingcai) rather than the cabbage or the random veggie mix. To add more insult to injury, the cabbage was bland and a little undercooked. The egg I got was reminiscent of a tea egg but lacking flavor, as well as being overdone and weirdly wrinkly--a first for me.Meatballs: 4/5Sides: 1/53. Vegetable steamed buns: I loveeeee eating vegetable steamed buns for breakfast in Shanghai. I have yet to find any in New York, so I immediately knew I had to get these. Google what ""cai bao zi"" look like so you can see how these are Not It. I was kind of heartbroken. They filled the buns with cabbage instead of the customary filling of fragrant qingcai (shanghai bok choy) and it left me actually sad. Why take something perfect and ruin it? Why even put it on the menu if you can't find qingcai? Why give me hope? 0/5I would return for the meatballs maybe, but certainly nothing else.","I've been eyeing this place for a while and when I saw a deal on ritual I just had to go and check it out. I ended up getting the chicken soup dumpling, and it was interesting.My supervisor and I both thought the dough was light and not heavy, the first bite was juicy and not dry at all, however the broth was a bit flavorless and not much filling inside. They do offer different condiment such as hot sauce, soy, and a ginger sauce. The dumpling itself is missing something, it has potential to be better.The service was quick and the store was clean. 3.5 stars to be honest, but I haven't tried any of the other items they make.I wouldn't go out of my way to re-visit this place.","Delicious xiaolongbao and noodle soup (the ultimate comfort food) in Downtown Brooklyn. The pork xiaolongbao were well made -- the skin was not too thick or thin, had flavorful soup, and had great consistency and taste overall. It would be nicer if they had more than 4 dumplings per serving though. The Braised Beef Noodle Soup has a slight spice that made the soup even more flavorful. The Beef was tender and tasted great with the noodles, but it would've been even more amazing if there were more noodles in the dish, because there was definitely not enough. Overall, the food tasted great and I'll definitely be back. The portions are on the smaller end though, so keep that in mind when ordering.","I wanted something quick and easy but in a decent decor and with some flair to it. Then we tripped across this fast-casual-style Shanghainese restaurant and were glad that we did. We shared the spicy chicken with vegetables and rice which wasn't really spicy at all...just spiced, but that was OK. We also had the dry noodles with tofu and they were actually far more flavorful and interesting.All of the ordering is digital making for a quick and easy checkout process. The staff are extremely polite and as attentive as can be when they've got lots of orders flying at them from seemingly lots of apps and in-location customers. I'll likely be back at some point.",The food is delicious here... I appreciate the easy to read and see menu along with the authentic flavors of the foodS. I've noticed portion sizes have changed significantly and for that reason I'm going to give it a 3... however the rib tips and the meat ball are my favorites!!! Haven't tried the soup but that's next!,Yaso Tangbao
70,"I have been going to this place for almost 10 years when I am in New York and I have always loved it. It has great food and it used to have awesome servers, however this time the experience was completely ruined by the waitresses when after waiting for about 25 minutes to get out order taken, we get our breakfasts but no utensils to eat with, we asked the server for forks and she got quite upset with her facial expression. We ate our breakfast and after we finished the upset and unhappy waitress says to me, do need more forks?I don't know what this lady thinks but she got her role completely up side down. She willfully wanted to upset this fine restaurant's customers. I know this is a busy place and will not loose customers because of this but I think ownership should know about this person and send her to the back of the house where she is not exposed to the public. I was there on 9/18/19 at around 10 am in the small room inside on the booth for four.","I've been coming to Mogador in WillIamsburg for 6 years. I live in the neighborhood and always bring our visitors here. They have a great reputation as food is always fantastic but service can be spotty. They're never flexible with small requests. Well today will be our last visit. I. AM. LIVID. And embarrassed as we brought my mother who was visiting from out town. I'm allergic to egg yolk. I came on a Monday morning at 11am.  Not Sunday brunch when the restaurant is slammed. Half the restaurant was empty. I requested egg whites scrambled as I always do. And as usual they said they can't make special requests. I said I was allergic and the server said ""let me ask the kitchen"". Normally they come back and say ok since it's an allergy. But today, not so much. I asked to speak with the manager. Some flakey girl (Rachel I believe) with zero management skills comes to the table. Same convo. ""Let me ask the kitchen"". If you're the manager, shouldn't you be able to make the request and not simply ""ask""? Nope, kitchen said no because it will slow down service. Seriously? What kind of a restaurant would not accommodate a food allergy? And what kind of a manager needs to ask her staff and not make the decision herself. We left and went to Sweet Chick where they were more than happy to accommodate. Never again. Which is very disappointing. If you like pretentious restaurants with zero hospitality and care for their guests, then Mogador is your spot.",Wanted to try this place after seeing a show. We asked to look at a menu and then to sit outside. We were seated and brought water. The restaurant was pretty empty and the food that people receiving looked great. Multiple servers came to the tables next to us. We patiently waited for 25 minutes and no one ever came. A real mood killer.,"Everything is just so fresh and flavorful, really. I've been to the East Village original before years ago, but this outpost didn't fail to impress at the very least.The chicken tagine with dates was yum, but my praises are for everything else we had. The meze platter had great, fresh apps all around.Delicious, soft, warm pita. Good, spicy schug.","I have had my eye on Café Mogador for some time, and it was worth the wait.It is a charming space right in the heart of Williamsburg. The interior has Moroccan touches and is cozy and inviting.The food here is excellent. I went with a group and shared several plates. The hummus/falafel platter and babaganoosh are, unsurprisingly, delicious. We also had the roasted halumi cheese and a cauliflower appetizer that were pretty tasty.My favorite dish that I tried here was the Bastilla. It was prepared with a deliciously golden flaky crust and stuffed with perfectly seasoned shredded chicken. We also had a roasted chicken entree and whole fish which were pretty good, but I'd probably try something different next time.The service was great and the staff was very friendly. I definitely plan on returning for more delicious bites. The brunch menu, in particular, looks very enticing.","Where do I begin. Let me just relish on how amazing this place is. We came here over the weekend to what was the start to a fun filled night. I anticipated a wait time since it was pretty busy, but the hostess was able to get us seated in less than 5 mins. I made the safe bet with the granola bowl, Eggs Norwegian, and side of Canadian bacon. The wife had chicken with basmati rice, in addition, we added a Falafel with Tahini. Everything was fantastic! The waitress was very kind, and alert. She was definitely on her A game, since she had several tables in her jurisdiction and everything came out perfectly without any hitch. Also, the food wait time was at a minimal. I appreciated the chill vibes, as they are profound here, with Queen and the Bugees playing on the same playlist. I've noticed that we've been steering more and more away from the city as Bk and Queens have consistently produced some solid brunch spots. With quality places like a Cafe Mogador you can see why =).",Cafe Mogador
71,"Walked in here for the first time and the staff rocked it out.I can't wait to return Also, the decor is bomb! UPDATE: I came in to order food for takeout and had a margarita while waiting. Margarita was bomb but the food was a disappointment. I'll try again next time.","Walked in here for the first time and the staff rocked it out.I can't wait to return Also, the decor is bomb!",I wasn't overly impressed as every one else on Yelp. The food so so.  The service was quick.  The place was crowded and hot.  The first drink I ordered was terrible.  I had to order a different drink.  I honestly do not even remember what I ordered except for the queso fundido and I definitely have had better.  It was very oily.  I just was not impressed to go back.,"Came here for brunch , very cute setup , a lot of creative menu options , just wish they had more of a drink variety . The service was excellent and the food was delicious! Will definitely be coming back to try out more items","Chela is definitely a neighborhood favorite. For starters, they provide homemade chips and salsa that are amazing. The homemade tortilla chips are amazing. We also tries the cheese fundito which was on the happy hour menu. It was also tasty. We got the happy hour margarita pitcher and it was huge. More than enough for 3-4 people. For our mains we ordered tacos and the ribs. The tacos were so so but the ribs were incredibly tender and flavorful. The sauce on the ribs was great. The restaurant has a nice vibe and decor. They also have a backyard but we didn't check it out.  If you are looking for a trendy Mexican spot, definitely check out Chela!","A fantastic spot with excellent service, lovely ambiance and delicious, authentic Mexican food! A must try next time you're in Park Slope. I stopped by during happy hour and stuck mostly to their HH menu when ordering. (Why not take advantage of the deals, am I right?) I was happy to discover their happy hour menu was diverse with options for both food and drinks. To drink I had the red sangria to eat, the ""Cochinita Hoagie""  which was stacked with flavorful shredded pork and toppings. I was so impressed with their happy hour menu that I wanted to see what else they had to offer. I tried their ""Chicken Flautas"" and ""Esquite"" corn on the side. They were both phenomenal just like everything else at this spot. Can't wait to stop by again!",Chela Modern Mexican
72,Probably my own fault but the kimchi ramen was very whatever.  Not sure about this one at all. Sorry guys not your biggest fan or did I order the wrong dish. Place is nice though.,"Very underwhelmed, americanized/Asian fusion flavorsWhat we got:***Kale salad with fried sweet potato, golden raisins, and fried seaweed tempura? -really good, could eat a whole bowl to myselfRamen ughh starting off the bowl priced as $14 with no proteins , pricey We got the Miso As well as Sesame garlic ramen. Decent sizes, but both lacked that simmering for hours umami-ness, no depth of flavors.My sesame garlic ramen was not worth finishing.Bottom line: I'll come here if I just want salad","Service was excellent but quality of the food was average. Tried the pork buns, miso & soy ramen. Porks buns had a little much mayo for me and not enough meat. The miso broth was a little on the salty side and soy was okay but nothing special. I did enjoy their curly yellow noodle. They were cooked well and still had some bite.","Let's get right into it. Chuko's menu isn't exactly fun. You get 4 different ramen body options all with no meat or proteins involved but each a different broth so make sure to ask for a run down. If you want to add anything it's going to cost you. For 1 piece of pork 1.50 or ground pork or an egg, etc. It feels a lot like a cheap pay to play (expensive really) game. That being said plan to spend at least 20 to get what you'd expect from you average ramen bowl. One bonus is for the veggie lovers you have options as any bowl is Veg friendly from the start. Fortunately I got over it quickly and said fuggit I want me some ramen. I got the miso bowl with one piece of pork, ground pork, rayu garlic chili oil and a soy marinated egg. As you can see, yes I would like to add guac(if You missed this reference go ahead and skip this review). The broth was thicker and buttery which is exactly how I like it. The spice from the ground pork gave it a rich orange-reddish hue. I usually shy away from spice but as long as I'm spending I mind as well punish myself a little too. It's a solid medium broth, I've had heavier but the flavor is there. The noodles were thick and cooked perfectly. The corn was sweet and a great counter balance to the spice and saltiness of the broth and protein. The miso ramen comes with cabbage which in general I can do without in any ramen. They feel like large incongruent guests in the bowl. No flavor and awkward to bite into leave the greens for dinner with your parents. The ground pork was a mild spice at best(which I think is perfect). There was enough kick to let me know they play with fire but not enough to burn. The slab of pork was okay, not as soft and melting in your mouth and the taste was actually akin to what I grew up with. It was good but in my ramen I love feeling like it came right off the grill with the charred flavor of most ramen spots. Still I'd recommend it. Broth- 4 out of 5 noodles. Medium heaviness with your classic miso taste. Definitely will be back for more. The outfit- 3 out of 5 noodles. it's pretty to look at as I don't normally have orange ramen. The vibes- 4 out of 5 noodles. Cool, modern, minimal. The music was nothing to note. We got there right when it opened so it was quiet which gave it an intimate feel. Staff is friendly and smiling. However they did not have a happy hour, they should cuz it'll help me say fuggit add TWO eggs in this mutha. Overall I'm gonna give Chuko a 4 out of 5 dumplings because 1- the name. ""We're going to Chuko's tonight to get drunk on ramen."" That's fun to say. While the pricing feels like a bit much they make up for it with the vibe and taste. Staff is super friendly and more than happy to explain the menu to you which is better than most ramen spots in nyc. If you end up going say hi to Micky for me and tell them I sent you- trust me they'll have no idea what you're talking about.","I came on a weekday during the afternoon and there wasn't a line. I must have made it after the lunch and before the dinner rush. The ambience like everyone else is saying is very modern and slick. I ordered the the sesame garlic ramen which is the tonkotsu base ramen and the pork bun. The ramen broth was rich, but not too fatty; it was just right. The BIG disappointment with the broth was that it was TOO salty and this is coming from someone who loves his salt. I'm the type of guy who only uses salt with sesame oil as my condiment of choice when I'm eating korean bbq. The noodles was perfect and there was a lot of noodles! My only other disappointment is the price. I also agree with some yelpers. Maybe it's just New York, but $14 for just the base (noodles, broth and veggies) with $1.50 per topping is a bit much(especially 1.50 per slice of pork, but they are thick slices). The pork in the pork bun was cooked perfectly it was moist and juicy. Unlike other ramen places they don't sear or season the pork at all; it's very clean, a good cut of meat and well cooked. They let the pig do the talking.","nice place, loved the interior. Everyone was super friendly.Got the tots and ramen.Tots were different and def interesting dish but I wish there was more SAUCE it got a little dry towards the bottom so I was like meh.My thing with ramen is I love when its premade with toppings and i just ask for extra meat or whatever. Here basically you pick soup and then toppings which was meh for me. It was  tasty but I wasn't as amazed as I thought I would be given the raving reviews.",Chuko
73,"8:47pm- My boyfriend and I were starved so we decided to pop into Suede. I ordered the five spice curry goat and my boyfriend got the curry jumbo shrimp. My boyfriend didn't have much of an issue with his dish besides it being unseasoned but I mean how much can you mess up shrimp?.. My dish on the other hand, not only was it unseasoned and cold but there was a hair in my food. I literally spent $23 for a plate of vegetables, rice and bones... I'm literally still waiting for the curry goat meat. We both left still starved as when we came in. Oh and let me not forget our poorly made coconut rum punch. First off it was filled with some sort of canned curdle that I've never experienced having had several coconut rum punches in the past two of which were here. This was a total waste of time and money. I'm praying I don't wake up sick of food poisoning. Not sure if we'll be returning.11:15pm-So I'm just piggybacking off of my earlier review. At around 9:30ish I've been experiencing serious stomach pains, diarrhea and vomiting. Curry is definitely not a food to be played with, it has to be fresh. I can not believe that I got sick from this. Definitely unacceptable and will not be returning!","This was the only non-commercial restaurant I could find near me in Brooklyn with cushioned seating, nice ambiance/decor, and menu items we could all equally enjoy. Most restaurants have the gastropub/bar feel with the wooden tables/chairs so the dining experience isn't as comfortable or faux luxurious. Not so great for conversation (a bit loud - live dj). Service was TERRIBLE initially. We had a reservation and upon arrival we waited 10 mins for a table. The issues: 1.) There were 7 tables available. 2.) Hostess informed ""someone"" was adding a chair to suit our 3-person party and would escort us in a moment. 10 mins waiting, no one came. 3.) There were 8 staff members walking around without tasks who could quickly add a chair and escort us. 4.) I follow up with the hostess; she is short and gives attitude and proceeds to repeat that someone is coming. 5.) I seat myself and a waitress stops me and says ""You can't sit here, you have to wait for them to seat you."" I ask her can I add a chair and she repeats herself instead of asking for a manager or solving the problem. 6.) I find a manager as a last resort before they lose my business, she says hold on, and gets us seated without urgency which I don't like to tolerate in service industries. The food is good and they have a cute patio where a silent party was happening (which is cool) however no one was dancing so I would never go. We ordered: Fish and Chips (okay if you like bones in your fish and can handle eyes and tail). Jerk Salmon (amazing!) I'll give them one more try (on my birthday as I heard they give free meal on your birthday) because I love good food, nice ambiance, and great music. But if service is not better I WILL NOT RETURN OR RECOMMEND.","Very nice atmosphere and decor. Food is tasty but we waited quite a while to receive our order. Nothing offered while we waited. The portion size wasn't that great as we left still hungry.  I ordered the red snapper with veggies and rice and peas. My husband had the salmon, veggies,  rice and peas. Here is what our order  looked like.","My daughter took me here for mother's day yesterday. It was packed but we had a reservation and was seated within minutes. Our was server Rena was a delight, she was professional, attentive and super polite.The food as always was delicious! I had the salmon crab cake appetizer and the braised oxtail entree.The decor and ambiance of the restaurant it's very inviting.I can't wait for the weather to warm up to experience the patio.","For an upscale Caribbean dining experience in Brooklyn you must visit Suede!Great atmosphere, delicious food and great service.Appetizer sampler is amazing, the braised oxtails was finger licking good and the whole red snapper fried to perfection.","Review: Suede is a hop, skip and jump from my house.  I've been for dinner on several occasions, but this time I wanted to try their brunch.  On Saturdays, Suede has prefix brunch, which is a pretty awesome deal.  For the low price of  $19.95, You can get an appetizer, entree and in a mimosa.I called Morgan, and Shani to see if they would meet me for brunch at Suede, and they agreed.   After a few laughs, we all decided to order the prefix menu.  I ordered the traditional West Indian breakfast which included plantain,  boiled bananas, callaloo, ackee& saltfish,  with festival.   After the pictures were taken, we dug in!  When your brunch with the brunchnista, you have to dig deep for that patience.  Massive shout out and Bigups to all my friends who are so patient and supportive. They help me capture these images that I share with you on social media and my blog.  For the appetizers, we ordered a fruit plate and chicken wings.  The chicken wings came with a side of coleslaw salad, and a bakes aka (fried dumplings) the flavors were exciting, but the chicken wings were lukewarm and overcooked. As for the fruit,  I wanted better presentation maybe something in a banana leaf, coconut or pineapple to give it that tropical feel. But alas, it was just fruit on a plate.  You can't really mess up fruit, but the presentation is everything. I love Caribbean breakfast or brunch, but it's not usually offered in restaurants.  The best Caribbean food is traditionally served at your mother's or grandma's house. Very few restaurants attempt to execute these meticulously curated brunch dishes.  I was curious to see if Suede would rise to the occasion.  Upon arriving, my plate was a vision right out of Jamaica. If I closed my eyes, I could picture myself sitting on the beach in Montego Bay watching the waves crash against the shore with this plate in front of me.  The breakfast had staples of a Carribean breakfast,  but did the taste match the presentation? Sadly it did not,  the taste was below what I expected. I've come to expect rich Caribbean dishes filled with love and flavor to match, but this dish did not measure up.  The saltfish and bake and shrimp and grits were okay but when you have eaten at a real Caribbean table it's hard to measure up, but I do give Suede and ""A"" for effort.The service at suede was slow but cordial they accommodated my request to be seated near a window to take better pictures of my food. I always appreciate when restaurants assist the Brunchnistas twirl.  Where Suede really excels is with drinks.  The mimosas were terrific, and we had one too many. When your brunch starts with tropically flavored mimosas such as Guava, Sorrel, Mango or Passionfruit brunch is going to be good no matter what! If I were to choose between brunch and dinner at Suede, I would go with dinner. Caribbean restaurants are not known for brunch, but Suede comes close.  Suede is a good spot for someone who is new to the Caribbean scene and would like to get a taste of what the islands offer for Breakfast/Brunch. Have you been to Suede?",Suede
74,Service was polite but the food was awful. I tried the gnocchi and it was the worst i have ever had. It was so much tomato sauce it was basically soup.,This place is overrated. The reviews on here do not reflect the food.I ordered an anchovy pizza an it was rather pathetic. Not only looked like a child tossed and shaped it but it was unfinished; by unfinished I mean they gave me the mozzarella on the side for me to finish the baking process at home?! Unheard of. I paid over $20 for a poorly made pizza.Honestly there are superior places that leave the snobbery aside and deliver quality and taste for about the same amount of money.,"You ever had food so bad that you have to post a review on yelp, google, AND Seamless?! Well this restaurant provided such food! I ordered the margarita pizza which is supposed to have mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. I got NONE of the above! They just threw some basil on top, not even baking it with the pizza?!?",Very good pizza and great service! We loved it! We had several different pizzas and drinks and doggie bags to go.,Very good pizza and great service! We loved it! We had several different pizzas and drinks and doggie bags to go!,"Came here for a birthday and it's a true gem in Crown Heights! Most of the food and drinks were good. I got the gnocchi which is made of semolina and definitely tasted different than traditional gnocchi. It was almost like a lasagna or casserole type of dish. I actually enjoyed it and cleared off my plate. I would recommend it to those who are open to trying something new! For dessert, we got both the pistachio cake and panna cotta. The cake came with ice cream and it was a pretty good combo. The panna cotta was sweet and smooth. They have some cool looking drinks which have unique tastes. I'd definitely recommend a spritz!",Camillo
75,Just as good as the Bed-Stuy original only with more tables and space.  Less chicken centric at this location but still as flavorful with the seafood offerings.,"It is so unfortunate that I have to write this review, considering that I have been a loyal customer of this restaurant for a while now. There was a fly in my cranberry juice, and when we asked for the manager, he was completely unapologetic. The fly was bad enough, but the total disregard for an unacceptable mistake added insult to injury.",Food is pretty good  especially the fish sandwich however they need to pay more attention to customers and details. For example after my 8th visit  the service has been consistently bad.  Staff does not pay attention or understand how to earn that 20%. They know nothing about choreography. Its simply a case of disorganized confusion!!!! Staff need a refresher course on how to wait tables period!!!!!,"Listen... get ready for a party in your mouth!!!One Friday I was craving seafood.  Wanting to try something new and not go to my go to spot, I came to my favorite app (Yelp!!!) and searched for seafood in Brooklyn.  As I sat and looked through all of the menus and pics, there was something about Peaches that stood out to me... probably the price. lol. Significantly cheaper than all of the other places I was looking at.From the photos, I already had my mind set on the Jim Cade boil.  As soon as I walked in, I noticed some folks at a different table had it.  And they were sharing it!  The pictures don't do it justice. It's large enough to share with one other person.  So my meal was even cheaper than I had anticipated.  3 large crab clusters, about 10-12 shrimp, an abundance of mussels, corn and potatoes (which we didn't even finish).Happy hour until 7, I believe.Can't wait to return.","Whiting sandwich was delicious ! Definitely brought back memories of Long Island Summers. Crispy and flakey white fish with enough pieces to take one off and save for later (if you can control yourself lol). The blue crab pasta was another star of the night. Crab cake sandwich fell a bit short, not much lump crab meat. We has called about 20 min prior to showing up on Saturday night around 10pm. Our table was waiting for us and we ended up closing the place! A great seafood option in  Bed-stuy.","My coworkers and I took our supervisor here for her birthday celebration on a Friday evening. We made reservations and I have to say the young lady who placed them was kind and full of information ! When we arrived the restaurant was fairly empty, we had to wait a while for a few late comers in our party so we did have a bit of a wait but we were seated while waiting. I was thirsty and decided to pour some water from the reused bottle placed on our table. As I'm pouring what looked like a black/gray dust particle came out the bottle. Now this wasn't a small piece of dust but a good size which led me to believe they don't wash their bottles and that the water was sitting out in the open. We let the waitress know and she apologized and removed the bottle. Most of the bottles on our table weren't clear and after the dust incident I refused to drink their water. I ordered the pineapple juice but wasn't impressed it tasted like regular can Dole. Also the water was room temperature slightly annoying but moving on. Most of our party arrives and we order our food I had the lobster roll with bacon, I believe avocado and tomato. It was good but the bread could not hold the sandwich and the bottom part of the bun was soggy. The French fries were also lukewarm which led be to believe they may have been sitting there a bit. Overall it was cool though.  My supervisor ordered a shrimp boil and as she was eating she realized they didn't devein the shrimp now I am aware everyone prepares their food differently but this was a surprise. When we questioned the waitress about it she seemed confused and nonchalantly stated that this was normal and that's how they prepared their shrimp. Gross if you ask me but I wasn't the one eating it. It was also in the fried shrimp. Overall I am definitely not coming back here the dust in the water and unclean shrimp makes me question them as a whole. On a positive note if you are celebrating a birthday you are allowed to bring a cake or cupcakes and they provide all the plates and cutlery.",Peaches Shrimp and Crab
76,We went here for brunch. The food was ok. We thought the portions were on the smaller size.,1. Arrived 6:40 asked for happy hour menu and was told it was ending in a FEW MINUTES... did he mean 20 mins?? ‍2. Ordered 2 beers ... they were hot3. Happy hour menu posted outside said empanadas were $1.50 4pm-7pm.. but got charged $8 for 2. 4. Ordered fish empanadas and those were good5. Cash only ‍,"Beware price-gouging.I'd gone to PV several times and had good experiences before recommending it to a friend for his birthday party. Fourteen of us were scheduled for dinner on a Wednesday night. A few hours beforehand, Maritza, the manager and/or owner (not sure), told my friend that we would have to purchase a prix fixe. There is no prix fixe on the menu or website; no indication that large groups are subject to a different arrangement. My friend, who'd never been there and wasn't familiar with the menu, assumed that this was normal and that we could also order à la carte. The price Maritza quoted him was $38--a shocking sum, given that the most extravagant combo of appetizer, entrée, and dessert is $26 at most. We tried to order off the menu; no, we were told. When the bill came, it was astronomically high, given PV's prices. I asked the waiter and manager on site what happened; $38 per person, they said. I presented them with my common-sense calculation. They sheepishly admitted that the price was unethically inflated, but said they had no power to fix it. They offered glasses of ""free"" house wine as recompense. I later emailed Maritza. She would not address my allegation of price-gouging. I filed a complaint with the consumer-affairs department.","This is in my ""hidden gem"" category of Brooklyn restaurants. You can find a lot of great Dominican comfort food here with recipes that you can't find in other Caribbean restaurants. This makes the place great for a Dominican brunch.One thing to note about Puerto Viejo is it takes a lot of pride in their hot sauce. In fact occasionally they will setup stalls in food festivals promoting their sauce and selling it. It's actually through one of these stalls I found about this place. The sauce itself is fairly a fairly good scotch bonnet sauce and they give you it when your food comes out. Though its a Caribbean sauce its quite hot so be warned!Not only is their sauce good but Puerto Viejo also has great Dominican food. The first time I was here was for their brunch when I had one of their mangú dishes and their oatmeal drink. I never had either of these but I loved them. I love plantains in general so I like that it is staple to a lot of the food here. When I was here with friends I also had the Ox Tail Stew which was fantastic. I think everyone at our table enjoyed their food a lot.The interior of Puerto Viejo is quite interesting and gives off a rustic Caribbean beach shack vibe. You will see barrels holding up furniture, walls made of both wood and metal sheets, and wooden chairs/tables. They claim that the furniture is recycled from local industries or something. It is quite memorable and I would argue makes the restaurant feel more laid-back. Puerto Viejo is ""the bomb"" as one of my Caribbean friends said about the place. The only real complaint I have about this place is that they don't take credit card but cash only.","Amazing food! I ordered chicken mofongo which was great, but next time I'll definitely get the steak. Everyone else I was with got the churrasco and that was phenomenal! If I were judging this place by the mofongo alone, I'd probably give it four stars, but the steak took it to another level. We also had the empanadas (chicken and beef, I believe),  bacalaitos (fish cakes), and red sangria. All of which were great!","As a Dominican person, it pains me to write a review of a Dominican restaurant that is lukewarm, because our country's food is so delicious and flavorful and usually doesn't lend itself to a 2 star review (I actually want to give 2.5 stars, but that's not possible on Yelp).I've come here on three occasions and have tried different things, trying my hardest to like the restaurant more than I do, but alas some things just can't be forced. There are a few things that this restaurant does right, like the pastel en hoja, shrimp empanada (do not order the chicken empanada... it's not good), and the red beans, but that is not enough to carry a meal out of subpar status. There are just too many things that Puerto Viejo does wrong (and must be fixed) before I can feel comfortable giving a higher rating and recommending this place... I will elaborate below:For starters, PLEASE change up the recipe for your jugo natural (especially the chinola and Tamarindo ones). I love jugo de chinola and jugo de tamarindo, but the juice at Puerto Viejo tastes like chemicals.... there is NO WAY this juice can accurately be labeled as ""natural"" fruit juice- it's gross.Secondly, the rabo guisado (oxtail dish) needs some serious work. The way Dominicans usually make rabo is ""encendio,"" but the oxtail dish at this restaurant definitely lacks a lot of flavor. It tastes like the meat was boiled for a few hours and served. Not a hint or whisper of seasoning to be found.Lastly, if you're going to call something a ""chimi burger"" make sure it is actually a Dominican Chimi and not a regular hamburger. I was extremely disappointed when I ordered this dish the first time I came here and realized that it was not a chimi. Those are just a few suggestions on how this place can make amends. I really want to love Puerto Viejo, but until they switch things up I won't come back.",Puerto Viejo
77,This place was right down the street from my apt and it is to die for. Food was so tasty and so affordable. Wish I had more seating inside though!,Understood why it was 5 stars when i had their jerk chicken. Normally i don't really write reviews but this one deserve legit 5 stars,This place is the f*&!!king bomb. Jerk chicken is off the chain. Staff very hospitable.,"My boyfriend and I found this gem in Brooklyn that had some darn good soul food. We both had ribs, but he had the BBQ ribs which were perfectly cooked.  I had the jerk ribs, they had a good kick to it. They ran out of the Mac and cheese (since it's so popular), but we had some candied yams and veggies. (JUST AS GOOD) We will definitely be back for some Mac and cheese","It's been FOREVER since I've been to a soul food spot in Brooklyn And was like ""this is it""Came here 12 on the dot (as soon as they opened) and had a fried fish meal with two sides. Yams and Mac and cheese cause that's what true southerners eat! Fish was fresh out some piping hot oil. Wait, let me back up. The CORNBREAD! Chile! So good I asked for two (and I'm supposed to stay away from carbs but mind y'all business). Fast forward. So I received my meal. My biggest critique with yams is 1 of 2 things 1) they're not sweet enough 2) they're two sweet. I know, very thin line. But when you know, you know. They're yams are PERFECT! The Mac and cheese is real ""my grand momma said dinner ready"" Mac and cheese. The fish is fried like your classic black folk fish fry in the south. OHHHHHHHHH and they had kool aid y'all! Listen, I don't indulge like this normally. Maybe twice a year. I gotta keep telling myself ""girl don't go back before you start rolling down the street instead of walking"". The kool aid was black folk kool aid forreal. Not too sugary either. JUST RIGHT. I'm assuming they're family owned but they're a cool staff. That food though? A1. And now I know why they have a perfect 5 star rating on yelp.  Like I always say, I love when Yelp doesn't disappoint. Y'all were spot on with this spot man!","Yesterday, I and some of my family members went to this great restaurant in Brooklyn called A Taste of Heaven, which I found by simply googling ""soul food restaurants in Brooklyn"". The restaurant sits on a quaint block in Williamsburg. Upon us entering, we were greeted with a warm and friendly ""hello"" and shown the variety of foodchoices.There is SO MUCH to choose from, over here! I had the Rosemary Chicken with macaroni and peas and rice as my two sides, and my cousin had the Ox Tails with the peas & rice and macaroni as his two sides. I forgot what my uncle had, but it was obviously delicious, as he scraped is dish clean. The proprietors, Melody, Tony, as well as Tyrone and the rest of the amazing staff treat you as if you are family and truly made the trip to the restaurant worthwhile (mind you, I live nowhere near it). If you have time, this is a hiddengem that needs to be checked out! It is SO worth the trip to Brooklyn. Also, a block away, they have some of the most beautiful murals I've seen.",Taste of Heaven
78,"Food is great but the waiter German was really unpleasant and rude. Just had a scowl on his face the whole time and acted like everything we asked for was an inconvenience. If they replace him or give him some customer service training, I'd give the restaurant a higher rating as the food really was delicious!",Not impressed by the food. The past was extremely salty and had more ham than pasta. I removed the ham and literally had a handful of pasta left. Was disappointed when I showed up and saw a B rating. Came here for Mother's Day weekend and I'll be taking my mother somewhere else to make up for this meal. I felt rushed it was loud.  1Star for the manager giving me a refund on my meal. I honestly think everyone drinks so much first that they don't taste how salty the food is. I already told 3 ppl I know not to come here.,"Oh Scottadito, what happened to you?!?!? My fiancé, our friends and I went there couple years ago and it was amazing!! Seriously so amazing we were dreaming of going back and fill up our bellies.This time we wanted to go there again but unfortunately everything was so bad, that we ended up leaving almost everything on our plates! The waiter was nice to us and took off a few items himself. Food was very blend, over cooked pasta and very soggy chicken parmigiana with very bland sauce. Almost $200 for 3 people, sad faces and empty stomachs after the meal :( We will definitely not be coming back! One of the worst dining experiences of my life... simply stunned how bad it has gotten.",One of the best Italian food I have tried in Brooklyn! They always have different vegan options too.,"Came here for brunch for a birthday. Seeing as how brunch is my favorite meal of the week, I've got a lot of experience to compare this place to. The interior is beautiful and spacious. Some brunch restaurants have layouts where you sit on top of the next table and this place wasn't like that. It's spacious and rustic, which explains all the weddings that take place here.We had a party of 10 for a birthday brunch and the food was delicious, medium portions. I particularly enjoyed the steak and eggs because it was done exactly how I asked for it (many places don't understand what medium well is and cook it just medium or just well). The menu has much to choose from as well to accommodate various diets. Our only issue was that the service was lagging even though it wasn't busy. The waiter was constantly chattering away with his friend but not providing service. We even told him our friend would be 30 minutes late and he said that's fine, our friend can still join in on bottomless brunch. When our friend arrived, he poured his drink and then stated my friend has 30 minutes only since our group had 30 minutes (which he did not explain before, so our friend paid $20 extra for 1 drink due to lagging service of refills on mimosas)..... all around didn't make sense. Either ways, maybe go with smaller groups next time and enjoy the delish meals!","Fun bottomless brunch place in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Being from the Bay Area, I'm still used to my early brunch times - we arrived at around 11:15am and there were plenty of seats. They also allow reservations here, so I would make one just in case.$24.95 for entree AND bottomless brunch is a great deal in New York. Granted it's not in Manhattan, but this area is nice and even a good deal in general imo. All the food was very tasty - I had an Eggs Benedict (Florentine) which was very standard. My friend's chocolate chip pancakes had a lot of chocolate chips (yum!) and the pasta dish was great too. Now for the bottomless part - it's great, they actually make sure that your glass is never empty - the servers were super on point. They were nice and friendly too. We spent around 90mins here so it was a great time to just chill and catchup.Overall, great place for brunch, check this place out! :)",Scottadito Osteria Toscana
79,My boyfriend and I went to DeStefanos with a groupon for brunch. He ordered the steak and eggs and I ordered the French Toast with berry compote and a cannoli-cream topping. The food was excellent. The only negative thing I could say is that there was very little steak with the steak and eggs but the groupon deal made the meal worth it overall.,Had brunch steak and had to order another because the steak was so damn good. Juicy fatty and just right amount of saltiness. Perfect brunch experiece. Took out 1 star bc of the interior which I wasnt too fond of. It is just personal preference.,"One of my least favorite steakhouse in NYC. My friends and I came here awhile back on a Saturday night for a spontaneous dinner. The only reason we went here was because of the availability during prime time, otherwise we would've went to another steakhouse if we had time to make reservations. The bacon was good and crispy. The steak was a little dry and chewy, even though we asked for medium rare. They had different steak sauces, and their signature one was meh. I mixed it with another sauce and it tasked better.One thing that made this experience very below mediocre is their knives. It's steakhouse and you should expect sharp steak knives! Instead we got knives that resembled butter knives. It was not sharp. We also suspect the waiter overheard our dissatisfaction and scratched my boyfriend's card on purpose. After this night, he was not able to use his card again because it was damaged.","My husband and I love going to DeStefano's for birthdays! The food is on par with all of the big steakhouses, but it is so much easier to get a reservation here. The steaks - done to perfection! The sides - the bacon is a must!! The desserts - go for the creme brulee cheesecake!! If you happen to be in NYC and are trying to get into Peter Lugers - just go here instead, it wont disappoint.","My fiancée and I came for a celebration dinner. We ordered a half bottle of a Pinot noir to share for the dinner. We started with the burrata caprese . The balsamic vinaigrette on the dish was delicious. I was sure to dip the bread and to scrap off every last bit of vinaigrette.For our main course, we stared the porterhouse cooked medium rare with sides of mashed potatoes and creamer spinach. Their steak preparation is different in that there was a black pepper crust. The service was attentive, helpful, and wonderfully friendly. All the other parties in the room were celebrating birthdays so it seems like DeStefano's is the spot for celebrations!","Review is for the veal and the ribeye.Wow.The veal was very lean, which isn't my favorite, but I didn't order it - my wife did. Anyway, be forewarned. The sauce is incredible though.The ribeye was phenomenal. Herbaceous sauce and oil was fantastic, and the cook was insane.Uh... what else to say? After eating at DeStefano's I've removed all steakhouse bookmarks from my Yelp except Keens, which I haven't tried.",DeStefano's Steakhouse
80,"1st of all, the staff is incredibly friendly here! The first time I visited I LOVED my chicken burrito, although my friend said hers was dry and bland. It was the end of a night out, so I wasn't attached to either of our opinions.I tried again 2 weeks ago with a shrimp burrito and it was terribly dry! 3 of us ordered, and we all agreed it was hard to eat. I may try again in the future, but for now they'll be on my list to avoid. Sadly!","Would have given zero stars if I could. They've delivered my order to the wrong person then tried to get me to pay for it still, completely no-showed with no explanation, and most recently.... I ordered through post mates, the restaurant forgot to pack half of my order, then wouldn't re-deliver what was missing.Too bad because the food is almost decent, but they're incompetent to the highest degree.","I used to love this restaurant, best tostadas I have ever had. However, I got food poisoning the last two times I ate here. Unfortunately have to write this negative review. Both my friends and I have gotten sick on separate occasions.","Came here on a Monday night with a six pack of Negra Modelo and a boyfriend. It's an easy place to miss because it's so small, but it's a legit, family run, no frills, hole in the wall.We got the chips and salsa to start, which are homemade and solid, could eat those forever. Then the veggie empanadas, which are filled with some kind of deliciously caramelized onions and soft buttery potato filling. They were misshapen and totally hand made. Ugh, my mouth is watering just thinking about them again.The boyfriend got the chicken burrito with mole because he loves mole (and he's right to). The sauce has a lot of care put into it and you can taste that; he was very happy. I was kind of full by then so I only ordered two tacos, the fish and shrimp ones, both solid and flavorful, served with limes and radish slices. The total came out to 36 dollars and we had leftovers to go. The service was fast and so friendly. Grateful the boyfriend lives so close, this is gonna be our weekly spot for sure.","Authentic, delicious, affordable Mexican food. Pleasant service. Small section to eat in. Otherwise, delivery or takeout works well. We usually call the restaurant directly to order delivery after reading about how delivery apps charge businesses fees and sometimes don't pay the delivery people well.","I went here very hungry after riding on a bike and walking around a museum with my guy, who is pretty particular about his Mexican food and also ravenous. We ordered the vegetable empanadas, he the chicken mole burrito, I ordered the grilled tilapia burrito and one queso tamale. First the cons: I would not recommend this place if you don't eat meat because we were both pretty sure the vegetable empanadas contained chicken or some kind of meat. I'm a pescatarian and I make exceptions for pork or beef on rare occasions, but I haven't eaten chicken in several years. Needless to say, I was lucky my stomach didn't object because.....I don't think there is a public bathroom and we had to get back to Queens on our bikes. The pros: Despite feeling duped, the empanadas were ~*delicious*~ -- the shells were crispy and buttery, the contents moist and savory. I really really loved the grilled tilapia burrito; it was so tasty, I'm still thinking about it two days later. Their green sauce went on every bite. The chips with guac that came with my guy's burrito were fresh and crispy. The queso tamale was also insanely good although overkill for our bellies, but no regrets. Overall, this place feels like you're entering a welcoming room off your grandma's kitchen and the food is heart-warming -- perfect for a foodie adventure and I'm jealous I don't live closer. Gunna have to explore Corona next.... ;)",Taqueria Milear
81,"I read some reviews for Greedi Vegan that criticized the lack of speedy service, but didn't think it would be an issue since there weren't that many. My boyfriend and I were starving and in the mood for some brunch, so we decided to give this establishment a shot. Unfortunately, we received our food around an hour later and apparently, were lucky to even do so (they cancelled some orders due to running out of ingredients).To put this in perspective, we put in the order around 12:10pm on a Sunday and received the food around 1:00--their brunch isn't slated to end until 2pm. Around 20-30 minutes into waiting, my boyfriend asked how much longer it would take and the answer was an unhelpful ""not sure"". And those weren't even the only issues with our visit.We were initially mischarged for our order. What should have been $24 total ($12 for the cheese grits and greens and $12 for the French toast) ended up being a charge of $26. They did refund us the extra $2 after we pointed it out.The last straw was basically that after we got back to our apartment (we ordered takeout after seeing how crowded it was, hoping it would alleviate the wait) and actually seeing the food. First of all, the orders were tiny. In addition, I was under the impression that the French toast came with caramelized pears, but there were only a few berries on top. My boyfriend actually returned to ask and was told that it was pears OR mixed berries and that we had to specify upon ordering. That's fine, but if that is the case, I feel like the person taking our order should have asked.In short, we are still hungry and wasted around an hour waiting for food that ultimately didn't feel like it was worth the wait. The experience wasn't particularly pleasant either. I can think of a ton of other things I would have rather have been doing, so I can't say I will be back.","Ordered the soul bowl, veggie bowl, yucca fries, & hibiscus lemonade. All were amazing. Particularly partial to the soul bowl, but it's the only one I tried.  First time here, but it won't be the last. LA needs a location too.","The staff was very kind and helpful, but the food was a huge disappointment and gave both me and my boyfriend an upset stomach! The mac and cheese was not good- soggy (like way overcooked rice pasta that turns to mush), and the cheese had no flavor. Did not satisfy the craving for comfort food. The plantain was just ok. This place is exactly the reason to stay away from these types of casual vegan spots- because they don't make the effort to source good ingredients and put together thoughtful dishes.",Amazing fresh and delicious vegan food. Amazing staff.  Would recommend anyone -- with any diet-- check out this spot. The atmosphere also so cute and warm.Definitely will be visiting the next time I'm in BK.,"I had the crab cake sliders and my friend had the nachos. The food was tasty. Great flavor and not your ordinary vegan dish. The 3-star rating is because the one girl who was preparing the food was in a mood, standoffish and just plain old rude. We were sitting at the counter to eat which is practically IN the kitchen where the food is prepared. The least she could have done was have a pleasant look on her face instead of that attitude. She was even further annoyed when people were ordering items they didn't have the ingredients for. They ended up closing early that night. Guess they ran out of food. At least I got to try the crab cake sliders while I was passing through.","This place probably doesn't need another great review to encourage you to go at this point but I had to share. Although a really really cozy location (if you've ever tried looking for an apartment in NY you know what ""cozy"" means lol) BUT I still always eat in when I come. Small space packed w flavor, & not just in the food. Head bobbing music (love me some soul, R&b Erykah Badu vibes) but also the space has a good ""feel"" to it. No negative energy in the air I am solely writing this review for the woman that was working yesterday though. As I was waiting for my date to arrive (dk why I was early to begin w) I watched her gracefully (and without a second of panic in her) carry out orders. There were probably three - four rushes (including ubereats deliveries) and she did not break a sweat, remained calm and sweet!The food was impeccable!! (Tasted amazing!!! Can't stress that enough. ) !  I snapped some pictures but forgot to save them   but this woman was divine! And def added to the feelsI really really really wish I got her name- I did overhear her saying that wasn't her home store so she's probably employed at the Ralph ave one which I have yet to visit. But I hope that the owner sees this and she gets some gratification or maybe a raise! She def seems like she deserves one. (I was there around 1pm) Why four instead of five? Well like I said the place is pretty cozy, the chairs are pretty high stools (I'm 4""11) & there was a wait time. But it was clear why.",Greedi Vegan
82,"I searched restaurants for GF offerings.  This cafe came up.  Their menu is full of interesting sandwiches, but no gf bread!  I had two choices: quinoa and rice bowl or arugula salad with Green beans and asparagus. One is the worst salads.  The asparagus was mostly made of the parts I throw out because they are tough and chewy.  My husbands brisket sandwich was good but short on the beef.","One of the worst lunch experiences I've had possibly ever! $15 for a mayonnaise drenched MESS (aka. the Rotisserie chicken sandwich) was frankly a joke and I couldn't even eat it. If you're going to charge Manhattan prices the product should be of Manhattan quality!In addition the service was mediocre at best and at worst very, very unprofessional. Six staff members crowding around the Ipad register at the same time while customers are waiting in line? Are you serious? To top it all off the music and atmosphere was just bizarre - as in RAVE music at two in the afternoon. Why? One would clearly need to be impaired or otherwise inebriated to enjoy the vibe the staff is going for. Being in the service industry myself there were red flags every, but despite all this I still went out of my way to leave a generous tip. Sad that this place is branded as one of the only ""decent"" places near the Brooklyn Museum because it leaves A LOT to be desired.",Had chili pepper on it when it wasn't mentioned. Could not eat it.,"I've stopped in at this place several times in the past, and is is always PACKED with laptop sardines.  THIS time, it was only 80% packed, and there was a quiet table available in the corner, so I decided to stay.I ordered a terrific iced coffee from a super duper barista and rested at that table.  Wonderful!",Lincoln Station is okay. Nothing I've eaten here has been bad but I don't think anything I've had has really wowed me either. I've had a couple of the sandwiches and soup here before but nothing stood out. I do like that they have draft kombucha and it's also always busy with people working on their laptops so could be a nice place to work or meet other professionals.,"Gee, all my favorite people are from Brooklyn, y'know what I mean...Sandy Koufax, Mary Tyler Moore, The Notorious BIG, The Notorious RBG, Rita Hayworth, Bernie Sanders, Judge Judy, Eddie Murphy, Mel Brooks, identical cousins Patty & Cathy Lane rockin' in Brooklyn Heights, and of course, Barbra...and if I was living and breathing Brooklyn, I think I'd come here often. I only discovered this convivial cafe by accident when I was waiting to meet my friend Carlos at the Brooklyn Museum. I was almost an hour early coming from Lower Manhattan on the 2, so of course, I looked on the Yelp app.My objective was to find a quality cup of coffee nearby as it was getting colder than a witch's tit. I found Lincoln Station just a couple of blocks away, and it was certainly abuzz with activity as most of the seats were occupied, especially around the central communal table (photo: bit.ly/2UTB6TF). They appear to specialize in comfort food from pulled pork sandwiches to rotisserie chicken. But I was on a clock, so I got me a $2.75 Americano to go (photo: bit.ly/2SIyElA). It was a soothing brew made with premium La Colombe beans. I'm sure I'll make it back to Prospect Heights some day soon when the weather is better, and here I'll be.COFFEE - 4 stars...smooth caffeine on a high chill morningAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...busy but manageable SERVICE - 4 stars...friendly Brooklynites in hereTOTAL - 4 stars...I wasn't born in Brooklyn but I could passRELATED - Looking for dining options in Brooklyn?

83,"Excellent food but if you sit near the door, you will freeze. They need to put a curtain or a winter door around the permanent door.","Food is good; great for the price. 5 stars? Not exactly. I've eaten here twice. They have got to figure out their reservation system. I came here on a Friday night. A couple entered just before us and was seated at a table next to the door (probably the worst table in the house) because they didn't have reservations; meanwhile, the rest of the restaurant was relatively empty. They asked to be seated at a different, empty table and were told that that table was being saved for someone else. Most of the tables were empty in the restaurant at this time. I also did not have a reservation and was told that me and my companion could eat but that we would be forced to leave our table in 40 minutes to make way for other people. I couldn't believe that a host would say that to us. I eat out a lot and have never experienced that. I very quickly got a ""we're doing you a favor by letting you eat here"" vibe. This was handled poorly by the hostess. There are subtle ways to clear a table of patrons - telling patrons up front they'll be kicked out sucks. If I were on a first date or business dinner, I would have been beyond embarrassed. We ate quickly and left. The table the couple asked for when I walked in was still empty as I was leaving.",Very hip place in Bushwick. Presentation is very cool. Price is very reasonable. BUT the pasta is super plain. Very disappointed. No alcohols so bring your own bottle if you need!,"Food that looks good AND tastes good?? Now that's a rare find! I'm so glad we stumbled upon this place while in the neighborhood; we ordered some pastas off their brunch menu and oooo they are gooood. I got the squid ink fettucine and hubs got the papardelle amatriciana. Lookat that plate of squid ink, it is beyoootiful! So many flavors and textures in this dish and they all melded beautifully. We appreciated that they dont skimp on the ingredients either. Space is small and intimate and service was cordial. Definitely worth coming back to if we're in the area again!","This place is definitely a hidden gem. The restaurant is small and intimate and really great when not overly busy. The staff was friendly and accommodating. I had brought a bottle of wine, and they were kind enough to place it in the fridge for us to keep cool and brought it out to refill our glass as we drank away. I didn't forget about the food. SO GOOD. My friend got the wild boar Cavatelli and I got the squid ink pappardelle and the beef tartare to share. Beef tartare:Really good. If you're not a fan of tomatoes, you may not like this dish. It has a tomato-y base to it which I personally loved. Wild boar cavatelli:Flavorful with a kick. Oh man, oh man, this pasta dish took me by surprise in a good way. Those Calabrian chilis!!!! I love them so much! They are what Tabasco should taste like. Squid ink pappardelle:Well portioned ratio between the pasta and shrimp. The spring onions helped elevated the dish. A very good/light summery pasta dish.",You can't possibly be disappointed eating here if creative creations of Italian food is your craving. Come early to beat waits and crowds but if you have trouble getting in it's more than worth the wait...grab a tiki drink at Dromedary Bar and be patient! Had the grilled octopus salad...cooked perfectly with great simple seasoning. The carbonara ...how DO they get the asparagus so perfect??! My husband got the special of the day lobster pasta...early in the evening he got the last one so know specials sell quickly. I am someone that wasn't sure about a raw egg in my carbonara but it made it rich without being overwhelming or heavy.,Nicandra's
84,"$32 for a good Japanese breakfast.  $32!!!!!! And I had the Spanish mackerel, which costs less than $10/lb, probably $5-6. So for $32 I got a 4 oz piece of mackerel, a miso soup, rice and a few veggies. A meal that at the same restaurant cost $12 four years ago. It's obscene. I will never go back there again. And anyone that is willing to pay $32 for that breakfast is part of the problem. Gentrification on steroids. A price that only 20% of the neighborhood could even consider.","I want okonomi for breakfast everyday. I think that pretty much sums it up. Other minor details include limited seating, being a bit out of the way in terms of location. And if you're not a fan of rice, seafood and veggies , you probably won't like it too much. I appreciate that the flavors of the food come from the ingredients it self.","This place is apparently one of the famous restaurant all Korean celebrities go to when they come to New York, so my sister and I decided to check this place out. The food was delicately prepared and the server was great in striking up a conversation with us. The place was smaller than what I thought it would be, but it didn't matter. The food portion, when you look at it first, it's not that much. But when you start eating it, you'll realize that it is plenty for a women. I'm not sure about a man.","OKONOMI serves the perfect breakfast.The rice is slightly nutty, every individual grain is cooked to chewy perfection, and the grains stick together just enough to be edible with chopsticks. The bowl is remarkably consistent throughout, with no overcooked or undercooked spots. Mix the onsen egg in for a slightly richer, creamy blend.The rest of the breakfast consists of a slice of fish and a variety of little sides. Each side, from the sweet, light tamago to the greens with mayo and pepper, is a delightful little world of flavor. Both the striped bass and the mackerel are tender and flaky with a subtle marinade and crispy skin.","Honestly, I was disappointed.After an hour wait to get in (they're walk-in only) we were given mostly cold/lukewarm food. Our rice was cold, the egg to put into the rice was cold, and the only thing hot was the soup.The fish was good, but not great. It just tasted like salty fish. No amazing flakiness or special preparation, just lukewarm fish.Did everything taste good? I guess. Was the experience at all what I expected out of a breakfast-warm, filling, tasteful?No. I was really disappointed to wait an hour just to have incredibly bland, cold food. Maybe we just came on an off day but man, for $32 a person I was pretty sad.","Okonomi serves great Japanese breakfast at an expensive price tag. The place has 2 tables for 8 and counter for 4. The place is relatively small, and waiting in line is almost always required (no reservation). Our wait was around 30 minutes. Parking was easy to find on weekend noon.Okonomi serves the traditional Japanese breakfast with two add on options: ikura $6 and poached egg $2.5. The set itself is $32 with a selection between bluefish and swordfish grilled with miso paste. The set also came with a bowl of rice, miso soup, grilled eggplant, corn salad, marinated vege and beans with mustard paste. Although I liked the swordfish over the bluefish, both fish were extremely tender, you will not be disappointed by the flavor, gotta love that miso.We also liked the tamago and eggplant. The tamago was very sweet. Overall the assortment was great seasonal selections. At the price tag, we were very surprised about the portion, yes, very light. Everything was lightly seasoned and cooked, and the poached egg went extremely well with the rice. No doubt the quality of food lived up the standard, but the portion (or price) did not. No tip required, service was great and on par. I would consider it a one time try, no need to return often. Came in with high expectation looking at all the great reviews, results came in lower.food 3.5/5value 2/5ambiance 4/5service 3.5/5",Okonomi
85,Not impressed. First the wait was longer than we were told and the first table was right in front of the toilet. You can actually see the toilet seat and you have people lining up right behind you. After we changed tables it took another 15min until someone took our order and then around 30min for the food to come out. The food is good if you can deal with all of the above.,I had the beef shawarma. It lacked flavor and wasn't that great. I wish they had a side of yogurt or sauce to make it less dry. What I did like was their home made harissa.,"Atmosphere is great, service is good but the food is really bad. it pains me to give a bad review because I love Mediterranean food.Listen, I lived in the Middle East for 5 years and traveled all over including Africa, Greece etc and never in my life  I ate such a bitter and crappy Humus and a horrendous Shawarma like in this place.For appetizers we asked for the flat bread which was ok, the humus Plate (terrible) and a salad which was good. Main entree we got the Shinitzel with mash potatoes and the lamb Shawarma.The mash was tasteless but shinitzel was pretty good. I have no words for their version of  Shawarma. I get that this neighborhood is yuppie and they try to look cool with ""fusion"" like plates. Presentation is important  no doubt but the taste is what really matters and they failed  miserably here. The meat tasted like a washed up stew and smelled weird with an overpowering orange sauce. It was so bad that we were not able to eat much of the plate.I give them props because the place was packed and everyone was buying their awesome decor and ambience but it doesn't work for me...  I rather seat in a hole in the wall with great food.","Miriam is easily one of the top brunch spots in park slope. All the food I have had is great. My favorites are definitely the boreka breakfast and the schnitzel sandwich. The boreka breakfast really has a nice balance of everything you would want in an Israeli breakfast while the schnitzel is cooked to perfection. One thing to note is if it are having an espresso based coffee drink, get it in early- I think they have only one machine so it can take a little while to get your coffee. Also, they don't take brunch reservations so make sure to show up early as you probably will wait 15-30 mins depending on your group size. I would not come here with more than 4 people if possible. I have not come here for dinner yet but wave to try it at some point. All I know is their brunch is definitely worth the visit","We came for brunch and ended up waiting close to an hour. They said it would be 30 min, when we got the text to come back. When we arrived exactly 2 minutes after getting the text, they didn't have a table for us. We said we would wait longer if we could get a table outside, which the waitress promised, but we ended up being crammed into a corner spot inside. The food was fresh and flavorful. Overall: 4/5. Good food, mediocre service.","Miriam is my favorite brunch spot in Park Slope. I am sure others agree too as it is always packed, and wait to be seated. But, once you are seated service is great and food is delicious.I ordered Blueberry Pancakes, a side of Home Fries and freshly squeezed Orange Juice. Our table had also other orders such as Red Shakshuka, and 2 Eggs. Everything we ordered was very delicious and absolutely worth the wait. Food was 10/10. It is a little noisy but not too crazy. Service was great.",Miriam
86,I've eaten here twice...both times...were............delicious.The pistachio pizza is phenomenal. It will symbolically replace your children.Positivity is key!,"I like this place. I ordered The Mediterranean Omelette, it's really deliciousand. The atmosphere gives moody date night realness.","My regular place for Falafel platter, pistachio pizza. Affordable place when you want to try Mediterranean food.",Walked by this place a few times before deciding to give it a try. Very dimly lit which makes it ideal for an intimate dinner. Food is very delicious and consistent. Would recommend the Chicken and rice bowl!,"Dar 525 was fantastic. The portions were great, the flavors were delicious, and the brunch prices are super enticing as well!!! The Mediterranean open face omelette was super filling and super sizeable. The shakshuka was delicious and the eggs were cooked nicely as well. The pita they serve you is always super fresh, toasty, and puffy with steam! Be careful of your hands when you tear into that steam filled pita pocket! The flavors were good, food was delicious, portions were generous, prices were good. All in all, would recommend everything I got!!","In the short time I've been living in this neighborhood, this is the only place I've come back to. First time I went was during a weekday for lunch and my partner and I both had the falafel platter. Not only is it delicious but what a bargain! For 10 bucks you get a legitimate platter that you can barely finish and everything on the plate is a win. Went back for brunch and got the Mediterranean breakfast and it didn't let me down. The za'atar bread was delicious and the salad and eggs also A+. And again, SO MUCH FOOD. It's unbelievable and so tasty. On top of that, the staff is super friendly and appreciative of their customers. Their Driggs location is a great neighborhood spot and I see myself returning over and over.",Dar 525
87,"This place has fallen from gastronomic grace! Empanadas are 50% smaller, mixed grill for 2 ($55), is mostly sausage and chicken with approximately 5-6oz of malnourished skirt steak and skinny yet fatty short ribs that were inedible. The coup de gras was having to taste the putrid chorizo all night...most of which was discarded into my napkin.",It started with the wine being pretty bad. I don't understand why it's so difficult to serve decent wine.Next came the empanadas that were pretty much scorching on the outside and frozen on the inside.The only saving grace was the skirt steak and the mashed yuca. The meats is where they shine.,"We came here on a Sunday evening. The place is cozy and it wasn't packed. We both ordered the steak and sides (yucca, sautéed spinach and mash potato)and dessert. I would definitely come back for more delish food! 9/10","Good food, great people, great atmosphere. I went here after discovering that next-door restaurant Aperture had closed down. Was not disappointed! The fried calamari was delicious, and the Pollo al Limon was staggeringly fresh and juicy. Seasoning was on point, and all the sauces were very flavorful.I highly recommend this place.","I'm always impressed by house made hot sauces. This place offers several in various degrees of burn. Outstanding empanadas, chopped Caesar salad, fried yucca and no bad choice with any steak selection. Surprisingly, the burger was dry and they could improve upon the vibe by lowering the lights and Feng Shui-ing the seating. It's a steakhouse with cafe sensibility.","We found out about this restaurant exploring the neighborhood.Pretty tempting to see several traditional Argentinian dishes.We arrived around 5:30pm and set in their nice patio.Waiter greeted us promptly with menus and literally 3 seconds after placing them on the table asked us if we were ready or needed another minute to order...Came back few minutes later and I asked if they had happy hour. His face changed and even his attitude.We ordered two glasses of happy hour wine. He came back fast with them. Pours were good and wine pretty nice for a $7 HH pour.We orderer gnocchi bolognese and chicken napolitanas.Meanwhile bread and chimichurri sauce was served. The chimichurri was tasty, very tradicional flavor.We wanted to order another glass of wine before HH was over but the server didn't show up until 6:02pm. Happy hours was over and for my past in the industry didn't ask.The food arrived. Gnocchi has a perfect texture and the sauce was very nicely balanced.The chicken milanesa lacked chicken flavor. Ot was OK.More guest arrived to the patio, even heard a table was asked if that was their first time there, another table was told the specials and we didn't get any of that. Maybe they assumed I was a tourist for carrying camera equipment and thought they didn't have to work for their tip?I was trying to be friendly and didn't get the same in exchange. 10 minutes after finish eating feel to call a server like a cab since were being ignored.Finally a waitress saw me waiving and brought a wrong checked, which was 60 bucks over our expense price.Called the waiter. Unapologetically started walking away saying I'll bring your check.We left a tip that represented the service. You need to conquer your money!",El Mate
88,Holy cow- I thought I made the best pirogies. But clearly these guys do!! I may eat myself to death!,"Order take out, so good! I had Jalapeño - cheddar & potato. They have dessert pierogies too, but I didn't try.",Absolutely delicious. Cooked quickly & fresh - amazing sauces too. Will be returning to try all the flavours but I can't imagine anything better than the pork ragu!,"Hands down for the best pierogis ever! The place is super cute, love the clean design! and they were very accommodating. We were 6 people+1 toddler. They don't have hugh chair but they do have a booster seat, so it was all we needed.Menu was basically Pierogies plus salads, etc.We ordered: Pan fried (9pcs order): bacon cheddar, mom's favBoiled (9 piece order): spinach&feta, potato cheese3 orders of kielbasy.So goodddd!!!!! Pan fried was just perfectly crunchy at the bottom and boiled were al dente. The fill for everyone of them were so good... we had extra caramelized onions as well.It was that good and we so hungry that added extra order of 1 kielbasy and baba's potato!Our waitress was super nice and knowledgeable. She recommended for each of the type of Pierogies if it was best pan fried or boiled.For drinks, lemonades and beer. All super goodChill small place that do not rush on giving you the check. Definitely one place to go back again!","Tasty and filling pierogies; good pricing; friendly staff; cute little space -- all the makings of a great restaurant. We had the potato (boiled) and mac and cheese (pan-fried) pierogies, as well as the blueberry dessert ones. The potato ones were delicious; the mashed potato and cheese filling was smooth and creamy. The mac and cheese pierogies were also delicious -- solid mac and cheese filling. I would have happily eaten a bowl of each of the fillings, but it's nice that they package them up neatly in dough. We had 9 pierogies each for the potato and mac and cheese, and we were stuffed after those. The blueberry pierogies were pretty good as well, accompanied by delicious homemade whipped cream.One suggestion: I wish the blueberry pierogi filling was more like blueberry pie filling -- like a few whole/smashed blueberries and a blueberry sauce/jelly. Currently, it's more like just blueberries in a dough vessel. Price: 4/5Quality: 5/5Quantity: 5/5Service: 5/5Atmosphere: 5/5","Very good pierogies.  We had the sauerkraut and the cheese pierogies (farmer's cheese and ricotta cheese).  These were really terrific.  I kept insisting that whichever pierogi that I was eating at the moment was my favorite.  They worked together so well.  The cheese is a heavier, denser taste, and the sauerkraut was a much lighter flavor.  I think the pairing worked really well.  We also ordered the cucumber salad.  It had a little too much bite for me on it's own, but I enjoyed eating it with the pierogies.  We also had a czech lager, which was pretty tasty. Services was friendly and quick.",Baba's Pierogies
89,4$ decaf small.coffee. wtf.  All I wanted was a decaf.  It was good..but man i thought Starbucks was expensive.,"If you are reading this review you care about your good taste and about how you spend your money. Stopped by to get some pastries to go. The almond croissant was dry and stale, it cost $4.00 before tax AND a convince free of 10%. I was very upset and disappointed that this establishment charges nearly $5.00 for subpar pasties.","I came here today @ 9:45 AM with two friends and was seated immediately. Though the staff is friendly, they paid no attention to our table after serving our drinks. Two parties that were seated 20 minutes after us received their meals wayyyy before our simple order of baked empanadas came out. When the order came out, they didn't even give me a plate, but instead put my empanada on the same plate as my friend's. We had to ask for an extra plate so that I could self serve my food. No one came to apologize about the delay. The empanadas came out at 10:30 AM. It took 45 minutes for lukewarm empanadas to be served. Overall nice environment but mediocre food and non attentive staff. Will not be back.","Second time here and the quality of my experience hasn't changed a tad. Great food, great service, and great atmosphere. Met up with two friends for brunch and while we had a tiny wait (15-20 mins prob), it was well worth it.I had the pancakes with scrambled eggs (very dry which they did perfectly) and with a side of avocado. Another friend had the same but had bananas instead of avocado. The third friend had the avocado toast which was presented so beautifully! I had to take a pic of her meal because of it, lol.Service was on point! We were happy to be there. Looking forward to whenever I return!","I had a great brunch at Colina Cuervo this weekend! A friend wanted me to go here with her a while back, but I objected because I thought I wouldn't be a fan of the cuisine. I prefer a greasy spoon, Southern brunch. However, I ended up giving in this time and enjoyed my meal. I ordered the pancakes with dulce de leche butter and maple syrup, along with scrambled eggs. This meal also came with chorizo or roasted pork, but the friendly waiter told me I could swap the meat for a side of avocados! (Muchas gracias for accommodating the non-meat eater). There was minor confusion with our order because my friend ordered a side of one pancake to go along with her Plato Ecuatoriano, but when the food came out, they gave me 1 pancake instead of two and my friend received none. When my friend explained the mix up to a waiter, the chef walked over and asked to hear what went wrong. He quickly went back into the kitchen and brought out my friend's pancake and an additional one for me to complete my pancake stack order. He was very apologetic and checked back in on us to make sure we had a pleasant experience. Great service! Thanks for making us happy customers. I'll be back soon!","Amazing food, great ambiance and service.We took the tacos and the pork hash, both have amazing flavors.I can't wait to be back to try different menu items.",Colina Cuervo
90,"I expected much better food considering the reviews and buzz but they were expensive, small plates. The entrees were fine but forgettable. I won't ever come back.","Olmsted definitely lives up to the hype. I'm not gonna give a rundown of everything we ate because I don't feel like writing that much. Just know that almost everything we ate was exceptional. There were a couple misses (Kale Rangoon and Popcorn Fish), but both were still good. They just weren't as amazing as the rest of the meal. Service was warm and non-pretentious.","Was excited to eat at this semi hard to reserve restaurant. Brunch was ok, while the selections were unique/creative, i didn't fall over my chair. Restaurants looked was nice and crisp w an open kitchen concept. Where my review will go wrong is service. Waitress did fine up until we indicated to her there were live budancing in our food. (Notice the many plants throughout the restaurant) However the waitress had this ""eww"" look on her face (eww at me for pointing out something I need help correcting or the bug?). The shocker was no apologies comment/feedback from her (so I guess the eww was at a picky customer who don't like bugs in her food). She simply took the plate away and later came back w a new one. I thought this was a Michelin graded but that was an odd and I suppose rude experience....unless the bugs were part of the culinary experience.","My expectation was sky high the moment I walked into Olmsted.  With James Beard award for the best new restaurant and raving reviews on Eater. I expect the best, and Olmsted does not disappoint.  I liked the vibe, the coziness, the back patio with string lights a bathtub koi pond, all the details of the decor really make the restaurant pop and be as inviting as it can be.  Food was amazing - The fried crab rangoon was a stand out, along with the clam carrot crepe and the grilled pork belly were my favorites.  We ordered a burgundy red ($100) that was pretty good value and paired well with the food.  Highly recommend","Short cut; lovely place, bright, & friendly staff, with expensive, unremarkably tasting food but real hi end presentation. They recommend ordering 4 - 5 plates for 2. We did. Even though I try not eat things I dont love (why waste the calories) my nephew is 19 with the appetite and metabolism of a line backer(read eats ALOT of anything) so I was sure we would order more. We did not. It was just too much mediocre food. We had the Duck Pate - sweet and fluffy a very weird texture for pate, I did not like it. My nephew liked but didn't finish it. The Waffle - came with a scoop of ice cream, and some very tasty fruit across the top. When served they pour the syrup immediately over,  not enough I found myself hunting for it and suddenly could not get the attention of anyone to bring me a little more. We were at the bar. He demolished this! The Duck Eggs with Bangers - meh. Didn't finish. He didnt like the eggs, I thought they were over cooked and missing salt. There was a homemade loaf which was really more like a muffin that I thought was good. He was unimpressed. The drinks both non & alcoholic were very small and took a ridiculous amount of time to get considering they were mostly premade ( and we were at the bar!).Staff: The staff was bright & friendly but drinks and plates came out without regard.  We waited, while a couple whom sat & ordered well after us got an Egg Dish we had ordered as well. This happened several times but it may be because we never finished anything.  Brunch for my nephew and I with tip came to $120. Almost everything was just lackluster in taste but lovely eye candy. Maybe this is what English food taste like. (No offense to English Food )","The food: 2/5. Visiting from Chicago we were excited to check out our home grown chef who is not only a Kendall College graduate, but also had such impressive stints in his career as Alinea and Blue Hill. At the end, we weren't sure if he had learned anything at all from Grant or Dan Barber. I'm always a sucker for farm to table/seasonal menu and generally love veggie options, but Olmstead didn't deliver. Everything was either bland or not balanced, their sauces didn't add anything at all. The watermelon sushi had 3 distinct flavor profiles that didn't go well together. Shishitos were alright, I make those better at home with a miso glaze. Squash was a spin on the traditional Thai papaya salad but with squash noodles and charred zucchini which was nice, but their dressing was off balance, far too acidic and sour. Crab Rangoons tasted fishy. The biggest disappointment was the tomato schnitzel. It was your regular tomato fried in egg wash that cost 20 some dollars. It had no flavor profile at all, as the sauces didn't do anything for it; fresh tomatoes from the farmers market taste better than that. The only highlight of our meal was the tuna, which was a very stingy serving but I liked the smokiness paired with fresh basil. Shishitos - 3/5Watermelon sushi -2/5Squash - 2.5/5Crab Rangoon - 2.5/5Tomato schnitzel - 1/5Tuna - 4/5Cocktails - 3/5No complaints about the service, but their bathroom was both out of toilet paper and paper towels. Overall: 2/5. If you want to pay $23 for a slice of a bland tomato, come to Olmstead. Otherwise, get a drink at their beautiful garden in the back and go for dinner elsewhere.",Olmsted
91,"It's a shame! This could be a five star review, if the service wouldn't have been this bad!First of all the waitress was kind of bored and not very friendly when she handed out the menus and told us about the special. Then, after bringing our food, she did not come to our table again a single time. Which was sad, because I wanted to order another drink and we wanted to order another side of fries for our daughter, which she didn't bring a fork for. We wanted to give her one, but had no chance, since nobody showed up.Also, the vegan Mac and cheese needed a little more salt. Since it was not on the table, we wanted toast for it - but again, no chance.She didn't even show up at the table to ask how our food was, a total standard and must. But nothing.I have to give credits to the young waiter with the tattoos, who brought us the check (we had to let him come to our table since our waitress seemed nowhere to be found). He was very friendly and nice.But then again - we (and our 2 year old, who wanted to finally have her parents pay so we can bring her home and to bed) had to wait so long to pay.... I don't get it. I just don't. So again - what a shame! Decent location, good food but just horrible service! Won't be coming again I guess...","Reservations are kinda a must. I've eaten here 4 times and each time is a little bit more disappointing. The Hen of the Woods Picatta is my favorite dish and I enjoy repeating entrees to see if the cooking sticks ground each time. Unfortunately the flavor was on a steady decline. For the price point, I would say try it once and then move on to the number of other vegan dining experiences in the area.","Love this place but they ruined the amazing tofu scramble brunch option by adding pesto to it. It's inedible now. Also, the servers can be a little forgetful during brunch. It's understandably busy but having to remind someone three times for a drink is disappointing.","Went the other night with a friend for last minute dinner plans. Upon arrival the next wait for a table was 45 minutes so we were totally cool with taking a counter table to eat (if you are impatient I suggest making a reservation). We had a very polite waiter who was very prompt and available if we had any questions.My friend and I ordered the mozzarella sticks as an app to split and these are by far the best vegan mozz sticks I've ever had. I ordered the delicious penne vodka with meatballs and my friend ordered the Mac and Shews and we were both very satisfied with the orders.As I come here often, not a complaint yet. Keep up the great work!!","I'm a non-vegan who has been eating more vegan food recently for a variety of reasons.  Seems to me there is a spectrum for table service level vegan restaurants that runs from:Those that are doing dishes traditionally prepared with animal products, which are substituting something for that animal product; in other words, nut cheeses or seitan, or something like that.  Now a days the substitutions are with new, innovative foods that are surprisingly satisfying alternatives, e.g. beyond burger.Then there are restaurants that are exclusively serving dishes that are traditionally vegan, like salads, ratatouille, etc.Modern Love is somewhere in the middle.  Seems to me they have some of both of the above, but what I like most is that they have some dishes where they are doing traditional preparations, but substituting something vegan--a whole food, not a something new and, for lack of a better work, processed. For example, their picata that replaces the veal with mushroom. Sure, the cream is probably made from a nut milk, but it feels more like real food...no offense to anywhere else!Anyway, that's my description.  My rating is obviously very good.  They have a great menu and do an excellent job preparing the dishes.","I can't say enough good things about this place. But let me start off by saying my boyfriend is a vegetarian (I am not), has been one for 16 years & has never enjoyed ""vegetarian/vegan"" restaurants because they typically try to be overly trendy & give you super tiny portions (& he is a pretty big guy) so it drives him nuts.But it was his birthday, & I came to Yelp in hopes of finding a perfect spot & WOW did I find one. The atmosphere is def on the trendier side (I mean it's Williamsburg I expect nothing less) but from the second we sat down we experienced nothing but amazing, fast service, incredible (large portion sized) food & awesome drinks. We ordered the spiked lemonade & I can't remember what he got but it had sour in the title but anyway. Both were amazing. We got the tempeh buffalo ""wings"" & truffled poutine. I was FLOORED. The buffalo tempeh tasted like boneless wings without having to think that it's creepy processed chicken but just soy! The avocado ranch it was paired with was amazing too. The truffled poutine took me places. I couldn't even believe it was almond ricotta. I'm a true ricotta lover at heart so I was a little skeptical but it honestly tasted the same (or better because it was with truffle!!)For dinner we got chickpea cutlet parmesan & Brooklyn fried tofu. I think I ate only half of my dinner because I was SO FULL. This was probably the largest plate served to me at a restaurant. I was so shocked I got so much food. I literally ate the rest for breakfast the next morning that's how good it was..... My boyfriend loved this fried tofu, it was super super crispy on the outside, & perfect to pair with the mashed potatoes that were sooooo creamy. I couldn't even believe how amazing every single meal turned out. & honestly it's not even on the more expensive side so I was so happy to be treating him!!I cannot wait to come back as soon as I can, we are even thinking of inviting his family (who love meat) to come soon because it's impossible not to adore every single dish!!!!!!!All photos taken by @carbiesanon on Instagram",Modern Love Brooklyn
92,"The Clover Club SnubGave Clover Club another go yesterday.  My friend and I arrived to a full bar but empty seating.  We intended to have dinner and drinks but the waitress refused to situs at a larger table we requested because my friend had a broken arm.  I asked nicely a few times and explained our situation but she snubbed us and was super adamant about not giving us a more comfortable table and insisted all of the empty table were reserved for 4 or more people. We were so annoyed that we finished our rounds of martinis and went to Nobu for dinner instead.  Clover fails again.  Too bad, we would've tipped her at least 30% if she had been accommodating but I'm not going to spend $500 on a night out in a place that treats me like a second-class citizen.  The martinis were good though, even though the service left a bad aftertaste.We got the ""Clover Club Snub.""",The brunch here is delicious! We had the Bacon Tasting as an appetizer. Who doesn't love 3 kinds of bacon! I also tried the Wildflower cocktail. Such a refreshing drink. As our entrees we ordered the baked eggs with chorizo & manchego and the prime beef burger. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because there's no way 2 ginger ales should cost $8.,"This a great spot on Smith Street - nice ambiance, low lighting, and even when busy, it's never felt uncomfortably tight when having drinks at the bar. And I'm not sure if it's a recent addition, but just had dinner there for the first time, and the food was excellent (I could be conflating this with another place, but I thought they only served small plates - now they offer a selection of entrees). The staff there was also very nice and helpful - we had put our names down for a table, hung out by the bar for about a hour before correctly assuming they had forgotten about us. We let them know, and they promptly sat us and a round of drinks on the house. Not ideal that they dropped the ball - but when a place is quick to apologize and make it right, no harm, no foul in my book.PS: I ordered the Prime Beef Burger... A+","My hubby and I threw a baby shower in the beautiful private Parlor Room in the back of the Clover Club and we had a very good experience.Pros:- Beautiful, elegant, and tasteful space with 1800's decor and furnishings. We didn't want to just rent a regular office space and this venue really stood out- No hourly/day space rental fee!- Attentive and friendly staff. We worked with General Manager Justin and Susan with all logistics and they were always responsive. Our bartender Ashley was super outgoing and friendly and my guests all really liked her. - We ordered Deviled Eggs, Cheese Board, Cured Meats, Pulled Pork Minis, Caprese Crostini, Stuffed Mushrooms. All the food was fresh, flavorful and came out in a timely manner. Our friends raved about the Pulled Pork Minis and Caprese Crostini. - Wide variety of fun and delicious cocktails and mocktails. Cons:- The minimum gratuity starts the time your party starts. So if you wanted to order a round of drinks for your friends who helped set up earlier in the morning, that would not count towards the minimum. Our bartender was sweet enough to allow an exception and set it up once she got the bar ready - If anyone wanted to order additional dishes from the regular menu, you have to move out of the Parlor Room and dine in the front dining area, which is frustrating because you don't want to leave the party Details for Parlor Room (Sun-Thurs/Sat Afternoons)- 45 people max capacity for private parties. - The requirement is $300 guaranteed minimum gratuity on all beverages. This means a total bar spend of $1500 assuming guests tip 20%. Drinks can be rung as a cash bar (each guest pays for their own drinks) or open bar (host to pay the entire tab.) At the end of the party, the host must guarantee that the minimum gratuity on all beverages reaches $300 or that the difference is met from cash bar tips. All drinks are rung based on consumption.- Food orders, and signed food contracts are due one week in advance of party. Please note that food is subject to 20% service charge, which does not apply toward the gratuity minimum on beverages.- Saturday & Sunday afternoon events must be cleared by 6pm. You can get there as early as 10:30am to setup. - You cannot use anything that punctures any surface, also no glitter, confetti, stickers, and no duct tape (or equivalent) on any finished wood.- Tall ladder is supplied but not tall enough to reach the ceiling. Tall enough to reach high up on the walls though.- Must supply the source and speakers if you want to play your own music at a reasonable volume.- $25 cake cutting fee covers two small-to-medium-sized cakes or one really big cake. There is no fee for desserts like cupcakes and cookies, and they are happy to arrange them on one of their platters.Food Details- Recommend ordering 2-3 platters of stationary hors d'ouevres, plus the following amount(s) of passed hors d'ouevres. - 4-5 pieces of passed hors d' oeuvres per person is considered light eating. 6-7 pieces per person is considered medium eating. 8-10 pieces per person are considered heavy eating, or enough for each of your guests to call a full meal.   Finally, we ended up spending $1096 for food (medium eating), $115 on bar gratuity difference (in addition to $175 for drinks to treat our friends who helped out). Everything came together, everyone had a grand, well-fed, and drunk time and I highly recommend Clover Club for private parties! Thank you Justin, Susan, Ashley, and staff for helping us host a wonderful and memorable baby shower!","Beautiful atmosphere, highly recommend for date night/first date. It a big bar yet intimate and quaint with candles on all the tables. They have a very reasonable happy hour that I took full advantage of. This place is elevated bar food, I loved the chips with tangy creme dip. I would discrediting humanity if I don't address their breading pudding. It is ridiculously good. It has a subtle sweetness. Honestly could eat this everyday for a year and be happy. Make room for it!","What an incredible spot! - Cocktails are AMAZING; my friend called for a very old school drink off menu and they made it no problem. The frozen drinks are out of this world good.- Atmosphere is way cute and the service is spot on. This is an excellent date spot, absolutely no question. - Food is really really good! If you like Brussels sprouts, these are a MUST. The duck fat crisps were pretty good but honestly less exciting than I expected. Burger was perfection, and the steak was a solid 8/10. Come here for dinner, it's worth it!",Clover Club
93,"Pig Beach used to be everything everybody loved about Brooklyn, now it's the exact opposite: in terms of both clientele (irresponsibly allowing their dogs & children to run around bothering others) AND employees (who huddle in a corner, smugly sneering & snidely leering, very obviously hating their jobs, very unhelpful & resentful of customers).",I'm a black dude who was vaping when other white women were vaping and then I got kicked out? Double standards are cool.Also: it's pride month and I was wearing a rainbow romper,"Great food & drinks. The women's bathroom line on the other hand is horrendous. 20 minute, 50 person wait for the women's while no wait for the men's. The reason for this is because they have a private bathroom for men but only offer gender neutral bathrooms for women.",First off. Omg omg. The food was great. The brisket was soft as can be.  The Mac and cheese was great. They use crushed goldfish on top of the Mac and cheese. Omg. The price was good. The drinks were great. The views were great.  The clientele was ehhh.  Come with a big party. All in all 4.5 stars from me.  Brisket was on point.,"As the summer winds down, made it a point to come here to enjoy the outside BBQ atmosphere while possible. Saturday late afternoon (sometime between the lunch and dinner crowds), still a significant line to enter.Was able to get to the backyard area after about 10ish minutes in line. Place is generally packed both inside as well as outside - including a large portion ""Reserved"" for various parties. With nowhere to sit, opted instead to lean on one of the bars and order some drinks. The initial stall as you walk in has some cans, where I opted for an IPA ($8). Towards the back there is a bigger bar that I did not know had a better drink list. Inside, you can order food - settling on a Brisket Sandwich ($9) and some fries ($6 for a small). Meal comes out within a few short minutes - a small but dense sandwich packed with some brisket, fried onions, and pickles. Juicy and flavorful, but wishing there was more. Fries are fresh but completely over salted, which the beer couldn't whisk away.The flaw here was coming on a Saturday afternoon; it is way too packed to enjoy a meal, even despite the bouncers regulating the crowd. May try again on a weeknight.","Top 5 reasons why Pig Beach is the quintessential place for day drinking in Brooklyn.1. BBQ. Not just any BBQ. BBQ that's delicious as f__k. Everything on the menu is great. The brisket is my favorite. Authentic BBQ in the Brooklyn. Can't beat it. 2. Great summery booze options. Day drinking requires refreshing cocktails and this place has a bunch of that. 3. Did I mention that BBQ? ... Mhmmm. Ribs. Wings. Pork Shoulder.4. Large outdoor space. Big enough for you and your friends to soak up some sun rays from one of the large picnic tables or while enjoying a game of corn hole. 5. Fido Friendly! Your little furry pal can day drink with you. What's better than that?! ... BBQ, Booze and Pooches. ItThe winning formula for a great day drinking adventure. Sidenote: Pig Beach isn't a secret so expect a wait during peak times (weekends). It's a popular destination for young families too, so there's a good amount of strollers earlier in the day.",Pig Beach
94,Food and drinks were great.. However the service was terrible.Very un attentive and disappeared at times.. We had to get up and look for her.. The restaurant is but so big.,"So disappointed in this place. I walked in with my boyfriend for dinner. We asked to sit outside and one or the EMPTY tables and she said no because it was for a 6 person table however there was NO ONE sitting outside at the tables. Instead of seating us, they lost our business. Never returning. Shame because I actually enjoyed it every time I've been.",The service is as slow as molasses. Food is okay but it took over an hour to reached the table. The mimosa was served over ice so it wasn't bubbly. There were a few people. They also seemed as annoyed as we were. Not worth the wait.,"Been here twice! What brought me back was their frozen sangrias! Sooo yummy! Red or white or even mixed! We were a party of 3. For apps we ordered empanadas (one cheese and the other chicken) they were sooo good and more importantly not so greasy! The wings? FIRE! Soo good! Tender and juicy on the inside, perfectly crispy on the outside! The service was great also! The waiter was attentive and even provided us with his personal favorites! I will be coming back especially for brunch!","Very excited to finally make it here, but the experience was underwhelming. Very nice corner spot in Bushwick, but not what I was expecting in terms of taste. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but it was lacking the authentic Dominican taste I was hoping to get. My husband ordered the Baked Chicken with White Rice and I had the Chimi burger with Batata Frita. Again, flavors were good, but if you're looking for authentic Dominican cuisine, this isn't the place. My husband thought he was in an Indian restaurant because his white rice was actually Basmati rice. The chicken was good, but missing oregano and that ""mojo Criollo"" taste. My ""Batata Frita"" was actually sweet potato fries; albeit the translation of Batata Frita is fried sweet potato, as a Dominican patron entering a Dominican restaurant and seeing ""Batata Frita"" on the menu, sweet potato fries is NOT what I'm expecting to receive. I was expecting fried slices of the Japanese variety of sweet potato which has off-white flesh, unlike the Yam counterpart,  that has orange flesh. They also lost stars because the fries were of the frozen variety and not all of them were cooked through. My Chimi Burger had the flavors of an authentic Dominican Chimi, but they missed the mark with the bread; it would have worked better on Ciabatta bread instead of the  Brioche bun it was served on.I recommend this place for the extensive beer selection and atmosphere, but if you are looking for an authentic Dominican meal, this place isn't it.","Overall most of the food is very good! I've eaten here 3 times & I really enjoyed my meal.. You cannot go wrong with the mini burgers, sweet chili wings, fries, mango kale salad, and the cheese or beef empanadas ughh all of it was sooo good! I might just have to go back today lol! the reason why I'm knocking of 2 stars is because of the following:-kids menu mini burgers cost MORE than the mini burgers on the regular ""adult menu"" & they DO NOT come with fries, nor are there fries on the kids menu ..isn't a kids menu supposed to be a bit cheaper than the regular menu?? Came here with my daughter & her meal total was more than mine! -weak cocktails.. I really don't believe there was any alcohol in my mojito.. it tasted like limeade. It was not made from scratch which I specifically asked my waitress .. it was pretty much pure mixer with no alcohol in it .. if you go here drink beer or wine .. don't spend 10 bucks for a cup of juice. -boyfriend had a sprite & it was completely flat! I asked if we could get a new one & the waitress was like ""that's just how our machine is.. it's all the same"" SERIOUSLY?! GET A NEW DARN MACHINE! Nobody wants to drink flat soda. -yuca fries - you pretty much get 8 skinny yuca fries on a plate of lettuce. The lettuce makes them soggy.. that's a big NO NO for any restaurant to be serving fried food on lettuce or greens. I hate that. The dipping sauce was literally "" high in the cup.. I thought to myself ""seriously?"" So stingy with the dip! Don't order these, they tasted very dry and undercooked. -they wouldn't allow me to add bacon to my mini burgers.. that's just dumb. I don't get it. I do recommend this place & I myself will eat here again, just won't drink here, or bring kids here, or order yuca fries & not be in the mood for bacon.",Salud Bar & Grill
95,Ordered the speck pizza and a brussel sprout and Proscuitto frittata.I'm use to the frittata being a scrambled egg dish buy they put all that stuff on a pizza which was interesting. I wasn't a big fan of the brussel sprouts on the pizza. I typically eat brussell sprouts but I dont think it was a good mix on pizza.The speck pizza was delicious!They have chilli pepper flakes and olive oil on the table so I added a lot of that as I am a fan of chilli pepper flakes.,"Pretty unreliable with respect to wait times. We were told the wait would be one hour, after an hour and 15 we checked in and were told that it would be another hour or hour and a half. I've been before and the food was great, but the poor customer service is frustrating.","Terrible service! We were a group of 3, put our name in, were quoted a 1 hour wait. No problem, we got a drink elsewhere and came back. The app the restaurant uses to tell you how long your wait is assured us after 45 minutes that we only had 15 more minutes. We waited 15 minutes and then checked in the host, only to be told we had another hour to wait.Either update your app, or be nicer when delivering the news of a 2 hour wait.Not worth the wait.","If you are craving Neapolitan style pizza, this is the place! No slices are sold here but the pies are the perfect size to devour on your own ( maybe 1 slice left over). The crust has the perfect crunchy exterior which leads into a chewy interior for a nice texture balance- the perfect base for various flavor combos the menu has to offer. Margherita- perfect tomato sauce with cheesy mozzarella and basil. Well balanced. 5  Cremini And Hot Fennel Sausage- white pizza, packed with flavor from the sausage and mushrooms. A go to for me. Beware- There are garlic chunks- skip for date night unless you both are indulging! 5  Meatballs- meaty, cheesy, and juicy. Perfect sauce. Packed with flavor. 4.5  Kale Caesar salad- not may fave. Drenched in dressing. 3","Brooklyn is to pizza as Philly is to cheesesteak. This love affair has stood the test of time. It's better we don't start WW3 by declaring which style is best, a pizza lover can appreciate them all. Barboncino is not the kind of place you go for a quick slice. This charming space won me over the moment I stepped in. It's probably the multi level setting, or is it exposed brick? Yep, the brick gets me every time. The style of choice here is Neapolitan, the pizza that started it all. The menu is filled with creative choices which always makes it tough to pick just one, but thankfully you are allowed to do half n half. As far as the pizza goes, this is a high quality, very, very good pie. The crust in particular is beyond reproach. Crispy, chewy...simply irresistible. Easy to see why Barboncino is so highly regarded. To be fair, there were a few oddities (although very minor) I should point out. The pizza is cut into 4 huge slices. Not sure why, but this makes it hard to not only share, but to not be forced into eating the entire pie. (Neapolitan pizza does not reheat well). The second thing is the toppings seem to be introduced onto the pie only after the pizza has come out of the oven, which makes sense since you don't want to scorch them. I may be wrong on this one, but since no cheese is melted overtop to hold them in place, they easily fall off the pie when you pick up a slice. I know, I'm nitpicking here....Just saying. Overall, 4.5 out of 5. A good pizza is a good pizza, no matter how you slice it. See what I did there? Oh never mind....","The Margherita and the Cremini with Hot Fennel Sausage pies are my faves but all of their pies are truly delicious! The pies are not traditional NYC pizza pie size because this is more artisanal and Neopolitan style pizza. The meatballs are worth dying for. The ginger beer is the truth and they just added ice cream and sorbet with an impressive but not overwhelming variety of flavors to choose from! Woo woo! I tried the coconut and it was yummmmm-EE! My sole grievance is that it can get so loud at night especially on free jazz nights, that you're barely able to hear your company. Other than that the service is always good. They have an outdoor seating area too AND they do orders for pick up as well. What more can you really ask for?I've gotta make time to try their brunch.",Barboncino Pizza & Bar
96,"The food is good here - I've had the cowboy burger and the burrito multiple times. However, the service is subpar and not worth the price for standard bar fare. The past few times I've ordered the hostess working the phones has been less than friendly and impatient when taking my pickup order. The last time I ordered out, I arrived for pick up and was barely greeted or given an approximate time my order would be done. When I got home, I realized they forgot to give me condiments and one of the orders of fries was missing. Last month I gave it one more try because my girlfriend was a big fan of the burger. The waitress had little to no knowledge of the drink specials and hardly tended to us. Poor management has created a dining experience that lacks common courtesy and professionalism. I understand they are running a restaurant in a very hipster area and they want to reflect that kind of atmosphere, but this is now among a number of hip spots in the bushwick area which seems to have abandoned regular service industry standards because of it.",Girlfriend ordered breakfast sandwich with bacon. I got the steak and fries. Both came with what I highly suspect were frozen potatoes (see photos). Steak was like chewing gum and took me forever to get through.,"My g/f and I ordered delivery here. It said organic chicken breast for the buffalo chicken sandwich and had decent reviews. For the two buffalo chicken sandwiches it came out to over $40 bucks. Delivery prices have gone up due to outsourcing delivery people and using a private delivery services. However this meal was disgusting, the chicken was flattened out, as if someone beat it with a hammer, or even worst ran over by a car. I questioned the flavor of the meat, but felt so bad that my gf spent over $40 bucks on the food, that I tried to eat all of it. It had no flavor and the blue cheese tasted like old mayo or something worse. I had to drench the flattened out ""organic chicken breast"" in crystal hot sauce, just to get the questionable, gamey taste out of my mouth. I really can't believe this was chicken, if it was, something was wrong with it. I ate my meal, watching our movie, only to later find out that my gf had only eaten one bite before she gave up on this lousy meal. I'm only giving an extra star bc I did not get sick from the meal. But with so many great buffalo chicken sandwiches to choose from, hard times, Clara's, or hell; the deli across the street. This was a waste of money and I'm very disappointed. Oh and the fries were soggy.","I've been here a few times with my sister who lives nearby. It's one of her favorite spots. I usually get the huevos rancheros. I LOVE how they have a fried crispy tortilla underneath the eggs and cheese! The service is really nice, and I love how they play old movies. Today they were playing XMen 2 and some other oldies. Overall, great experience!","Cheap, cheerful, always great portion sizes.Gluten free buns & bread are really handy if you fancy a sandwich or burger in here. They're super accommodating and the food always turns out great.The rosemary fries are amazing, and I would definitely recommend their BBQ wings. They're always solid!","Cute brunch spot. Very busy place and great service. Yummy food and mamosa. Yes,Mamosa.",983-Bushwick's Living Room
97,"Ordered food for pick up. When brought it home , everything except tacos was AWFUL (fish dish, garden dish & pork). Even the rice tasted like garbage! We must have ordered from this restaurant over 20 times in the past and this was the first time everything tasted this bad. We called to complain and the so called ""manager"" on the phone said too bad and nothing they can do to compensate us for the garbage food we spent $72 on. I cannot believe that this restaurant has SUCH POOR customer service and clearly does not care about its patrons. They just lost really good customers who used to order from them a lot. Would NEVER go or order from them again. SIMPLY AWFUL.",It wasn't nearly as good as I expected. It's a meh interior and the food was bland. I can't for the life of me see what people liked about this except that perhaps they've not had really good mexican before.,"Came here for lunch today. I thought the food was OK. All of the five stars reviews in my opinion are not warranted. We ordered a ceviche for the table which was OK, a little bland for my taste and very small for the price. It was lunch so I got a burrito which again was fine but not special in any way. We were all remarking at the table how it was a bit overpriced for the quality of the food.","Unassuming Mexican restaurant with a classy and passionate menu. The mole verde is v good, not watery and flavorless like so many before it.The pina colada was just okay but anytime I've ever really enjoyed a pc it was too sweet to be anything but deadly so boundaries, y'know?","Everything on their menu is pleasure, and there's something for everyone... i'll explain.* Taco's - I compare all taco's to theirs [my faves: steak, pork, chicken]. they're the best tasing/best deal EVER!* Burrito - It's filling and super cost effective, if you need a meal to last [I vote the steak burrito].* Fish of the Day - It's always changing depending on what's in season. this is a super healthy choice that's always savory and filled with flavor!For apps:  the crab tostadas are genius, as is the guac, as are their ceviche's, as it the memelita.. i mean EVERYTHING is amazing!My only challenge with Amaranto is that I can't stop ordering more drinks. Whether it's the 'Jicama' or the 'Tamarind'.. cuz those add up, if you're not paying attention.","The quaint restaurant is right off the corner, a block away from Maria Hernandez park.I came on a Thursday night, and was seated immediately. There wasn't a lot of people, from the usual nights I've passed by this place. The service was nice. Offered me water as soon as I sat down, and took my order as soon as I was ready.I ordered the fish tacos ($3.75) and short rib with mole ($20) [price as of the time of review]. I was served the fish tacos first. It was hot, you'd know the food was cooked then and there. Biting into it, it was crunchy. The sauce, salsa, fish, and taco just fit perfectly together. Even the quantity of fish was plenty for you to taste the fish tempura. The short rib with mole was served after, it came with rice. The quantity was big enough, and the taste is superb. The mole sauce had a bit of tangy sour taste it in, but not too overpowering; the short rib was a so tender, you dont need a knife; and the green beans weren't under/overcooked. The only downside was that the short rib didn't have it's own solo taste in it, but I guess it wouldn't need to because of the mole sauce was perfect to pair with it. I think with the short rib, you can easily share it with 2 people, but if you're so hungry, it can pretty much get you full.Overall, the food, service, and price is good. I would definitely come back. This is a good place for dinner with family and friends, or a date. (If it's a first date, don't bring them here. Because if it doesn't work out between you two, they will definitely come back here and bring their own people, and running into them would be awkward!) Anyway, I definitely recommend this place.",Amaranto Mexican Restaurant
98,"I was so eager to try the food here based on the reviews but was so disappointed when the food here turned out alright but not great. I ordered an oxtail with rice and peas, curry chicken roti, and the potato salad. The oxtail with rice and peas was the most flavored. The roti was dry and a little too bland as was the potato salad. Maybe I need to go back and try it another time. The portions are very nice and the staff were welcoming.","There is no shortage of lunch options on church avenue. However, most of those options are not very good.  I work in the area and haven't really had much luck finding great food around there.  So after driving past this place for years, I finally decided to check them out.  And I am very glad that I did. Suzy's is a gem. A small, corner storefront full of amazing, delicious and flavorful food. Along with super friendly counter staff. I didn't know whether to go with the oxtail or the chicken so I got both.  And both were excellent; just the right amount of flavor and heat. They even threw in a double on the house.  I also tried the roti; it was good. Not the best I've ever had but still good. But overall I can't really say anything negative. It was fresh and it was good. Come here with an appetite; you'll want to try multiple things.","We were walking home from prospect park when we wanted to grab a snack - which again, turned into grabbing something for dinner since the portions are not snack sized. We shared a curry chicken roti and stewed oxtail over rice and beans. The chicken curry roti is packed full of flavor with really chunky potatoes and soft chicken - over time the roti did get soggy, but not sure how it felt dry and soggy at the same time. The oxtail can't really be called stewed since it wasn't soft/supple as I would expect stewed meat to be but the rice and beans with the sauce is really slammin. Price point for the portions is appropriate. I'll be back to try the other rotis!","This place had great veggie roti, doubles, and currant and coconut rolls. All so good!! The Maulby was very bitter but probably an acquired taste if you're ready for it. Wonderful food with a little cute outdoor seating!","Ordered for pickup but ended up sitting there to eat. Service was fast and courteous. Food was good. -double: my first double so I have nothing to compare it to but it was good. -curry goat roti: curry was milder than expected  but it was still delicious and flavorful. Having the bone in makes this impossible to eat as a hand item, would plan to eat as a dish or order with rice and peas.Would recommend and will def be returning.","Awesome roti shop. My fiancée and I shared a veggie roti with potatoes, pumpkin, chickpeas, and spinach. The roti bread was wrapped up like a burrito. The roti bread is very flakey so I'd recommend eating it without picking it up or using a fork and knife. The filling was well seasoned and is was super flavorful. I was hoping for more spiciness but my fiancée was quite happy with the spiciness level. Service was very quick. They do not have a restroom for customers but do have wet wipes.",Suzy's Roti Parlour
99,"Overall food came in good portions and was delicious. - Had the zuccini with shrimp wrapped inside, packed with flavors! - Coworker had squash soup, it was flavorful as well- I had the chicken which was cooked very nicelyOne thing I would change... the live music. I couldnt appreciated as much as I would like and had a bad headache after sitting in for so long, however, it could be just me not classy enough to understand it.","We love ceviche, so since we were in Brooklyn over mother's day weekend for a wedding, I decided to look for a place to get some. We came for lunch on that Saturday and the place was pretty empty. I ordered a pisco sour with passion fruit which wasn't that good. We weren't that hungry so we just ordered a bunch of different ceviches and a grilled octopus. The ceviches came on a cool platter since we got the sampler and picked 3 from the menu. All of them were extremely salty which overpowered any of the flavors they might have had. We were extremely disappointed so we decided to order another ceviche dish that was supposedly more of the ""classic"" taste - the fish and seafood in it were poor quality and the flavors were, again, non-authentic and way too salty. Even the grilled octopus sucked - it wasn't grilled/charred enough so it was very slimy and gross. We were extremely disappointed that we came all that way and didn't like anything we ordered. Some of their other dishes looked pretty good (from other tables that we could see), but I guess we'll never get to try them.","The food was good enough, (I had the Black Paella), but the service was terrible.  I'm refering particularly to the blond woman who tends bar on Friday evenings. Firstly when I sat at the bar, (I was the only one sitting there mind you) and politely ordered a Martini she acted like I was putting her out by asking for a drink ""they don't usually do."" When I said I would tell her how if she didn't know, she snapped back...""I've been a bartender for 14 years I know how to make one!""To which I told her that no offense was intended, it's just that after what she said before I ordered...well...Anyway she basicly ignored me for the rest of the meal and when I requested to take part of it to go she basically tossed the bag with it at me without a glance in my direction.Ask yourself....with all the restaurants in Brooklyn why would you spend your hard earned money for such abysmal service.",This is by FAR the best Peruvian food in NYC!! This is a husband and wife team that brings forward this amazing family restaurant! I started with the Ceviche sampler that was insane!For my entree I had the Skirt steak and onions which is what I normally want to eat at Peruvian restaurants.The Wine list was fantastic and they made a killer Pisco sour.And chef Miguel gave my wife and I a house special Prawns in the shell which we LOVED!!,"Had an amazing dinner last night at Surfish 2 located at 530 3rd Avenue in Brooklyn!! We started with some Cocktails (Mezcal margarita and Pisco Mojitos) for Apps. We had Yuka tater's with this amazing green dipping sauce. Then the Wife had Cauliflower soup and I had a soft shell crab bisque. For the entree I had this massive plate of Squid ink rice Payea For desert we shared Chef Miguel's special, I can't pronounce it but it was like a bowl of crushed ice with berry's on top and a Peruvian fruit pop in the middle, absolutely fantastic This is a great spot to stop in and grab a quick bite for lunch and even better for date night to take your time and just chill. They also have a great Wine selection, I had a really nice glass of Rascal Pinot Noir from Oregon and the Wife had a really nice Bordeaux Blanc....Cheers","Great food, service and ambience. Our favorite dishes are the salmon and hamachi ceviches (salmon being our favorite). Fried Oyster with spicy tuna was also yummy but the other ceviches steal the prize We always get the ribs when we come here. Has the Corvino this time good but heavy",Surfish Bistro
100,"The atmosphere is great, the food wasn't that much, the service is fine but they seem a bit angry. In general I would not come again unless I wanna drink coffee or something and enjoy the place.","I walked in here on my way to class to grab a drink. It was my first time here & I ordered the Matcha bubble tea. I love me some bubble tea so I was really looking forward to it. However this was the worst I've ever had. The reasons this was so bad is because it was powdery & not properly mixed or chilled...every sip drew up little clumps of unmixed powder, which was super nasty, and Made it chalky and bitter tasting. Super gross, and cost over $6. I tried to mix it up, stirred it multiple times throughout the duration of my class, and I still never fully got rid of these powdery clumps. Plus, it was warm! I ordered it iced, but what I got was room temperature at best with a few pieces of melty ice. This was my first time at The Market, and Maybe this was just an off day...but it was so unpleasant that I had to leave this feedback.","Ordered the Sichuan sesame noodles to stay, they packaged the meal to go which I was hoping to avoid because I disliked the thought of hot liquids in plastic To-go containers. Soup was rather oily but flavorful.","I'm a little late in posting but here it goes. So after having a few tacos around the corner with friends, I was in the mood for some dessert and the closest option was a donut shop around the corner. Unfortunately, the shop was closed and donuts were no longer an option. Well, all was not lost because my friend suggested the market which was right down the street. The market is such a cool spot. It's small in size but it only gives you a feel of a french Cafe. The safe is very friendly and the options are plentiful. The pastries are so fresh and the food items are delectable. You won't find anything like it in the area. I honestly walked out of there with several treats. I really had sensory overload, everything looked so good. I'm an instant fan and I plan to return very soon.","Wow... from the appearance of this place you would think they would invest some time and effort on the quality and taste of their food but what a mistake I made. I order the Lou Rou fan which is nothing like the real deal Taiwanese which should have pork belly yet all they have is ground pork with mushroom. Even the radishes were bland for that dish. Then I ordered the sesame noodles but received some hybrid dish because it was supposed to be cold yet it was piping hot. Last dish item was the chili-oil wonton which was just some cheap wonton with literal chili oil. I must say their presentation is nice but taste wise they might be able to fool the hipsters around here but not Asians who grew up eating this stuff. As for the bubble tea, the bubbles were so hard and sweet they shouldn't even be sold... I was hoping for a gem in Brooklyn but unfortunately this was a great disappointment. Also, the music they played while eating sounded as if they were about to sacrifice something...","Public Service Announcement: Do not waste your money on bubble tea here!  It is a sad, lazy shadow of what bubble tea is supposed to be.  This is just an iced tea with boba and a splash of milk on top!  For the good stuff, you're better off going to Inital. The rest of the food is decent, if a little overpriced.",The Market
101,"Good food but really slow (even there is no other customers) and bad service.Had food there yesterday, and waited more than 15 mins to get check (while the waitresses just chilling there). And when they finally came, I noticed they didn't give me my credit card back. Almost left the store without credit card. On the of that, there was no apology at all.",I mean seriously the ramen is incredible. I've tried all of them.  They close between lunch and dinner btw. Happened to me before. Hands down my local hangover cure spot lol,First time here and will be my last time. Pretty annoyed that a chicken based ramen has to have pork meat or no meat at all. Most places have an option to have chicken as the protein. I asked the owner to waitress to substitute for chicken and she said no. She claimed she asked the owner and he said no. We are literally their only customers at the moment and now I'm seeing why. I'll stick with other places in Williamsburg instead of coming back here.,"This hole in the wall is a literal stone's throw from my apartment and I never knew it existed. I love a good bowl of ramen as its comforting and a lot of love goes into the broth.  I'll throw it out there... if sharing a large table with strangers isnt your thing, or you prefer your own table, this place may not be for you. I tend to not like sitting so close to people I dont know but I was in good company so I went with an open mind. Their list of offerings is great. I really like their pork belly bao which I have i ordered for delivery. The Tonbara Shoyu Ramen is my absolute favorite; they offer the soup classic or bukkake. I opted for classic. They also have vegan ramen which is great for those days you just want something delicious but also want to feel you're doing your body a favor taking a break from animal products... of if you're actually vegan.  Like most traditional Ramen, it's not necessarily cheap but its certainly worth the price. Will be back for sure! Winter is coming!","I LOVE this place. The ramen bowls are my addiction! But at $13 a pop I unfortunately can't eat here every day or i would. I usually order for pick up and the staff is always super nice and never messes up the order. I've eaten inside a few times and also a great experience. It's on Varet st kind of tucked away from the dirty mess all over Flushing Ave and Bway so it's never very crowded yet always has a steady flow of customers inside so you know others agree. I live 2 blocks from here, for the last 10 years, and I am so happy this place it here. Def a great date night spot, to chill with friends, or if you live in this depressing hood and want to show your visiting parents/friends in town that your choice in apartment location is not all like an abandoned mental institution whose sanitation department exploded over a mile in all directions. Not that I don't have a twisted love for the area, but it isn't where you would intentionally commute to for a nice meal. But back to this place, they have alcohol too!","The food is flavorful and tasty.The decor is hip, modern, and perfect compliment to the delicious food (AND they have clean bathrooms!)The wait staff are friendly.Had ramen here once or twice in my day. Always tastes great and I am stuffed full afterwards.The last time I chose the bukkake style pork ramen, and it was a fantastic choice!Random experience: Walked in here once on a warm summer day and they had no air conditioning on. Walked right back out. Went to the BedStuy location that day and it was the same thing. Maybe they hadn't started using their A/C yet?? But that was just on that one specific day. Hopefully that was just an 'off' one.",Samurai Papa
102,Hey allIts not good nor bad. Its ok for one time but apart from it mehh. Ok starters ok ramen. Atmosphere was cool.What got me off was little thingsSuch as chilli oil bottles leakingSpice bottle brokenPlace had a smellPOS had oil drippings Needs a little clean up.Apart from that not bad noodles.,"When I walked into this place, I really liked how small it was with bar seating only. I also liked that the menu was also in Japanese. It gave this sense of...authenticity. The server was quick and efficient thoguh not very friendly. Didn't really greet me and just handed me the menu and water as I sat down without looking at me, but honestly I don't mind if the service is quick, which it was. I was really craving a pork bun, so I ordered that along with the shoyu ramen. I normally go for the miso, but it said it contained peanut butter......that just reminds me of pad thai, which I don't like, so I just went with shoyu. The buns were a nice size and I knew I would only eat one because of the ramen. I ended up eating only one though because it wasnt very good. It was a pity though because the pork was actually quite good. Well seasoned and juicy. I think it was missing some sort of pickle on top of the cabbage, but the bun itself just wasn't very good. It was....dough-y, not light at all. Just very dense. I brought the other one home but probably won't eat it.The ramen....the broth was ok. Thoguh to me it tasted very....pre-made? Not sure how to describe it but it just tasted like it was some broth you buy ready to use. The pork was very juicy with lots of fat which was good, but overly sweet. Again, it just didn't taste fresh. The noodles were all stuck together still from when they were frozen or refrigerated. It really just tasted like something quick out together with pre-made ingredients....I was very disappointed given the high ratings this place had.","First things first. There was only one chair open in this tiny ramen spot and there was remains of an order of a half eaten edamame. The barkeep didn't even clear it after she said I could sit there. She continued to organize whatever it was behind the bar while I sat here with half eaten remains in front of me....disgusting. She may have forgotten she gave me a menu because it took forever for her to come back and take my order, despite the menu being pushed away from me and clearly I wasn't looking at it anymore. I order Kariage soba. She then tells me they don't have soba....would've been nice to know that before I scanned the menu and decided on it. So I opt for vegan ramen. This place's broth is always so salty. Yeah they give you a side of clear brother to dilute the oversalted broth but who wants to eat all that frigging salt in the first place??Ramen comes with ""vegan"" ramen noodles. Aka Spaghetti noodles. I HATE When ramen places use semolina pasta noodles....it's NOT ramen. This place is like the part of town, too cool for itself. Get over ya'self!  It was actually one of the worst ramens I've ever had in my life. Second to cup o'noodles. Someone please open up a real ramen house and put these guys out of business.","Papa Was a Rollin' Stone Remix - The TemptationsIt was the third of September That day I'll always remember, yes I will (actually) 'Cause that was the day I took a little stride I never got a chance to try him Never heard nothin' about him Yelp I'm depending on you to tell me the truth Yelp just pointed me that direction and said, son Samurai Papa was a Ramen gemstone Wherever he laid his broth was his home",If you come for lunch on a Saturday and order the Karaage chicken bento make sure you ask for your chicken well done because mine was served RARE. With about 4 servings of rice sprinkled with black sesame to dress up the mediocre garbage they call food. Server was great. Menus smelled like it was soaked in Bonito stank water. The other samurai mommas and Pappas are great. Get it together.,"Samurai papa is good if you're looking for a quick ramen fix in bed-stuy. The both is salter than most I've had but the toppings are better and the unique bowls it's served. I think we order gyoza too. It was too doughy for me, like when you're about to grab it and it's overly delicate BUT all good.Team is nice and attentive (small shop so you can't miss a body). And oh, it does get busy quickly! Music is chill.",Samurai Papa BS
103,"WOWOWOWOWOWOW. The food here is amazing from the apps to the main course. (I didn't have dessert). Friendly and attentive waitstaff. You must get the sea bass with the grapes if they have it! Fluke ceviche and octopus were also top-notch. Only downside is the price = $$$$, but you get what you pay for!","Didn't feel like this place was as amazing as everyone says it is. I'm being honest here. Upon entry I was told there would be a wait for the bar, which was fine. As I watched from the outside door, I started noticing about 6 tables empty. They remained empty for about 40-45 minutes. The hostess kept turning people away. This place takes reservations, which is also fine. However that being said, I couldn't help but think that this was attributed to poor time management on behalf of the staff. At one point about 5 tables left. No one ever came to replace these tables until about an hour. I asked the hostess to alert me when something opened up at the bar. She kinda seemed checked out and clueless. I don't like to stand hovering over peoples tables because I feel that it's rude. So I waited outside but felt like I was going to miss my spot at the bar because she wasn't clearly paying attention. Now for the food. I felt that it was good but nothing over the top. This place was giving off somewhat of a Latin vibe with its dishes such as ceviche and Ecuadorian something else that I can't remember but on the menu. I appreciate Latin food as it's a childhood staple of mine. However,  if I go out to eat Italian that's what I expect. I don't really take to places that have an identity crisis. It's cool if you want to serve up different food but I would just like to know where I am. Staff was very friendly at the bar and made the experience a whole lot better. Decor was cool. Again nothing that made me say I gotta make it back to this place. Maybe people love it because it stands out among the rest in the neighborhood but wouldn't want to be trekking here thinking I'm about to have a life changing experience.","I wanted to really love this restaurant, however for the second time, it has severely disappointed .The service here is sloppy and poor. I went with several friends mid week and didn't have a booking however was able to get a table based on the premise it had to be available for a booking in 75 mins. Easy. We only needed a quick dinner and were moving on for drinks anyway. However from the second we were seated, we were pressured to order and once our starters were bought out, had our plates taken from us before we had even finished eating. Even when we mentioned that we weren't done, they continued clearing our plates as our mains were ready to be put down. Talk about rushing the customer! All the while, still plenty of time to eat, as the reservation was not coming for another 15 minutes.This entire experience was poorly handled, and this is not the first time I've had such bad service here. A real disappointment given how nice the space is. A word of advice, don't say yes to seating customers if you're only going to rush them, rush their meals and basically push them out the door.","Love the ambiance and feel of this place! Came on a Sunday with the family and everyone was pleased. Great service from the hostess, waitress was super friendly throughout our entire service for brunch. Lovely day to sit outside. Got a few apps to share but the octopus was the star! (Not sure if it's under the app section or main meal) Cocktails also amazing! Had the cocktail with mezcal and pineapple. Excited to return and try something new!","I've been to this place three times now and it has never disappointed.  The chargrilled octopus is bloody delicious.  The pasta with black pepper is everything you hope a pasta should be-- simple but extremely satisfying.  The mushroom pasta which they sometimes switch out to a ravioli is a must order as well. Their flank steak is prepared flawlessly.  Overall there's a good vibe at the restaurant, it's very chill and laid back. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. It's a really great neighborhood restaurant and I'll keep coming back.","This is a date spot. Evelina is everything you want if you're looking to impress someone. It's a beautiful space with what seems like a perpetually attractive crowd. They've designed a menu that quite literally makes me want to eat everything on it, and luckily the execution usually lives up to its promise, and the food isn't just tasty, but gorgeous as well.This is Brooklyn though, and you're going to pay for all this, so make sure you're bringing someone who's worth it. My wife brought me, which was probably a bad call. Pasta, fish, salads...we enjoyed almost everything, and the service most of all. The staff here cares about the details, and it shows. There was a tiny little clothespin holding a tiny sprig of herb to my excellent cocktail. And I liked it. A new favorite restaurant that could be my favorite restaurant if it were just a smidge more affordable and a little more consistent in deliciousness (nothing was bad, just some dishes were more worth the price tag than others). Judging by how hard it is to get a good reservation though, they probably don't need to make things cheaper on my account.Definitely coming back.",Evelina
104,"My brother and I ordered food from this restaurant using Grub hub and the first thing I have to compliment them on is how quick they got the order to us. We ordered the Mac and cheese and two orders of wings one extra hot and the other garlic. Unfortunately when we got the order a good amount of the cheese spilled out of the bag and onto the napkins, utensils and the other food containers. The Mac & Cheese had a powdery taste it wasn't nasty but it was just weird and the peri sauce wasn't noticeable to us. My wings were okay nothing amazing but also nothing to complain about, my brother said they were spicy but he was shocked they described it to be their hottest sauce as it didn't taste like it. Overall I like their speed and that the food was hot. The customer service is amazing as well, if you're in the neighborhood check it out.","2.8 miles isn't far enough to keep us apart. Since our first day meeting I've been hooked. Peri... I need to end this today. Tonight was our last night together. Not because of how you taste. I've tried quite a few different things-Seasoned fries-dip it with the chilli sauce and say thanks Shirrell after that bite.Lamb- seasoned well, tender, mouth watering, succulent. I sucked your bone dry!wings- tried very hot, mango passion, and I can't remember the other flavor but all left me wanting more and more.chicken burger- pepper jack cheese, very hot.... sigh you were my favoriteUnfortunately you make me so happy you're expanding my waist line so we must part ways so I can figure out how to prioritize my life. Summer body starting soon and with around I won't fit in my bikini in March for Jamaica..... I'll miss you but I need a few months Btw we've never taken 1 pic together smh but we'll make up for lost times soon.","I have had peri peri in South Africa before, so I was excited to see a place open up not to far from where I used to live. I've had the chicken a number of times both mild and hot and I 100% prefer the hot flavoring. The mild is dare I say too mild and the hot is just right. The chicken is juicy and flavorful and a solid size for the price. I also once tried the lamb, which was really really REALLY delicious, I'm working on replicating that marinade, like damn! lol but it's pricey and I'm not sure I can justify the price, so will stick with the wings. The fries are fine, nothing amazing, not terrible. Solid new bed Stuy place!",Omg the food is awesome. First time trying them and I am in love. Wished they would of gave us utensils n napkins but other than that it's great. The wings are juicy. The lamb chops were cooked to perfection not dry at all. Will be ordering again.,"I like Peri Peri. Service is friendly and consistent and the wait for food is never long. I typically just come for the seasoned fries. Most recently I tried the falafel wrap and it was small but filling, and not very memorable. I like falafel crispy and this was the soft, packed kind. I opted out of their signature seasoning salt on the falafel since I'd previously had it on the veggie burger and found it way too salty. The sauces lean on the spicy side, so I use just a tad. And unless I get the fries plain (no seasoning) the sauces are too strong. All in all, Peri is a good stop for reasonably priced, made to order fresh fries and fast casual eats.",I had lambchops that was delicious .. and the wings are awesome . employees are nice people. a place for good eats,Peri Peri Grill House
105,"Reasons Why This Is My Favorite Spot From Which To Get Thai Food Delivered:1. More often than not, I get pad kee mao (drunken noodles, here and at a lot of places). Thaiholic's is tops. Consistently. Beware though, I rock a medium spicy and sometimes it's too hot for my wife to eat.2. My wife rolls with pad thai, and I hate pad thai...but I hate it less here. It's actually got flavor (even the mild), and the tofu (I know, she's the worst) is plentiful and delicious.3. Every once in a while you might want a pineapple fried rice with some shrimp. The shrimp are huge, well-cooked, and there's more of them than you expect.4. The Thai dumplings (that mix of shrimp and chicken that seems ill-advised but tastes delicious) are money. Since nobody is perfect, here are the downsides as I see them:1. It's a little bit pricier than a lot of their competitors. However, I'll pay an extra dollar or two to be happier with my meal every time.2. They charge $2 for a side of peanut sauce. This is a travesty, but since I've been unable to recreate Thai delivery peanut sauce in my own kitchen (holler if you've got the recipe), I'll suffer through it.3. The papaya salad leaves a lot to be desired. Squeeze some lime over it to make it passable, or just don't order it.","Came here a few hours ago for take out. Ordered the shrimp drunken noodles and the veggie dumplings.  I won't be back here.  I told the person over the phone not spicy. My food was the spiciest dish I've ever tasted.  Overall, I would say typical for Thai food.  The veggie dumplings were good but I think it's a bit over priced","Got my food late, and its cold and I had to pay full price on food that's cold. Why is it cold?due to the delivery guy not understanding English ,had delivered to the wrong address and even when I tried to make it easier to find me, I told him to meet me on the corner. FF, the calamari was not season well and it was cold and my calamari pad thai, the calamari in my pad thai taste like rubber. Not a good look and it all tastes awful. I cannot believe I paid the full price of this.","There are actually quite a few Thai places in the neighborhood. I have tried them all, and I have to say that Thai Holic is the best, hands down. I've never actually been to the restaurant, so this review is on the delivery experience. I've ordered from here for a couple years now. The food is on point and consistently good. I've never had an incorrect up order and the quality is always very very good. Prices are great for the quantity of food you get.My personal faves are: drunken noodles, green curry, spicy basil with rice, Tom yum fried rice, chicken wings, and calamari. In fact, I've never had anything from here that was actually bad.",not sure what the fuss is about although happy to report finally properly hot thaitiny spot with some attempt at cute decor service ok did not go to bathroom area but heard from dinner-mates  area to get there very dirty big portions but preparation and seasoning lackingshared shrimp and pork dumplings tasty but super thick dough and a bit undercooked mains whitefish curry and initially salmon currysalmon bone dry and tastelessseemed like cooked from frozenwhen I tell waitress salmon not properly cooked she says that's how they make it only option is get something else ??what they can't even try and cook the salmon better so i get pad thai initially way too much sauce with strong acidic element next day flavors blended better a bit pricier than most thai drinks were weak but tasty overall would not come backnothing special even if you are in neighborhood much better Brooklyn  thai options,"I've been to this spot a few times and I have to say each time has been quite delicious. The two noodle dishes I've had here have been exceptional (Sesame noodles and Drunken noodles). I also got a glowing lychee mojito last time, glowing mainly because the base they bring it on has LED lights inside. Very attractive presentation and a delicious drink.  As I've come in later in the evening several times, service has always been fast, however I have a feeling it gets pretty packed for the usual dinner and lunch hours. Kitchen seems to have no less than 10 cooks at all times. TLDR: Best Thai spot I've been to in Brooklyn.",Thai Holic
106,"Terrible service, had to get up and flag staff for anything and everything. (They were not busy)Food was in small portions and again staff never checked table for more bread.Was hoping food would make up for indifferent and slow service. Lamb chops were over cooked, under seasoned and served with breakfast potatoes? TLDR; Bad service and mediocre food, will not return","I'd give this place 2 stars for the food and because its a BYO, 0 stars for the service. We came here on a Saturday night for a birthday dinner. We called ahead for a table of 7 people for 9pm..We then proceeded to get the worst service possible. If it wasn't a special occasion and we had a smaller group I would have left immediately. We were constantly trying to get the waiter's attention for anything..to ask for water refills or for them to take our order and we were constantly met with dismissive and rude attitudes. There was no one else in the restaurant so we really couldn't understand why the service was so terrible!!That all being said, I had a lamb dish which was really delicious but after my experience I would never recommend anyone I know to patronize this restaurant.",I was very disappointed. I ordered scallops and did not realize it was an appetizer for $19.00!!! It would've been kind of them to call to confirm that's all I wanted. When I called to ask about the small portion it seemed to have been funny to them. The delivery person also called to complain about how they treated him..as if I could do something for him. Scallops were flavorless. Really not worth $19.00,"For a reason I can't fathom, they don't advertise that they have a BEAUTIFUL backyard terrace. Imagine sipping a watermelon mimosa in the sun in your own backyard, now add delicious food and you're at Seed. Wonderful food, speedy service, and a quintessential park slope ambience.","I came here for my birthday and I really wanted to like this place as I love  Mediterranean food. I chose this place as it has high ratings.I order the lamb skewers platter ($22) and it came with rice, yogurt sauce and lamb. The lamb was dry and some pieces were a bit too raw and was not very flavorful.Mezes -Platter with a variety of dips and 2 grape leaves. The grape leaves stuffed with jasmine rice taste the best. Most of the dips were rather bland. Hummus- Not as good as the one from Agora. Chicken skewers ($21) platter- This was the saving grace. The chicken was juicy and very well done. The bread did not match with the food serve. They were dinner rolls and did not go with the meze dips. The dinner rolls were more appropriate for a steak dinner. I was expecting more of a flat fluffy bread like the ones they have at Agora (Turkish Restaurant in the upper east side).Service was very dry. The waitress was not welcoming and was mostly in the back and the restaurant only had two other tables filled. The service was lacking and the flavors were also lacking. Will not be back.","I've been to Seed several times in recent years and always leave satisfied. It is a quiet restaurant, with the friendliest if staff. They may not rotate their menu as much as other nearby restaurants BUT what makes Seed great is that they do a mid-size menu exceptionally well. Portions are appropriate and flavors bold. Don't miss out on this Park Slope gem!",Seed
107,"Had lunch with the family and my kids enjoyed it.. especially My son who is a picky eater. The portions size is perfect, not too much and not too little. The Forma salad was sooo good! Being that it has tuna in it and I am not usually a fan of tuna in my salad, but you couldn't taste it. I loved the pippette ragu and Budino- chocolate caramel pudding dessert.","Everything you want in a fast casual place. High quality every time, quick, reasonable prices. Have been many times and will continue to go back.","Yum! Incredibly: * good* quick* affordableGo. Eat. Repeat. It is cafeteria style, order at the counter and they bring it to you. Not ideal but worth it!","Forma Pasta Factory is a beautifully designed Italian spot located in the heart of Greenpoint offering delicious appetizers, pasta dishes, and salads. I love the fast casual concept here. Patrons can order their food in the front and grab a seat wherever, no tipping required. All their pastas are also made fresh in-house. On my visit with my friend, we ordered the pappardelle bolognese, the tagliatelle scampi, the forma salad, and the arancini (yes we can eat). I absolutely loved both the presentation and taste of both pasta dishes. The pappardelle was simply executed with a bold and flavorful meat marinara sauce. The tagliatelle included sautéed shrimp, white wine, and a lemon butter sauce that brought all the flavors together perfectly. The forma salad was a nice lighter dish to pair with our pastas. I liked the arancini but in comparing it to my other arancini experience from Arancini Bros at Smorgasburg, this does not compare, though it was still tasty. High recommend checking this place out!","Pipette Ragu - 4/5Spaghetti Pomodoro - 2/5Cauliflower - 4/5Hygiene - 1/5The dishes are small by nyc standards, so don't expect to leave full! I wanted to love the sht out of this place and have been meaning to dine here for months since I grew up and live in an Italian neighborhood, I know what good Italian food tastes like.The pipette ragu was tasty, I would've preferred my pasta to be a bit more on the softer side though. The spaghetti pomodoro, reminded me of a slightly tastier version of chef boyardee's sauce, because it had that same level of sweetness, but had more of a flavor depth to it that I can't quite explain. The meatballs are surprisingly, freaking small, but bigger then the chef boyardee version. Personally, I wasn't fond of this dish.Side of cauliflower that had tasty sauce, HOWEVER, and this is a huge no no and costed stars from me due to unhygienic food handling: The person who took care of the garnishing, plated the cooked cauliflower with his bare hands, that's right, SANS gloves, and placed the garnishes on top, then served directly to me. NYS law prohibits bare hand contact with ready-to-eat foods!","Absolutely lovely. Pasta was the best I've had in awhile. I wanted to try everything but they were making a batch of meatballs that smelled so good I figured I should start there. It was a good call. The spaghetti was cooked to a perfect al dente. I was pleasantly surprised to see smaller meatballs instead of 1 or two huge ones. The sauce was well balanced and not overly salty or acidic. Delicious, and I don't feel like I need a nap afterward. The service was great and the space is cute. Glad to have them in the neighborhood!",Forma Pasta Factory
108,"Very under whelming experience. The best part of myExperience was leaving. Despite the fact that the establishment was relatively empty, it took forever to get our food. As far as the food, steamed with oil and garlic is the only way I can describe it. My drink sadly  was no better Than a wine cooler. Long story short you should probably skip this place for claw daddy's or just purchase the crab legs yourself from your local seafood market.","Went here for a Friday night dinner with some girlfriends of mine and first things first I'm not a crab person, more a lobster shrimp girl. Our drinkkkk was so bomb !!! (see photo) I couldn't tell you how happy I was with it. On to the food; I wanted to get the shrimp in bag with the works (corn potatoes lobster) unfortunately the menu states they have Argentinian shrimp and when I went to confirm with the waitress they said they were the prawn shrimps . I ended up getting a fried shrimp sandwich which was Ok (didn't take a picture of it). Service; the waitress was nice and did what she had to do, she was extremely attentive. What I didn't like was the bus boy ; how he just dropped our food without a care wasn't my cup of tea. I understand they have to clean the tables upon people leaving to get more customers in but they should really use something that has no scent, not pleasant to inhale while you're trying to eat. Now the bathroom ; I saw a sign that said not to throw tissue in the toilet; PLEASE FOR THE SAKE OF SQUEAMISH PEOPLE !!! Get a garbage can with a lid, let's just I was extremely mortified.","Came here with my sister & was super excited as I had been craving crab legs. We arrived approximately an hour after opening and the place was already packed. We were offered a seat at the bar and ordered a drink, the fisherman's drink (or something like that). It was basically juice with swedish fish in it. Our table was available fairly quickly and our order was taken promptly. I ordered crab legs with shrimp and the fried oysters. My sister had crab legs & mussels. The fried oysters were disgusting, don't even bother. The crab legs & shrimp were good, the shaking sauce was good but spicier than I expected. The mussels were kinda tough and the sauce was a bit oily. I'm only giving 2 stars because that night I had the worst stomach pains. When I called my sister she said her stomach was hurting as well. This cannot be a coincidence. The 2 stars are for the short wait time & friendly waitress.","I had a very positive experience at Shaking Crab. I was expecting a long wait as it said reservations were totally out that night but we surprisingly got seated right away. My friend and I split the Cajun fries which were nice and tasty. I got the snow crab legs with the shaking crab sauce at medium and thought they were delicious. Super garlicky just like I like it. Word to those who like mega spice: I personally found my medium to be spicy - not crazy spicy but a nice kick of added flavor. My friend Marla got the spiciest level and literally added chili powder after and didn't find it spicy at all. So if you are into flavors so spicy they may kill you, it may not be spicy enough here. Knocked down a star for slow service. Being that the food is spicy I would expect them to refill water more frequently as we were regularly out. Otherwise I liked everything.","Went here yesterday with my best friend because of the ratings.Nice atmosphere. Enjoying the outside  balcony. Our wait staff was Daniel very knowledgeable on the menu n helped us make great selection.My bff selected the fried shrimp basket.. low quality on the fried shrimp heavy on the frieds... Alaskan king crab legs which seemed a little pricey for me ($36 for 1 lb) which she found quite salty.My choice was spicy calamari... mussels.Althought the food was plentiful and the Cole slaw was delicious we found the seasoning to be bit too salty a little hard to keep eating.If I should return to this place a lesson learned I ask that the season be on the side which will allow me to control the salty intake in the bag.Love the idea of the coming in plastic bags less messy.But do go you will enjoy the food, drinks and corner location.",I had the wonderful chance to experience this wonderful fairly new restaurant. I am always cautious when trying a new restaurant but I was pleasantly surprised with Shaking Crab  the ambience is laid back and you can get comfortable and enjoy the best that this restaurant has to offer.The lobster roll is delicious and nicely season. The wings and fries were great and seasoned to perfection but the absolute cherry  on top of this cake was the gumbo and please don't forget to add those shrimp! I can't forget the absolute best bartender I've ever had the pleasure to know. Ms. April gives a new meaning to doing your job with a smile. She's fabulous. Tell her Hope sent you.,Shaking Crab- Brooklyn
109,"I had high expectations for this place but it was a total let down. Got 3 dishes, curry puffs, chicken pad Thai and duck soup. First the puffs were mostly dough. The Pad Thai was very average. The duck soup was so flavorless, I would never order this again. So 2 subpar dishes + 1 average = Meh","I haven't ordered from here for 6 months because of 4 awful experiences... in a row. See my past review for details - it's too ugly for me to rehash.Tonight was the first order I've made since those experiences, and they screwed up again - in 3 huge ways.1) I came to pick up an order. Provided the name for the order, and even recited the phone number that placed the order to them before receiving the food. They hand me a bag and I leave. Turns out, it's the wrong order! They proceed to call my girlfriends phone on repeat, demanding we bring the food back. So I walk all the way back with the wrong order. 2) When I arrive, they didn't offer a thank you for coming back, or an apology for their mistake, or a refund for the trouble. They offered me a diet coke. I said thanks but no thanks, expressed how disappointed I was, and mentioned that this was the 5th order - IN A ROW - they had absolutely botched. The server started giggling. Literally. And asked, ""Ok. So what do you want then..?"" I said, ""I want nothing. Take your diet coke."" Removed the soda from the bag, handed it to them, and left without another word. 3) I return home to a cold plate of Pad Kee Mow. In my second bite, I get a f***ing fingernail. There was a long, jagged fingernail in the second bite I took. The chicken was also mildly spoiled with a funky, awful aftertaste, but the fingernail was the final straw. I only write 5 star and 1 star reviews on Yelp. Those are the only things worth the time. And 90% of the reviews I've written have been 5 stars. But this is the SECOND TIME I'VE HAD TO WRITE A 1 STAR REVIEW BECAUSE THIS PLACE ABSOLUTELY SUCKS. They used to be my absolute favorite thai place in NY. Undeniably incredible. But this is unacceptable.","The quality has gone way down, portions are shrinking, and prices are increasing. What gives?I've eaten here at least once a week for nearly a year. Today, I ordered the Panang Curry to-go, but somehow only got a half order? The portion size barely filled the takeout receptacle! To put salt in the wound, all the vegetables were undercooked, and the curry itself was cold... By undercooked, I mean the vegetables were pretty much raw.Almost walked it back, but I was too hungry and tired to have them remake my order. I live a 3 minute walk away, and it's usually piping hot by the time I get home. My last order I received cold, smushed Curry Puffs. It was like they'd been left on a cold metal counter for 12 hours and then served to me. Used to be my favorite, not anymore.Two orders ago, I got the Pad Kee Mau. They forgot to apply flavor to the noodles and chicken. Had no flavor whatsoever. I had to apply my own sambal and hoisin sauce to try to make it edible, but still wasn't very good.Three orders ago the dressing they put on the Papaya Salad had gone bad and smelled awful. It made my whole apartment smell like SOUR FEET, to the point I thought there was a dead mouse decaying behind the couch. We actually moved the couch to look, before realizing it was the salad. Ridiculous.Disappointing, after a long work day to get stiffed on a place I've frequented and used to trust... Gave it the benefit of the doubt not once, not twice, but three times. By the fourth consecutive blunder, the need for a public shaming was due. Four botched orders, in a row.  I never write 1 star reviews, and had previously given them 5 stars, but enough is enough.","Loved the vibe of this corner Thai bistro. It's very cozy with trendy decor and the food and service are excellent.We got the Massaman curry with chicken, Thai basil fried rice with shrimp, and Pad See Ew with beef. The dishes were really flavorful and the quantities very generous.My daughter had the lychee sangria and I got the white berry sangria. Both were really delicious.We loved this place and will definitely be back!",Banging food. Clean. Fresh. Lunch special is bomb. Thai tea too sweet for me. Ask for Thai hot if you genuinely like it spicy.Recommend pad see ew with veggies,"Ordered delivery. Late night craving of Thai food. I decided to get siumai( pork dumpling) and Thai sausage. Both taste good! Dumpling sauce is a little too sweet for me but I can see why it goes well with the dumpling:) sausage comes with another type of sweet sauce. Delivery is free but price is 25% higher on some of the items compare to other Thai restaurants in the area. Example: Mr. Thai's chive cake $7 + $3 delivery fee Their delivery is free but their chive cake is $8.95 So if you will order multiple items, it's better to order else where and save money",Klom Klorm
110,"Tiny little place with interesting atmosphere and tasty food.  Large filling portions for reasonable price.  If you're searching for a unique experience, then try this.","Had their dumplings, beef and pork was good but vegetables dumps can skip that. The food was flavorful. Service was good but 1 big problem was the air conditioner wasn't cool enough for such a small place. Sweating while eating is never a hood thing. Hopefully they get that fixed.",I can't tell if I just don't like Tibetan cuisine or if this particular place just isn't good. I wish I had something to compare to.,"Please keep in mind this place is TINY! It will fit groups of 2, with a couple of tables that fit 4. If you're a group of 8, this is not your spot. If you're a group of 3, eh... you might get a table or you might have to wait.But! After you get a seat, this place is a wonderful hidden gem. Perfect for a cute date night! Food was delicious, the dumplings were my favorite (chicken or beef were fantastic, veggies were ok), and the garlic noodles were a crowd pleaser as well. My wife had the curry and they made it to order as to accommodate a food allergy. It seemed like everything was fresh and cooked to order!Service was fine and the staff were friendly. An easy commute as it's literally the building next to the Q train. We will definitely be going back and will see you there. Enjoy!  =)","I came to Cafe Tibet in the midst of a really bad cold, hoping to find some soup and spiciness that would clear out my congestion. The entrance is easy to miss, adjacent to the Cortelyou subway exit, and as others have noted, it's a jewel box of a place in terms of size. I ordered a takeaway of the tsam-thuk soup (made with tsampa barley and veggies) and the chicken momos with a hot chili dipping sauce. Note that the place is so small that there's no waiting area inside, so you're better off calling the order in ahead, if you're not eating in.The momos were fantastic--very filling and sinus-clearing when dipped into the chili sauce. I was able to save half of the portion for another meal. Unfortunately my batch of soup wasn't as successful--a thin watery and salty broth without many vegetables. I would definitely get the momos again and pass on the soup. The menu appears to have many other tempting dishes, and the staff preparing and serving the food seem really committed to what they are doing.CASH ONLY.",Just go (or don't because I'm selfish and don't want to share). This place is incredible. Amazing momo. Lentil soup is superb. Great service. It's so cheap. Right off the train. Just go. You won't regret it.,Cafe Tibet
111,"So many amazing food options so little room in my stomach. I found this place that did ice cream sandwiches with churros as the bun and another place that did Hennessey infused mini donuts. Cell reception isn't great down there, but who cares when there's so much great food around!","3.5. It's pretty much a big food court.   There were many vendors.  Once you go in, take the escalator downstairs and that's where the food hall is.  There is food from all over the place.  There's also beer in the food hall.","Ordered a Briskets sandwich for quick-bite. [Smoky & Tender] just what you needed on a hot summer day.Lovee- the seasoning on their Waffles fries, well it could be 10/10 if their fries wasnt that soggy soft. Maybe it was my preference that fries must be firm and hard.Overall [9/10]","If you ever find yourself in Brooklyn anywhere near the Dekalb Market Hall, by all means... stop by. There are so many options, even if you are not hungry, you can enjoy a good brew, juice, dessert or some good grub.We have had the opportunity to stop here several times for a meal, and have yet to be disappointed. Seating space can be at a premium doing busy times, but don't be deterred as you should be able to find a spot soon enough.I like the variety and diversity of foods here, we are really fortunate to have places like that this where we can try out new culinary concoctions or fall back on the old familiar ones, either way... you win.","Came here at 9 and 3/4 of the hall was closed before the advertised 10PM time. I do like the mix of vendors and it's a great place to grab food with an indecisive crowd. Depending on where you choose you can have a reasonably-priced meal or pay as much as a sit-down(better quality) restaurant. My favorites are the pierogi dudes, the crepe place by the escalator, and the churros by the Ample Hills. Han Dynasty is always a winner if we have time.   This place would be a better asset to the neighborhood if they could keep things open later, or at least make it all consistent. Frustrating to trek all the way over for dinner after work for half of the vendors to be shrugging their shoulders and washing up.","In Southern CA we have Grand Central Market in DTLA as the foodie Mecca. This is the Brooklyn version of Grand Central Market as it a big food hall with a unimaginable list of food  choices to choose from. You can get anything from Columbian Arepas to Vietnamese Banh Mi to unique dessert choices. To be sure, if you're not satisfied after grabbing food from any one of the vendors here, you can stop by Trader Joe's and grab groceries for dinner here as well. It's hot in there as it is underground, inundated with a mass amount of folks (who are emitting body heat) and the vendors have hot kitchens. The Women's restroom needed a little bit of work. There was toilet paper on the floor; some stalls lacked seat protectors; some soap dispensers lacked hand soap. If you're simply not sure what to eat in Brooklyn, check this place out, I promise you'll find something you'll like.",Dekalb Market Hall
112,"Went here for lunch with my family. We have wanted to try this place for a while and was finally in the neighborhood and found parking. I love that they serve breakfast all day. I had the 2x2x2 special which is two eggs, 2 pancakes, ​and bacon or sausage ( I got bacon because my son loves bacon). The service was good and the food was great but..... my issue was its cash only but the ATM doesn't​ work. I went to withdraw​ money the ATM spits out​ the receipt but no money​. I was told the money was going to be put back​ into my account about 2 hours later and no money and no one is answering when I call.","We got seated in a corner with the dirty dishes and shelves behind my seat, so the waiters were constantly reaching over me to get stuff for other tables. The strawberries in my meal were over ripe and not good. Overall a pricy restaurant and the food is not good.",This place is downright gross and i have no idea why it has 4 stars. Back the day it was good but it's disgusting.,A real old diner with just about anything you might wish to eat AND lime rickey!!!Open since 1938 & real friendly waiters. Decore is wonderfully strange & inviting.Try it.,"Came here to catch up with an old friend early on a Sunday morning. Toms pancakes were super duper fluffy and yummy. The line when we were leaving around (maybe 11a) was around the corner. I probably wouldn't come back and wait on a line for their food. I wasn't THAT impressed. But if I'm in the area and can be seated immediately, I would grab a bite. Service wasn't stellar either. ‍ -actually came back for my birthday with my grandma and boyfriend and one random time for breakfast during the week day.

113,"Hidden behind a market, the restaurant offers Italian inspired sandwiches and bites. The minute you walk in, you can smell the meats and baked Italian breads. We ordered the meat and cheese board ($25), porchetta broccoli rabe sandwich ($15), wagyu roast beef sandwich ($16), and the slab bacon salt baked potato. The porchetta sandwich was my favorite. It comes hot with fatty and crispy pieces of pork - dripping like a hot mess. The bitterness of the broccoli rabe offsets how heavy the sandwich really is. Did not love the cold wagyu sandwich as it was a bit dry. The meat and cheese board comes with fig jam, dried apricots, olives, almonds, and mustard seeds. While waiting for my food, I browsed the market and bought an olive tapenade spread - can't wait to try it.","I am a really big fan of Mekelburg's for both their amazing food and drink selections, as well as their no-BS vibe and service. Mekelburg's looks like and is an actual grocery store up until you hit the bar in the back. The rustic modern bar also features an amazing outdoor spot with picnic tables for drinking outdoors in the warmer months. The draft craft beer selection is always changing and awesome. There are many mouth watering dishes here including the baked potato, Porchetta, BBQ Shrimp Po Boy, and Chicken liver crostini. The cheese and meat plates also never fail to disappoint. The vibe here is chill but very on the hipster side. Cons: The Tuesday trivia night is pretty packed, so you probably can't get a seat unless you arrive very early. The night we went a bunch of frat boys were drunk and cheating on their cell phones so it totally ruined the night. We also had to wait 35 minutes and write on a wall before finding actual seats. Bloody Marys are far too clumpy: skip them.People tend to bring a ton of small kids here on weekends which is a huge turn off for anti kid people like me.","location is kind of hidden since it is in the lower level of a building. It is bigger in there than it looks but I did not have time to sit and eat.Seems like everyone in here is going half speed... I called 20 min ahead of time for the meatloaf sandwich and it still wasnt ready when I walked in. I read the reviews on the meatloaf so I was very excited to try it. Unfortunately the sandwich was underwhelming. First off, The bread to ratio is not good. The bread is quality but too much of it compared to the other ingredients.  The meatloaf lacked any sort of seasoning and tasted like mush. The tomato sauce was also bland and added no value to the sandwich. The picture looks good but it was extremely underwhelming.Hopefully I get the opportunity to try something else from this place but based off my first experience this place is VERY OVERRATED.","This is my new favorite place! Tucked behind a market is a bar that serves great food and has a vast selection of craft beer. They have a deal where any can plus a shot is $10. The oysters are delicious. Even though the order only comes with 4 they are huge! The friend that took us was also raving about the veggie sandwich, spicy chicken sandwich and the bone marrow. If we had not just had dinner I would have ordered it all. They also have a backyard you can sit in(closes at midnight) and at the bar there is a tv that you can request whatever channel you want. Great experience overall. Bring a group of friends here for a night of snacks, beer and games (they have board games too)!","This place is definitely in an ideal location, but the food was okay. The chocolate babka was really good, the chai latte was good, but the sandwich was below average, I thought. For what you get, I think this place is overpriced, but hey, the view is nice. We came here while on vacation. Probably wouldn't come back while visiting Brooklyn. If I lived in the neighborhood, I might swing by for chocolate babka if I had a craving for it.","Came here for lunch and a snack and had the BBQ Shrimp Po Boy with the Babka Bites. The po boy was pretty good; the baguette was really fresh and the sauce around the shrimp was pretty tasty. My gripe is that it shouldn't cost $16 for this item -- very pricy in my opinion given the size and complexity. It's smaller than a bahn mi at any given Vietnamese sandwich shop (usually around $6).  Same with the Babka Bites. I liked them; they were crunchy and served with icing. However, I wish they weren't so expensive. It's $8 just for 3, which are slightly bigger than Dunkin Donuts donut holes. Also, we waited about 45 minutes just for these two items when it wasn't even crowded. This place would have a somewhat higher rating, but it was dragged down by the price and wait times.Price: 1/5Quality: 4/5Quantity: 2/5Service: 2/5Atmosphere: 3/5",Mekelburg's
114,"As a Texan, now living in Brooklyn, you are always skeptical of any BBQ above the Red River.  My wife keeps strictly Kosher so we ventured in and were pleasantly surprised.  We got brisket, the giant beef dinosaur rib, and sides.  We ate for six.  This guy has trained with Aaron Franklin in Austin and is legit.  We'll return.","Went in yesterday with my mom for some BBQ. Got there around 1:30ish 2pm, walked to the counter, there a unenthusiastic counter attendant said ""What can I get you""... I asked for two Dino ribs... He quickly told us ""we're sold out, we won't have anymore until later, for tonight, but he had back ribs"" My question is, How do you offer Back Ribs, when someone asks for Dino bones? I was heartbroken. I then asked was that (pointing to a square piece of meat in the plexiglass case) the Brisket... He says ""That's the one I'm cutting from"" My mom says (out loud) ""That looks dry enough to write on"" Shocked that she said what was not only true but she said it out loud... I just asked for a Pulled Beef sandwich and a Sweet Potato...to go.I opened the sandwich in the car... There was more Purple Cabbage Slaw than meat. I picked what meat  I could out and it was OK... Nothing to write about. It did contain some ""heat"" which was nice. But I was still wanting BBQ. So to Hometown BBQ we drove. There we got succulent Brisket and three huge Dino Bones, NO PROBLEM. My desire for BBQ was sated for the day.I can't recommend going to IZZYS. It was a waste of time.",Overprice fake barbecue Service is horrible especially if you're black. I won't ever step foot in this place again.,"Very good Dino rib. Tons of seasoning and crispy outside, still juicy on inside. I split one w my friend and was still hungry, but we had already spent close to $60 on the one big rib. Next time I'll probably get the brisket sandwich which looks like a much better bang for your buck.","I didn't have high hopes when walking in- small, lack of decor, hot sun beaming through the windows, but the food was outstanding! Not cheap. But it was by far the best kosher bbq I've had.","As someone who occasionally goes to kosher restaurants to accommodate friends and family, but still eats treyf, I can generally tell you a kosher meat restaurant isn't as good as a non-kosher one. But, hearing the fascinating story of this place, I knew I had to try it.Can one study under the best pitmasters, never try their food, and recreate it well AND kosher? The answer is a resounding yes.We got some lean brisket and it was legit. This place is as good as Hometown BBQ in Red Hook.My BBQ loving fiance concurred.Will definitely be going back, with or without kosher keeping company.",Izzy's Brooklyn Smokehouse
115,"Never again! I ordered the tempura shrimp rolls and California rolls from Postmates. For some strange reason, they packaged the items together, although one should be served hot and the other cold. Furthermore, they gave only ONE packet of soy sauce for 12 sushi rolls, which wasn't enough. Lastly, I ordered the rose Thai booba tea and watermelon smoothie. The watermelon smoothie was okay, but booba tea came 1/4 empty and tapioca balls tasted hard and stale. Not to mention, a lot spilled in the bag over the other items because of the way it was poorly packaged. You can see evidence of the items in the pic when I first unpacked the items. I can't speak for dine-in, but overall, I had a 0/10 order out experience and WOULD NOT recommend.",Solid takeout. Chill vibes. Quick. Cute. Close. 12 dollar cc limit which is weirdly specific.,Food is good but they took a over a half hour to make a sushi roll and it wasn't even busy. Do not go here if you don't have tons of time to waste.,"Buntopia is an unique restaurant in the Bedford Stuyvesant area.The decor: Cute and Cozy.  We enjoyed our meal in the backyard area.  Great for a Spring day!  (There is also an option to dine indoor area as well.)The service: The staff was courteous and attentive.  They were great in answering questions and providing food recommendations.And last, but certainly, not least, the food:  For appetizer, I had The Shrimpatation.  It was a great combination of crunchy from the tempera shrimp and spicy mayo flavor.  For the entree, I had The Mango Tango.  If you like mango (like me!), this is the roll for you.  It had the sweetness of mango subdued by the tasty greens.  The drink was my favorite!  I had the Rosy Kiss.  The strawberry and coconut water combination was sooooo refreshing.","Was looking for a quick bite for lunch and saw that this place had a great rating. However, I left somewhat disappointed. The place is clean and bright, but the sushi I ordered did not live up to expectations. I ordered the Jade Dragon roll, basically a spruced up eel and avocado roll, and a pina colada smoothie.  I don't think my sushi was made fresh, I saw them pull out a sushi package like what you get at a grocery store from the fridge. I think it then sat while they made my smoothie, then they took it out of the package, put it on a mini cheese board and drizzled some sauce on it to make it look nice. The sushi was so uniform in shape that it seemed like it had been sitting that way for a while in the fridge. It didn't taste great either. My eel roll had trace amounts of eel in it, I mostly tasted avocado and rice. There wasn't much flavor, I had to get sriracha just to try and add some depth to it. A disappointing sushi order. Perhaps I ordered the wrong item. The smoothie, at least, wasn't bad.","My boyfriend loves this damn place. He literally sneaks off to get ramen at least once a week. The sushi is good too. I always get the vegan green something roll and the shrimp tempura. I don't eat sushi often and I'm a very picky eater, but it is always solid here. I would suggest to pickup food. Delivery isn't as good.",Buntopia
116,"2.5. Underwhelming menu, warm beer, mediocre food, shoddy service. We arrived here around 3:30 on Sunday. We saw that it was bustling and had plenty of good reviews on Yelp so we figured this would be a great spot for a quick bite. Well, this is one of those times where Yelp let me down.The menu consisted of half brunch items, sandwiches, and salads. Not too much to choose from, and nothing really sounded amazing. I had no idea what to order. Not because there were so many enticing options, (which is usually my dilemma) but because nothing sounded appealing to me.We ordered the benedict and the croque madame. The benedict was awful. Not much flavor at all. The temperatures were off. The croque madame was a little better. Ham, fried egg, bread and sauce. Not worth the price at all. The sauce had some rich flavor, but other than that it was a very boring dish.I wasn't impressed by anything here. Maybe my expectations were too high. But everything from service to food was poor to mediocre.","Good food, but will not be back. Could not enjoy my meal because of the following:Serves room temperature water with no ice. - 1 starNO AIR during a heat wave. - 2 stars","This place has done it, made a very non confrontational person actually complain about a meal. I arrived here at 9am on a Sunday, being the third people in the restaurant. I ordered the eggs Florentine and my partner got the French toast, after waiting after seeing all the tables around us fill up, eat their food and pay their bills. We informed the waitress of this and she went into the kitchen, then informed us our food would be coming out shortly. We waited another 20 minutes, hoping that at least the food would be good and worth the wait. When my eggs Florentine finally arrived I ate some potatoes, and a few bites of salad that were average. With the eggs Florentine, I noticed the eggs had been cut in the middle, showing that the kitchen had checked the eggs and thought this was alright. The eggs were clearly hard boiled instead of poached. I informed the waitress, and sent my food back. She asked if I wanted to order something else to which I said no, she didn't even offer to comp the meal after seeing it? Weird. To be fair, the waitress didn't make the food so that isn't her fault, however she could have atleast offered to take it off the bill. I was offered nothing as a comp, paid for the meal (minus the eggs Florentine as I sent it back) and left. At least I now i can say I've had the worst brunch experience!","Their BLT is hands down my favorite sandwich in all of NYC. Maybe all of the country. Heck, why stop there? Maybe all of the world.

I'd give this dish a 4.5/5Lox Eggs Benedict - eggs were well cooked, the salmon was tasty. If you fancy an eggs benny's you can't go wrong with this one. I'd give this a 4/5Lamb burger - the patty wasn't as tender and flavorful although the herbes feta that came with it was so good. Overall 3/5",Rabbithole Restaurant
117,"We came here because it was featured in Eater, yet I am quite surprised that their ramen didn't wow us. The portion is adequate in their smaller-than-normal bowl, however we both thought our noodles were just normal. Admittedly, the salmon bowl is different from all the usual pork slices you get in many ramen shops, so that's a plus; personally, I think it tastes better than the yaoyao. Their special of the day is cheese and ramps quiche, so we gave that a shot. Not bad, but not great. Also, we order the spam musubi since Suzume is supposed to be a Hawaiian-esque joint (or maybe full-on Hawaiian?). It was good, but not worth the price tag.","I stopped eating pork and the salmon ramen is just as delicious. Yum, Missing this spot from LA.","Who's idea was it to change the entire menu ...?!?? Like you had an established menu who a lot of costumers liked and decided to change it for what ?! I dined today and heard THREEE OTHER TABLES COMPLAIN ABOUT THE SAME DAMN THING ?! Also who the hell changed the sushi roll into HAND ROLL the most annoying thing to eat !! This was my favorite place, but they should have just stuck with a specials menu ... I'm sad someone in this business had such a shitty idea this place is going to suffer it's loyal costumers ...","The interior of the restaurant makes you feel very warm. We went around early evening and it was perfect because there was no wait and we were seated immediately. As we looked at the menu, we agreed on ordering just the snacks.We ordered:-Syd's Peashoot & Bok Choy SaladThe Syd's Peashoot & Bok Choy Salad was very tasty. I am not sure what the crunchy brown stuff was on top of the salad but it was great. - Fish TacosThe fish tacos were very tasty. Not only was the fish fried perfectly but also the taco shell was soft as well. I was expecting a soft or hard shell;however, it was a soft crispy shell.- Blistered Shishito PeppersI love shishito peppers and these were very good. I just wished that the seasoning was a bit lighter. After eating a few, the seasoning got to much for me.- Spam MusubiThe Spam Musubi was tasty. If you love spam then you should order this. It is snack size so you may want to order other things as well if you are a hungry guy like me.- Lumpia Spring RollsThese were awesome. It came out very hot so take caution when you take the first bite. It was very crispy and the meat inside was delicious as well.- Scallop Hand RollsOverall I would say it was a great experience and I would come back to try the noodles and rice bowls.",I love love loved it. Reading the reviews people rated it lower from their sushi experience.  We didn't eat their sushi but we did order their yaoyao ramen bowl and their fried chicken bowl. The appetizer of ribs were finger licking good and really filling for two! Its $10 and I totally recommend it 100%! Vibe was good except they're really laid back and u have to wait for them to come over or really work hard to be seated and flag ppl down for some service (I knocked a star off for their inattentive service tho that might just be their style...?) It's small so I recommend go in smaller groups. Itll be hard to seat a big group in. IG eatsumbap,"The food here is phenomenal. I've tried many places that are known for their fried chicken and ramen -- but this place exceeds in flavor among all of them. We had: - Buttery chicken wings: smaller than usual wings but worth it- Yayao ramen: my friend thought it was the ""best ramen"" she's ever had- Fried chicken rice bowl: THE BEST fried chicken I've ever had. It was a burst of spicy goodness, moist, and tender. I would come back and just order this on the side. Spicy ribs: some of the most juiciest ribs I've ever had - the scallion, lemon, and teriyaki flavors were a perfect combination for a marinades- Veggie ginger scallion noodle bowl: noodles were buttery and flavorful- Veggie and scallop rolls (sushi pieces): good but not memorable",Suzume
118,"Distracted!!! This sums up the type of service you'll receive here.A random night of the week my Queen and I were out around happy hour time and wanted dinner. Having walked past this place a couple times prior we opted to give it a shot... bad idea. Upon walking in we realized that we officially took the patron count to THREE and in my mind that meant the food would come out quickly and drinks would be plentiful... false!We sat at the bar in an attempt to reinforce my hypothesis and immediately we noticed that bartender took her time taking our order. Ignoring that we ordered drinks and entrees as we were almost famished. Our drinks also took their time arriving due to her attention being fixated on what appeared to be a crush. Hey, we all try to lock down something for later but usually not while working. From the HH menu, we ordered the ""I'm Shook"" which didn't taste much like anything other than a bad mixture and the ""Fall Daquir"" which wasn't bad but also wasn't good.... I closed with the ""Dark and Stormy"" which was the only good drink on this menu.For food I went with the Mushroom Flatbread (without dairy) and my Queen had the Sunshine Burger medium. The food was okay at best... honestly you'd think it wouldn't taste rushed with there only being THREE customers in the entire place. Oh yea, did I forget to mention that the bartender completely left the establishment for a good 15mins while no body decided to check on us for more water/drinks/etc? Or the fact that at multiple times during our visit the entire staff (minus the kitchen staff) huddled at the opposite end of the bar with their noses pointed at the phones....yea I took pics.This was NOT a sunshine experience, if anything is was more a waste of time and money... wait, the food was okay and we were no longer hungry so I guess their ""did their job"". Service: 1/5 (we were served so 1 is fair)Drinks: 1/5 (just order the Dark and Stormy if you want a HH drink)Food: 2/5Staff: distracted I won't be back.",Today was m first time there and I will definitely goes back. I ordered grits  with shrimp ass on poach egg and it was delicious.. I wasn't full cuz the portion was small. But  service was on point food tasty definitely going back,"Here's the thing. When it's 6 pm on a Tuesday, and you are one of only two tables, and the person who seats you is clearly the owner or manager, and the service is beyond bad and inexcusable, despite that both he, and I assume a waitress, literally stood three feet away from you the entire time, it doesn't matter if the food is good or not. That's enough alone to ruin a meal, and a dinner out. How, with only two tables, and you standing feet away, so you not ask, even once, if everything's okay, or if we'd like something else to drink, or dessert? And, frankly, while it's cute and the food is decent, it ain't all that, which you can try for that arrogant, we're better than attitude. Because you're not. So, Jayson had a pasta. I had the burger. They were okay. But certainly nothing special or worthy of such rude, dismissive and inexcusable lack of service in a restaurant with two tables seated. It might not have been so annoyingly bad had the owner/host/quasi server not stood behind us the entire time, yammering on, but unable to ask how our meal is, or see if we want anything else. Honestly, the annoyance that after a beautiful date day at the botanical gardens, we decide to try Sunshine for date night dinner and end up having to wave down the owner and waitress, three feet away, as they also ignore the only other table in the place, is why there's so much restaurant turnover. Can not imagine going back.",Came in for brunch  The food menu is a bit on the shorter side. A lot of egg choices. Which is not a bad thing. Got a BLT with sunny side egg. Very flavorful. Bacon was very crispy and I'm not a regular mayo lover however the garlic mayo was actually better than expected. Would come back for dinner.,"The food is fine (nothing too special). I had the Brussel Sprout Hash (not bad), and my dining companion had the Veggie Burger (disappointing). The latter was a bit mushy; it completely fell apart upon first bite. Food aside, this restaurant has some real issues it needs to figure out: lack of air conditioning (during summer) and terrible acoustics. I've been twice, and both times (during the summer) the A/C has either not worked or is simply too weak for a commercial space. When I asked the waitress about the A/C during my most recent visit, she kind of shrugged and gave a non-answer (""I think it's on, but I'll check...). Mind you, I looked around, and all the other diners were similarly pouring sweat. The other issue is the acoustics. For a non-scene establishment (aka a place that is a casual neighborhood spot), it's inconceivably loud. It sounds like people are shouting their conversations in your ear. And while Sunshine plays their music far too loud (again, it's just a neighborhood spot...not some awful Meat Packing scene), it's the bad acoustics that enhance the volume to an intolerable decibel.Even if Sunshine's food was magnificent (it's not), the aforementioned issues would still sully the experience.","My friend and I came to Sunshine around noon on a Sunday.  We were lucky enough to only have to wait a few minutes for seats at the bar.  When we left around 1:30pm, there were several tables open.  The restaurant has an upscale diner vibe to it and the menu is typical of a bougie brunch scene.My friend ordered the Sunshine veggie burger ($13) and I ordered the brussel sprout hash ($13).  My friend enjoyed the veggie burger and it's sizeable and comes with fries, so it was a pretty good deal.  The brussel sprout hash was also good, but a bit heavy on the brussel sprouts.  I like brussel sprouts, but the ratio of brussel sprouts to other stuff was uneven, and even when I eat normal hash, I don't want it to be super heavy on the meat side.  I also felt that the paprika was a little too much to the point of drying out the dish.  The bartender was kind and friendly and provided great service throughout the meal.  Overall, the presentation of the dishes were decent and the food was good.  I also thought the value was not bad for bougie brunch.  However, nothing really stood out to me about Sunshine that would keep me coming back for more.",Sunshine
119,The food is good but it's hard to give this place more than one star because the service is chronically abysmal. I've eaten here many times at all different times of the day and days of the week and service is lacking. - everything from being ignored to food taking a very long time to extremely uncomfortable furniture.It doesn't even occur to the servers  (or they are not empowered) to offer some kind of compensation like a drink or dessert for the awful service. This place gets away with it because there aren't a lot of options in the neighborhood. Maybe they're just taking advantage of people,I went there for brunch today and the food was good but the issue was that there were flies in the joint and the excuse was that it was caused by the humidity and the fact that they kept opening the door because of the garden. I was surprised that people were gleefully sitting in the restaurant with the flies with no concern in the world. I wanted to leave... but we waited for 40 minutes for the seat,"Try to get the waiter's attention- ok, done but that took a while.Order something simple from the menu, scrambled egg and avocado: out of avocado.My wife tried a combo from the menu, eggs, salmon and toast.Ok I end up with one dry, crumbled egg on s plate, and a latte served in a tumbler - really poor.  It's how the chef works apparently as my wife's eggs were similarly unappetizing.Why did we give this place another chance? When will we learn?","Another awesome Brooklyn place, I was told after visiting I would have to travel to Brooklyn each time I wanted it, and it's true.We put our names in, and hung out in the bar for awhile which was completely fine, we got to catch up and hang for a bit with some delicious Italian margaritas, you don't typically think Italian and margaritas but these drinks are amazing. Rosemary infused tequila is my new favorite tequila, it's amazing, botanical but not overpoweringly earthy. We got brought to the back through what seemed like a secret pantry into a back room in the corner booth, we ordered another round of margaritas and started with the octopus, this was actually ordered by mistake, I blame my little bros use of the word octopus but it was completely fine because our starter was amazing. Wild Octopus, Taggiasca Olives, Red Onion, Cherry Tomatoes, Gigante Beans, Celery, Chili & Lemon this salad was fresh, light and packed with the perfect flavor combinations.Decided to go with 2 pizzas our first was the MARGHERITA  San Marzano Tomatoes,House-made Mozzarella & Basil loved this one, being cooked in a wood fired pizza just gives a special flavor to pizza that is the best. The second pizza we had was SALSICCIA  San Marzano Tomatoes, House-made Mozzarella, Heritage Pork Sausage, Kalamata Olives & Basil my word this was also delicious, the flaky thin crust is now my favorite style of pizza.Visit this place if you have the chance, it's amazing!","The Menu is pretty straightforward in terms of selections. There are various Pies based on your preference ranging from Mushroom, Margarita, seafood or sausages. The ambiance plays a major role in the experience. As soon as you walk in, you're drawn to the delicious smelling coffee from 'La Colombe'. The prices are decent enough to split within a group should you decide on a variety of pies. The area is fairly easy to get to as it's a few blocks off of the A train and accessible by several bus lines. Great for groups and special events.","I went to Saraghina a few days ago and had a good dining experience.The ambiance is nice, especially outside in the patio. The servers were nice and attentive, although no one came to asked how our food was or if we needed anything else.The waiting time was decent, we didn't have to wait at all to be seated, and did not wait too long for our food. (Although, when we left the entire restaurant was full and there were people waiting by the bar for a table).The food: the pasta had really good taste, although it was a bit too greasy and that can put off people who don't usually go for too much oil. My husband said his Margherita pizza was good; nothing out of this world, but it was good.I felt the menu was lacking a bit in variety, but we may probably come back again to try something else.",Saraghina
120,"This place would've been the best thing to happen to me since I moved to Bushwick, had it not been for perfectly avoidable things that just make it kind of suck a little bit.First and foremost, the food here is delicious. If you can stand literally everything else about this place, then you'll probably love it. I'd come here every weekend for the food. I'd come here more if the people over the counter were nice (or at least moderately pleasant), if the food wasn't so insanely expensive (see photo below. $20 for a burger, an additional $2 for cheese on the burger....insane), and if the food came out a little faster. It's also very loud and very cramped during weekends but I'm sure it's fine during the week.Service here can be confusing if you're not familiar with NYC cafes; this is a sit-down spot, but no, they do not necessarily wait on tables. So your order will be ready at the bar and they will call you over, but sometimes plates will be brought over to you. Which is completely fine and normal. So disregard those reviews complaining solely about that.Again, food is great! I'd be a regular here. I really wanted to be. But the unfriendly staff and the overpriced menu items really just sort of ruins it.","Coming to this spot is like Martin Luther King days, FIGHTING RACISM ALL OVER AGAIN ! The employees in this place have really nasty looks and attitudes. When you come into the neighborhood of Bushwick, respect the Natives of Bushwick.",Cute spot! I'll go here for breakfast on the weekends and it never disappoints. The service is a little on the slower side at times but the atmosphere makes up for the speed of service. The lamb breakfast sandwich is a must!,"Really cute brunch spot in Bushwick. Relaxed place offering many drinks & brunch options. There's not much in this area so this place is a gem. Service was a little slow but its a tiny kitchen so to be expected. Staff was friendly & attentive. The coffee drinks were very good, one of the better chai lattes I've had in a while. My only complaint was that my dish (beef hash) was very over salted which if that happened in Manhattan I probably wouldn't have been as forgiving. They still get 4 stars for being a super cute place with great coffee & probably the better brunches in the immediate area.",Came here for a cup of coffee and lunch. Place was cute. Service fast. I ordered their burger medium. It was delicious and juicy. Made perfect. The cold brew was on point as well. Will Def be back when I'm in the neighborhood.,"Pretty solid coffee shop near my boyfriend's apartment. I've been here probably a dozen times now, both for coffee and food and to work, and it's been consistent each time.Good egg sandwich, great chia pudding and pancakes, great dirty chai, mediocre chilaquiles.It gets pretty busy during the day with people camped out on their laptops, so get there a little earlier if you need to work and want a spot. Internet is good enough for most work, but I wasn't able to have a voice/video call.",Sunrise/Sunset
121,The food here is consistently good. The service is ok.  Wish they would pick up the phone. Came in for an order. It was wrong. Had to go back as no one picks up the phone.,"I ordered for delivery, and I wish I had read the reviews first.  I will say the food was tasty and the order arrived fast, my hot food was in a plastic salad-sized container, which I definitely would not expect for a $21 meal.  You would think they'd have made changes after the first twenty complaints about the portion size.Can't say I'll order from there again, or even visit the restaurant, because this is shameful.",This review is about the service I didn't even get the chance to try their food which is very unfortunate. I made a 9pm reservation for my bf and I. We got there at 845pm and was told that we won't be seated until our reservation time. Which is fine but my bf and I was standing there waiting to be seated for 20 mins and they had tables opened. They had 3 tables opened that were not occupied at all. Another couple was also waiting to be seated. I came to this place after working a strenuous shift and all I wanted to do was to be seated and feast on their food. The host told us that they're waiting on the people who are at our table to pay and it did not seem that they were leaving any time soon which got me and my bf very upset. So my bf goes to the manager and tells her what's the point of a reservation if it's not being honored? And he pointed out to the open tables and the manager said those tables are for a larger party  The open tables was a 4 seat table. And I was thinking to myself then why don't u put me and my bf at that table and the couple who was waiting too at the same table?! The manager absolutely does not have any customer service experience. She did not even apologize for having us to wait for a table that we made a reservation for. She was not accommodating at all. So we just left. And the weird thing was no one was eating when we came into the restaurant. I don't know if it's because the kitchen is really slow? Or it just so happens that no one was eating and was only talking and drinking. There was not enough staff either. I only saw 1 waitress taking orders from table to table. This place is disorganized and I will not step foot into this place again.Please save yourself from wasting your time coming to this restaurant. I rather go to jersey and have some real AUTHENTIC CUBAN FOOD.,"Quiet simple place here, very open so good for music to played. Customer service is good but some extra personality that's nice but a bit weird too. Our waiter said things like ""My Friend"" when referring to us and that's a little bit too much in my opinion.Love the hot sauce here, I will buy a bottle from them the next time I'm there. It's a great sauce because they use habaneros which means you won't miss the heat and there's a ton of garlic in it. Very powerful stuff that reminds me of seafood boils and cajun places that use flavorful sauces like this!As for the food, they make some great chicken, soup, and plaintains! The soup had a good hearty flavor and the plaintains are caramelized really well. The chicken comes with a green sauce that is very acidic with lime but adds a nice creaminess. There's another sauce much more savory and something you'd think was cooked with the chicken for enhanced flavor rather than a dipping sauce or sauce to pour over. We also got some food to go and it was well wrapped for transport but they did forget to add the plantains for one of them.I'll be back again, good place for lunch or dinner!","This is a lovely restaurant. Great food, great atmosphere and good service ONCE you are seated. My experience has been that the hostesses get a little overwhelmed when the place is too crowded? The food is worth the wait, but maybe make a reservation if you can? Maybe plan ahead and show up half an hour before you want to eat? Also, come here with a hungry stomach, because you'll want to eat everything on the menu. :)","Came here for brunch on a Saturday and was pleasantly surprised by all the vegetarian substitutions available to accommodate us!   I started out with the limeade, which was refreshing but not as balanced as I would have liked as it was more bland than tart or sweet.  For breakfast I had the tostones benedict which was so good!  For this dish they subbed the chorizo for cheese and beans.  I usually steer clear from tostones because they tend to make meals heavy but these were perfectly portioned.  The flavors of the dish were great, the beans were very nicely seasoned and well complemented by the sauces.  Service was great and they have cute outdoor seating for enjoying the sun and people watching.  They also have a bakery next door with coffee and treats but I believe you can order them from the dessert menu without having to go relocate.",Pilar Cuban Eatery
122,The patties melt in your mouth like butter! Came here for some chicken soup. You can smell the aroma from outside.,Every few weeks i take my boyfriend here for a treat (amazing and so legit and affordable!) Pocket of perfection~,"The food is phenomenal, the decor is stellar but I must say that I have been let down by your delivery provider. I recently had surgery and wanted your soup but could not get to you so I used Seamless and they are so unprofessional. Please look into other providers like Uber Eats because Seamless(Grubhub) made it seem as though the untimely delivery(waited an hour and a half and had to cancel) was your fault. Just a suggestion. Other than that, you guys are perfect!","I love Kafe Louverture.The salmon quiche is out of this world.  The patties are pretty nice too, but if it's your first time ordering and you like salmon, you'll love the quiche.  My boo thinks their breakfast sandwiches are pretty good, and I believe him.I'm happy to support a black-owned business in the neighborhood.  :)","Went here today. Loved it! The owner even greeted us, which is rare at most nyc establishments. I recommend the beef and chicken patties. I also really enjoyed the cold ginger lemonade, it was really refreshing on a summer day. Definitely will be back!SIDENOTE - the lamb patties must be amazing cause my friend (who comes here regularly) and another customer inside both were raving about the lamb patties. They only had a couple left so we let the other customers grab them since they were there first, but I will be back for lamb patties! And more ginger lemonade!","Absolutely one of my favorite places in Brooklyn. Everyone in this coffee shop is always friendly and the food is always fresh! The couple who owns the place are always in there and make sure their customers are taken care of! I'm not Haitian or West Indian but I've been told they are the best patties in Brooklyn! Whenever I'm sick I get ginger/lemon tea and the chicken bullion soup (which always sells out) and it's so soothing! Go coffee they have several non dairy options (almond, oat and macadamia nut milk) which I love! Everything is amazing...but come early because they always sell out of patties and soup! If I ever moved from Bed Stuy this would be the place I miss the most.",Kafe Louverture
123,It's ok. The food is delicious and authentic but over priced. The service is subpar plus the drinks are boring.,"Dinner review:Truthfully the staff is great so's the food, the downside is the price. $20 for literally a cup of stew and a plate of rice was disappointing. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.",Not worth it. $24 feijoada is tiny and the brigadeiro tastes stale. No seasoning just plain all around. Had such high hopes. Only giving it two stars because the delivery was fast.,"Just. Wow. One of the most genuinely memorable experiences I've had. The second I walked in, Mari was so attentive and welcoming that time flew quickly. After looking at the menu, I settled on the Açaí bowl and the Feijoada.First, the Açaí bowl... a hearty serving with a variety of fruit. Then, the feijoada. Nice balance of salt and texture, and the farofa was on point. And to top it all off, I had cashew fruit juice - muito obrigado, Mari. I'm really looking forward to going back and exploring the menu in-depth. In the meantime, I'm gonna have a difficult time keeping my mind off the food.","Was really excited to come here! Always smells amazing and looks so cute. We went on a Friday at 7pm and got seated outside right away. First off, it took at least 5 minutes for someone to come over with menus when I had made eye contact with the waitress several times.  Didn't matter to us much.  I noticed she was the only one working at 7pm on a Friday.  Poor girl was running around, good thing it was a small place.  Our appetizer came before our drinks.  The drinks had never came and my fiance went up to the bar and asked about them and the waitress said she will check with the bartender.  Clearly they were forgotten.  We got our dinner a couple minutes after finally getting our drinks and we both REALLY enjoyed the food. Maybe they were short staffed that night but the service made for a below average first experience.  Food made up for it though!","If your looking for a staple restaurant in your roster, look no further. This is the perfect place for long or short meals, drinks, great in the summer to feel the breeze, great in the winter to get cozy... the staff are the best, the food is authentic and wonderful. No complaints! Try it!",Beco
124,Unfortunately not even nearly the same quality compared to the the best of its days. Unfortunate.,Came back for another go of this iconic pizzeria. It was a lengthy wait for another disappointing slices. Both slices were nothing special and overly greasy and heavy. The staff however are amazing and kind. It's good pizza but not worth waiting 1.5hr for 2 slices,"Do you like BURNT crust pizza? Well this is the place for you. You pay five dollars for a burnt pizza. I ordered 2 slices and it was a total of 15 dollars, are you kidding me? I asked the guy why it was so expensive for just two slices and all he did was shrug his shoulders and say I dont know. There were rats crawling around the place (thats disgusting). The tables and floors were filthy like it was never cleaned for months. The food was way below standards, there was no quailty to the food. All i could taste was burnt bits. Everything was burnt to ash.The staff has no respect for their customers, and treats them like garbage. I love eating pizza but this place is THE worst place to eat at.","Many have trekked to Midwood, Brooklyn for this pizza, and much has been said about this pizza. I had it for the first time tonight and boy, is it perfect. It's light, crunchy, and thick enough, all at the same time. The crust is reminiscent of a cracker, but also crunchy fried bread that feels as if this is the standard by which all pizza should follow.Once you've got the crust down, the other ingredients, the cheese, the sauce and basil, are all perfect. It's $5 a slice, and worth it. Place has been around forever, and it's worth trying.","Di Fara is well known for its slices and line. Its the most well known written and spoken about pizza in Brooklyn. The pizza artist is an older gentleman by the name of Dom but when I found my way it seemed the younger generation has taken over. I had two very expensive slices of pie.One topped with cheese and the other with dried cherry tomatoes.  The cheese slice is the "" New York"" style hand tossed bendy slice,crispy crust. Very travel friendly. The square slice was deep dish the thick crusty,zesty sauce and cherry tomatoes and not so travel friendly. Two slices cost me $12.  And let the beautiful letdown began....Was it the best slice ever? No. Have I had better locally? Yes. The slices were just ok. I'm glad I made the trip and  had a enjoyable walk. I would have never made to the neighborhood if it wasn't for the pizza. Thankfully it was a rainy day in Brooklyn and I didn't deal with a line. 10 minute wait at the most. Go to DiFara for the experience, the journey and walk or drive in Brooklyn. Please don't go hangry because you may have a wait.","Came here after a trip to Coney Island. Got here around 4:30pm and thought the wait time wasn't going to that bad. Boy was I wrong!The restaurant bit was closed for a private event so we ordered through the little window in the corner. The process was straightforward until they told us it was going to be a 40 minutes wait. We decided to go ahead and wait anyway. They took down our name and order. No payment required at this time. We were told to come back within 40 mins.We came back at 40 mins wait and was told it was almost ready. 15 minutes later we were still waiting. We eventually got our pipping hot pie after 1 hour and 15 minutes of waiting. Luckily there are three seats right at front which I sat on and waited and waited.  Excitedly we picked up the pizza and was told there was a cafe two doors down where we could eat the pizza which was pretty convenient. The pizza was definitely fresh and delicious. It does taste different to all other pizzas I have tasted. The base seems crunchier and the actual pizza itself seems saucier - in a good way. I definitely enjoyed the pizza and devoured every single bite.Bottom line is:Would I have it again? Absolutely YESWould I make a special trip out to buy it? No, not unless I am in the area Would I wait over 1 hour for it? Absolutely NOTHalf and half pizza was $34. Individual slices start at $5. The restaurant is cash only.",Di Fara Pizza
125,Not good.  Tasteless.  This food cannot be authentic.  Griot was hard and tasteless.  Too expensive and not worth it.  The bread pudding was a disappointment as well.  Thought of using them for my friends house warming ... negative.  Wish I could give no stars,I went last Tuesday and expoected a smaller restaurant style eatery but instead it is pretty large with an open kitchen.  It reminds me of a coffee shop because of its laid back feel.  I had the fried chicken with rice and plantain. There was this weird discrepancy about the Haitian hot chocolate.  My lunch mate is Haitian and she suggested.  The server made it seem as though the cook had to make it. Nope upon talking to the cook the server makes it at the barista.  Ok....Needless to say the food was delicious..I am not sure when I will be back though,"Honestly I've gone to the restaurant twice and ordered delivery twice but this last time really turned me off. I ordered the fish with sauce and when it arrived the sauce was all over the bag because it was sent in a paper container. That didn't make any sense atall. Additionally we ordered a side of sweet plantains for $5.50 and it came with 6 extremely tiny pieces (equivalent to the size of two averaged sized tostones). I tried to avoid writing a poor review by calling to see if they would do anything to rectify the situation but I was met with a ""I'm sorry I'll talk to the kitchen and the next time you order i can give you a free soda"".","Excellent food! The banane is fried to perfection. The salad is real salad, not the usually iceberg with a third of the tomato plopped on top. A fabulous spring mix with romaine, radicchio and a fine vinaigrette. I mostly order black rice or di-riz kolé with griot. They also carry cola-lakaye or Couronne (can't remember which) if your looking for authentic soda from Haiti. The dining area is casual and roomy. Plenty of seating. I always call ahead and place my order and for the most part it's ready in roughly 15 minutes. 6/30/19Update: I finally was able to bring my mom and aunt here! I've brought my mom food but we never stayed to eat. They were so impressed. The food was great as usual, and the service was incredible. The atmosphere was so chill. We had a tassot kabrit platter (with black rice), and two griot platters (one with rice and one without). I am so proud of these young Haitians that run this establishment and I will continue to be a patron.","Excellent food! The banane is fried to perfection. The salad is real salad, not the usually iceberg with a third of the tomato plopped on top. A fabulous spring mix with romaine, radicchio and a fine vinaigrette. I mostly order black rice or di-riz kolé with griot. They also carry Cola-Lakaye or Couronne (can't remember which) if your looking for authentic soda from Haiti. The dining area is casual and roomy. Plenty of seating. I always call ahead and place my order and for the most part it's ready in roughly 15 minutes.",If you love Haitian food dont eat here! The food I had was tasteless! Me and girl ordered the Griot and peas and rice. It was the wrost haitian food I ever tasted. Haitian food is known for its really good flavor and season this food did not have a drop of flavor its no way a haitian person could own this restaurant. If you want good haitian food this is not the place to go. Even the bread pudding was tasteless.Im African American and I cook better haitianThen this save your mobwy and time !,Grandchamps Kitchen & Market
126,Decent but not great. Mashed potatoes were good. Mac and cheese wasn't my favorite. Ribs were disappointing. Not enough meat and overdone. My little boy likes his chicken fingers. My wife got the pork sandwich and was not impressed with it.Lots of space those and good air conditioner.,"Got take out from this place for the first time, got the sampler app and a bbq sandwich. See the attached picture to see what it looked like when i took it out. First of all why would u put the hard boiled eggs with the shrimp and throw it in so carelessly. Eggs and shrimp DONT GO, Trust me I've tried it.... and the shrimp still had the shell on so i had to peel the eggy ass shell off and then bite into a flavorless shrimp because all the seasoning was on the shell which i peeled off? Makes no sense. I would have brought my whole order back if i wasn't so STARVING. Sandwich was good tho.","First impression: can I sit in the booth? NoSubsequently seated at a table that held more guests... hostess was a pale dark haired girl with a bad attitude.Food was drier than your grandma and the cornbread should require a license, as it could've choked someone.PASS ON THIS PLACE!","Was happy to finally try this place out.Very extensive menu and combo options. We got the Sweetheart for 2 with a rack of ribs and 4 sides. Ribs were very tender, minus the charred ends. Fried rice was surprisingly good, as was the salad. Beans and potato salad were tasty-- personally would not recommend the mac & cheese which was a bit disappointing.Service was polite, restaurant is large and spacious. Wouldn't mind checking out again sometime.","My boyfriend and I ordered the Sweetheart Meal for 2 and it was just the right amount of food for two people. We came hungry and left stuffed.The meal comes with ribs and 4 sides. We chose the mashed potato, fried rice, corn and Mac & cheese.  The mashed potato was creamy and not too salty, fried rice was good and flavorful and the corn had the right amount of spice and wasn't too dry. The Mac and cheese was kind of odd though- it had a gooey texture and wasn't that cheesy. Wish we ordered a different side. The corn bread that came with the meal was alright, I've had better! It didn't really taste like anything.The star of the meal ...the ribs were.... AMAZING. So tender and flavorful - the meat came clean off the bones. The rub/sauce on the ribs was sweet and savory. I haven't had ribs that good in a long time! I highly recommend the ribs!!","I heard about Dinosaur BBQ from a friend and when I realized it was a few blocks from our hotel I had to check it out. The pictures online were mouthwatering.I had the 3 Combo 1/4 White Meat Chicken was flavorful but dry, 1/4 Rack of Ribs tender and was good with dry rub, Brisket good with original bbq sauce I prefer moist, but still good, Potato Salad was close to home, but was diced finely and heavy on pepper, wouldn't be so bad but also it had onion and they finished it with cajun seasoning as well so it packed a punch. It was good, just ask for no cajun seasoning  and add salt. The Mac and Cheese was creamy, noodles aldente and had a little kick to it as well. The corn bread was hard and dry, not worth the carbs.Honey had The Ribs, bbq wings, Collard Greens and Mac and Cheese. The greens were good, heavy on vinegar they have chopped carrots in them as well. Overall nice environment. Spacious, has a private room and outside seating. It's pricey, but the portions are good. Spent $42 on 2 meals.",Dinosaur Bar-B-Que
127,Food was ok and service not so good. Considering the price I was expecting something better.,"This place is really disappointing. The ""crispy Brussels sprouts"" are far from crispy. We also had the potatoes, shrimp, and tuna carpaccio and all were disappointing. Our waiter was also disorganized and neglectful. I can't see a reason to go back.","I have come for dinner, and it was lovely - so I picked Tambour to bring my mom for Mother's Day Brunch - boy was that a mistake. It not only roll 45 minutes to get an egg and cheese sandwich, an omelette, and eggs benedict - but the eggs benedict had no hollandaise! Just two poached eggs on toast flanked by about 8 strips of bacon. It was bizarre. Portions were small and so, so unbelievably underwhelming. My omelette was greasy, nothing had any herb garnish or nice touches. It was really just so disappointing. Server was friendly but slow. Now, had I come here on a day other than Mother's Day, I would have not written a review and just not come back. But on a day known for brunch, and one where we celebrate moms, I was so surprised at how lousy this was.","Are you kidding me? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Seriously; why are you not here? Have you heard the love music? Did you know the owners have the most adorable dog EVER? Ask to see a photo of Theo (OSHA - he can't actually be here if you expect food). Wine - quality over quantity - and they know what they're talking about. Yes - it's on a dark corner in South Slope. Hello Park Slope - c'mon over to the Dark Side! The Dry Aged Ribeye was OUT OF THIS WORLD. My wife orders the Roasted Mushroom Sunflower Seed Risotto - a giant bucket of awesome. I actually snuck some of the white truffle oil salt from her dish and placed it on my ribeye because I have a white truffle oil salt problem. She wasn't looking. Ok, I'll say it again, Park Slope and y'all hanging out at Industry City - why are you not here?I'm updating this 5 minutes later...I just used the loo. Ok - while the wine is well worth visiting for AND the food is well worth visiting for, the faucet in the loo is EPIC. I want one in my home. Now.","I went to brunch here on a Sunday. It's a nice place to go when you do not want to deal with how loud a brunch hour can potentially be. I went with a friend and we were one of the very few patrons there until other people came. It was very peaceful. I love the look of the place and i can't wait to come at night to see what it looks like. It's a wine bar too so that's all i care about haha. The food service was quick but i wasn't worried about service time because like i said, it was super chill and no one was there. So here my comments:LOVE: I got unlimited mimosas and there was no time limit! Maybe it's because they do not get so many large parties there so i was very content about that. I love the atmosphere and the aesthetics. They have live music! Someone was playing the acoustic guitar and it was super soothing to listen to. Like: i liked my food. However, separately, i wouldn't have like it. I got chicken and waffles. My waffle was rather bland and my chicken thigh was a little too salty for my tastes. But together, i think they meshed rather well. My friend ordered potatoes and they were really good as an appetizer. Dislike: my food was good but it was ehh. So i really want to come for dinner to see what it is like. Overall, i would definitely recommend this place. I would give it a 3 for brunch and when i come for dinner, I'll update my review.","I'm a vegetarian and it seems that the only dish on the menu for me is the Cauliflower ""steak"" and quinoa. There seems to be a memo going around that this what vegetarian want since I'm seeing it so much but there are other options...I do like cauliflower but I've yet to have a really good dish to justify the price tag /  paying instead of stating home and makkn the same  or better dish at home.This is 2019 Restaurants should really be *consulting vegetarian* people before setting a vegetarian dish as their only option. I was so disappointed when my dish was set in front of me. It was clearly missing.... Something. Looked Like carb on carb.That plate made me sad. Was thinking - Can I get some onions? Some color? Some tomato? Or Something unique? Sure quinoa had pototien but I feel like I needed... something else. It Looked like the chef just didn't care about people who don't eat meat even though we make reservations and we have friends who eat meat. I'm less likely to go back there with my freinds if the restaurant continues to appear not to care about my experience there.With all that said, I could not give least than 4 stars for 2 reasons which are a big credit to the restaurant- everyone there  seemed to be committed to excellent service in the restaurant. The chef on the floor. Very friendly and  tending to customers. Impressive. The biggest credit- my husband was raving about his steak dish he said was perfect. I'm a neighbor So if Love make other reservations there...but ONLY if I'm also excited to eat there.P.s. :)Potatoes are great- but not evenly heated- pieced below not so good. Fingers crossed for changes to make this place a regular for me, my family and friends",Tambour
128,"I haven't written a review for this place because I don't want you all to know about it, but alas there's always a wait so I guess what harm could it do now.1- Cash ONLY.  BUT it really is shockingly cheap so if you forget this you might still be ok with whatever you happen to carry in your wallet lol2- ALL VEGETARIAN- Thank you!!!!! 3- Very cool vibe. The place is big enough to be intimate but also have a group come in. The decor is all Ethiopian themed and the wait staff are always niceI could literally eat Ethiopian food all day every day- probably don't go alone bc its a more interactive type of cuisine as you eat with your hands and the injera, but damn its soooo good.",Came for my cousin 26 Birthday to try something new. She been her numerous of times. I enjoyed the Ethiopian food for the first time. It's always good to try new things and be open to new food. We didn't make it in time for the coffee ceremony but everyone speaking very highly of the coffee ceremony.,"Incredible food and organic wine, incredible atmosphere, incredible staff. Just go here!","As someone with embarrassingly little knowledge about Ethiopian food and culture, I can only say that the food here is incredible, the ambience is divine, and it's cash only. Bunna (aka coffee) ceremony every Wed and Fri at 6pm, Sat and Sun at 5pm. If you participate you get free bunna! Any coffee shop should definitely try the origin of their favorite drink.  They offer both Ethiopian beers and a handful of domestic craft beers.If you're alone, try the Meal-size Beyaynetu $14, your choice of 5 entrees in small portions over injera.  If you've ever eaten Indian food with naan, you'll get the hang of nomming on this delicious cuisine.","A happy, energetic environment to enjoy an Ethiopian feast on a Wednesday night. There was a 20-min wait at 8:00PM for 3 eaters. A live band and music playing were an added bonus to our meal - maybe every Wednesday is live music?Our trio had the two orders of sambusas, 'feast for 3', a bottle of pinotage, and finished off with baklava. Recommend 'feasting' so you're able to try all the dishes they whip up, with some rotating out seasonally. The rolls of injera flatbread were a perfect vehicle for picking up the nine dishes (they come in little mountains on a MASSIVE feast platter) - bouncy, tart sourdough to net the rich savoriness. Shared piece of baklava was a sweet ending to the meal.","K.C. and N.S. and I came here after a foray into the Bushwick climbing gym Metrorock. K.C. had been here a few times before and thus recommended the platter for two. Apparently the platter for three was more than enough food for a group of 5. So, we got the full combination of nine different sides made up of all sorts of things, collard greens, ground lentils, beans, pickled veggies, etc. The platter itself was served all at once and had a repeat of the sides on each side of the plate. It helped save us from having to rotate the dish. The fermented flatbread to pick up the sides was, as you'd expect, a little sour (I believe its actually sourdough based) but not so sour as to upset your stomach. We did end up needing an extra side of bread but it was well worth it. So why 4 stars? Ethiopian isnt my favorite cuisine but it was well seasoned and had a nice balance of flavors. Additionally, when I've had the flatbread in the past, I've gotten upset stomachs quite quickly afterwards. The bread here has a nice balance of flavor and fermentation which added to the dishes and made it easier on my stomach. Will give it a try again in a few months!",Bunna Cafe
129,"I came here for restaurant week. Place is dimly lit so it's bad for IG photos.AppetizerMoules PiperadeDELICIOUS! Dip the vread into the sauce! The mussels were well cooked and everything tastes better in sauce. probably my favorite dish over the fish.EntreeI had the swordfish which was pretty great, the fish was very soft and moist. I typically didnt eat fish because I'm terrified of fish bones but this fish had no bones in them!DessertThe dessert I had was the mint chocolate gateau. I dont like very sweet, heavy desserts so I had a bite of this one and and it was good but I'm not much of a dessert person.",The notion of hospitality is lost on this venue - a shame as the food and setting set it up for success. Won't be going back.,"Stopped by during a Monday night and ordered a steak & frites. It's just mediocre, not bad but definitely not very good. Won't come again as there are many better options.","Been here many times. It became my new goto after some bad experiences with Bacchus. The Chickpea socca is fresh and savory with softness and crispness in all the right places.The creme brulee French toast tastes EXACTLY LIKE CREME BRULEE! How the heck do they do that?The Eggs Benedict are always perfectly poached.And the fries... woohoo.Go, enjoy, bring friends, have a wonderful time.","This is a cute place with nice ambiance but a wee bit cramped so you're quite close to your neighbors.I'm a little torn on the food-- it was a bit heavy for what I was expecting. A lot of heavy sauce, even though the food itself wasn't bad. Depends on what you order of course-- my sister loved her beef tartar which was light and left her a bit hungry while I was uncomfortably stuffed.Waitress wasn't the friendliest which is why this place is still just okay in my book. Wouldn't mind trying it out again in the future, and see if my thoughts on it changes.","Another day, another restaurant week review....The restaurant atmosphere is nice but it is a bit loud. It's a bit cramped (so voices get loud) and they play jazz music on top of that. It was not too loud to hear the other person and tables for more than two seemed to have more space.The service...exceptional... they were very good making sure we had everything we wanted. The only issue was that I eat a late lunch and was not that hungry. They would not let us split the restaurant week 3 courses and I had to order something. I got the soup and both of us ended up eating too much. It's not that big of a deal but was an inconvenience.The food - good but nothing I will be craving but solid good food. Good portions too. We got tghe cauliflower soup, the mussels,  the steak with fries, and the profiter rolls. The steak was a bit salty but good. The best part was the mussels. They were in a mustard sauce but it worked and was good.We went for restaurant week, but they also have a prefix 3 course dinner every Monday.Overall pretty solid place",French Louie
130,"I have been here twice, the service has been mediocre along with the bland food. Both times I have been here I have experienced the manager/owner have an argument with staff and delivery people. Its a shame I am sure without his presence both of my experiences would have been that much better, despite the bland tasting food.","No matter if you're eating in or ordering via seamless...the staff here KILL IT. Always delicious, always on point, always f-ing proper. This place rocks","Not bad.Food, it's just alright. I wanted it to blow my mind and be my new Greek go to. Honestly, given no other options I'd go back again Given the option of gyro world on ridgewood capitalizing on that cracked out junk food doused in yogurt... I'm going for gyro world","I LOVE Yiayia's Taverna, it's the only Greek food I've ordered around here that tastes authentic! We order from here all the time, I'm also writing this as I wait for our delivery to come because I know it's always amazing.It genuinely reminds me of my yiayia's cooking growing up. The owners/managers must be Greek because it really tastes like home cooking.Highly recommend, and I'm Greek lol!","Stopped in for dinner with a friend after walking by the other day and had a great dinner! Food was fresh, well-priced, and delicious. The highlight was definitely the baklava we ordered, and we received a complimentary greek yogurt dish as well. The only complaint was the service. When we were seated, we asked for a drink menu and were told that they didn't have one. Then when our waiter came back after a while, he rattled off a list of drinks. We both ordered sangria, and finished them pretty early and never had a chance to even ask for a second glass. When we finished our meal, we had to wait over 20 minutes to ask for the check before finally getting up and finding a server. Additionally, my friend felt like the employees were watching her eat pretty intently and it made her slightly uncomfortable. None of these were too big of an issue, and we will be back at some point to try it again, but definitely just something to keep in mind for the future!","Came across this place while randomly walking around and I'm very pleased with it. The pita and olives served as a starter were good and had me excited for more. I ended up ordering the doner sandwich with a side salad which was a huge portion (could definitely be shared) but was definitely delicious. Also, their red sangrias are tasty and we were able to get them on a happy hour special!",Yia Yia's Taverna
131,"Maybe this was me and my wife's favorite Pho in the tri-state area.Definitely a but overpriced compared to Chinatown Pho places, but the neighborhood that they are in (south Williamsburg) makes it understandable.Worth checking out just for their Pho!",Some of the most authentic Viet dishes u could find in New York. This is Hũ Tíu Gõ. The flavor is on point. Made me miss home so much.,"Definitely americanized Vietnamese cuisine cater more toward Westerners. This doesn't mean the food is bad in anyways, they are still okay, just does not taste as flavorful and some dishes are just really 'bland' and average. Read the two asian ladies reviews above, notice all the high rating are of mostly non-asian/ non-vietnamese. Extremely overprice for the portion and quality. $16 for a bowl of Hue Beef noodle is possibly the highest I've paid in my entire life anywhere. Then they want to charge extra just to have the spicy chili oil thats supposed to come with this dish, with out this chili, this dish isnt a complete dish in vietnamese cuisine standard, They are only able to do this here because, once again this is caters to westerners. Imagine charging extra for mustard when you buy hot dogs, or ketchup when you buy fries. When we come in, we were the only asian peopleIn this restaurant and felt like we were being treated differently right away. Instead of leading us to the table, the server just point to the table in the corner. Usually, I don't mind these kind of etiquette in restaurants but if you're going to charge premium price for typical foods, at least I expect a little more customer - experience oriented service. We ordered the tamarind chicken wings, grill pork rice dish and bun bo hue. 5 mins later the server came out and said they no longer have any of the chicken wings. We ordered something else instead. Around 10-15 minutes later, 2 westerners guests entered and ordered the same chicken wings we tried to order earlier. Notice that this is when our food still hasn't come out yet. We didn't say anything right away just to see if the chicken wings actually come out and you guessed it, they have the chicken wings!! When I asked for the check, I politely ask the server how come she said they don't have the chickens wing, she said, oh because they were out of the sauce, and that they have made the sauce again now... and she then ask me if I want the chicken wings now, after I asked for the check...","Fantastic Pho, Great Spring Rolls & Watercress Salad.The Bun Bo Hue and Chicken Pho broth were both delicious and sweet.  The Bun Bo Hue was my favorite of the two due to the complexities of broth flavor.  With thin slices of beef shank and bologna topped with scallions, onions, bean sprouts, cilantro, and mint, everything was fresh and vibrant.  The Grilled Chicken over rice is a keeper.  Tender moist thigh meat sliced and layered over seasoned rice.  There is also an option for rice noodles in case you don't want rice.The Roll Platter included two each of three different rolls.  A fried Spring Roll, a Summer Roll and a Rice noodleSheet wrapped with beef.  The fried Spring Roll was definitely very good with a strong porky flavor.  The summer roll was ok as was the rice noodle beef.Tamarind Wings were ok but the plate was limited to two wings and two drumettes.  That's a little pricey for 10 bucks to be honest.  Even so they were very good options for appetizers.The menu will vary, on a recent visit the menu did change but the quality of the food didn't.  The pho options were slightly different but still very tasty.  It's a small restaurant with 7 Table tops, a picnic table, and a bar, not really a place for a super large group.  There's a slight discount for cash and the staff are friendly.","I've been dying to come here for so long, and it definitely hit ever spot I was craving for this! We came on a Sunday early afternoon, and there weren't many people in there. This is great, because we sat down right away :) rather then waiting an hour+ for a table, especially in that area. They have season menus, btw! We wanted to try their spring rolls but unfortunately it is on their regular lunch menu during the week, and not on their summer brunch menu. Confusing, but I guess we just need to come back! We ordered their grilled rice paper, which was delicious! It's cool too, because they offer scissors to cut rather then ripping with your hands. Light, crispy and good. My sister go their beef Pho, which was packed with beef and I got their street pork noodle soup which was SOOO flavorful, wow. Both soup portions were a great size, the perfect size to fill you up but won't leave you hungry or won't leave you feel bloated and stuff. Their presentation is cute too. We ordered a Vietnamese coffee, super strong and it almost tasted like candy.Their staff was super friendly, and the ambiance/ vibe is cool. Their pricing is pricer then your typical whole in the wall Vietnamese place in Queens, but what do you expect. We're in Brooklyn and it's more of a restaurant. I'm use to spending $8 on a bowl or soup and I spent $15 on mine here. If you're in the area, or a huge fan of Vietnamese food, i suggest checking this place out.",Overall experience is good. The pho I found out the sweeter it is the more south it's from. For me sweets is not for me. But the rest of the food is good. When I came the head chef was away. Will come back to try the food again.,High Lúa Vietnamese Kitchen
132,"My first experience was amazing. We decided to do the Chef's menu both times and had different experience each times.First experience - food came out on time & was on point. Everything was amazing. Second Experience - The first five plates were great. But everything went downhill after that. We waited 15 mins for the next plate & it was the exact same thing they brought out for plate #2. Server apologize and took the plate back. 5 mins later, same thing happened. He brought out another plate & it was the same as plate #3. We also mentioned no pork as dietary restrictions - there was bacon on the ice-cream!Overall- Disappointing Experience.","Had a bad experience at this restaurant last night and do not recommend, particularly for anyone with food allergy concerns. My friend is severely celiac and, upon arriving, informed the waiter who spoke with the chef (one of the co-owners) and provided a marked up version of the menu indicating which dishes were gluten free. As she was eating the first dish (which, as noted above, was specifically recommended to her by the chef as being safe to eat), she began feeling ill. We took a good look through the dish, realized it contained rye, and flagged it to the server who promptly apologized and went to check with the chef. The chef proceeded to insist the dish was in fact gluten free and only after some back and forth and a google search did he come to the realization it was not. The fact a chef and co-owner of a restaurant could be so misinformed about his dishes and their contents is concerning in itself, however our biggest disappointment was a phone conversation that happened afterwards with the chef's wife, Heather. While Heather could have apologized on behalf of the restaurant for the mistake, she was defensive, confrontational, and overall left such a bad taste with us that I can't imagine ever returning to Traif or to Heather and her husband's other restaurant next door, Xixa.",Service in this restaurant is really bad. My parents and I had really bad experience in this restaurant.,"Really delicious tapas style restaurant- we were recommended to come here and definitely glad we did. Food was amazing (well cooked and well seasoned), and our waiter was super friendly. He recommended we order 2-3 dishes per person so we actually ordered 6 at first (we were hungry) but then were able to cancel one of our dishes after realizing that we had definitely over ordered! To start, they gave us free little soup shots which were very tasty. Then we got:- shishito peppers with watermelon- definitely worth getting, not your average shishito dish, very flavorful and not too heavy - tuna tartare- exceeded my expectations, it was paired perfectly on fried eggplant, not too oily or saucy- cauliflower bowl- tasty and quite hearty and filling, comes with cucumbers, tomatoes, rice crisps, etc- fish dish - forgot what kind of fish (maybe flounder?) but it was so perfectly cooked and came with a side of pan fried bao (like Chinese buns); I actually think I would've preferred steamed buns instead since the fish itself was fried. But still so flavorful and probably my favorite dish!- scallop risotto- again cooked perfectly, at this point we were unfortunately getting pretty full but it was delicious, had some corn and tomatoes in it tooOverall we really enjoyed every single dish.. favorite was the fish, least was probably the cauliflower - not because I didn't enjoy it though, just everything else was even tastier! Ended with some complementary pineapple bites. Yum.","We visited Traif on a dreary night and were hoping to get some cocktails and some delicious food. We ordered two cocktails off the menu- this is where the biggest disappointment came. Honestly the entire cocktail menu needs revamped- they are all heavily suite options and just not appealing. We really were disappointed with our cocktails, so much so that we did something that I have never done, we asked to have something different- they were seriously undrinkable. We ordered two plates- they are bigger tapas (definitely sharable). We needed something to put the taste of those cocktails in the past! We were surprised with an amuse bouche which was a curried carrot soup and it was INCREDIBLE it was our best part of the entire meal and it was a tiny serving. We both agreed that if we could have had a bowl of that, we would have been pleased. Our burrata, bacon jam and bbq potato chips was unique. The texture of the burrata wasn't typical (I am kind of a burrata enthusiast) so that was just ok. The gnnochi with a pepper sauce and chorizo was ok as well, nothing to write home about. Towards the end of the meal the bartender made his own cocktails for us, which the gesture was so kind, but honestly they were not great either and we were just trying to steer clear from the cocktails. Again though the service here, they are trying to make it work and be really helpful and receptive to their patrons.If you go here, definitely stick to wine- the cocktails are a no go.I would return only for that carrot curried amuse bouche.","As long standing patrons of Xixa we were interested in seeing what Traif has to offer. BTW big up to Jando for the recommendation. We made reservations over the weekend and had an amazing experience. It started with the nine course chefs selection. I will break it down from my favorite to least. I must disclaim we bought a bottle of white wine, so my memory is a little hazy=). 1) Spicy tuna tartare (delicious!!)2) Strawberry-cinnamon glazed baby back ribs3) Dayboat scallops4) Salt and pepper shrimp with pineapple5) Looks like Creamy pasta with octopus ink(forgot the name sorry)6) Roasted duck breast 7-9) Can't remember the names...... I give up... all I can say is everything was delicious, including the deserts!I must mention the waitress, my compadre Isabel from Mexico.Thank you for such great service! I did want to point out that in my opinion, I believe Xixa to be a little bit more upscale. Other than that, both places are amazing with a fantastic spin on the typical tapas menu. If you want to impress your date or want to take your significant other to a boujee little restaurant without the city prices,Traif is a must!",Traif
133,"We happened to stumble upon this hidden jewel off of Flatbush Ave after another restaurant that we were interested in wasn't open for business yet. There is outdoor seating available for those who may be interested in soaking up Vitamin D while enjoying their meal. I believe there were about four tables available for outside dining.My friend and I decided to try the chicken breast sandwich which consisted of a grilled chicken breast, turkey bacon, mashed avocado, lettuce, tomato and Mayo on a tasty soft toasted brioche roll and the PurBird mac n' cheese. I told our server to omit the avocado dressing on my sandwich but somehow it was on my order when it arrived. Rather than wait for another sandwich or the cook choosing to wipe the dressing off himself in place of making a new sandwich , I did it myself instead. However, the small mishap wasn't enough for me to not write a good review because the food was really good.The decor is simple, nothing outstanding which is okay because the focus should be on that good chicken coming out of the kitchen. If you sign up on their website, they will email you specials and coupons. Hey, who doesn't like specials and coupons especially when good food is involved? I know that I do! I can't wait until my next visit to PurBird!",They removed whole and half chicken from the menu to squeeze out more money. Lost a customer.,"Really legit! Sandwich is packed with flavor, mac is very cheesy, chicken marinade is good.","I love grilled chicken sandwiches and whenever I can find a place that makes them well, I take note.  With the beautiful pics from Purbird, I had to try it out and they did not disappoint!My friend had the regular chicken thigh wrap and of course I went for the sandwich. Layered with lettuce, tomatoes, turkey bacon and crushed avocado, I added raw red onions for an extra kick. It was delicious. Everything was fresh and crisp, the bread, like a brioche cloud The employees are personable and provided quick service.The wrap also looked great and heard it was tasty. A group of regulars came and ordered chicken breat cutlets with some type of green leafy veggies in a bowl and that, too, looked great. Definitely worth another visit.","This is a cute little chicken at the corner of flatbush and 6ave. Can't miss it as you can see the blue color and big sign from a mile away lol. The chicken is grilled, flavorful and very moist. It's not your regular size chicken but the little hen. It's flatten and grilled to perfection. We have 2 sides: jalapeno mac and cheese, it was very spicy and pretty greasy, and sweet potato fries, which were pretty soggy, but the chicken was the total bomb. It's self serve but the guy was nice to bring us water and our food. Even though the chicken was delicious, I found it very expensive $31 for 1/2 chicken and 2 sides, and the half chicken is a very small portion. I saw the board and it's $10.50 for a lettuce salad and extra $5 if you want chicken in it. Food took a while to come out. Place seemed empty but they had lots of to go orders.","This was my first visit to Purbird. It was 11:45am on a Sunday. I ordered the spicy half chicken and the jalapeno mac and cheese. I paid, gathered my utensils and napkin, then took my seat at the window. I enjoyed my meal while listening to alternative and classic rock on 92.3 FM including Green Day. The chicken was great. I highly appreciated the Purebird sauce which I dipped my bread into. It's their version of barbecue sauce. The mac and cheese was fine. It's great food but too expensive for the serving size to make it a regular thing.",Purbird
134,"Came here for Fathers Day with the wife and kids. Was so looking forward to coming because we've been here before and had the oxtail burger. It was amazing and I was looking forward to having it again.  I don't know what happened since the last time we were here but it wasn't the same. We even questioned if it was actually oxtail meat in the burger because it just tasted and had the consistency and texture of regular burger meat. Was so disappointed. I'm keeping from giving this place a ""One Star"" because I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt in case I come back here again. But I don't know if I'm just over this place. I hope I'm wrong and they're not scamming people by passing off regular ground meat as oxtail.",Food here was good and vibe was dope. I accidentally walked in and was not disappointed.,"The food was good, but service particularly inattentive. I waited at the door for 10min as 4 servers buzzed around me tending to their tables. Finally, one stopped and said I could sit at the bar. I appreciated her finally taking 15 seconds to tell me that. The bar was a little wet and littered. My setting didn't get wiped down at all while I was dining, but a server did wipe down the section next to me. Maybe they just hate me. I didn't have utensils until the food was brought out and the server realized they didn't set up my setting. It took a while to get the check that I wondered if anyone would notice if I bolted. Would never go back.",WOW!!This is a pearl of a restaurant. The flavors are insanely good MUST TRY: Oxtail RavioliOctopus Steak- Staff is really nice- Restaurant is Intimate and great for a date - No need to dress up but you definitely can - Honestly one of my favorite restaurants. The flavors will blow your mind I'd highly recommend checking them out,Really good food prepared with care and without pretense.  The quintessential neighborhood restaurant.,"Sunday funday! I found this place through yelp and was very glad that I closed out the weekend with brunch at Aita's. It was very warm and was surprised to notice there wasn't any AC. It turned out to be fine but a bit toasty as you were waiting for a seat.I believe they were short staffed or at least it seemed they were stretched pretty thin. We waiting around 15 minutes for the hostess to seat us. It wasn't an issue as it gave me time to decided what I was going to get because I'm pretty indecisive. Once I was seated I ordered almost immediately. There are so many good things on the brunch menu that it was difficult to decided. I ultimately chose the salmon hash which was incredible but also looked at breakfast, scrambled, and eggs benedict. I definitely made the right choice. The salmon was very good and the combination of the bacon, potatoes, and scallions topped with the fried egg was amazing! I was a bit nervous about how much salmon I'd actually get, but I was glad to see they included a healthy portion. Brunch was fantastic but I definitely have to be back because I need to try the pasta!",Aita
135,"Wet food and absolutely no flavor, no spice, and no salt. I added lots of salt, still, couldn't swallow the puffy, greasy chunky rice. The meat was wet! Yes, wet with some soup, although I ordered the grilled dish and specifically asked him if the meat is grilled and browned or is it in Maraq, which is soup or tomatoes sauce. He insisted that the dish should come with crispy grilled to perfection peices. I'm from an Arabic country, and I've been cooking Arabic Food since I'm 9 years old, so you can't tell me that's the dish is normal or it should be like this, coz it is not! They wouldn't dare serve that to their Yemeni family. I have had many Yemeni dishes, and the tasteless, flavorless plate I received would not reach that status. Yemeni food is one of the best of Arabian cuisines.I hated the food so much THAT I barely ate 4 spoonfuls. I wouldn't suggest going there unless you don't care or don't know better. I'm sure they have some dishes that taste better and cooked right.","The Good: The food is incredible, we had the Lamb Haneeth & the Hafsah and both came with sides, naan, soup, and tea. I am so happy. The wait staff are pleasant.The Bad: Not clear about the fact that we can get our own water in the back for free, never offered us any drinks, so odd.The Ugly: When it's busy, it operates like organized chaos. If I had a larger family, I would be annoyed. But it was just the two of us.CANT WAIT TO COME BACK FOR ALL THE FOOD.","Lamb Fahsa and Foul. They bring you mad bread, the tastiest soup and killer hot sauce.Terrible lighting. It's perfect.","Yemen once was the center of a major civilization. It had trade and culture, consequently great food.  In a thumbnail, Yemeni cuisine can be described as a cross between Middle Eastern / Greek and Indo /Pakistani food.  The food is distinct and delicious.  Their national dish is Roast Lamb called Haneeth. Saltah/Fahsa a root vegetable (plus meat)  stew served in hot stone pot is very popular. Spicy Marg soup/broth is also a very iconic Yemeni starter. The Yemeni ""Biryani"" (rice and meat casserole) called Zorbian  is different from the Indo/Pak Biryani but equally good. Yemen Café  on Atlantic Ave, close to Court Street (by the recently shut down  Barney's) is perhaps the best Yemeni Restaurant outside of Yemen. It has been a local landmark for multiple decades. It was there when the neighborhood was not that hip.   I have never been disappointed with food at Yemen Café. They serve their spicy Marg soup and their oven fresh bread with all meals (just comes without even asking for it).  Almost everything on their meu is good. On every visit I take some food home for the next day","The complimentary marag soup was good. Really good. It all went downhill from there. Salad was bland, nothing special. The hummus was decent, not too much to it, but it was fresh. Their ""world famous lamb haneeth""? Not in this world. Not flavorful, way over-cooked. It really was like eating a soft leather shoe. Not kidding. When you add in the price tag...well, it would do in a Zombie Apocalypse, by other than that, I wouldn't eat it for free.  Being of Middle Eastern origin, I was highly disappointed. Won't be coming back for a meal, but if I'm ever in the area I might get some soup to go.","Paaacked on a Sunday night. Always a good sign. Full of locals who know what they're eating.The lamb was deliciously tender and literally felt right off the bone. The hummus was delicious and authentic, nothing like a Sabra (though Sabra is quite yum). The Kibdah (lamb liver) was only fine; I've had way better, and this one's texture and spice level just felt off.",Yemen Cafe & Restaurant
136,I tried it again last week and not satisfied.  I decided to give it another try  after getting attacked by the owner on Yelp for giving the business a 1 star rating. The last time.......Salty food especially the chicharon. Same issue this time and they aren't very customer service friendly.  Time to move on!.....,"I was in the area and want to try out this restaurant. I order take out with Oink Oink Babe Bowl for $12.00 (Slow cooked pork butt with rice and beans) I was so disappointed it. The pork are ""SO SALTY"" and I can't even eat it. This is probably the most salty pork I ever had in my life. The price is high  and potion is small. I will not going back again!",I visited Cuba recently and became an addict of Cuban coffee and food. If you want the same food and hospitality this is the place!!!,"Bruh..... I had quite the experience ordering from MCS through Uber eats (). Let's just say this food was absolutely worth the two hours I waited. MCS did nothing wrong! They were sooooo helpful and patient. Uber driver was a jerk. Anywho!The boss sangweech. WO WI can't wait to go back and have another one. So much flavor!!!! The pork , the bread , the proportion of mustard  and pickles . The mariquitas are crispy and perfect. The mojo!! Perfection. I also had a guava and cheese empanada.  it was divine. So flaky. I'm speechless.   Shoutout to the woman working that afternoon. She was awesome as wellThank you, My Cuban Spot. You really are my Cuban spot .","Amazing food, great prices -- will definitely be back. Came here to see how The Boss (Cubano) compared to other Cubano sandwiches, and it did not disappoint in the slightest way. Also ordered a Nutella Empanada. There isn't a lot of seating, and the seating available doesn't seem too comfortable, but this place is perfect for carry out. Still, the outside is cute; and the benches are convenient. Pro tip: Order online about 20 minutes in advance; my wait time wasn't painful, but still. The Boss (Cubano): Everything about it was great. The meat was flavorful; the bread was crunchy; the mustard wasn't overpowering. I'm not sure what sauce came with it, but I found myself dipping my sandwich in it frequently. The plantain chips that came with it were also good -- found myself eating them with the sandwich, rather than after. Nutella Empanada: Awesome dessert to go with the Cubano. Not much to say about it, other than that it was delicious. I also appreciated the sweet milky sauce that came with it. That definitely put the whole empanada on another level. Price: 5/5Quality: 5/5Quantity: 5/5Service: 4/5Atmosphere: 3/5",Great sandwiches. We had the Cubano and the Steak. Be prepared to fill up on this tasty food. But also be prepared for very limited outdoor seating. Probably best for take away.,My Cuban Spot
137,"DO NOT GO HERE, I BELIEVE THEY ARE RACIST I live in the community and just started coming here. the owner and staff seemed ok, a little weird whenever I came but I shrugged It off. I really hate how everything is always a black/white issue, but this last encounter, and how it all played out, I couldn't overlook this anymore!I came in sat down, saw the room had a few people there and had a quiet meeting with clients. I needed some change for the meeting, asked they didn't want to give me any. Usually ive been using my card so I never had to asked before. That was fine Shrugged It off. I had another client meeting soon, so I decided to stay there instead of going home. while there someone  who looked white asked for change and they gave it to them I was puzzled, but I had another meeting, so I was getting ready for that.After my second meeting I was filling out paperwork and the owner or one of the many staff said basically I had to leave...I didn't understand why...he said I couldn't be doing meetings here...I was in shock really, because 1. there was a few people that meet others at this place and sat right next to me, so I know they were having a biz meeting to, and two people right in front of me as well. 2. I thought maybe I  was sitting here to long, and that cant be the case because there was a white guy who  was there before I was there and he was still there as I left. He was  writing on his laptop. 3. Most of my clients are local and are black and now looking back, anytime I would have a meeting there the guy was always weird about it, and now I know why! His a racist, when he told me this the room wasn't full, but I believe everyone else was white or fair skinned. I was singled out for no other reason. Also every time I was there I always bought something to support, so I wasnt just freeloading & using there space, and was every quiet, just minding my business. Am disgusted & in shock that this happened in Bed Stuy smh!PLEASE DONT GO HERE!!!there is a Donkin donuts across  the street or there is a nice place near the corner of the park","The food is great, but when I got back to my car, the coffee cup bottom had separated from the top- spilling everywhere. I sent the cafe a note via square and received no response. I think it's frustrating that I wasted money on a coffee that I couldn't drink and didn't get a response or anything from the square message I sent. Food was good, but service is lacking.","They have a lot of working space but limited places to charge any devices while working. Some of the chargeable areas were taken by people without any food or coffee. Unfortunately can't stay here and work. Coffee was just okay.Interesting menu. The BLT was decent but they use spinach instead of lettuce. The board says that it's a spring mix, but it's definitely just spinach.","It looks like a bar but breakfast was gluten free and  tasty!Strong coffee, breakfast tacos and a bright window.I'll be back","The service was great! The cashiers/waitresses were warm and welcoming, and the ambience is great for meetups and work. What prompted the two stars, however, was the food and coffee. My partner and I ordered the kimchi omelette and breakfast wrap. While they were not bad tasting, I would have expected a lot more from an eating establishment with presumably professional cooks. The level of cooking was something that I'd expect from a home cook -- why come all the way out here to pay $14 for a meal that I could have made this at home for less than half that price? The specifics:-The gochujang (Korean chili paste) was greatly watered down and runny, which is not something you'd expect of Asian restaurants. In real Korean eateries, the sauce is more viscous, almost to the point of tomato paste. -The kimchi omelette could do with more kimchi. It lacks the acidity and almost pungent, fermented element, rendering the kimchi omelette not much different from the ordinary American omelette. -As a former barista, I realized that my mocha, and all other hot espresso beverages that I observed around this eatery, were steamed terribly. Steamed milk should not have uneven bubbles on the top --  steamed milk should have microfoam (not bubbles) that is more homogeneous. The mocha itself has an artificial hazelnut flavor, and it just covers what lackluster espresso flavor there is.","Garden fresh bibimbap & platters affixed with delectable bulgogi and side of house gochujang. But the real star was the marinaded spicy pork. Generously portioned in this hipster meets retro meets smooth 21st century technology corner cafe spot- we just came in for a lemonade on a hot day but got so much more.It was mid-day and they were clearly renovating... replete with 4 muscle men ""piping"" their new roaster because clearly a 200lb 20Gallon roaster is for little league. Oh yes- aside from the housemade Korean standards with a twist... their thing is Coffee... really really special coffee where you can tell someone has an obsession when there are actual life-sized hour glass contraptions of cold-brew technology. That alone is worth a look to be honest. If not, they have artisanal beer and wine on tap as well. Shout out to Juwan & Angel who treated us like we've been frequenting the day he opened- we haven't but we definitely will now.",Nostrand Cafe
138,"Not sure why I gave it a 3.5 before, this is definitely a 4.5 or 5. Things to order:-gimlet-lamb shank-tahini & date salad-feta herb flatbreadPass on:-catch-of-the-day-eggplant mainAlso a tendency for the servers to be sort of obnoxious, better-than-you white men. But not all.","This place is overrated. I never write bad reviews but here it goes. As soon as you walk in the door the host is rude. She let us know that the bar would be available in a half an hour and then when we came back she was absurdly rude saying we misunderstood what she said so as to cover up her own errors. When we pushed back to let her know that she told us 7 pm she insisted that my boyfriend was rude and being ""rough"". The owner disappeared from the incident and stood behind the bar. When we sat down to eat- we we're recommended a rosé that was blah, too sweet, cheap. The food took a while to come and when it did the feta bread was extremely salty with low quality cheese and way too much of it for the amount of bread. Everything was too salty. The lamb shank too. The food was seriously just fine.  My boyfriend took a sip of his water and found a piece of glass in his mouth. When he told the bartender what happened nobody did anything- no apology or word from the bartender- who was cold---no notifying the manager. The place should know the number one rule of business which is treat the customer well- from the first step in, to the empty reserved tables, to the food, to the glass- nothing went well and no one was there to correct it with a complimentary dessert. The restaurant needs a warmer approach and a less defensive and uptight host.","Came here in December with a rezzie for 5 people.  Had been dying to get in since the infamous NY Times Article on how great it was.  The good:+cute vibe in the heart of BK neighborhood off Flatbush Ave.+nice, simple restaurant that is loud and lively but not too loud or lively.+the food is very good and authentic.The bad:-HOLY SHIT IT IS OVER-PRICED.  you can get the same meal easily in Boston or NYC for probably half the price and 4X the authenticity. But, you pay for fancy ish. -the service was TERRIBLE. they forgot things we ordered and were so slow getting us drink, food, and take our order, etc. that eventually the person who owned the restaurant had to take our orders.Would only be back for drinks, not food.","Scored the last 6 PM res on opentable by checking randomly the night before. Start with the eggplant dip, you won't regret it. Don't pass up the kofte meatball, the sauce and tender meatball will have you keep returning back to the dish. The roasted cauliflower is spicy as warned but goes well with the yogurt underneath. The lamb shank is tender will all the meat falling off the bone but the steak kebabs are some of the BEST marinated steak we've ever had!  The pomegranate flavor really comes through and the steak is perfectly marbleized. Both went well with the carrot rice. Tahdig wasn't quite like homemade but is always a treat!Ice cream sandwich was unique and delish - the ice cream is all 3 flavors of pistachio and saffron with rosewater. Incredible food!","I came here on a Friday night and had reservations for 745 and it's a good thing I had reservations because it stayed packed. They do apparently have a downstairs room too though that is meant for walk ins. Everyone was super kind and welcoming and the menu was very interesting, there wasn't really anything bad but I didn't leave feeling like I have to come back. We had the eggplant and Whey dip which was very good but also very rich, I had to stop eating it at a certain point worrying I wouldn't feel so good later. We each got the lamb shank and then split the orange zest and carrot rice which was really good but also slightly less flavorful than I would've expected. The lamb was incredibly juicy and just came right off the bone without even a knife, could be cut with a spoon.For dessert we got the ice cream sandwich, the ice cream was so flavorful and interesting, highly recommend!","Really beautiful spot with some solid Persian food. It's white and expansive and spacious and doesn't get too loud. I ordered a bunch of things, including:roasted cauliflower - not my favorite. It was a little too oily, and could have been more seasoned.grilled carrots and yogurt - the grilled carrots really brought out its natural sweetness, and was really tasty. orange zest and carrot rice - this is pretty standard, but the long grained rice was fluffy and fragrant.lamb shank - the lamb shank was pull-apart tender. The crispy onions was a nice touch, and the broth was really tasty and worked well with the rice.smoked eggplant - my favorite part of this dish was probably the poached eggs that I could swirl around with the roasted and charred eggplant.tahdig - these were just a few pieces of crispy rice bits; I don't feel like I need to have ordered them again.",Sofreh
139,Absolutely disappointed the wife and I at our last visit. We were coming out from manhattan and really looking forward to an evening there after several good experiences.  I will say the place has excellent drinks and awesome oysters.We were seated behind the bar at the oyster station and after no one checked in on us we asked a server passing by for some help.  After some time passed I ultimately had to snag the hostess as she was bringing others to the rear.  Round two on the drinks I had to snag the hostess again.  We moved to the main bar but by that time the evening was ruined.  Never going back.,"Very good food, we have been here a lot of times. The past few we've had issues with the time it took servers to get our drinks and orders as well as the orders coming out. Last time we waited for 2 cocktails for 28 minutes. Their garden is infested with caterpillars so I don't recommend sitting outside if you have issues with them falling on you/your drink or food.","Came here yesterday for 4th of July. I think this place has a great atmosphere, cute decor, and the live jazz music was amazing. However, service was horrible. We wanted to get some oysters and seafood but our waitress ignored us every time we tried to call her. She paid attention to every other table except ours. The table next to us were constantly served and asked if everything's okay, and she never even asked us that. It took them 30 min to bring us 2 glasses of wine and 1 cocktail. I asked the hostess and our waitress why this was and they both said that it was the bar's fault. They switched out our waitress and our new waitress didn't pay any attention to us either. We ended up leaving after paying for drinks and no one in the restaurant seemed to care about our  experience.","My favorite place for great oysters. Great selection of oysters to choose from too.They make a good drink as well Love the old style ambiance. A little pricey for a group, great for two.","Great cocktails, pretty good food too if you really order right, and the place is gorgeously transporting -- that's what this team does best. Experiences vary wildly. Had a glorious dinner (with a reservation) in their verdant backyard garden. Succulent absinthe-based cocktails. Solid food. Oysters are your best best here. Like Sauvage, you are really coming here for the experience and the mixology -- not the cooking.Another afternoon, stumbled in off the street, last minute decision, and they were just lovely about giving us a table, and the drinks were good, and the service was attentive. We had a great time.Front of House continually seems confused in terms of several things: knowledge, training, and tone. Occasionally they are unfriendly, but competent. Other times, they are as sweet as can be, and yet have no idea how to seat a human being in their restaurant. It is honestly baffling.At a recent brunch, we were told there would be a 20 minute wait for a table. OK. We waited. It was more than 20 minutes. Eventually, we were seated -- but at the bar (which I don't like and didn't want). And without food menus. And we were famished. So I called over the hostess.""I'm not sure if we're still doing food?"" she looked around helplessly.*so why did we wait 20 minutes?* ""We are doing food,"" someone else who worked there said.""We aren't,"" another server said.Trying to be patient: ""Yes. Okay. But. We're hungry. And we want a table,"" I told them.""A table? Let me get that for you."" She searched in vain for a table.""We're still serving food,"" a host said to us, reassuringly.""We aren't actually,"" another hostess said.yeah, so we left.","Came here Monday for happy hourJust wait a couple minute for them to clean up the tables. We got garden seats. It's very cute but serious not too comfortable tho. 2 of us decide to get 2 fozen and that include everything for one from happy hour. Everything is amazing. I like discovery bay the most. It had stronger taste than others. So after a dozen oyster, we decide to go for another half dozen.Amazing place for fresh oyster!",Maison Premiere
140,Seriously good Italian deli with ridiculous portions. You ain't going home hungry! Place is a throwback but every penny!!,"Great sandwiches and quick, no nonsense service. Well manned counter gets you in and out fast. A NY gem.","One of the best sandwiches you can find in NYC. The corned beef reuben and pastrami & swiss are other-worldly.  The staff is surprisingly warm and patient for being an old school Brooklyn shop. It's off the beaten path so it's rarely crowded-another thing I like. The seating inside is very limited (one table and a couple of standing-room only counters), but when it's warm enough, they set up a few picnic tables outside in the parking lot.","Defonte's is a no-frills, classic NY-style sandwich shop, so there's a counter that you can stand at to eat, but no formal seating. I had a great experience with the staff, who are very friendly and attentive.Defonte's eggplant parmesan sandwich is a hot mess in all the right ways. Let me tell you about it.The eggplant is breaded and fried, but not greasy (eggplant has a habit of absorbing oil, which is usually what goes wrong in eggplant parm). A thick layer of gooey cheese blankets that fried eggplant goodness, and the whole thing is tied together with a fantastic marinara sauce that's on the sweeter side, with great flavor. Defonte's is a classic throw back shop well worth your time, you will NOT leave hungry but definitely  come early while the good food is still available","What a hidden gem. A true old-school Italian sandwich shop tucked away in the sleepy back end of Red Hook. Cash only.I had the ""Golden Boy"" which comes with chicken cutlet, mozz and prosciutto all smothered in vodka sauce. It was a great mix of savory, sweet, and salty. A large cost me $12 and lasted for 2 meals. All in all, there's nothing I can say against Defontes. It's a throwback, a relic of a bygone era in New York when flavor and culture mattered more than media and virality. There's a deep gastronomic satisfaction that comes from eating at places like this, and there seem to be fewer of them left every year. I can't wait to go back and try more of their sandwich combinations. I highly, highly recommend you check them out too.","In a city filled with delicious sandwiches, Defontes might just make the best Italian subs you can buy.  After ten years in Brooklyn, my family is leaving for another town.  We threw a going away party and I ordered two party subs from the best place I know - Defontes.  The sandwiches came with plates and silverware, and were pre-sliced and individually packaged.  This made everything easy, and was certainly a lot of extra work on their part.  They also included two gigantic orders of potato salad and macaroni salad.  But let's be honest, you don't go to Defontes for the potato salad.We ordered a chicken cutlet sandwich, which was delicious.  But let me be clear, the Italian sandwich is a national treasure.  Nicolas Cage should have just gone to Red Hook.  Mystery solved.  Layers of delicious deli meat and cheese were piled high.  Hiding in the middle was a mysterious, thin slice of fried eggplant (?) and sweet red peppers.  All of this was stuffed between two perfectly crispy pieces of fresh Italian bread.  Marone - that's one hell of a sandwich.  Damn, I'm going to miss Brooklyn.",Defontes
141,The service is top notch. But I found the food a tad disappointing. The wing app is so good but the scallion pancake all to easy to choke on with large undercooked hunks of scallion and zucchini (also a tad stingy with the dipping sauce).  We shared several appetizers and my daughter and I started the monkfish. I wish our very helpful server had talked us out of that. Plenty of string cut veggies but perhaps 3 oz of monkfish that were cut into small cubes and hidden in the mess on the plate. I took three lil hunks on my plate and put one back so my daughter would not be hungry.,"If you want Real Korean food, don't come here. As a Korean who grew up in family who owned successful Korean restaurants, I find the food and atmosphere here offensive to true Korean culture. The mandoo (dumplings) were undercooked, the banchan (side dishes) were bland, and the kalgbi was average. What bothered me the most were the wait staff. They were inattentive, rude, and had no understanding of Korean food. Also - the price points do not justify the experience. If you want REAL Korean food do yourself a favor and go to Koreatown.","We got seated ~9:30-10pm on Sunday. Apparently, this place was featured in NYT.+ good service and ambiance+ crispy spicy yang-yum chicken wings - standard but good+ grilled oysters seaweed butter, brioche toast - very tasty!+/- ran out of the mackerel, which they are famous so I was disappointed. They substituted the dish with sea bass, which was very good.+/- spicy cured cod roe, tuna sashimi, perilla bibimbap. The seafood was fresh, but I didn't think it tasted special. - saucy and spicy rice cake fundido, chorizo - average, very cheesy","This was really outstanding -- among the best Korean places we've tried in the city, up there with Her Name Is Han (my other favorite Korean ""comfort food"" spot) and a slight notch below Kawi (which is more upscale).First visit, we came with a party of four and got the scallion pancakes, grilled oysters, rice cake fundido, sablefish, pork barbecue ssam, spicy kimchie chigae, bibimbap with spicy squid, and then finished with the beignets and warm chocolate cake. This was a pretty perfect amount of food for us -- we killed everything and were solidly full, but not sick. The fundido is as amazing as it looks, so no surprise there. What was a surprise was that the sablefish was maybe our favorite item of the night -- it's not overly huge, but it really was perfectly done. We really loved the pork and the bibimbap as well, although it would be very tempting to try the short rib ssam and the tuna sashimi bibimbap next time around. I'd probably try a different chigae as well -- the spicy kimchi was very good, but didn't blow us away.Overall, an amazing meal and I hope we get back here sooner rather than later.","Treated myself to a birthday dinner here. Sat at the window counter by myself because I have no friends. But what I did have was an amazing meal.Lots of banchan to start off. All delicious.I ordered the fried scallops (served with a corn tartare topped with masago) as an appetizer. Perfectly fried and didn't detract from the taste of the fresh scallops.For my main, I got the jalapeno chicken. Generous portions, juicy chicken, and just the right amount of kick. Highly recommended!Washed it all down with a delicious glass of cold sake.An amazing experience all around!","We got here around 9:30pm on a Friday. It looked crowded on the inside when we passed by, but luckily the wait was only 15 minutes for a table. We were seated outside. While I usually like outdoor dining, I wished they had turned on their lights outside so that diners could actually see their food. (However, I walked by the restaurant the other day and noticed they had the outside lights on, so maybe they figured it out.) So the food photos aren't great because of the lack of lighting, but it was definitely delicious. The rice cake fundido was cheesy and the perfect size. The tuna, sea urchin, and cod roe cold bibimbap was pretty good too - lots of toppings. But my favorite was the boneless beef short rib ssam. Love wrapping it in lettuce wraps with rice. They also brought us a bunch of banchan. I don't remember the name of the cocktail I got. The waiter recommended it and I believe it had strawberries in it. It was not my favorite because I prefer drinks on the sweet side, but I think it was just personal preference.A big plus: our waiter was nice and extremely attentive. All in all, an amazing dining experience and I'd definitely come back.",Haenyeo
142,"Although not gluten free for those with a minor intolerance to gluten??? Who could resist R+R, In the day...wow","With free pizza so bad that it's a disservice to give out and a scam system of putting little gravy on sandwiches then charging money for more, going to Roll-N-Roaster today ruined my day.","I would take roll-n-roaster over Brennan and Carr's any day. Solid sandwiches, quick service with a smile, and a nostalgic rnr atmosphere that remind me of times I used to go when I was younger.","I lived in Brooklyn for quite some time but never knew this place existed. Good thing my friend bought me here. They are known for their delicious homemade roast beef and cheese fries so I gave it a try. Can't complain, the roast beef sandwich and cheese fries was fantastic! Parking was super easy. This place is huge! Quick and fast service!Definitely stop by if you are around the area.",Everyone and their mother comes here; it's a Brooklyn gem. The place is pretty huge so bring the whole family! Their prices are reasonable and they have a good variety of options so everyone will find something they like. Order $25 or more and get a free pizza!Their clam strips are delicious. The orangeade is a must! We come here a lot after the movies or if we're in the mood for some comfort food.,"Bland, unseasoned food. I gave three stars because everyone loves comfort food but you can use some more flavor, especially the fries and the roast beef which is homemade. I wish it came out warmed up, instead of refrigerator cold. Also, in my opinion they don't give enough roast beef. In places like Buffalo, where they do beef on weck, they stack it way higher than this.",Roll-N-Roaster
143,"This spot has the feeling of an intimate brunch spot.Better yet, they have a menu that contend with most and puts them to shame. The steak is a definite must. My only complaint would be that there are barely and deals for drinks. Also, this place is cash only!","Tried to go this Saturday as part of a group of 5 for my pregnant sister's birthday mini food tour. Literally more than half the restaurant was empty and we were told we couldn't be seated. We asked how long the wait would be , if we could sit outside or take some empanadas to go and he said he wasn't able to accommodate us. Won't be going back","We sat outside on a Sunday 1pm. No wait, many seats. Prefix $17 one drink (mimosa, sangria, house wine, or Bloody Mary) + one of 3 entrees + coffee. I got the chivito sandwich +$1. It was very messy to eat, and mediocre. Nothing spectacular. The empanadas looked really good, we did not order this. The atmosphere is v vintage. Heard good things about the salmon crepe.",One of our long time new favs. We love the specials and the cookie desert I actually dream about.Excellent drink specials.Relaxed vibe.So grateful,"Came across this gem after an evening of pinball at nearby Jack Bar. Empanadas (cheese and onion and chicken) were delish, a special salad that was amazing and pappardelle special that was just ok. The pasta itself was thick and tough and the sauce was quite good. The Alfajor Rústico dessert was wonderful and a must have. Bon appetite.","My go-to spot for brunch in Williamsburg. I go a few times a month. I've never been for dinner though. I don't understand how there isn't a line out the door, but there's never been a wait. Great spot for an improtu brunch with a group of friends. When friends come visit it's always on the agenda. For around $20 you can get a coffee, cocktail and steak from the pre-fix menu which is unheard of in the neighborhood. Food is great. Cocktails are great. Ambiance is great. The patio is super serene and quiet with natural shade. I can't recommend it enough.",Tabaré
144,"No, no, no, what happened to this place?  Why did they move?  Bigger doesn't always mean better, guys.  They should have remained put in their original location, it was perfect as it was, and now its lost it's appeal in more ways than one.  I don't get the tacky decor, it's no where near as dope as the small shack where they first started out, and sadly, that goes for the food as well.  I was surprised how the quality has suffered and I could tell the same level of attention was not being paid to the food, what with a busier kitchen servicing the larger volume of diners at this new, and bigger -- yet not necessarily better -- location.  It wreaks a bit of pretension.  And, nothing we ate was as memorable or delicious as we both recalled from previous experiences at their first, now de-bunked (sad) location.  Their food is no longer the ambrosia of the gods.  I hate to say it, but, I can't say I'll jump at the chance to return again.  They are also pretty overpriced now!","Sub par and overhyped Vietnamese cuisine- service is average. Ambience is quintessential Bushwick. The banh xeo we had was passable, but I felt the mains were lacking in flavor. Food also took a bot longer than average wait times to come out. Would not recommend.","Management is unreasonable and oblivious. Our friend has nut and shellfish allergies so he brought his own food to the restaurant for our group outing. Despite all of us being paying customers (including him) he was not allowed to eat his food inside. This was after the host told him it wouldn't be a problem. Instead, he was asked to take t outside as our food arrived--so we couldn't even leave anymore. He was instead forced to eat outside in the rain.","Came here for dinner with the bf and 2 of my friends a few weeks ago. The restaurant is in a rather industrial part of East Williamsburg/Bushwick, and the building it's in is a warehouse. The restaurant's interior is full of kitschy Vietnamese/South East Asian decorations, and it kind of reflects the menu, which is full of modernized and Westernized versions of traditional Vietnamese dishes. I got their vegan pho and would have loved a cruller with it, but they happened to be out that night.My pho was decent: not the absolute best that I've ever had, and certainly not the worst. I wish it had a little more body to it, but it was tasty enough. The rest of my party seemed to enjoy their respective dishes, so all in all, it was a pretty good dinner experience for us all. Also, we were told by our server that they grow their own mushrooms in house, which we thought was pretty cool. Would try out again, if I happened to be in this part of Brooklyn again.","Bunker! So good! Very skateboardy vibe and good music.Food: fresh, delicious. Very fresh, varied (good for vegetarians), and great portion sizes.Drinks: good happy hour deals. Even on weekends.Music: hip hop and chill soul (think Anderson.Paak) Family friendly as hell! Lots of kiddos running around but the place is so spacious, you don't get annoyed!","Don't be deterred by the area this is in, a desolate block of run down warehouses and such, this place is a gem. Came on a Sunday afternoon about 2:30pm and it was really packed. There was no seating in the main restaurant where they had a cool jazz band playing so we were taken ""outside"" to the covered area which is like a greenhouse and felt every bit like one. It was so hot and uncomfortable that the fan next to us didn't help. For drinks I got Kaffir the Reaper, a lovely, smooth Bourbon drink and my friend had a glass of Prosecco. We were starving so we ordered the crab spring rolls to hold us over but 25 minutes later our main meals came but not the appetizer. We let the waiter know and he apologized and brought them a few minutes later, on the house. My friend had the Chicken Sausage Bánh Mì, a large sandwich filled with lemongrass sausage and all the trimmings. I was disappointed they ran out of the Bún Thang but had been eyeing the Oxtail Hash the guy next to me at the communal had so I went with that and was not upset for long. The flavor of meat was outrageous and the portion was really good. We were very full but they also offered us the Tapioca Rice Pudding on the house for our inconvenience that also was very good. Even with the blunder and the uncomfortable heat of the room, this place was outstanding and would definitely visit again.",Bunker
145,"Rude and unwelcoming host and waiter. The menu is limited, doesn't have any vegan options. They refused to adjust any meals for vegan diet. Overpriced.","Just ate here with friends. The food was tasty, despite being over priced and having egg shell in the Eggs Florentine. Our waiter was the real downside of the experience. He was rude when asked questions about ingredients, but the most concerning part was when he delivered our buttermilk biscuits at the end of the meal. We had ordered them to go with our meal but had long since finished and he promised to take it off the bill. When another waiter delivered them, we were surprised, but reached for them anyway only for him to snatch them up and put them on another table. This is crazy unsanitary and made us very uncomfortable. You can't take unattended food from one table and put it on another! Gross! Won't be coming back here.","My wife and I stopped in here after we walked the Brooklyn bridge, and had a few drinks and snacks. It's mostly a place that would probably require a reservation at peak times, but they have a bar and common table in the bar area that's first come, first serve. The drinks were reasonably priced for NYC and the Mac and cheese is to die for. Then we just got some fries, but ultimately a cool spot to swing through if you need a destination after the bridge.","Delicious drinks, cute ambiance, and pretty good food. I highly recommend giving the tea and kalamansi cocktail a try.For food, I enjoyed the mussel appetizer and duck breast entree. Dipping the complimentary toasted and garlicky bread into the mussel's butter sauce was divine. The duck breast entree was very tender and flavorful.","The staff acted like we were lucky to be able to ""get in"" for Sunday brunch. Red Flag 1. They weren't even busy. The cocktails were decent but not worth $17! I had the bloody mary and my friend had a mimosa. The food was terrible. The avocado toast was cold as was the poached egg on top. My friend had the eggs Florentine and didn't like it at all. The portions were very small.We left spending $70 plus tip for the least-satisfying brunch ever.","Party of 4 was in and out in 45 min thanks to the server that couldn't wait to go home. We were rushed out of the restaurant in a pressing bordering with aggressive manner. Another round of drinks wasn't offered, neither was the dessert. We were not the last nor second to last table there. Ordered housemade bread was ice-cold in the center, the second one was charred and greasy -drizzled in butter. Cheese board was thrown on the table with no explanation. We were enjoying 5 mysterious cheeses. It was our second time there - we brought our traveling from the West Coast friends. Left feeling ashamed for the server's behavior. Not coming back.",Atrium Dumbo
146,"I have contemplated over and over again whether or not to post this review and probably will get backlash for it but here it goes.On Sunday my S.O and I entered into David's Brisket house. There were four young men working behind the counter. Two of them were playfully arguing but while arguing they were using profanity and racial slurs toward one another in a joking manner. They were so engulfed in their conversation, they did not notice we entered. Once my S.O and I got to the counter, we literally had to wait for them to finish their banter before we could order. The young man, stated ""That's my brother and we were just kidding around"". There was no apology for using the word ""Nigger"" or for using profanity nor for making use wait until they finish playing around. In my opinion this is not professional and I would not accept this behavior from any establishment I spend money at regardless of the neighborhood. The use of racial slurs made me feel uncomfortable and made me personally feel like I do not want to spend my money in this establishment anymore. The food here is good but I do not think I will be back. You can decide on your own whether or not you want to continue to spend money there but I will not.",I stopped by this place to avoid a snowstorm and was excited about the yelp ratings.  Honestly I don't know what the hype was about.  I got the large brisket. It was just ok. Lots of meat. I didnt like the gravy because it was both too sweet and salty.  The meat itself was good but not great. The service is a walk up counter but when I walked up I was ignored like they didnt even know i was there. Lastly the price was too much for an average sandwich. It had a lot of meat but it was over $18 for just the sandwich...no sides...no drink.Will not likely be back,"Pastrami to die for. Perfection. A New York gem, must eat! Or hey get one to go for the plane like I did","I've been coming to David's Brisket House for a long time. The quality has remained the same throughout.Today I had my go-to:  a combination Pastrami and Brisket with Russian dressing on club with brisket au jus on the side.I always eat the sandwich the same way:Open the bread and eat the pastrami slices by hand.  The deep, deep smokiness is richer and deeper than Katz's.  But it's sliced on a machine so it doesn't have the texture of the hand-cut Katz's pastrami.  It's also leaner than Katz's - though it still has enough marbling be nice and moist.After finishing the pastrami, I close the sandwich and get ready for some dipping!  I usually dip into the cup, but my wife likes to pour the au jus onto the plate and mop it up ""Sunday Sauce-style""!The pickles are awesome, we usually get their pink lemonade and over the years we've sampled dessert, with the carrot cake being a standout.Also on occasion we've had breakfast and David's may have the best selection of hashes in the City:  Pastrami, Corned Beef, Brisket or Salmon.  I've had both the pastrami and brisket hashes (of course!) and they are both outstanding.One final note:  I love Katz's and think their Pastrami is more to my liking, as it's hand cut and I can ask the counterman for a nice and juicy cut.  But a visit to Katz's is a major commitment - in time (always a line with tourists now who don't know quite how to order), in stomach (it's a lot of meat!) and price. David's Brisket House has everything I'd love Katz to have: comparable quality, easy accessibility - you can always walk right in, order and get a seat and the sandwiches come in small, medium and large sizes.","I haven't tried the infamous katz's delicatessen in nyc yet, but I heard from few of my friends that this place is just as good so I decided to give it a try. My boyfriend and I shared pastrami and brisket combo ($17), a large size sandwich that comes with few pickles. The portion was just right, but definitely could have gotten one more sandwich in small or regular size if we wanted to. The meat was delicious and melted in our mouth. I think it's reasonably priced for the quality of the sandwich. It's a small deli with 4-5 tables so the atmosphere is more low-key but intimate. I would definitely come here again for their pastrami sandwich!","I have been craving fresh corned beef for two weeks and this place hit the spot. It is a little hole in the wall but it gets the job done. My S.O had the brisket and pastrami and it was tasty, without any condiments. The meat is flavorful and a great portion. This is my second time eating here and I will definitely return in the future",David's Brisket House and Deli
147,"- Mostly delicious food- Inappropriate, unprofessional, and discriminatory staffMy partner and I dined here recently. The food was delicious and our dining experience was going well until the Shio Saba was served. The smell of the fish was pungent and nauseating, and the fish itself was leathery all the way through. We didn't feel comfortable eating it because we were worried it was bad and we were concerned about getting sick. Regardless, we were willing to stay and try other options. After speaking to our server, he kindly removed the dish and went to speak to the chef. When he came back to our table, he informed us that the chef no longer wanted to serve us. My partner and I paid out without objection, and even tipped our server 20% for his brief service. On my way out, I stopped by the food window out of respect to apologize to the chef. As a server, I understand how frustrating the business can be, especially when it's a small, locally-owned establishment, with a hands-on chef showcasing his craft. He immediately began yelling at me through the window in front of everyone dining in, and told me to never come back. He proceeded to raise his voice even further, and insinuate that my partner doesn't deserve to call himself Japanese (he's Japanese). His anger was explosive and volatile; clearly lacking in self-control. I cannot begin to imagine what it's like working for such a miserable, poor excuse of a man as a server--or what really goes on behind the scenes of that restaurant--if my experience as a customer was this terrible. As promised, I will never come back; but do everyone else around you a favor: Quit your job. You are clearly very unhappy there.",Rude staff and veeeeerrrryy looooong waiiiiiiiit tiiiiimmmes,"No phone number. Walked 30 mins to dine here. Arrived at 9:30, they're suppose to close at 10:30. The restaurant was full. They told me they were closed. No explanation given, just closed.No A/C","My first visit was for my business with them. We, 4 men had tasted almost all menus, and were awestruck. It was a month ago. Now I came back with my wife, who is very picky for any type of cuisine. I and she experienced the excellent food. Eating one and expecting another was pure joy. My favorite was Vegetable Agedashi. It produces so called 'Umami' in its genuine way. You must try Karaage(Japanese style fried chicken) too. My Japanese colleagues found it superb even by their higher standards. Go check this hidden pearl. It deserves more delightful eaters.","750 Myrtle Diner is truly unique. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but you walk in and the decor is amazing, the kitchen basically takes up half the restaurant up against the wall, leaving only room for a handful of tables. Oh, it's most definitely not a diner, so don't get confused by the name. It's a Japanese bistro, with some other Asian influences.The chicken karaage was basically perfect. Giant chunks of perfectly fried chicken. The lettuce wrap with crab was weird. I expected a... lettuce wrap, but it was more akin to a sushi roll with lettuce inside. It was good though, and the portion size was nuts.For our mains, we got the duck soba and the duck with mushrooms and lotus root. The duck dish was really good. Lots of flavors intermingling together.They also have a bunch of Japanese beers and sake on their menu, including sparkling sake!Definitely recommend stopping by.","Came here for a 1 on 1 date with my S.O. According to the waiter, their menu changes everyday. It's a nice little place with shared plates. For 2 of us, we ordered like 4 plates to share, which was a decent amount of food for me to be satisfied but not too full. Original fried chicken- yummm. I absolutely love fried chicken and this does not disappoint. Crispy outside, moist inside. It's flavorful. It also comes with a side of citrus dipping sauce and that complimented the chicken very well.Chicken gizzards- i also love gizzards. I love the crunchy texture and this place makes it pretty well. I really enjoyed dipping it in the citrus sauce (part of fried chicken order). I don't know if they will give u the citrus sauce if u just ordered the gizzards. Keep in mind, my plate of gizzards wasn't 100% gizzard. They mixed it with chicken heart and some other unrecognizable parts as well.Tuna tartar- this had an interesting flavor which I can't say I loved, but it was decent. It's basically a paste, or pate, and u put it on a toast and eat it. Can taste the hint of Wasabi, the raw eggs. Texture had some getting used to.Chicken liver in butter- this was a mixed bag for me. I can't deny, the butter garlic parsley sauce was delicious. Everything I love. The liver itself takes Alot of getting used to. For those of u who have not tried liver before, it is VERY gamey, and has a very strong distinct after taste. I hated it when I was a kid....thought I got used to it as an adult already but apparently not. My first piece was not too bad. I actually kinda enjoyed it. But I think I ate my second piece too fast. The overwhelming after taste made me want to throw up. Luckily I didn't. I rested my stomach a couple minutes and drank some soju to mask the after taste. I was able to eat 1 more small piece afterwards but my fiance had to finish everything lol.Overall, this is a nice little place with some interesting dishes. I would come back again if I was around the area.",750 Myrtle Diner

I went for brunch for my birthday and we had a lot of fun. They have bottomless mimosas! The one thing I didn't like was that for the outside they only had one fan which broke while we were there. Not great for a hot summer day but once we were drunk we forgot about the heat.,Came here for brunch. The food and service was AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG. The French toast was to die for. Would definitely come again. S/o to the chef man. I've never been to a place where I enjoyed every thing from the decor to the staff to the drinks to the food. If I could give this hidden gem 15 stars I would!,"I wish I took pictures of the food, but it was too good! We had crab cakes, turkey burgers and fried cheesecake. I would highly recommend the blue cheese infused turkey burger. It's late August and it's a little hot, and there is only one server running the bar and food. He is really accommodating however and aside from waiting a little the experience was great!","Iight so boom. *Sigh* I was really disappointed in this place. I must say the reviews were more in favor of the boozy drinks rather than the food but my goodness.It's the type of establishment where everyone has to be present in order to be seated. Cool. Our waitress was fine. Literally fine nothing exceptional but nothing subpar. We had the bottomless Bellinis and I will say the champagne was potent. Redeeming quality. As it was only two of us she did her best to refill our drinks in a timely manner and at the end, she sat down a carafe of bellinis for us to finish. That's a star in itself. Food.....lawd! I ordered the catfish and instead of home fries asked for grits. My homegirl had the omelette with home fries and my other homegirl had the burger. The omelette with home fries, again, was fine. The burger she said was dry. My catfish? NO SEASONING. Like the catfish itself wasn't seasoned and neither was the exterior crust. Like what?! I literally had to spread the remolaude sauce all over to get the slightest bit of flavor. SMH. The grits and side salad....fine. But that catfish was a HUGE disappointment. Idk if the chef was lacking that day or if that's the norm but per my review and my homegirls.....would not recommend any of these items.So all in all.....if you're trying to get drunk and don't mind subpar food then here's your place. However if you want to enjoy a quality meal with your boozy cocktails then you most certainly can find other places.P.S.--The music was good. It's not one of those day party brunch spots where the music is too loud and everyone's singing at the top of their lungs and you can't eat your eggs without somebody rump shaking into the back of your chair. So good for that. Also, the outdoor seating is VERY cute.","Cold Food...Saturday, September 7, 2019 2pm: friends were in town to celebrate turning 50.  After an intense searched for a brunch venue and after the process of elimination, everyone agreed with the Rustik Tavern.  Party of 5 arrived at 2pm, placed our orders and here is where the problems started.45 minutes later, no food.  When the food arrived, everything was cold.  omelets, burgers, fries, home fries, all cold.  We complained to the waitress and she apologized, that was it.  This was the first time for everyone and the last for everyone.",Rustik Tavern
149,"This is the spicy Thai food, not the typical pad Thai or drunken noodle type of Thai food. The restaurant focuses on Northern Thai food. We ordered:- Mushroom pineapple curry - Mixed seafood We were both crying while eating but it was so tasty!","We don't know if it was the freezing situation at the tables near the door or the spiciness of the dishes but we were quite disappointed with our dinner here.After reading so many positive reviews, we've decided it's about time to trek to 4th street on a cold winter night to try Ugly Baby. Compared to our first attempt, this time it didn't take us long to be seated, but near the door.We found the tables so close to each other that private/intimate conversation is not expected here. Our waiter however was genuinely helpful and she discussed with us the spicy levels of each of the dishes.We started with a bottle of IPA beer and ordered the fried sea bream, pigs tongue and pork belly with shrimp paste, it was served in timely fashion although it gotten really cold as soon as they put it on our table. In fact it was so cold we could not even remove our jackets and beanies because of the temperature, my lower body was freezing, it was that bad! I hope that the management would read this and do something with the door situation specially in winter time, as I said we didn't enjoy our dinner this time but will keep an open mind to come back in warmer weather.","All Hype! Bon Appetite wrote an article about this place and got a ton of hype on this little hole in the wall Thai place. As a true foodie, I will speak from experience. The food is SO spicy that you will not even taste a thing. At the point of extreme, your mouth is numbed and food is not enjoyable. At all. I don't even want to mention any food items separately as I usually do in a Yelp review because I lost all interest in the food after my second dish came out and was UNBEARABLY spicy. I asked kindly the waiter if the spiciness can be toned down, he said without hesitation, a firm ""No"". I hated my experience so much that I will not be wasting my time explaining each dish. I will not be returning, ever. Food was not that good, and the spiciness was way too overpowering.","Ugly Baby is, without a doubt, the best Thai restaurant I've yet experienced in this city--or really, anywhere. I'm no expert, but to the best degree I can tell, it's got ""real"" authentic Thai food. No pad thais or standard green/red curries here; instead, you'll find an incredible array of new and exciting dishes, ALL of which look equally appealing.We went with the Khao Sui Nuer and Shrimp, Squid, and Egg Yolk, which was plenty for the two of us. The Khao Sui Nuer comes with a fiery curry sauce on the side that you can titrate in to your liking, but be careful--it's really, really good *and* really, really potent. The shrimp and squid dish is a little milder, but equally fantastic. It's not as spicy, but very flavorful with coconut- and tamarind-ish notes. I'd highly recommend both.If anything, our only regret here was not having a larger group to share (and try) more dishes. That being said, it's a small-ish space, so I wouldn't plan for more than 4, maybe max. 6.A few other notes. First, the staff here are excellent. There's a lot to work with on the menu, and they were great with helping us find something well suited to our preferences. Second, the place is simple and has a sort of hole-in-the-wall charm, but the quirky, rainbow decor adds to the fun of the whole experience. And finally, this is one of the best ""value-for-quality"" deals in the city. Most entrees are in the $15-20 range, with generous, very much splittable portions.In short: Ugly Baby is freaking great. Go ASAP.","I've seen a lot of ugly babies in my time (some on Yelp), but this Ugly Baby bites back. If you're into authentic Thai food with a giant spicy kick, then you've come to the right place.The Khao Soi Nuer (northern egg noodle soup) WILL make you sweat. But that's good. Get all those toxins out. Don't worry, the staff will keep your ice water cup filled. And provide you with more cutesy napkins to dab your forehead.Portion sizes are also pretty big, so just when you think you can make it through without burning a hole in your stomach, you find a whole 'nother hunk of beef and even more noodles. Yowza.Their beer list is also surprisingly good. A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one!",My favorite Thai place in all of New York! Any time I'm in the area I stop by. I'm seriously hooked! They have some things on the menu that are SPICY which is always a fun challenge and some dishes that are mild to give your stomach a break.My go tos:Kao Tod Nam KlookKang HohMood Pad KapiKhao Soi NuerBut honestly everything is good!!

150,"Amazing New Orleans gumbo and po'boy joint right in the heart of Brooklyn. If you're looking for a taste of NOLA in New York, this is the place to go. It's a tiny shop, probably seats about 20 or so people. You order at the counter and the cashier will bring over the food when it's ready. We got the classic fried shrimp po'boy, the catfish po'boy, seafood gumbo, and chicken and sausage gumbo. No complaints, just happy tongues and tums. My only regret was not having the stomach space for beignets. One downside is there's no AC or fans. A bit toasty for dining in on a hot summer day, but bearable enough.","We've ordered  po boys from here many times even though we thought it was an over priced sandwiches we still went back. Today we were given a little extra with our sandwich, specifically a strand of hair 3 inches long in the batter of the chicken sandwich. It was enough to make my stomach churn. I mean how does this happen? Aren't you supposed to wear hair nets or something? When I called to let them know they said they would refund us (not really sure if they will since they didn't seem to know who we were) or it would take over an hour to get another sandwich. No thanks, we won't bother ordering here ever again.",Such an authentic experience felt as if I was in Nola again. I had the Spicy Honey Chicken Po-Boy.,"I saw a review on YouTube before going to NYC and I just had to put this place on my list.Being from Brazil, I love spicy food and I have to say that New Orleans is one of my favorite places in the world. When I leaned that Gumbo Brothers had the most authentic creole food outside of Louisiana I had to try it.My best friend and I went on a quiet Wednesday afternoon. The place is small but because it was about 3 pm on a week day, we found plenty of seating and didn't have to wait at all. We had the traditional Gumbo with 1/2 a PoBoy sandwich eqch and it was enough for us! It is prepared hot. REALLY HOT! borderline what I could eat. May not be suitable for people who are not used to hot sauce. I'm not sure if they can make it less spicy on demand, but it's worth asking. The guy who took our orders was extremely nice and very professional and recommended some less known beers. For desert I couldn't help not getting a pecan pie - delicious!!! I would give this place a 5 star review and if I lived in NY I would probably go there at least once a week. Highly recommend!!","Catfish PoBoy that was good enough to want to make you smack (you fill in The Who). Foodie haven.Catfish PoBoy was Crispy on the outside and flaky inside.

I was SO excited to visit the Gumbo Bros' new brick & mortar location, and it does not disappoint!  The place is cosy, with a brick wall on one side, complete with pics and descriptions of their 2 featured foods: Gumbo (""a big bowl of southern comfort"") and Po'Boys (""the best sandwich you'll ever scarf"").  There are 3 tables (2 tall, for standing/stools; and one short, with regular chairs) lining a red wall on the left side. You order and pay up front at the back, with a peek-view of the kitchen (where they work their magic!). If you're lucky enough to meet the owners, they are so so nice too, and very open and friendly!(I'm also hoping for a return of the Rabbit Stew they featured once during their days at Urban Bites!)

Someone even walked out while we waited on a ride home around 12:50a (yes I took accurate accounts of the times) and Someone from the inside came to lock the door behind them but continued to ignore us in the cold. Do not come here if you want decent service.Smh.. do better black businesses.,"The rum punch is awesome but after an hour, we HAD NOT recieved our shrimp order. Unacceptable and very disappointing",I was celebrating a book release with one of my best friends and this location was nearby. It was pretty empty when we got there but for some reason we had to engage in a 2-minute long staring match with the waiters before they finally decided to greet and seat us. This was very strange considering that we were the only people there and I was in a party of 4.We were finally seated and our waitress came by to take our orders. Her attitude seemed a bit sassy and I'm not exactly sure why. By the end of our evening she became nastier; I have no idea why or what may have triggered her. There was a guy having a conversation in the back of the restaurant who we later found out was an employee there. In the middle of winter he decided to open the back door and leave it open; please do keep in mind that we already ordered our food and it was on the verge of getting cold. We asked our waitress if it's possible she can close the door and she literally walked off and didn't say anything. She was so rude; it's unfortunate I didn't get her name.I ordered the fried shrimp which only came with 6 pieces and no sides. The shrimp was overly fried and a bit chewy.It's very unfortunate to say but I will not be coming back here; the rude waitress and the employee who insisted on leaving the door open when there's a table of people within walking distance is so inconsiderate.,"This spot is the BOMB! It's small, the music is BOMB the drinks are strong and again the music is BOMBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB!!! My review is short because it's not much to say other than come. I'm here on a Thursday night and YO!!!!","Very unassuming place on the ground floor of a three story brownstone. At 6.00pm a Saturday night, there was one bartender/server and she was friendly and attentive. Also note, they have happy hour specials 7 days a week.The place is really dimly lit and the vibe is chill. While I was with a couple of friends, most other patrons (about 4 couples) seemed to be on dates. There was a deejay playing music, but I like that the volume was just right so you could hear conversation with friends/dates easily.I see rave reviews about the sweet chile wings, but to me, they were nothing to write home about. The wings were very hard (hard - not crispy) and lacking any hint of freshness.","Visiting Brooklyn this past weekend and my friend suggested we go here and I was pleased with his choice. On a Saturday night it wasn't too packed. We mostly just wanted to do drinks and get something small to eat. I opted for the beef sliders and they were so filling and delicious - hands down, one of the best I've ever had (like in life). The fries were good as well. They had some specials that night so I tried the rum punch and being that I'm Caribbean, I'm a bit biased when it comes to rum punch - it was actually pretty good and had some ""punch"" to it! I would come back here again. I like chill spots with nice mellow vibes : )",Tree House
152,Imagine that with every bite of a dish a different thought comes up... who mama made this... who do they have cooking back there because damn...oh my god... you get the idea. Well it's hard to tell which dish you would say that about here. They are all incredible.  But if I only could pick one... mac and cheese. Drops mike.,literally the worst place on earth. food is insanely overpriced for the portions. gorg inside and out but our apts back up to the business and the music is blasting all the time!!! It's one thing to have music it's another to keep it blasting after during and after hours. Not cool. It's NYC but weekdays keep that shit down. Not ok and rude to the neighborhoods. My friends baby keeps waking up nightly because of this noise and my dog is going nuts. JUST STOP,"Nice looking spot but the service leaves a lot to be desired.When I walked in there were two women at the counters (one on either side). Neither of them greeted me with a hello. I proceeded to look at the menu to figure out what I wanted and the woman at the main counter slapped a menu in front of me without uttering a word.Then, after I had gotten my food to go, I realized she hadn't put any napkins or utensils in my bag. I asked her for a fork and was told that they had run out of plastic forks and that I needed to go over to camille's (a few stores over) to get one of their forks?!?Now the only reason this isn't a 2 star is because the food was really good. I ordered the mac and cheese and the 1/4 chicken. When I was in the car the chef walked out and was very friendly but the owner of this establishment needs to reconsider who he/she has as the face of his business. It's so sad that people look so hard for a job and then when they get hired act as if they don't want to work.","My only complaint about Risbo is that it opens at 5pm but I want to be there 24/7 lol. I love everything about this place because it is a vibe. They have delicious, healthy, and decently priced food, the cocktails are always well crafted, and the good energy is palpable. You walk by it on Flatbush and you can't help but to be curious about seeing all the grooving and chewing faces. That's how I found it when it opened and I just never left. I love sitting at the bar in the winter and taking in the 90s R&B jams or chilling in the backyard during the summer or getting hype in the backyard while listening to the live DJ. This place has never disappointed me and I am so glad to have it in the neighborhood.Stop in for the food & drinks but stay for the vibes.","I've passed this place many times but it today was the first time I've stepped inside and I have to thank my sister friend for suggesting it. It's a beautiful space, I LOVE all the greenery and the simple menu. I ordered the Healthy Bowl and it was more than enough for one (I ate half and took the rest home). For desert I ordered the pear cheese cake with a scoop of the vegan coffee ice cream . Everything hit my tastebuds just right! The flavors were perfect. The staff...friendly. Boris, the owner, was very attentive and has created a very welcoming space for everyone in an area where the gentrification is oh so real. Ohhhhh and there's a live DJ . I'll be back .","Wow.This place is absolutely fabulous. The reason it claims the coveted 5 stars is the atmosphere, the food and the drinks being ON point. My friend and I ordered from here but decided to eat in at the end. The food was so tasty. I salivated just looking at the Mac and cheese. The kale salad was also one of the best in town. I'm not even a huge fan of kale so that's saying something. Ok, don't even get me started on the dessert. It was soooo smooth. We tried the apple crumble. The ice cream looked amazing but our stomachs were too stuffed for both.Yes, they are open late. They take they're last food orders at 11:30pm.They're drinks start at $10 and are the cocktail you pay for. Not sure if they have a happy hour but happy to come back if they do for that. Would recommend the mezcal based drink. It was Smokey enough without too much sugar to mask flavor. I was very impressed. Overall 5/5 stars! Can't wait to try this place again!!",Risbo
153,"Don't let pictures they have fool you. The food was so bad that I was shocked that this place is so popular. New Yorkers really can eat anything! The soup dumplings were sticked to the plate, so when we tried to grab it, all juice was gone. Moreover, the meat filling tasted like some cheap can food. Fried chicken we got was over salted and was definitely a leftover from yesterday that was heated up in a microwave.  Other wishes we got were not as terrible but it definitely wasn't delicious. Result- we spent about $100 and left hungry.","Just dropping by to drop a 2 star rating. To give a TLDR, our server at the bar always seemed preoccupied. It is impossible to get his attention even when we were literally right in front of him. When we asked him for a cup of water, I kid you not... it was like his mind went somewhere else while he washes his protein shake bottles.","Went here today for the first time. Wow, service was extremely poor. We ordered a few tiny dishes and ordered drinks. Drinks never came and neither did the server. I mean like ever.  As we sat there with empty bowls  for about 20 mins without the drinks or the server in sight, we finally waved  a server over and asked what happened to the drinks. The place was almost empty. There was really no reason for their inattentive behavior. No apology. In fact, it almost seemed as if they didn't care. I left hungry and upset. Won't be back.","Sichuan food is one of the pillars holding up my food pyramid.  We live in Fort Greene and had found a solid place, but it really was only satiating, we never walked out of there swooning over the foods we'd just eaten.  We were swooning over the dishes at Birds of a Feather.It was only my wife and I there, so we couldn't do much more than 2 dishes and an appetizer - but BoaF went 3 for 3.  Their MaPo tofu was one of the better versions I've ever had - they nailed all the expected bold flavors and did enough ""little things"" right to make it stick out as something special.  The Chungking spicy chicken (seen it called Chong Qing elsewhere) was a really solid rendition, if unmemorable, but I'd order it again.  The sichuan pickled vegetables were really good, perfect heat, great flavor, nicely complimented the other two dishes.We will definitely be back, and plan on making BoaF our default Brooklyn sichuan place.","Came here last Friday.  Initially made a reservation for 4 at 6pm.  We ended up being 5 and the restaurant gladly gave us an additional seat.  The restaurant is adorable inside.  The staff are very attentive.We ordered the following to share:-  Thousand year old eggs w/ tofu:  This was delicious.  The tofu had great texture and paired really well with the thousand year old egg. -  Mung bean noodles:  This was ok.  It was tart.  Pass on this.-  Husband and wife special:  The tripe was very good.  Very thinly sliced and flavorful.  -  Poached wontons:  I enjoyed these.  The wontons were decently sized and went nicely with the chili oil, not very spicy-  Mapo tofu:  This had some nice flavor as well, eat this with rice!-  Curious chicken:  Pass.  The wintermelon was good, but the chicken wasn't great-  Order the purple rice!!!","Serious hidden gem! We were party of four and in search of some food with heat (in summer) and tried a couple of dishes and told our server to make it xtra spicy. The dishes are explosion of flavors and we couldn't stop eating. Plus, cool vibe, friendly staff and wallet will thank you.",Birds of a Feather
154,"Went for Good Beer Passport DinnerFood - 2/5. The poblanos were really overpowering on the burger. Despite being roasted pretty well, the large slices of poblanos with their stringy texture did not fit well when eating a sandwich. Since you're cutting with your teeth, it wasn't a good texture especially when you have everything else to chew at the same time. Beef patty itself was pretty average and the two8two sauce was barely noticeable. There was a reason they served the burger with ketchup on the side.Service - 4/5. Friendly and courteous.Value - 2/5. Their namesake two8two burger runs at $10.50. It sounded good on paper, but the actual burger itself wasn't good to eat. Despite the price point, it doesn't come with any sides at all either. I definitely expected more.Parking - Street (Free)","Delivery was a complete nightmare Ordered a burger at 7:52pm, didn't receive until 10:33Yes, you've read that correctly. I was a hangry bitch. Called and the manager made excuses, took no responsibility and directed me to call caviar. Never ordering from here again.",I've only had the Greek fries from here and I've returned many times to order them again.,"Located at '282' Atlantic Avenue (somebody is a clever wordsmith), Two 8 Two Bar & Burger serves up high quality burgers and a solid selection of draft beer in a family-friendly neighborhood style pub.  Service is incredibly attentive, warm, AND down-to-earth - which makes this spot deserving of repeat business.The menu is pretty straight forward.  Order your choice of burger and a side, a drink or two, and sit back and relax.  We thought it was pretty cool that they offer a dedicated hot dog menu (classic, garden, bacon cheddar, chili cheddar, and two8two dog).  But, we chickened out and went with two Pub Burgers and a side of fries.  The patties were tasty, well-seasoned, and cooked to perfection!  Our only gripe was the two8two sauce.  There was simply too much of it and the flavor overpowered the dish.  It was good, but balance would have been appreciated.Also, this place offers outdoor seating in the back.  You should definitely take advantage of this while you still can!",I wasn't blown away. Burgees spots are so competitive in Brooklyn that every burger spot you try it's always expected to be better than the last. I had the veggie burgers with grilled onions and onion rings . The onion rings were very good. My burger was just ok. I know it's veggie but that doesn't mean bland and tasteless. I felt like it was missing something. I also thought they were pricey as well. $70 for 3 burgers and a kids meal with chicken tenders. I'll have the onion rings again for sure but I'll pass on the burger.,"My thought process with burgers always begins with the question:  Is it better than Shake Shack?  I can confidently say Two 8 Two passes that test and earns the 4-star rating for taste.Burgers are flavorful, cooked correctly, and have a good meat-to-bun ratio. Prices are right and service is friendly and efficient, and ambience is cozy and not too loud, and there's a nice little garden seating area out back . Great place to catch up with a friend or watch a game; great rotating beer selection.",Two 8 Two Bar & Burger
155,Five star soup. Got their Lagman soup in the middle of the summer and can't wait to get it again in the winter. Fire,"I was with my husband first time in this place on last Sunday. Manti dough was thick.In Braised meat  much onions and peppers than meat, and price $10.99 doesn't match for this dish , expensive. The plates didn't change when bring other dish.I'm not recommended to my friends.","Surprisingly good. We came here on a whim and took a chance on an empty restaurant. The workers/owners? were really friendly and food was really good. I don't think I'd travel all the down there just for it, but if I was in the area, I'd stop by again.","Restaurant serving dungan cuisine. Based on the menu items, there are influences from Uzbek, Chinese, and Russian cuisines. After reading a few exerts from Wikipedia, it seems like most dungan people currently reside in Kazakhstan or Kyrgyzstan and are decedents from the Hui from China. Interestingly, it seems like the language originated from Chinese roots but is written is Cyrillic. There also sounds to be Islamic religious influences. The bottom line is that there are a lot of influences to the cuisine.We started off with some Greek salad. Simple flavors and fresh ingredients resulted in a delicious salad. They had small blocks of feta which preserves the slightly poignant flavor on the instead rather than the shredded feta which becomes subdued after mixing with the salad dressing. Next we shared beef and onion manti. These were some of the best manti I've had. I'd highly recommend them. They were freshly made and had no noticeable butter. All the savoriness came from the meat and onions. We also shared the cold noddles plate. Great thick noddles. Similar to udon noddles. They were served with a bunch of veggies in a plate filled with rice vinegar. It was a very interesting dish.","Excellent noodle texture and broth flavor. Beef is a bit tough (though that might just be the style), and the noodles didn't quite have the depth of flavor I've had in lagman elsewhere. That said, the noodles' texture is pretty standout and the aggregate flavor from seasoning etc is really good. I've had my share of lagman in other cities (ie Chicago and Toronto)---I actually came here specifically because I searched for lagman---and this is definitely a very solid entry in the genre.They also have besh barmak here---if I'm ever in the area I might come back to try that, since it's really hard to find on restaurant menus.","Learn the historical and cultural backdrop of Dungan cuisine from fellow Yelpers Kathleen S, Natasha G, and Lindsay F. They really hit it out of the park. Otherwise... my, was Lagman House a welcome surprise. The meat and carb focused cuisine is very much light for what it is but it's also complex with depth thanks to the spices and herbs. Deceptively simple visually, their food slowly reveals all it has to offer the more you eat. Then another layer is added as, like Yelper Lawrence C noted, flavors from other cuisines come to mind as you chew, sometimes more than one at once. An amalgamation of flavors, dishes, cuisines and potentially memories. The iconic Anton Ego moment from Ratatouillie does happen in real life! This was my experience:- Their LAMIAN flavor reminded me of a light Filipino kaldereta with also a hint of spaghetti. Except their gravy-like sauce is on the soupy side which still somehow clung to their dense chewy noodles. There's a nice bite to the dish.- Their LAMB STEW smelled like mashed potatoes, making you think of sour cream thanks to the scallion and dill and even shepherd's pie thanks in part to the combination of ingredients. The lamb shank was only very slighty gamey and very tender. A very aromatic dish that reveals itself slowly the more you waft down. Light but still rich and hearty and very wholesome. This isn't to discredit what they do or the Dungan cuisine itself as it's definitely its own thing. While the cuisine is an extreme rarity here and unfamiliar to nearly all, including myself, it's to their benefit their food will still taste familiar. Come here to have an enjoyable out of body experience that feels like a paradox even though it's not. This may very well be the epitome of David Chang's unified theory of deliciousness. A very curious and immersive experience that gets you thinking. While portion sizes are small, you'll still leave satisfied simply wanting more to try and eat.  Went for dinner on a week day. A few tables were filled. Very quiet and not busy. It's on days like these when the owners' son and manager will talk to you if you're open to it. Very nice!4.5 stars.",Lagman House
156,Everything I said before but more amazing!No seriously... from the never never to the last word! Amazeballs!!,"This place is a great cocktail spot. It's unfortunate that it's okay for their staff to undermine women....I took my team to blueprint after a corporate event. A male employee of mine tried to personally pay for a round of drinks and I interjected with the company card. The (I believe) Aussie male bartender thought I was a friend/date when I tried to pay for the bill and refused my card. I tried to explain the situation... He turned to the guy and asked him if he was ok with me paying! I had to argue with him for a good 3 minutes before he accepted my card. Once he finally agreed to re-run the cards, rather than apologize for the confusion, he had the audacity to ask why I had an attitude and  turned to my employee and said ""good luck""! (Still assuming I was a date I presume).He later stated that he was offended when I called out his actions as sexist....Maybe I'm mistaken, but I have not witnessed any man facing these same obstacles when trying to pick up the tab for his team (or even on while trying to pay for a date) #no #equalpayequaltreatment #idontwanttobepaidfor #ijustwantrespect #RBG","Probably the worst cocktails I have tried. We were here celebrating a friend's birthday. Our waiter told us that none of the cocktails, except for one, were that sweet but he was wrong. Every one we tried was cloyingly sweet with no depth of flavor. For a cocktail bar, I expected the mixers to be hand squeezed and of excellent quality, but all I tasted was Tropicana grapefruit juice and mezcal. Nothing worth $13.  By the middle of the night, our group was drinking wine because the cocktails were so bad.","Hung out in Blueprint while waiting for a dinner reservation in the neighborhood. Very very cute antique-feel cocktail bar. Drinks were quality and staff was friendly. I didn't have any of the bites but I would definitely go back to sample the menu - there were even a good amount of vegan options. Loved the vibe, I am glad I stumbled upon this place!","With dim lighting, tapas to share, and bomb cocktails, Blueprint is perfect for date night. The moment we entered, all we saw were couples, so beware if you are thinking of coming here with friends. They also have a cute patio in the back that can be used during the summers - check it out if you come here!The food wasn't mind-blowing, but the drinks were delicious. We got the bourbon based My Dear Julius and gin based Satan's Bell. My Dear Julius has egg white in it and therefore is a tad heavier. I expected Satan's Bell to be your classic gin and passion fruit juice flavored cocktail, but was pleasantly surprised by the red bell pepper juice that unfettered the drink! Satan's Bell was light, sweet and presented well. Kudos to the bartender, who invented it. The food. We came here for dinner, which was supposed to be the main event, but left enjoying the cocktails more. The baby octopus with potatoes was okay but had more potatoes than octopus and wasn't anything to write home about. The roasted Brussel sprouts were a bit disappointing as they completely lacked salt. We dipped the sprouts in the lemon juice of the octopus dish to give them a bit of a kick. As the final dish, we got the Blueprint duck club, which definitely was the largest plate of all. The club sandwich had thinly sliced tasty duck meat. It was the first time I had duck as deli meat. Definitely not your typical date food though. Your hands are a bit of a mess after holding a club sandwich that looks like could belong to a diner.","I've been writing this review for months... lol. I kept bypassing it but last night I stopped in for a drink and dessert and just had to share why I like this spot. Setting: after 7pm the mood to me says date night. The lighting is dim and the tables are set for intimate conversation or you can sit at the bar and flirt with the bartenders...lol.Drinks: the drink the night was called the Doctor is in...if you like a gin cocktail w/ a lil rum and a pretty flower this is the drink for you! My companion had wine, and enjoyed their pinot grigio.Dessert: the bread pudding...OMG! It's my favorite dessert and I like to try it at any new spot I go to. I'm floored there's a spot this close to me with bread pudding that's so good. Final thoughts: I'll be there tomorrow",Blueprint
157,"Cute mom and pop shop, definitely overinflated reviews Most certainly not the best dumplings. Food was okay. What we got: potstickers, pork dumplings, pork bun, ribs, lychee bubble teaWhat we liked: quick service, the one sided crisp on the dumplings/potstickers What we didn't like: the pork bun was difficult to eat...the bun is a fluffy flat, so imagine you forced to eat it like a tostada. Food is somewhat overpriced...ended up being a $50 bill for two people. Bottom line: not impressed at all, avg","I decided to try them out given the great reviews but was disappointed with the quality. To be fair, I ordered the Shanghai Belly noodles, so this review is just for that one dish.The noodles were too soggy/over-cooked and the sauce that was mixed in (if any) was very bland and tasteless. The pork belly was ok but they only had 3 pieces. For $14, I expected a few more pieces of pork belly and better quality.  I don't know if I'd go back again. The first experience was disappointing.",Well.  Mixed review of this place.  Ran out of Shrimp Dumplings at 5 pm when u got there.  They were very quick to take my take out order.  Very busy and Very tiny place.  They did not tell me how long it would be.  After 20 minutes I politely asked the very RUDE girl in charge how much longer it would be.  She was very annoyed and curt.  After 10 more minutes my order was ready.  I asked for another extra soy sauce and a hot sauce. They replied that there was plenty in the bag.  .....  Well there was only ONE of each.  We had a dozen dumplings . How cheap can you be?????  And now onto the Food. The veggie dumplings were barely cooked and dough was almost raw.  The pork dumplings were better.  The veggies and rice platter was not good. The vegetables were So hard and grossly uncooked.  Spring rolls were very ordinary and nothing special.  Won't be returning.,"I checked out East Wind today and am so happy that it exists!!!!! Very fun, cute vibe. All the food I tried was outstanding. I shared Juicy Pork Dumplings, Dry Aged Beef Potstickers, Sweet Chili Ribs and Rice with a friend.For dessert we shared a bubble waffle that was covered in powdered sugar and drank bubble tea. Both of us left very satisfied.The food is all made with quality ingredients.","Great new addition to Smith Street. All of the 4 types of dumplings are tasty! That said, I stick mostly to the dumplings (desserts supposed to be great but haven't tried) and the from-scratch bubble tea. The rice dishes are good but are mostly rice, which just isnt that satisfying. The double happiness is the best rice dish if you're going to get one. It's one of the better fried rices I've ever had and it's sprinkled with slices of chinese sausage and topped with pork belly. I plan to be back to try the remaining items!","I was super excited to stumble upon this after getting off the subway for Prospect Park.  I knew it had a pop up in a different location but had no idea it would be right next to the station I was at.  I got the Pork Belly Bun since people raved about that and also ordered the Juicy Pork Dumplings and Shanghai Vegetable Dumplings.  The pork belly was not kind of dry and for $5 it is overpriced.  Even the bun itself did not do me anything and I have had better.  The pork dumplings were ok, nothing special.  I did enjoy the vegetable dumplings, a lot of stuffing in it.  Overall this is an overpriced dumpling shop and there are way better places to get dumplings.",East Wind Snack Shop
158,"Ah; I only came here with my lover because of the good reviews but we were left disappointed. Idk what flavor ya tasted but we had to seasoned our bowls with the table seasoning. It was bland the broth, and um, the ramen doesn't come with much for the price that it is set on. No egg, no seaweed added unless requested and paid extra for. Um, they have NO corn which literally surprised me. I've gotten yummier bowls of ramen in St Marks or in Canal for 8-9 bucks with everything included, the yummy eggs, the seaweed, the corn, the bean sprouts. And the chopsticks, idk, i know they japanese chopsticks but they are not ideal for eating with ramen. Ramen just slips through. Shit was rough. I'm sorry. This was a disappointment.","Broth that reminds me of Totto and customization that reminds me of Ichiran.I was served a solid bowl of ramen. The creaminess of the broth is what lured me in. With their lunch special, I was able to add a topping and dumplings for a nominal fee but otherwise, the bowl needed more, maybe if it came with a soft boiled egg it would have felt complete. Another suggestion would be to find some fattier pork and to add some char to it.","I try 暖暮 in Okinawa Japan, 90% same taste as eaten in Japan. Service is good, I will come back.","BEST VEGAN RAMEN!Visiting from SLC, we have a favorite VRamen bowl there. But since trying Danbo's V classic, miso, shio , & negi-goma chashu-men, we've given them our new personal favorite title!Must try- 10/10","This small ramen spot reminds me of Ichiran, with all the ways to customize your ramen (but not as expensive!!)They have a few tables on the side with a larger bar area that can seat more people.They have different choices for broth, but I believe most of them are tonkatsu based.Then you choose your noodle and how soft/hard. And finally choose your toppings. The base price of the ramen is about $10-12. But they charge you for everything you wanna add, including things that are usually included like egg and nori.We opted for the shio (salt) broth, which was really good! I was hesitant to get it because I thought it would be too salty, but it was perfect. I got standard thickness of broth, but light richness (lard). My bf got the standard richness, and it was slightly a little more flavor, but I was still happy with mine and wouldn't have noticed unless I really compared the two. I didn't get extra meat, so it came with 2 pieces which was enough for me. We also added a soft boiled egg, which I highly recommend!!!I thought the ""thick"" noodles mean wavy/thick. But it's just a thicker version of the straight noodz. So next time I'm just gonna stick with the thinner version. Overall, it was a delicious bowl and we left happy and full! We also added the gyoza appetizer, which I thought was good but nothing special. Almost reminded me of the frozen ones from the grocery store that I love.","I was told by my Japan traveler friends that this is definitely one of the better ones in NYC. I've brought my friends here, my boyfriend, my mom, my cousin, just about all who I know loves a hot bowl of ramen on any type of day! After devouring all their broths and testing the different firmness of noodles, flavor of the broth, my favorite combination is the following:Thin firm noodlesStandard thickness of brothRich brothExtra spicy sauce Tonkutsu with extra pork and extra order of noodles on the side.I must have love their firm thin noodles so much that when I get extra, I mix it in their sesame oil and vinegar sauce and toss is up to eat it.",Ramen Danbo
159,"As a student, ordering takeout is considered a ""treat"" for me and I can't help but feel choosing Bedouin was such a waste of an indulgence.The meats both chicken and lamb were extremely tough. The texture of rubber, and chewing time of gum. Basically inedible and had to toss out.Definitely bypass this place. Tons of good eats a neighbourhood over.",Hidden gem. Cheap. Authentic. Make their own pita and it's the best I have ever had. WillCome again and again.,"I really like their falafel, and their pita is amazing, and they use excellent lettuce & tomatoes in their salad, but, honestly, their leg of lamb & also their chicken & also their baba ghanoush & also their hummus are disappointing. And since their prices have gone up a couple bucks in the past couple of years (AND IT'S CASH ONLY), overall, I really find it both undesirable and inconvenient, sad to say...","I rarely give out 5 stars, but this place absolutely earned it. I've been looking for cheap eats in Brooklyn and so far this place was high on value and quantity!I got the falafel plate which came with a salad and a side. I got the babaganoush for my side, which came with pita. Everything in the salad was super fresh and the pita came right off the grill. I ended up only eating half cause I was so full, but $15 for dinner and lunch the next day is a good good deal. Definitely a winner! Bring a friend and eat outside on their cute little patio!","All cash only. The food was good but less flavorful than expected. - lambjin: okay, looked better than it tasted, was much tangier than expected.- merguez plate: merguez was pretty oily as I suppose all lamb is but I had expected some oil would have dripped off as it was being grilled. Was less flavorful than other merguez's I have had.- chicken plate: chicken was lean but, again, had less spices/herbs than expected.Overall the food was okay but not as flavorful of most other mediterranean food I have had. Would not return.",I would have come here ages ago if I knew they had a serviced back patio! Stumbled upon the backyard as we came in planning to get a quick snack - ended up deciding to sit for lunch. Food is really A+ and very reasonably priced. Service is very fast and staff is very friendly. Plates are big - we got two dishes and had leftovers between two of us. We loved the assorted salad option (you pick 5 of the salads you want) and the chicken plate with pitas. So good and very filling without feeling heavy. Will be coming back soon!,Bedouin Tent
160,"I never write reviews, but I am forced to make an exception. I sm a regular customer at Hot Pot. I go there 2 to 3 times a week. Yesterday I ordered six doubles and tried to eat them the following day. The salt content was so high that my friend and I could not eat them. When I went to complain the server asked me if all of them were salty and then said they got no complaints from other customers; and that was it. No apologies no offer to replace them. As I said before I'm a regular customer but that is no longer the case as of this day forward. I am willing to give them the ""benefit of doubt"" that it was an isolated incident but their customer service was appalling and dismissive.","At first glance, you might mistake this place to serve hot pot (""De Hot Pot"") yet it couldn't be farther from it.  When walking into DHP,  the line might be wrapping around the room with hungry locales who know the Trinidadian dishes and names. I so much knew one item from the menu. The standard fare is simple: Roti (wrapped)  doubles,  or stews (separate). All dishes come with channa (rich, savory chickpea stew) and potatoes(seasoned, slightly mashed) except for doubles(just channa). Def recommend ordering       ""doubles with everything"" which is a regular double loaded up with smacktastic seasonings of taramind and fried shallots. IMHO you're missing out if you decline their recommendations. Srsly tho the most amazing thing is you can get 2 doubles and a drink for $5. NWTS for cheap fastfood .",I used to come here for years until yesterday when I ordered beef rice and beans and potato Chana The food didn't settle probably shortly after I started vomiting and I had a case of diarrhea. This led me to believe that I something was in the food. I later on had gotten a proper diagnosis in which I was food poisoning. Be careful great people sometimes but this was the last time I will ever eat there.,"Fabulous food! My husband and I wondered in to De Hot Pot after spotting it while riding the bus. We ordered from the menu a ""veg roti with four sides"" for $8. This consisted of a roti with four different vegetarian sides combined in the middle. We chose channa (curried chickpeas), potatoes, pumpkin, and spinach. The combination was perfect--they meshed well together, and yet kept their distinct flavors. The sweet pumpkin was especially delicious. In addition, we shared a double ($1.50), our first one ever. This consisted of flat fried pieces of dough with channa as well as a bit of ""sweet sauce"" in between. The flatbread was soft and slightly crispy, yet not too oily. We left very full and satisfied. The food is made to order, but the wait was well worth it.","Would give a 3.5 total.Went on Saturday at ~4:30pm and there was about a 20-30min long line. We ordered the:-doubles: delicious, very flavorful, 5/5. Highly recommend.-boneless chicken roti & beef roti: very good size, even for someone with a good appetite. The curry was a lot milder than expected, I think it could have used more curry and a touch of salt. The meat would have benefited from being cut into smaller pieces before cooking as the pieces did not have much flavor since they were large and the mild flavors did not penetrate the meat. 3/5The place is very casual, def a pick-up and go place. Although they have 3 tables with chairs, it's practically impossible to sit there when they are busy because the place is narrow and people are lined up right next to/touching the tables.","I unfortunately haven't had a good recent experience.   Yesterday, August 18, 2019, I stopped with a friend to get some chicken roti.  I used to come here all the time after a party or boatride.  Yesterday the first time in a while.   So the shop apparently didn't have curry chicken only the boneless.  Nothing against boneless but I like traditional west indian roti.  I was asked if I wanted the stew chicken in a roti instead.  I opted for the boneless and I asked to put a couple of the stewed in since it was boned, just to satisfy at least that part of it- although it wasn't my preference. They were about to close and someone came from the kitchen to dispose of all the food so this food was going to waste anyway because the shop isn't open on Mondays.  I was told ""we don't mix.""  So firstly, I could not get what I initially wanted, I am paying the up fee for the deboned chicken because the shop didn't have any more regular curry chicken, and could not add only a couple pieces of the stewed which I was willing to pay for.  To top it off, the food was going to waste which we saw ourselves that it was being discarded.I have never experienced this before.  This is not how you treat your customers.  This is why many of our black owned businesses can't survive.  Of course the are is now more gentrified and many shops do get pushed up.  You'd want to keep your patrons and build more customers as well.  Word of mouth can kill a business.   Sadly, I won't be back here as there are too many wonderful spots on Brooklyn.  I should have just gone to trinciti in queens or A&A Bake Doubles and Roti the next day since it is closed on Sundays.  For Triniciti, there is no running out of anything.  One basically orders, and pay for whatever they want- you can mix and add as many garnishes or mix until that roti busts- you just pay the price.  There was another patron, also a triple business owner, who faithfully buys roti skins for her functions.  We chatted a bit outside the shop after the incident and she stated that she won't be back for a while.  We were both sorely disappointed as we were both of Caribbean descent and we want to support those business as well.  I don't know what happened along the way but I urge this business to review their customer service practices and appreciate your customer patronage.I did like the rotis at one point, and even had the doubles and this is why my cousins and friends would frequent this shop, but after yesterday, my disposition has changed.  There are too many other shops out there to deal with this.",De Hot Pot
161,Pretty restaurant with cozy atmosphere.The food is OK. Not great. I think it's overpriced. Especially the wine/drinks.Good service though.Doesn't deserve more than 3 stars at that price.,"Horrible place. The decor is outdated and unsanitary. There were two giant flies hovering above our table and we had to request that we were moved.I ordered a beer and the ""bartender/waitress"" poured it as though she had never poured a beer in her life.Food was not great. We had the dumpling and the mussels. They're were nothing special. When we were done the waiter took my drink without asking if I was finished. All in all, this place sucks. Don't go here.",Don't quite understand what the hype is about. Came in for a late lunch on a Saturday. We waited 30 minutes for our food. The bibimbap and the burger with kimchi were mediocre and totally overpriced for the portion and taste.,The patio out back is awesome.  Good vibes.  The dumplings were great.  The sweet and sour pork ribs were amazing.  But the Chinese sausage corn bread was dry and frankly.... very disappointing.  But.... we had a great night nonetheless.,"The Good Fork could have been so  much better if the service was up to the ambience, which it definitely was not.From the get, I sensed major attitude from the person serving me (female, caucasian, hair up in a bun), as if she could care less about the basics, which turned out to be getting a spoon so my friend could mix their coffee without asking for my butter knife because a spoon was never provided, to eating a burger I order rare (which I was never asked how I'd like it, by the way and had to tell another waitress how after mine left), medium-rare because after waiting for my original waitress to check back in and ask 'is everything okay,' I decided I was just too pissed off and hungry to bother reprimanding her (I would have made quite a scene and my friend would have been embarrassed). Ben Schneider and Sohui Kim, the owners, must be oblivious to what goes on at their place as I found out later when I called to inquire from Heather, the manager and probably server who I encountered today, that they are never there.  I am very easy to please and in the customer service industry myself, so I know how hard some days can be and sympathize - but that sympathy would be out of place and wasted here.  I will never dine there again and definitely would not recommend it to my friends.  I hope Ben and Sohui see this and basic service, like serving a spoon to mix coffee and cream with and checking to ask if everything is okay a little while after serving a meal is restored.","The line for Hometown BBQ dragged back to its hometown. Brooklyn Crab was filled to the gills with day drinkers and crustacean lovers. The Good Fork was opening momentarily so we figured it would be easy to walk in for dinner. Easy, it was. It was a solid meal though somewhat forgettable. The restaurant itself is cute with a backyard area covered with string lights. There are two rooms within the restaurant, one that overlooks the backyard, and the one where you walk in, which is somewhat dark because it doesn't receive natural lighting. Yelp describes The Good Fork as eclectic. I would call it Korean fusion, which doesn't always necessarily work. I think The Good Fork skirts the line pretty well between crazy concoctions and respectable food. I only wish it was executed better. Four of us shared a variety of dishes.My boyfriend and I shared the vegetable scallion pancake  [$14] which, if you're looking for a traditional Asian pancake, it is not this. The pancake was drizzled in various sauces and was fried. It was not overly wet nor greasy. Perhaps, it could have used a little more seasoning. It was a good size to share between two people and it satiated us. I had the Korean Steak and Eggs [$30] which I thought was passable. The steak, cooked medium, was delicious but the kimchi fried rice on the side was lukewarm and was not particularly sour. I think the waitress waited until all the entrees were ready before serving them to our group. The sunny side up egg was just runny enough to spill over the rice, but only just. My friends got the burger, I probably should have gotten that too and for half the price. I also ordered the rhubarb and strawberry cobbler [$9] for dessert (spring!) but my excitement was quickly dashed. It looked like it was thrown onto the plate from the baking pan. Let's call it rustic. It was tasty but it was hard to cut through the rhubarb, while the rest of the pastry was kind of soggy. My friends had Steve's Key Lime Pie (which is also located in Red Hook). I thought the lime flavor was muted, versus what you get at the actual shop, which I've been to. I had the Carpe Diem [$12] which is a margarita with jalapeño and other fruit flavors. It was quite good! All in all, the check came to close to $200 for four people before tip. Yikes.",The Good Fork
162,"I've been wanting to come here for a while since it's so close to my apartment. I finally came here with my roommate on a Tuesday. We got seated immediately. We got an order of tamarind wings, jerk wings, and the loaded jerk fries to share. The jerk fries are DELICIOUS. They are a must get! The wings are a bit dry, but they're only $0.50 each on Tuesdays. They seemed understaffed since it was also kind of hard to get a server to come by for drink refills.They have specials almost every night. I would definitely come back again.","DON'T BELIEVES THE HYPE!!!!...or the Instagram  pics. I came here after seeing them on Instagram. I asked a friend about this place and she told me she didn't enjoy anything about the food or the service, but the pictures on Instagram was giving me a different vibe so i wanted to go really badly. So i went after work after 5pm. The door was closed and it was very dark inside so i walk over to the bar tender to ask if they were open and she just nodded. So i took that as a yes and sat down at the bar. She didn't greet me just placed the menu on  the table and walked away. As I'm waiting for her to return i looked up and notice my face on her phone i then called out to her and asked if she was on live.she said yes and walked away again so i just move my seating away from her phone. I ordered a tequila sunrise which was   straight ORANGE JUICE didnt taste like it was a mixed drink with liquor at all. I didnt order any food because even though it was after 5pm they was still setting up . Unloading and bring food in from outside. Just paided for the drinks  with tip and lefted...i wouldnt recommend this place to anyone at all","One cook and one bartender/waitress... do I really have to tell you the rest!!!!!!. It is 70 degrees out, people want to spend money and drink. I witnessed a couple waiting close to an hour for their meal wtf!!!!! The highlight is that they had a customer volunteer to assist...and they let her!!! The manager was there and she moves way toooooooooo slow!!!  Food and drinks: the rum punch was pure juice. The loaded jerk fries was missing the jerk!!! Oh come on'I just don't know of the longevity of this establishment. It's in a good location and the potential is there ‍Totally Disappointed","After looking for a place, decided to try out one that was bookmarked for a while. The server is beyond sweet and we decided to try their iron cast mac and cheese along with their flat bread pizza. For anyone reading that loves a spicy kick -- THIS IS YOUR PLACE. All tapas style and delicious! Really filling and my friend and i wanted a third dish but the kitchen closed so def coming back since I live in the area","This place was just ok. My girlfriends and I were seeking a spot to catch up over dinner and drinks and picked this based on proximity to our Airbnb and reviews.  I would probably not revisit. The calamari is defrosted and then fried, giving it a rubbery taste. The cojita corn was good, but for $6 was a small portion.  We also got a coconut shrimp which again appeared defrosted and came with microwave rice. The service was a bit slow, although friendly - despite it being our table of 3 and only one other couple in the establishment. The surrounding area is a bit loud/hectic - it's mostly corner markets, beer stores etc. The rum punch was REALLY sweet and they had no vermouth for the martini, which also came with a black instead of green olive. I don't think the bartender had a vast knowledge of mixology because he asked if I would like triple sec in my dirty martini in place of vermouth (ew). He meant well and was very friendly but overall we just were not impressed.","So my gf stated that it's  her brothers birthday and she wants to go to this place that he constantly eats at. She said he talks highly about it and she would like for me to come. I told my bf let's go support her brother for his birthday while enjoying a new place to eat.    As soon as we got there the gentleman behind the bar greeted us to ""hello"" with a smile we sat at the bar and skimmed through the menu for what we can drink and eat. Until everyone comes. Oh I forgot to mention it was an impromptu Birthday Surprise dinner. As we looked through the menu I seen so many things that sounds so amazing so we finally made an decision, he had the Sidecare ??  (I forgot the name but I do kno for sure it was a sidecar) it was good and I had the Jamaican Passion. Omg my drink was oh so good. My bf kept sipping on my drink bc he knew it was delicious.     We ordered appetizers until everyone came. Which was the Jerk Chicken MAC & Cheese smh it was everything a more I thought it would be. I wondered how they will pull it off and they absolutely did. We also ordered Kung pao calamari I wasn't too crazy about. It was okay maybe I needed a sauce with it. But I do remember eating a lot of it. Lol. We also had a fish sandwich which again was delicious. I was so impressed by the drinks then the appetizers I'm so looking forward to going back there to try other entrees. Finally everyone comes and especially the Birthday Boy he was happy to see us all. And esp happy to eat and his favorite place. Just about everyone on the table ordered there Mac and cheese with jerk chicken some Ordered theirs with shrimp. Everyone at the table was pleased especially me. We all stated we will definitely be back to experience some more good food and drinks. Think this maybe our quick stop every other week especially since it's a short distance from our home.",Sip Unwine
163,"The below reviewers must have been paid for their positive feedback. Do not attempt this place unless you have many hours on hand and enjoy average food paired with bad service. The appetizers came before the drinks, 20 minutes after we had ordered. These women are sleeping at the wheel, watching them move around the restaurant is a slow motion picture.I'll summarize. They got our drink order wrong. We had to steal utensils from other tables. They got our appetizer order wrong. My entree came out 15 minutes after everyone else's, no apologies, no update on if or when my food was coming. I paid $30 for five pieces of shrimp, white rice, on a questionable orange sauce. Just don't.",Ceviche wasn't fishy at all well marinated and very fresh! Jalea... The fish used to fry was sooo good you can taste thats it's fresh fish and not frozen! Excellent customer service! Only complain was no AC and drinks were a bit weak!,This restaurant doesn't deserve a star or any at that. Everything is overpriced and the food is in very small portions. I'm peruvian so this is a disgrace to peruvian cuisine. Terrible experience I don't intend on coming back.,The lunch grilled chicken sandwich is amazing! I Pair it with sweet plantains and even put it inside my sandwich to give it that sweet and savory taste! I've tried the rotisserie chicken sandwich with cheese but literally it's just bread cheese and chicken... to plain for me! Let's not forget my fave margaritaaaaaaa!!! The causa rellena is a great appetizer and the empanadas with cheese so yummy!!! The octopus is the perfect spice and served cold as ceviche with capers .For dinner I get the chicken saltado! Super delicious !,"To me a 3 means I got what I expected. Food, service & drink were all OK., But the employees should have better communication  with customers in what's available. They need to work on their service too, Way too slow. Great chicken no doubt about it. Just my concern in about the service, Hope they can fix that","I was craving something like pollo campero and as a Miamian in NYC, I naturally looked for a Peruvian restaurant and stumbled upon Pollo D'Oro in Downtown Brooklyn.The place was decorated nicely and the ambiance was good (a lot more high end that the Peruvian restaurants I had been to in Miami, which are more casual) only complaint is that when we went the Peru - Brazil game was playing and it was extremely loud! Husband and I had to scream at each other. Husband ordered the Lomo Saltado with fries and I ordered 1/4 of a chicken with french fries. The taste of the chicken was good but only the top skin, the inside was very bland. Husband said his Lomo Saltado was good, although not the best he has had. The prices were reflective of any restaurant in DB. We had a decent experience and the menu had a lot of variety so we may come back again.",Pollo D' Oro
164,Good food but horrible service.. this new server taking orders and all over the place then come another server and she is as horrible as the the first guy..I like the food and the environment except horrible service..,"CHEESE. BOAT. My husband and I visited for lunch and were excited to experience a bread boat filled with cheese. Said cheeseboat met all expectations and was delicious. However...we overestimated how hungry we were and also ordered a side of fries. We assumed they would be New York-sized. They were not. That basket could've easily fed four people. We did our best to finish our food but failed miserably. Then we mistakenly walked around Brooklyn for the rest of the day. It wasn't the best start. I'd suggest visiting Cheeseboat before a casual night in, perhaps wearing sweatpants.","Prosciutto Cheese Boat was ok, definetily wasn't the best. The taste got tiring and honestly soooo much money for something that tasted just ""ok"". Wouldn't really go back.","Oh wow.  If you love melted cheesy goodness and Eastern Europe like I do, this is the spot for you. Dishes and wine from Georgia.  Came in around 1pm on a Saturday, seating for 5 was easy. Decent size seating area with bar in the back left corner. If all the tables are full, it could be kinda tight at the tables. Front windows open fully and some sidewalk seating. I enjoyed the red wine we had with lunch, but for others it was a bit too sweet- the blackberry note.  Three of us shared a Cheeseboat- a boat made of bread filled with gooey hot melted mozzarella and feta, then topped a with butter and an egg. It was like an open faced epic grilled cheese.  I was in heaven!! The Kundari- cheese-less meat pie was unexpectedly huge, the size of a medium pizza. Flaky layers of pastry with a thin purée layer of meat and spices. Service was great. Table just a little sticky.","Had a reservation for 6 , at 8:45 . When we arrived the table was not ready .   Mushroom dumplings were gross , hope I won't get food poisoning.  Also had khinkali with beef , if you now how the real Georgian food taste like , you will be disappointed. Wine was ok , but the quality and price just don't match .  The worst thing , we had to leave in an hour and half , cause nobody told that restaurant closes at 10 .","Beware! They have changed their brunch menu as of one week ago and not updated it online. A group of friends and I came, eager to try the various different cheeseboats only to find that their menu had drastically changed and they no longer serve cheeseboats until after 4 PM. This change with lack of update onto their website is the primary reason to knock their stars down. There was very little flexibility in accommodating to us based on our disappointment and expectations except that they could make the regular cheeseboat. Some of us got the regular cheeseboat which was very delicious and freshly made. Others tried the pumpkin French toast and pear salad, which were also good.",Cheeseboat
165,"Didn't get a table or order to go , arrived on Friday 8 pm , they said they completely booked ( party of 2 ) so we start looking for other options around and in mean time other group of 3 came , and I heard they taking to the host , she said if you can wait 10 minutes they might be able to find a table for them , we came back with same question, and she said NO for party of 2 , probably they didn't want to keep table for 4 busy only with 2 people , so they loosing money . After I watched video about owner and how he want to keep it oldschool and now it looks it's only business no oldschool","Best pizza - no doubt 5 stars. Worst customer service experience of all time- 1 star. My 14 year old son researched this place and swore this was going to be the BOAT as were from the 1000 miles away. Well as for the pizza he was right. BUT the hostess was abrupt and rude to him (6'0 tall maybe mistaken for an adult). After not being able to get a table, we waited 2 hours for take out (not a problem). When we were given only three pizza in a box, he wanted napkins and hot peppers-sprinkles. He would not go ask. So I went and asked her. With a glare and bf I could finish my sentence she left to get napkins. When she returned I asked for peppers, she said she could go inside and grab a pepper container, as if I was going to decline. Greatest pizza, rudest service, and don't expect napkins and peppers on to go order. The first person you see at a restaurant sets the tone and communicates the business culture-message. I'm gonna guess maybe it was a bad day and she's usually great. Feedback- place someone up front that understands this principle and is on point w customers. Arrogance and poor customer service doesn't mix well with the best pizza.","My favorite pizza in NYC (Juliana's is #2).  I could tell you the secrets of how to get a table, but then how would I beat the crowds?","Worth following the rules and waiting in line for the reservation.  If you plan to come with more than 4 people, just be prepared that you may be feasting on this delicious pizza closer to 9pm.  Be there by 4pm to wait in line for your reservation and be prepared to take any time slot you can.  The girls at the door are excellent, no games and they keep it moving.  Definitely appreciate that!  The crust of the pizza is light and crisps up beautifully.  The gents making the pizza are friendly, if you're stopping by the bathroom, say hello and thank you. You can't go wrong with the pepperoni and garlic pies, literally will melt in your mouth.  The ingredients are top notch.  Normally, pizza leaves me with a heart burn sensation because of cheap dough ingredients, but I have no issue at all with Lucali pizza.  It's a must have. Pro tip - If ordering the calzone, make sure to order a plate of pepperoni on the side to stuff in.  Bring your favorite bottle of wine and enjoy every bite.  The owner is fantastic, greets everyone dining. Highly appreciative and his story is pretty cool. Peak their website for the details. Last but not least, this is a staple in the pizza business, so you never know who you may run into. Jay Z and Beyonce are regulars, hint hint.  Just don't be star struck and appreciate that even the top 1% enjoy this phenomenal pizza. Definitely plan a day to visit Lucali, get your name on the reservation list and go visit some of the local breweries... Other Half is a great local option.","My boyfriend got in line on a Friday at about 3:45 (thanks babe). He was 6th in line. The host came around at about 5:15 to give out reservations. We got the first seating (5:45) but unfortunately I was stuck at work so he asked the hostess for the second seating at 6:30 (I know - major screw up on my part). She was somewhat annoyed but instructed him to find someone to switch with. As you can imagine it was super easy to find 2 people that were willing to switch. I arrived at 6 and we walked over to a cute wine shop on Union (Il Vignetto Fine Wine & Spirits) to grab our bottle of wine for dinner. It's BYOB - 1 - 750ml of wine or a 6 pack of beer per table. We returned just before 6:30 and sat on the bench out front and chatted with the hostess. She was very pleasant. When our name was called walked in and all of the staff greeted us, even the guys in the back cooking waived. Our waitress was also super friendly.Food was excellent. We ordered a pizza with pepperoni and basil and a small calzone with garlic. I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that we ate all of it! Definitely recommend! Just make sure to plan ahead and be okay with the waiting!","The experience didn't live up to the hype in my opinion.I think the pizza was delicious but the overall, I wouldn't call it exceptional by any means.I get that by keeping it a first come first serve type of business you make it an exclusive outing but I would not see myself wait in line on a cold and rainy day. Remember to bring cash as it is the only form of payment accepted.Also, it is bring your own bottle and they ask that you only bring one bottle as seating is limited to one hour. There is a few places to get wine nearby and highly recommended Scotto's; 5 minute walk.Another aspect I found unpleasant, and that's really a personal preference, was how loud and cramped the dining room was. It might be part of the charm but it is not my cup of tea.The kitchen is located in the dining room so you can witness where the magic actually happens. I thought the service was pleasant and quick. You can't have any other way if you want this kind of business to strive.",Lucali
166,"This is probably the most overrated restaurant I've ever tried lately. The main reason we went there was because all the good reviews we read. But the food was just ok. We ordered fish, veggies and pork. The fish was tasteless and not fresh. The other dishes were disappointed too. I think they got good reviews because they have promotions going on and people can trade good reviews for some discount. Very disappointed overall compared to the price and other Szechuan food I have tired before.","One of my favorite sichuan places in Brooklyn! Tastes very authentic , but... not spicy at all. if you ask for mild in your dishes, you wont get any spicy flavor, but you can see a lot of spicy oil. weird. but anyway, service was always on point. theyre very patient with you, even when they get shitty customers. cheers to these servers that keep their heads up and continue being patient with each tables. Food, i would say, is not perfect. but.. what keeps me coming back is the service. I havent had a bad experience yet, i hope they keep up the service and I will be back more and more","First the food is okay, wait staff were nice.but i wont be going back.Long story short, we found a bug in our Dish. I told the staff, he brought the dish up stairs to show management i assumed, he came back offering to change it for us.But we asked him to take the dish off the bill,and we will paid for all the appetizers.we still left a good tip for the staff.I understand these things happen, its hard to avoid in the food industryand it is not a big deal, it is not about the money either, it is about good gesture and doing the right thing for the customer.  management did not even take care of our situation. we sat down only for 10 minutes.what i didnt like,1. they took the dish off, but they still charge us the tax with the dish, which is 3$ more, is not a lot, but is not right, we realized after we left.2. they charge us for the 2 plain rice, even though we are unable to eat it with out the dish cuz there was a bug in it3. the tip suggestion was also with the $30 dish included","We wandered in a weekend afternoon and it was nice and empty. The waiters gave us a basket to put our bags in so it doesn't have to sit on the floor. We were given free peanutsThe quality of the food was phenomenal. I'm always looking to expand my Szechuan food palate after Han Dynasty left me wanting more. The spicy chicken is a huge, shareable portion with plenty of szechuan peppercorns sprinkled throughout.The eggplant with garlic sauce is sweet but not overpowering - you can really taste the eggplant and it is perfectly tenderThe pork belly is light and delicious - less seasoned if you want something that is a break from all the flavor, but well executed","I love szechuan style and everything spicy!! This place was pretty good but not as good as szechuan mountain house in my opinion. The beef in chili oil was the best! So delicious and a nice big pot of meat to veggie ratio like cabbage. Totally recommend this dish.Fish in chili oil was not as good as fish fillet, which I like so much better. We did not realize it would be that kind of fish where they left the bones in which made it kind of annoying to eat, because i am lazy and don't want to spit out or take out all the bones. I just want to eattt haha. But it came with a ton of veggies and tofu like cucumber and bean sprouts. Check in so you can get a free Chendu cold noodle!! It kinda tasted like nothing but it was good with the minced meat and spicy chili oil. Need to come back to try some other dishes especiall that fish fillet","Szechuan food is not everyone's cup of tea! So come in with welcoming taste buds. The interior blew me away, as the place looked really modern and cozy. It looked nothing like the other stores in the area. The music was also fantastic, as I found myself jamming to all of their songs! You could place your belongings in baskets which was really nice. The workers there were really friendly and quick, but too fast in that they came way too often to ask if we were ready to order. Nonetheless, we ordered a bunch of things. Tip: If you check in, you can get free Chengdu ""noodles""! They don't actually taste like noodles, but more like a gelatin texture. So it would taste like nothing if it wasn't for the chili sauce.The food we ordered were a hit or miss. The Chengdu wontons were good, but definitely nothing special. The ""fries"" were unfried potatoes which tasted bland if it wasn't spicy. The pineapple rice was small in portion size and just tasted alright. The fish soup was HUGE. It was sour, possibly a bit too sour if you are drinking it. The fish pieces were sweet and flavorful but had bones. I probably enjoyed the tofu the most as it was this fluffy egg tofu that was sweet and saucy. The food felt like warm and hearty home cooked food, which was a great first experience. But I definitely do not find myself craving Szechuan food anytime soon.",Chuan Tian Xia 川天下
167,"Food was good like always!! Except me and my mom AND my sister were extremely sick the next day!! All 3 of us got the same thing and we were all extremely sick with the runs and stomach ache. Never happened to me before at peppa's i love this spot. Maybe they had an off day, but idk i still love their jerk chicken  but i never got so sick like that from eating food before, idk if it was the chicken or rice? Hm maybe I'll try again in the near future. For now, i won't be back.","Peppas jerk chicken is overrated. My husband and  I came here after work with the best intentions. It is a very small spot with an old appearance. When we got there it was only three people ahead of us. I then placed my order with a female server who was not friendly at all. I got the large jerk chicken meal for $11.00. The chicken looked okay but once I got home I could not wait to taste what turned out to be DRY, OVERCOOKED, FLAVORLESS CHICKEN. The rice and peas were too fluffy and lacked ideal texture and my salad was stale asf. The chicken taste was so disappointing that I almost threw it in the trash :(  I know that everything is not for everyone so this is nothing personal but in my opinion McKenzie's on Utica Ave. by far was the best jerk I have had next to Fisherman's Cove.","I came to Peppas on an afternoon, and the line was long. I decided to wait anyway on the recommendation that I try their famous Jerk Chicken. I ordered the meal, which came with cabbage, rice & peas, and two slices of plantain. The chicken was adequately seasoned, and was even able to retain some moisture despite the cooking process. I topped off my dish with some of their spicy Jerk Sauce on the side and some barbecue sauce, and I really polished off that plate.Considering the price point, food quality, and portion size, Peppa's is a great option when it comes to quick Jamaican food.","This place is open early and closed super late, if it closes at all.The jerk chicken is great.The fried fish is also great, I usually get either porgy or snapper.You can order for a large party same day if you'd like.","So I'm running a 5k this evening, so I wanted some pasta so I can get some good carbs and proteins and energy ready! Ifyou say you open at 11am, then if I come at 12pm, don't tell me nothing is ready.NOTHING is ready Except jerk and festival, so I pretty much sat in traffic for nothing.Even further, They don't sell Rasta pasta here (go to the express on on Utica for that).There was no curry chicken (not til 2pm), no oxtails (needs 20 mins), no stewed chicken (not given a time frame)So I'm relegated to 2 festivals and a lemonade, because of course Peppa's has nooooo clue who makes atleast a Rasta pasta in the area...I'll stick to the Peppa's in East Flatbush. They sell EVERYTHING! And have food ready for when the restaurant opens!Edited to add: these Festivals are like half the size of the Peppa's on Utica.","Man this place really knows how to do jerk chicken! I mean, they should seeing as how that is their name! But yeah, this is some of the best. You get a pretty large portion for the price. And the festival (Johnny cake, bake, fried dumpling...whatever you want to call it) is GREAT!  Not too greasy, nice and crunchy on the outside and soft inside with just the right hint of sweetness! Mmmm! I could eat those all day. They aren't the most friendly or welcoming but I've been treated way worse at the Caribbean restaurants at home (Boston). Cash only. They have an ATM inside to help you out with that. I highly recommend this place if you're ever in the area.",Peppa's Jerk Chicken Restaurant
168,"Somewhere between Chinese & Vietnamese, decent atmosphere and friendly staff. A gem on Ave. N.",This place is a diamond in the rough. Hard to find southeast Asian cuisine anywhere in Brooklyn. Very cheap for the portion size and the chef personally came out and asked us how the meal was. Cant beat that,I love the all food from here but the Chinese waiter talk too much and rude so I don't wanna go back there but I recommend order food as deliver,"I love saigon grill. The food is always tasty, great portion sizes for the price and the restaurant has a beautiful decor. So happy they are in the area. The staff is friendly, accommodating and quick. Been at least 10 times and I've never had a complaint.","All around  pretty good, just avoid the Pho.The plate dishes have a decent to large serving size whereas the Pho bo...WHAT A TOTAL RIP OFF, they basically dumped another half bag of noodles in to make it a large, but added no additional beef. Bowl literally only had 3 slices of thin beef. If this was a pure pho review, this place would be getting 2 stars! Broth is avg/ok. Banh hoi (thin vermicelli) beef skewers: I was satisfied. Nicely seasoned and good portion for my size.Suong nuong (pork chops): all around best dish of the night. Came with basically 3 whole pork chops, and I'm not talking about thin cuts, they were on the thicker side. Ridiculous! Were grilled to excellent perfection. Summer rolls -goi cuon Tom (shrimp) -tasty as it shouldAmbience: nicer date night atmosphere than your typical Asian restaurant Bottom line: if you avoid the Pho, you will most likely have an enjoyable experience",I'm not so keen with this place. They serve Vietnamese food. I've been to many so I'm gonna say this one fell off the ratings hook. They're just okay. I wish they would upgrade their menu to be competitive with other Vietnamese restaurants in the area. I ordered a mixed veggie dish and the veggies are from the can and not fresh. Ugh!,Saigon Grill & Bar
169,There drinks are  good specially the Canarsie cranberry and Eastern pkwy express. The bad thing about this place is that there prices for there juice is way to expensive. They charge you 2 dollars extra for a Large which is not much different from there regular size.  The only reason why I keep going back is because is the only juice place around me that taste good.,"Best salmon sandwich i ever had in my entire life.I was sleeping and my girl came through with a banging sandwich. She only had a half of a half left, and was mad it disappeared.We immediately went back out to get 2 more!!!",This place is amazing! I don't even use YELP but they earned this 5 star and that's on my momma.,"This my spot. This spot is manly for the health nuts that cares about how they eat. Now that I've been working out a lot I really started coming here often. They make one of the best protein shakes and smoothies. The salmon burger is so good you will want two. They use a special type of sauce that they make, makes the burger taste even better. The owner is very cool. If he Nah's your shake he don't throw away the extra he give it to you. He's very friendly and down to earth. I don't mind spending my money where I feel welcome. Especially when the food and drinks are on the money. Parking is easy at this place. Every time I go I find parking in front or across the street. They have a bench outside if you wanna have you a little something to eat and drink you can chill out front an enjoy the view and the weather",Love their smoothies and juices. They also have cushions making it a super comfy place to work. Also love that it's black owned.,"I want to eat all of these foods and drink all of these drinks every day of the week.The food and drink offerings are really great and the seating provided (both indoor and out) are all really nice. Tables are made from reclaimed wood, booth seating available, and they have stools against the bar, too. It's a great place to work during the day (free WiFi!) and the employees are super friendly.Drinks I've had:-Marine Park (not crazy sweet. Perfect when you just want something tasty and cold)-Broadway Junction (this is my go to. So sweet and perfect! Try subbing out the agave for honey. Perffff)-Church Av Special (Perfect for a morning treat. Not overly sweet and, with the banana, oats, and spices, it's just a great addition to your morning bagel.)-Fulton Street (good but basically tastes like peanut butter. The flavor takes over the entire drinks. And let's be real, I've never scoffed at PB, but it's a good thing to be aware of!)-Marcy Mango (the smoothie counterpart to the Broadway Junction. Sweet flavor, very fruity, delicious!)The food is also good. I've tried a couple of salads, the BedStuy bagel, and the roasted fingerlings. All was yummy! They are very happy to customize items and allow you the freedom to swap or drop the things you like or dislike.Def check this spot out. You don't even realize how much you need Brooklyn Blend in your life!",Brooklyn Blend
170,Really used to enjoy this place but after last night forget about it. The bouncer was threatening and the dj did not let us request songs but it did not stop there. The dj had the bouncers make us LEAVE for requesting a few songs! We will never return to this establishment. I have never had such a poor experience at a bar.,"This is the worst place I have ever been to. The drinks are insanely overpriced ($25 for a Heineken and a vodka soda) and each of the staff members are assholes. First of all, we were almost kicked off of the line to get in because my boyfriend seemed ""drunk."" It was 11:30p at night and we were coming from dinner. It was an entire problem for 15 minutes trying to get in and prove that he wasn't drunk. Second- My friends tried requesting songs from the DJ and he yelled at them saying ""let me do my fucking job"" and wouldn't take the requests. Sorry, but you're a DJ you should expect requests? He then called security and they kicked us out because of that scenario. Bottom line- do not go to Freehold. They're a bunch of pretentious assholes who think they're amazing because they work at a bar in Brooklyn. The worst bar I have ever been to.",Customer service was horrible. The Tito's Lemonade was just lemonade with no Tito's in it. The spicy chicken tacos was disgusting. The setting was very nice and cozy. Hopefully they work on customer service because the place has a lot of potential.,Great food and chill vibe.  The $6 cocktails at happy hour were really good and strong! I recommend the chicken sandwich too. All around great time and the beautifully decorated main bar area was lovely.,"I've been here before and swore i wouldn't go back because it's trash. Underage people, weak/overpriced drinks, generally too crowded. Last time i was here a creepy man was following my girlfriend and i around and kept demanding we make out on command and then a different man was caught taking photos of us (i know we aren't your typical demographic but cmon you've never seen gays in the wild before?? I told the bartender that these people were bothering us and it was shrugged off and was told to go to a gay bar if it bothered me).It's been two years and i had to go back for a friend's birthday. I got there and the bouncer gave me a hard time for my government issued Id (a global entry card, which i use at the airport as my TSA approved ID) saying they need it to scan and can't accept it. I had international friends already inside who had used foreign IDs which 100% didn't scan when they arrived. I've also used this ID to get into other bars, including this one, in the past. I explained I've literally used this ID to get on a plane in lieu of a passport/license as a federal government and TSA approved ID and he said this isn't the airport, this is Freehold, and that as a former first lieutenant in the army, he was the expert on acceptable ids. I left, and proceeded to watch a group of girls who looked underage go in without getting their IDs scanned. Safe to say i won't be back/they don't deserve my business.Update: just found out some of my friends couldn't get in the same night (a guy and his husband). They were told it was closed for a ""private party"" while our other friends were inside.","Freehold for brunch or Freehold for a night out? I have a different option for both. FREEHOLD brunch: Their food is very very mediocre and pricey for what you get. People tend to go in groups for the ambiance/ music and a good time but take that away.. there is nothing special about their brunch. The service is very poor, and they are not attentive at all as it seems the waiters and waitresses rather hangout by the bar with the bartenders. I highly suggest to make a reservation, because if you walk-in you probably will not get a table. However, when you call them.. they don't seem to pick up the phone :) so you have to leave a voicemail, for them not to get back to you. Terrible customer service. FREEHOLD at night: Super cool spot, and great music! In the summer time, it's cool because they have a back area where you can hangout and have small games. They have a bar outside as well. Inside, especially in the colder weather gets PACKED. Sometimes too packed. They have tables around which are reserved for big groups, which sucks because there is nowhere really to sit, unless the couches in the middle of the place. Those couches I feel are in the way and take up too much room, I wish they moved them in the night, to allow more space for people to walk and dance. Beware of the long line to get in as well. Depending on the time, the line can be at the corner.",FREEHOLD
171,"Never underestimate the potential flavor found in ""seasonal vegetables."" We have never had better vegetables. And the lasagna never disappoints -- one order could serve a family! (Leftover lunch today)","Their food is good and they usually have interesting options on the menu but the few times I've been here, the service is a little flaky. I'll come here if I'm tired of the other pasta place down the street. I'll say Aita has better pescatarian options though.",Cozy lil spot. Lighting was way too dim. Wine glasses used were miniature. But the food was delish.,"Stumbled into Aita Trattoria on a Wednesday evening around 9:45PM.It was about 45% full and the vibe was mellow and nice. I was quickly and warmly approached and told that the kitchen would be closing in about 10 to 15 mins.That's was fine with me as I had no intentions or having a late night.We say down by the window and there was a nice breeze coming through - did I mention this place is really cute!! The staff was very helpful in explaining the menu and portions. The portions are generous! We ordered the Roasted Octopus, asparagus salad, Fresh Spaghetti w/ Seafood, and Bucatini Amatricana.1. Roasted Octopus: It was nice, but I do think it need more spice. It would be nice with some jalapeño or chili - some type of kick it was bland-ish but nice2. Asparagus Salad - MY FAVORITE DISH OF THE NIGHT- IT WAS MUUYUAAAHHHHDDD GOOD. 3. Fresh Spaghetti w/ Seafood - egh... the first bite was good but I do feel like there were tooooooo many Capers... well too many Capers for me. I couldn't finish it. 4.  Bucatini Amatriciana - it was tasty but I do wish it had some more flavor.All and all I would go back, because their salads sound are amazing.  And maybe the Capers threw me off?!?!?","It really sucks that I'm having to write this review. But after 3 years in the neighborhood and 3 visits to Aita it's time. Each visit has resulted in terrible food.My third and final visit, the focus of this break-up text, was last night.When we sat down at our table a child at the table next to us jumped up and puked all over the main floor within inches of other diners. A simple wet mop to wipe it up. No cleaning supplies. Odd. It wasn't just a small amount. This poor child blew at least 2 days worth of chunks and whatever he had just scarfed down at the table.This restaurant must be popular on the take-out apps because the bikers congregate outside the front of the door and frequently come inside and  stand in the very narrow aisle/main floor where, just minutes before little Charlie had puked his guts out.We ordered two glasses of wine to start. The wine was good. The previous two visits had resulted in terrible tasting wine. Glad they got this right.The same time we ordered our two entrees, both the tagliatelle al ragu, we ordered the Aita fries, which are actually good. If you're going to rough out an experience at this very cozy but can't-quite-get-it-right-after-all-these-years restaurant, order the fries, the full body red wine, and you'll be set (I guess).Said appetizer arrived and despite having to flag someone down for a  second round of wine, we enjoyed it with our soon to arrive secound glass of wine.After noticing, some 30 minutes later, that other diners that sat down well after us had already received their apps + entrees, the waiter came over to ask how everything was. Wait, what? Its been 45 minutes since we've ordered and 30 since you brought our now finished app..why are you not bringing our entrees. I politely said, ""App was great just waiting on those entrees now."" He brushed off the comment and walked away.10 minutes later he returned and asked what entrees we ordered. WHAT!? They clearly lost the order.Soon thereafter two plates of...something...were thrust upon the grand communal table we were seated at.To be totally honest it was as if they had opened a can of Campbell's vegetable soup, microwaved it, dumped it on some hot noddles, and rushed it out to us. After one bite I knew it to be true. We both pushed our sad veggie soup-pasta aside and I flagged down a member of the  staff whom had just almost took a nasty fall on the no-sign wet spot where vomit-time had happened (he must've had the veggie soup-pasta).I asked for the manager and the person told me she was the manager. Fabulous, we can wrap this up even faster. I politely said, ""No disrespect to anyone here but this tastes like Campbell's Vegetable Soup poured over noodles."" There was a small gasp, a dramatic pause. I asked her to remove the entrees from the table and delete it from the bill, which I asked her to bring to me after doing so.She apologized and took the entrees to the kitchen. She returned to with the menu and asked if we would like something else. We declined. She brought the check. Entrees were deducted and a round-of-wine was free. Fair enough.What I don't get with Aita (whom have prime real estate on Franklin Avenue and have always been friendly) is how they continue to have a lack-luster and poorly curated menu.Don't get too comfortable, Aita. Cent'Anni and D'Antan are within blocks and their food is so much better it may very well make your business go belly-up.We wound-up at Cent'Anni and enjoyed two delicious entrees and a bottle of wine.Cheers!","Had brunch here in April 2019 and overall I would not recommend or return. Came here with a friend and had non-brunch food during brunch. Perhaps that contributed to the overall lackluster experience. Ordered their spring spinach pasta, a side of roasted vegetables, and their much lauded lasagna. This spinach spring pasta was described a bit obliquely but deliciously on the menu. Turns out it was a deeply boring and underwhelming pesto pasta with bland ""spring"" vegetables. The same vegetables it turns out that were the side of ""roasted"" vegetables we ordered! The vegetables had the appearance of being steamed and then maybe put under the salamander to be given some color. This isn't exactly the deep delicious roasted flavor one would be expecting. They were essentially tasteless. According to the menu they were served with a garlic confit which was nowhere to be found, seen, or tasted. When we asked our server about this she said the sauce was on there which leads me to believe...there is no sauce! Another issue with our server was that she could have prevented this double serving of mediocre vegetables by keying us into the fact that these vegetables were also mixed into my pasta. The lasagna was tasty but incredibly celery/carrot forward from the bolognese element of the dish. It tasted unbalanced and was underwhelming. Won't be returning but the space is very cute and the meal wasn't that pricey ($25 each with a non-alcoholic beverage apiece).",Aita Trattoria
172,"Arrived at 8:00 on a Friday; we were not approached for.our order until 10 minutes later.We ordered a cheese plate, 3 tapas, and a paella ar 8:10. We didn't receive our cheese plate until.8:45 and when we.asked for an update, the waiter claimed that the kitchen was backed up. At 9:00 when our tapas arrived, we.told the waiter that it was taking an extraordinary amount of time for food to be delivered and that we wanted to cancel the paella. 5 minutes later, the paella arrives--with a burnt crust and hard rice. When we finally flag.down a runner at 9:15, and tell him the issue, the manager comes over and claimed that in Barcelona, the rice is supposed to be hard--and proceeds to touch my husband repeatedly to emphasize the (incorrect) point. (Not to mention they didn't refill water glasses or see if we wanted another drink!)This was our third time here. Only come if you like glacier-speed service (consistent all 3 times), barely passable tapas, and being told that paella is supposed to be the same density as a snail shell while being touched without consent.PASS.","Meh. You can find much better tapas in the city than this place. That being said, the service was good - waitress was polite and attentive - and the space has a nice vibe to it, but the tapas are really hit or miss. The octopus was lovely, tender and flavorful, but the patatas bravas were an embarrassment. I'm shocked they had the nerve to squirt some aioli on subpar roasted potatoes and charge $12 dollars for them. Overall, I'd skip this place.","The waitress was the better part of the experience. Not in service, but in overall demeanor. From the moment we sat down, we received water, which was never refilled, ordered items , one of which was currently unavailable. I ended up ordering the salmon which was overcooked and had the texture of chicken and served in a broth that though tasty, didn't make up for the horrible taste. My partner ordered the fish tacos which was the equivalent of a frozen fish stick in a tortilla and some market greens. No flavor, no sauce, no nothing. To add insult to injury, in the middle of our meal we were joined by a huge cockroach that was scurrying across the floor and flustered guests so much that one woman ran out...good luck on that bill. I wouldn't recommend that anyone spend their time, money or energy here. We also took the time to share our concerns prior to leaving and the response was incredibly nonchalant and dismissive. I think it may be safe to say that this wasn't their first dissatisfied customer.","Great little gem in Ditmas Park! I lived in the neighborhood for years before deciding to check this place out. It has a great brunch deal (3 tapas from one region for $15) and their dinner sliders are fantastic. From the outside, it doesn't look as nice as the inside ambience. Great customer service, strong drinks, live music, and good food! No wonder I went twice in one week!","They played Reggaeton when we first went in. And at that moment, I was nervous because I didn't know what they wanted to be- Spanish restaurant or Caribbean.Located on Cortelyou Rd, Manchego's menu has all the bells and whistles of a Spanish restaurant: Tapas, Pinxtos, Desserts, down to the Sangria. Style is cozy but a bit odd- but hey...it works for them. Service was incredibly nice and between our 6 Tapas and the ones I could pick from hubs', they were very good. The young gentleman was so nice, especially when I asked about any dairy in any of my dishes. Which he in turn, came back to remind me of aioli in my Patatas Brava. Thank you. Hubs enjoyed his Chorizo and Manchego slices. Octopus could've been a smidgeon softer- but it was edible. The same way lighting to me is everything- so is Music- and it'll make or break the vibe. Manchego's playlist was so stuck in the 90's and 2000s it was just bad man. And while I popped some moves with Mr. Saxobeat back in the day, jammed to Beyonce's ""To The Left"" and No Doubt way back when and grooved to Sixpence None The Richer's '97 song- ""Kiss Me""- that's not gonna fly now in this day and age. At. All. Listen- I don't get this place. And maybe I won't. And maybe I didn't get the total 'Spanish' package either- but service was very nice, price was good, Tapas were presented nicely and were tasty. Olé!","This place has the best seafood pasta - the Spanish Spaghetti. It's a huge portion of perfectly cooked shrimp, clams, and chorizo with a very light olive oil drizzle. It was way too much to eat in one sitting, so I happily took the rest of my plate home.The Mac and Cheese balls were also a hit! Could account for my not finishing my pasta, now that I think about it....I'm excited to come back and explore the rest of the menu, it was so hard to chose! The staff was pretty excellent despite being a little overwhelmed with a full house on a Wednesday night.",Manchego Koko
173,What is the hype? Its nothing special sorry to say. Doesnt taste bad but not worth a trek. Underwhelming... go get a slice at Prince Street instead,I placed an order on seamless from there for a delivery . After an hour and a half when my food did not arrive they told me that oh your food is here waiting for you to pick it up . I explained to them that is was a delivery and the guy said I know . I asked him why would I pick it up then. He said listen lady it's here for pick up. I canceled my order with them. The food here is amazing but very upset on how the situation went down .,"Trying  to write this review for a long time. My problem is I've been buying pizza here for over 20 years!! It's consistent different than everyone else. Sauce on top, cheese,  than a thick dough ( I'm talking there square pies). If your with a group go to the window get what they call a half pie and sit at one of the picnic tables. Bottom line is it's delicious and if your on a pizza crawl or have been trying different places this is a must stop. I tried to keep this simple didn't want to sound like the pizza snob I am.","The best pizza & ice cream I've ever eaten!!!I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the area! The pizza's sauce is known for its doughy, square slices, L&B Spumoni Gardens is located in Bensonhurst and is a popular destination for its signature pizza. I decided to try it few years ago and it has become my favorite pizza ever since. Not to mention the Spumoni ice cream - once you have eaten it, nothing else would be enjoyable!","The guys from work decided to grab some Spumoni for lunch. Solid place for some good pizza in the Bensonhurst neighborhood! Here's what it tastes like: sauce on top of the cheese and again under the cheese layered on some very soft and chewy bread. The pizza bread is moist and tasty. At $24 a tray, it's a pretty good choice. Only difference between these and your normal slices is that it's a lot more doughy. Gets old after two or three slices unlike your average pizza joint in NYC (where one can devour an whole thin crust pie). For the Spumoni pizzas, the bread and sauce dominates the taste; whereas at other places, the cheese is the pleasure of each bite. Your rating of this place will simply depend on your preference. Check it out and enjoy!",Great Pizza!Our family loves to go there in the summer for pizza and ices.  Fun place to go and enjoy pizza.  We love the square pizza.,L & B Spumoni Gardens
174,"Came here for Mother's Day. Should've taken my mom to  McDonald's instead as even that has better standards for meat that this terrible place. $200 for the most tasteless meat ever that was impossible to chew. Appetizers (calamari and cypress salad) were done so poorly as well. Even the bread in the table was stale and seemed reheated. The place tries to pass itself off as a ""high class"" place but from the paper menus (Chinese take out style) to this the food and service, i have no idea how this place stays open. I haven't written a yelp review in years. This is how terrible this place was....",Very nice place went here for my husbands birthday the food was good the driks too but the menus is so limited u dont have a lot of choices,"Bad steakhouse. WAY overpriced! The interior is nice but the food is terrible. First off, the prices listed on their Google overview are lower then the prices on their actual menu. I payed $50 for a ribeye steak that was probably worse than a steak I could have got at Applebees, truly disappointing for a high class steakhouse. Also, I dinned with a 2 person party and they included an 18% gratuity in the bill, which I've never seen at any restaurant before for only a 2 person party regardless of how nice the restaurant was. I had to request to get the 18% gratuity taken off the bill before I paid. I have never left a negative review on Yelp in my life but this place has left me so disgruntled I felt the need to warn others. Worse steakhouse I've ever been to. Do yourself a favor and never go.","Happy Belated Mother's Day to all of the mothers, grandmothers, aunts, sisters, cousins, foster moms, step mothers, parental guardians and any + all mother/motherly figures that have had or continue to have an emotional, physical, psychological, spiritual, etc. impact in somone's life! I am blessed to have such a wonderful mother and I wanted to make sure that we would be able to have a nice Mother's Day dinner. After making several reservations and those restaurants not working out for one reason or another, I did an internet search for restaurants that went along a specific bus route near our home. Why?-Because I wanted my mom to have to do the least amount of transit transfers and walking possible since it was pouring rain outside. It was fate that caused Atlas Steakhouse to come up on the screen. Pictures included  a lovely looking restaurant and equally beautiful looking food/cocktails, so we were convinced that this was the right place. Luckily, they still had reservations available yesterday and we arrived there via public transportation in about 30 minutes.We could hardly believe our good fortune as we were seated right away. The hostesses were so super chill and as soon as we got to our table, our server Rossi gave us the special Mother's Day Menu. I took a few minutes to initially take in their warm/inviting ambiance. Atlas Steakhouse has gorgeous lighting fixtures, comfortable seating, a vast array of wines displayed in their wine selection racks and a chic bar area. We decided to each order a Mango Margarita while munching on bread from the bread basket. Atlas Steakhouse has this creamy garlic butter that complements the bread perfectly...Yes, I definitely ate quite a bit of bread-lol. Rossi was so patient and kind to us and was able to provide us with information on specific menu items. My mother ordered Branzino Filet w/ Mashed Potatoes + Broccoli and I had the Skirt Steak w/ Mashed Potatoes. I also tasted some of her broccoli. Everything was prepared well w/ love and was oh so flavorful! The Skirt Steak melted in my mouth, heavenly mashed potatoes + nicely cooked broccoli = a great meal....My mother and I both agreed that her Branzino (yes, I tasted a small portion of it-lol) was fantastic. We shared a slice of their light and creamy Tiramisu. Boy, were we stuffed at the end of the evening-lol.Atlas Steakhouse staff made sure that we had everything needed to have a pleasurable dining experience. Thanks so much to Rossi, Daniel and Agor. Musician Boris played a medley of jazz music w/ his  saxophone + keyboard and had us snapping our fingers and dancing in our seats. He let us know that he is there just about every Sunday so one can see/hear him on a weekly basis. Thanks to Atlas Steakhouse for giving each of us one of their signature candle holders as a Mother's Day gift....they also have mints, wine corks + signature key tabs that customers can take as they are coming in or leaving the restaurant.We have already planned to come back soon for Brunch....","Tonight is my 4th visit to Atlas and I keep coming back for 4 reasons.  1) Service is amazing from Edwin. He is so charming and remembers returning customers.  He treated us like family tonight and its only been our 4th visit.  2) Ambiance makes me feel like I'm in Manhattan.  The restaurant is beautiful,  the hostess it's always pretty, welcoming and helpful and the live musician makes it romantic.  3) Food- Everything we have had tastes amazing and the steaks are perfectly cooked and 4) location is near my home in Brooklyn. Family friendly but also great for couples and can accommodate groups. We will be back! Thank you Edwin for starting  my birthday weekend kickoff  start in the best way!",Been here a couple times now with my friend who is a regular. The service is spot on and friendly esp Paul. Food is great. Esp the lobster bisque. Even when they make a mistake they are more than gracious about making things right. Live music on a Friday night. Beautiful restaurant.

175,"So disappointing. I took my wife, brother and fiancé here on a Saturday afternoon. I had eaten here once before and remembered that it was a decent spot. We came in hungry and sat down at an outside table. Once we finally got menus it took us about 15 minutes to order. Then we waited, and waited, and asked about our food, and then waited even more. Over an hour and still nothing. Then the waitress offered us shots. We said no. We just wanted our food. She then brought a round of beers on the house instead and said our ticket somehow got lost. When we finally got our food, the burgers were incredibly over cooked, almost inedible. But we were starving that we just forced it down. $100 bucks and 2+ hours later we left. I not only felt embarrassed that I recommended such a place but also felt cheated out of what should've been a special and pleasant experience. Shame on you Brooklyn Icehouse!","Really chill backyard space! Small menu; the sweet potato fries were so salty that I feared for my organs. Average service, and reasonable prices except for the $5 in ATM fees you're going to swallow since they don't make it clear until your bill comes that it's cash only :O",Nice dive. Large Backyard. Large drinks $6 draft pint beer. Chill music. TVs. Inside has plenty of tables to eat at. Bar is smaller but you can always chill in the back.,"Why am I ancient but I still love dive bars?  Because for $6 for a shot and a beer you can get messssed up before heading to brunch in the neighborhood. This place is convenient walking distance from the South Brooklyn Ferry when getting off at the Red Hook stop.  The bartenders are cool and the patrons are too.   Nice BIG TV for watching your sports.We had a fun chat with the chef and as a Brooklyn native he knows some great sounding dishes.  Didn't try anything, but we will be back for our pork chops.  Stop in if you're anywhere near here.","We arrived here for some late night grub, and I wish the kitchen was still serving the full menu... but unfortunately, we could only order wings, fries, and some key lime pie.  The wings were pretty tasty and the blue cheese/ranch mix dressing was phenomenal.  The fries were delectable. The key lime pie was from a local joint called Steve's.  It was average at best.  Only downfall, the dude serving behind the bar was as friendly as a door stop.","Came here after hanging out in the area for a few hours for some drinks. The inside is real divey and can get full pretty quick as it isn't all that big. What makes this an even bigger draw is the back yard area which has several tables and chairs so chilling here with drinks and bar grub was great. Unfortunately this makes it limited to the warmer months of the year.The drink selection was pretty decent best I can tell. I had some beers and a few of a cider that I'd never seen before so that was cool and the staff were pretty cool despite how busy it became as the evening crowd rolled in. I didnt have any of the food but some of the choices sounded pretty good. If I find myself outbthis way again maybe I'll try something. Again the best part is the backyard area, so if you're coming through, make it a warm night.",Brooklyn Ice House
176,"Veggie burger and cocktails were beyond delicious. Ambiance and service were second to none. Gorgeous place, wonderful food, 10/10 would recommend.","Esme used to be a solid neighborhood spot but it's gone downhill over the last year. The ambiance and staff are still as lovely as usual (hence the two stars) but the food is subpar. Dinner is simply ok. Brunch is downright disappointing.1. The avocado toast is barely edible. The bread is cut way too thick, lacks flavor, and is barely toasted. The avocado is overly processed, tastes stale, and is no better then the guacamole served as a side at Chipotle. The worst part of it is that they give you two oversized pieces of bread but only one poached egg.... the thought process behind that is just beyond me. Just give one piece of toast if you want to cheap out on eggs. 2. They use the hot water tap on an espresso machine for tea. This is a major no-no. The water in the machine is boiled over and over again and becomes incredibly chalky and tastes terrible. In addition, the temp is way to high for tea and burns it. Not what you would expect when you are paying $4 a cup.3. The quality of the rest of the food has gone down as well. The beignets have lost their fluffiness, the blueberries taste frozen, the espresso was terrible, etc etc. 4. The food took 30mins to come out.The place seems to be suffering from the consequences of bad judgement and general ambivalence by the management. Do better for yourself and the poor staff. Do better for our neighborhood.","OMG this place is so delicious. My wannabe hipster brother made me help him move to Greenpoint and afterwards we were absolutely STARVING. I'm gluten-free, vegan, and don't eat sugar but the staff was SOOOO ACCOMODATING to my needs. I ordered the kale, cauliflower, beet and sprout pizza with cashew cheese and white bean crust....OMG I ate the whole thing, which is crazy Bc im never like that hungry. Can't wait to come back....","What a great place. Me and my work place come here almost every three weeks at the same time. And they're always ready for us. The waiter was so polite, tall gentleman with long black hair. He was funny and interactive. He sat us outside on a gorgeous day. The beer is great, the atmosphere convinced you to be off your phone and actually care about the person you're eating with. And the chicken sandwich... oh the chicken sandwich. It was so delicious. I'm pretty sure it's popular because he told me they sold out of it that day. Which doesn't surprise me and didn't disappoint anyone knowing how good it is. Rate this place 5 stars for sure!","Really liked this brunch spot! $32/person for a party of 5 with 4/5 of us getting a cocktail (the fifth getting a latte) and an order of table pancakes, in addition to our own entrees. Adorable garden, although the interior of the restaurant is also nice. The avocado toast was large and delicious, as was the side salad it came with. I also appreciated the fact it already comes with a poached egg, instead of having to pay extra for it!The blueberry pancakes we got for the table were DELICIOUS, and I am not normally a sweet brunch eater, and will only have a bite or two. I didn't want to stop eating. Would absolutely get these on the table. Only gripe was that the Bloody Mary wasn't great, I honestly wish I had skipped it. Seemed watered down and lacked the punchy flavor I look for when I order one. All in all, though, I would absolutely recommend Esme for a brunch in Greenpoint!","Came for the blueberry pancakes and will return for the fried chicken sandwich! Esme is super cute and reasonably priced. I came for brunch, so can only speak to that, but the menu was stocked with great options. The pancakes were everything I was promised - thin, slightly crispy on the edges, and beautifully buttery. We also grabbed an order of the fried chicken sandwich and it was wildly good; they add bacon (genius) and an especially delicious sauce. I opted for the brunch punch - it was sweet and had a nice kick. The Bloody Mary was typical Brooklyn style with a little too much horseradish. My only complaint was the service. While I know brunch on a Saturday gets nutty, we waited about 25 minutes for our drinks after we ordered them. I'll be back as I'm sure it was just a busy brunch morning!",Esme
177,"I've been in this city for like six weeks and I'm tired of writing long-ass reviews for pizza, so let's just say L'industrie is the only place I've been to so far where I'm willing to go back for $4+/slice pizza.Also I just ate a sad salad and writing this two sentence review has made me hungry again, dammit.","These must be fake 5 star reviews. Ordered delivery, said 50 min, then updates to 2 hours and 30 min and person there says this is normal. Then told me I was the one who had to call the app customer service to cancel it even though they were the ones that are just incredibly slow and unorganized. Wasted over an hour of my time waiting for these clowns to get there act together. Ended up just walking down the road to Vinnies - way better. Edit: and now the owner is threatening me with saying 'he has all my information', has called me 10+ times and harassing me on WhatsApp and is saying he is going to come to my house. Reporting to police. This guy is obviously unhinged. Had to call the police.","After all the hype this place has been getting, I added it to my bookmarks list.If you're not already in the area, I don't think it's that good of a slice.Their whole thing is they'll do any of their slices or pies to order (they only have regular pies premade and they'll add stuff to it and throw it in the oven for you). I guess on most high traffic days, things will be fresh enough. But when I went, there had to be 6 pies just sitting in their shelf waiting for people to order. It was a hot summer day, so I assume all the gentrifiers went to the beach. Massimo (the owner) didn't seem as friendly as the photos and stories I'd heard made him out to seem. Kinda felt like he was annoyed at everything, but I'll chalk it up to a bad business day.Anyway, I got a margherita and a burrata slice. Both were okay, but nothing extraordinary. Crust was light, but kind of stale. Maybe more time in the oven would've worked in their favor. The burrata slice (which Massimo recommended) was fine, but nothing mindblowing. The cheese was fresh enough though.The space is tiny, so if it's busy (or if there are a bunch of Chads talking about buying pizza and 30 racks for a house party), it'll be annoyingly crowded. Cash only, and no bathrooms either.","Food: 5/5   Price: 4/5  Service 5/5 Ambiance: 4/5  Bang for your buck: 4/5 Recommendations: You have to try the burrata pizza! Put some hot oil on the side to dip your pizza. Would I come back?: Yes! Tips: It's a small pizza place with a few tables. I would recommend getting your pizza to go or making sure that you have a table before you order. Review: We were looking at open houses around the area, and I am so glad we were able to stop by. All of the pizza options start with a red or white pizza base. Then they put the ingredients on based on which slice/pizza you order. The burrata slice is a must-try. With a crispy and chewy base with the creamy, savory burrata on top, it made a red sauce slice (I usually don't like red sauce) one of the best slices of pizza I had in NYC. You can't go wrong with the other slices. Just get the one with toppings you like. You won't be disappointed.",The pizza here is absolutely unreal. Not sure how they do it but the crust is perfectly crispy on the bottom and chewy on the top....BY FAR the best pizza I've had in NY! The place itself is tiny with a few seats inside and a few tables/benches outside. The slices are pretty small so it definitely makes sense to order a whole pie if it's for multiple people. They have red and white pies and the toppings are added fresh. Words honestly cannot express how amazing the pizza here is...just try it for yourself.,"I have to agree, this is definitely one of the best slices in New York!! I love their technique of having their two base pies(red and white) ready to go and then adding fresh topping when you make your order. We had the special prosciutto-hot honey-ricotta slice and New York Slice. Both were fantastic. Not over cooked/not burnt, excellent form. Crust was just right. This is what all New York slices should be like!I can't wait to return for another slice!",L'industrie Pizzeria
178,When I walked in the restaurant it was inviting and the service was nice. Sounds nice and peachy right ? Wrong. The pizza was too soggy and had too much spice. And let me tell you I like spice but this was all the wrong spices put together. The juices from the toppings plus the sauce plus the cheese all spilled out and created this wet soggy glop of doughy depression. Maybe it was just my pizza. Maybe it'll be yours next. But all I can say is it won't be mine next.,"Yo, I came here around 15:30 on a friday and the customer service was horrible. No one paid me any mind when I walked in, and the entire time I spent at the bar drinking. Like no one engaged. Then a couple walked in and put a baby on the bar counter. I got my check and went to Zombie House. This babies at bar trend needs to stop and I need the DOH and licensing to start addressing this. No one is gonna be happy until someone drunk throws a glass at a baby for looking at them wrong.",The place was trash i don't recommend anyone to go there at all they are racist they don't like people of color,"Very cool establishment! My roommate and I went for the first time a couple of weeks ago and we were greeted by the bartender (Mark), who immediately assisted us. Make sure to ask about the drink menu if you are curious, he will be completely honest and won't steer you wrong. I would like to add that he really makes the drinks with love. On the first visit we ate a Margherita pizza and the Nutella bread cake. Both very good! For drinks we had the ""Side Bae"" & ""Left on Read"". Also, you'll find that their drink menu is named after modern terms related relationships and situationships. Very comedic.Tonight was our second visit as we were celebrating a friends Master's degree graduation. Mark remembered us and we asked for the same drinks again since they were so good the first time. This time we ate the garlic knots filled with mozzarella cheese..(Highly Recommend). I had the avocado toast which was great! My friends had no complaints about he food, compliments to the chef! Great place, great food, right by the Q train on Parkside Ave., mixed crowd, they play good music at a reasonable volume, mix of everything. Staff is very persistent on serving customers. Stop by!",Really really really good pizza I must say.I was very impressed.Will definitely be back here and I do recommend you to try it out.,"A friend and I were actually in the vicinity for another one of my favorite food spots. Unfortunately, the kitchen at that spot was inexplicably closed early. So we wandered into Parkside. Their wall-to-ceiling glass panels were open to the air. The music was chill, as was the vibe. We saw pizza on their menu and asked if they were still cooking. Thankfully, they were! Their pizzas are the obvious draw here. It seems like they go all out with their ingredient options which seemed really fresh. We were worried about how fast it would take to make one for us (we were famished) but it turns out that they can fire those bad boys pretty quickly. Our orders came out within minutes and they were perfect. Meanwhile, don't sleep on their drinks. They were great too. #BarTenderGameStrong!Bottom line: There's no downside to this place. Solid food being made late into the night; Great drinks; Sharp looking venue. I'm going back for dessert.",Parkside
179,This place is gross. The chef missed completely. Im starving.74 for cucumbers YuckGentrification at its worst,"As much as it pains me to say this, my dinner at Honey Badger was one of the most frustrating and disappointing culinary experiences I have had in a long time.I was SO excited to try this place after my girlfriend and I had found it while exploring the neighborhood. At the time, we had gone inside and chatted with the owner, who struck me as an exceptionally nice guy.After talking about it for weeks, I finally convinced my girlfriend to take me there for my birthday dinner. We arrived at 7pm and were greeted by a very friendly server who was quick to wipe down the table for us after we remarked that it was extremely...sticky. Not exactly a great way to start off a fine dining experience, but I remained undeterred and excited.We both selected the tasting menu for $74 and, after about 20 minutes, the first course came out - A really delicious, fresh salad. Unfortunately, this is where things started to go downhill. Although I fully understand that everything is made fresh and tasting menus tend to take a while, we were also hungry. After finishing the salad, we sat there for nearly 45 minutes... waiting. Meanwhile, other tables that had come after us were already being served their second course. Weird, but ok, I thought, maybe they got the more expensive Omakase menu and just have more courses. Fair enough, I guess.Still, a full hour into our birthday dinner, we had only had a tiny salad as well as a small bowl of broth with literally one mushroom and one small piece of meat in it. At this point, the atmosphere was really starting to slip. My girlfriend and I were both hungry and had no concept of how much longer we would be waiting for our food. Even worse, as we sat there tired, hungry, and increasingly frustrated, the owner's(?) child was sitting in the kitchen ""playing"" a flute very loudly above the otherwise pleasant music. Why she was allowed to do this is completely beyond me. It was loud, erratic, piercing, ....and just utterly unpleasant. So bizarre.Still, we sat there, helplessly waiting for our third course. At no point did the waitstaff check in on us to see how we were doing or let us know that the food would be delayed. After ANOTHER 45 minutes the third course finally came. Some sort of meat with seagrass on it.Unfortunately, after the first bite, I decided it would be a hard pass for me. This course was so salty that it was hardly edible. My girlfriend, who unlike me had not had lunch that day, scarfed hers down and then asked if she could have mine ""It's awful, but I'm just so hungry"" she said with a pained look on her face.I decided we had had enough. Rather than sit there for presumably another 45 minutes, we would just cut our losses and go eat elsewhere. I waved over the waiter and politely asked for the check, telling him we'd have to be on our way. Another server brought the check, and I was slightly surprised we were charged for the entire tasting menu even though we only had three out of the five courses. (I understand that you pay for the entire menu, not per course, but I had secretly hoped the staff would pick up on the fact that they had made us wait almost a full hour between each course and we had completely lost our motivation and enjoyment - In my view, they could have at least comped the drinks)At no point was there any acknowledgment by the staff that the courses were taking an inordinate amount of time to come out. While waiting for course three, I even went to the Honeybadger website to see if they made mention of this somewhere (they don't). We also were not asked whether everything was to our liking at the end or I could have told them that it wasn't. Alas, with other guests right next to us, I was not going to dispute the check or make a scene.So, a full 2 hours and 15 minutes after sitting down, we ended up paying almost $200 for a small salad, a small soup, the saltiest meat we have ever tasted, and a glass of wine. I'm embarrassed to say we ended up at the $1 pizza joint across the street just for the sake of actually getting some nourishment.This is a long review that I wouldn't ordinarily write, but I am just so utterly disappointed by my experience here. Slightly angry, definitely annoyed (what's with the flute playing??), but mostly just sad and disappointed. I was so very eager to come here (my girlfriend had wanted to go elsewhere and I had to convince her to come here instead) - we were ready to have a great evening and celebrate my birthday, and ended up feeling like we wasted two hours being hungry and burned 200 bucks. It's not even about the money, it's just a special evening that got ruined. I really hope our experience was the exception - It looks like other patrons are having great experiences, but based on tonight, I cannot in good faith recommend coming here.",I had high hopes for this restaurant but was really disappointed.  After the 5 course menu I was still hungry and the replacement options for dietary restrictions were not good.  They replaced pasta was seaweed :(.  The biggest plate was the dessert so I left feeling hungry yet sugared up. I hope the restaurant refines it's menu. Also they are cash only- who carries around that much cash?,"Literally one of the best dinners I've had in my entire life. Honey Badger is an entire experience and everything is honestly impeccable. The decor is warm, inviting, and makes you feel like you're eating at someone's amazing home.We had the pleasure of being taken care of by Fjolla and Junayd, and they are so kind and welcoming. They start the meal by asking if you have any dietary restrictions or dislikes, which I really appreciate.The food: just insane. We chose to do omakase and the wine pairing. I'm telling you, every single thing they brought out was amazing. Have you ever had moose heart? Well now I have, and I'd do it again over and over if it tasted the way this one did. Ingredients are all locally sourced, primarily from the northeast. They tell you about everything you're eating and where it came from. Each dish is unique and well thought out, not only the dish itself, but also the presentation. I don't even want to say everything we had because I feel like I'd ruin your experience even though I know they constantly change their menu, just can't risk me being the reason you've got certain expectations or don't enjoy the excitement of the surprise.Just go, don't think twice, do it.","Ok listen I'm all about experimental innovative food but Honey Badger missed the mark for me. I had the tasting menu ($74) which consisted of the following:0. ""Palate Opener"" - a trio of a spicy flavorful flower, buffalo milk with water pepper sauce and honey-covered twigs. Great starter and really got my expectations up.1. Oyster soup - creamy soup with bits of oysters (at least that's what it tasted like). Oysters were hard to chew and broth was too salty.2. Smoked eel with venison broth and greens - great smoked flavor on the fish. A bit salty and a pretty small portion.3. Goldenberry (?) salad - this was my favorite. And that tells you something when the salad is your favorite part of a $74 tasting menu. The salad had toasted pepitas and greens with vinegary dressing all of which was perfectly balanced. Great dish overall. 4. Pasta - hey, I'm sure it was made with local ingredients and some fancy yolk but it was just pasta with lots of parmesan and oil and some pesto sauce. Very oily.5. Magnolia dessert - it was some version of a magnolia flavored marmalade. Good flavors overall.Did you note that I didn't mention almost any proteins? Well, that's because there almost weren't any. People who got the $120 Omakase menu seemed to have gotten some oysters, a small portion of duck, grasshopper and snails in addition to what we got but they didn't seem too excited about any of their dishes either.Overall, I appreciate the ambiance and the hyperlocal DIY concept of this restaurant but unfortunately, I did not think it was a good value. Especially considering I left pretty hungry with very few proteins on the menu.","Honey Badger was truly one of the best meals I've ever eaten. The many courses served were all delicious and unique in their own way. Somehow, they managed to fill me up as soon as I finished the last course! I felt completely satiated and GOOD! My favorite meal by far was the scallop (see below) It was deliciously creamy, rich, and flavorful. Everything felt fresh and well thought out. The wait staff and the chefs truly care about their jobs, that was obvious. So much care was put into each course. I would highly recommend that everyone who can afford this place should try it out. Not only was the food delectable, but the ambiance was amazing. It felt cozy and warm, had an amazing smell inside, and everything just felt good. If you haven't been to Honey Badger yet, you must go. And tip the waitstaff generously! They really know their stuff .",Honey Badger
180,"They completely ignore request concerning food Allergies.  I explained my food allergies and then asked ""can I eat this?"" about each item on the cafeteria style line. I was told ""yes"" about each item.Thank goodness for my Eppi Pen!I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.If they don't know what's in their food - I wouldn't recommend eating it.",Food is not bad but they have no respect for NYC Emergency Medical Services so they lost my business.....,"I paid $10.89 for: Market Chicken Bowl +Veggie Fried Rice + Sichuan Eggplant + Garlic String Beans.I opened up the cover and they gave me free hairs and very dry food.I contacted the restaurant about voiding my transaction because it was unacceptable. Dead silence..just like when I opened up the cover to the food. What a waste of money and in addition, they aren't customer focus/service competent.","The Wei is amazing and more people need to go. Period. It's probably one of the best fast casual ""make your own bowl"" places out there and their portions are more than generous.I'm pretty picky about good Chinese food and everything that I've tried here is top quality. My favourite combo is the green fried rice, mapo tofu (super legit and delicious, although you can't go wrong with any of the proteins), bokchoy and string beans. Basically this is a no-stress, you get what you order (if not more) quality af place everyone needs in their lives","When I first ate here, I thought that it is the Chipotle of chinese food. Similar idea of ordering. I liked the Wei because it was conveniently located across the street from my University. They were fast paced so even when there was a lot of people, you didn't have to wait long. All their vegan food is clearly labeled. Portions are good too, so I usually could never finish the whole thing. For the base, I usually get their veggie fried rice. For protein, I get the ma-po tofu. And for veggies, I get the garlic string beans, and shanghai bok choy. Lastly, I put extra extra sesame seeds, fresh scallions, and fried crispy shallots. Try this combination or try something different. All I know is that it is gonna delicious.",I actually liked The Wei but idk Im not to hype of about this place anymore. Its good fast food  thats very flavorful. They do have a make your own bowl type of vibe going on which is cool. Its pretty self explanatory you pick the type of rice you would like between jasmine rice and green scallion infused rice which both taste pretty good. Then on to your meat and then veggies. You spend a pretty penny about 11-12$ for a very good portion of good food.,The Wei
181,"Otto burger, I had when I first moved to this area, was fantastic. I saw ""deep fried"" and thought what the what...idk about that. But it was awesome.The next thing I tried was the Fish N Chips and it was incredible. I was craving it tonight, so I ordered it.Absolutely awful. Just completely terrible. I was craving THEIR version of the dish and spent $20 to eat two wet bites and offer it to my roommates before tossing it. Had to order wings from Bonnie's.This is upsetting because they've been so delicious but the fish doesn't even LOOK like it used to. The 4 tenders that they used to make.No seasoning, no flavor and super wet when cutting into it. Almost just like watery fish. The sauces, however, are incredible! Saved those for something else. But disappointed I had to give this up and order from an entirely different restaurant at 9:18pm.","My husband and I went there for brunch, and were pretty let down by the quality of food. He ordered pancakes and I ordered vegan entree, both of which were below average. Wouldn't go back.","The ambience was very nice, hip decor, quiet music. The food was good. However, the water was undrinkable, the wait staff was completely inattentive (never came over to ask how things were) and very difficult to get her attention. Since I couldn't drink the water, I spent a good time trying to get her attention, then ordered a beer but by the time it came, I was almost done with my meal. It was not very busy either. Therefore, I gave a small tip, then saw that they had charged me more than what I wrote as tip. So I called the restaurant to correct this, the server argued with me and once I said that the service was bad the server very rudely hung up on me before I could finish speaking. I had to call back to ensure I was indeed getting my money sent back on my card. Who changes what you write as tip? This is scary.","Saw them on Burgers, Brew & Que.  A deep fried burger?!  Had to check it out.Got here later on a Saturday night around 9:30 after the dinner rush.  A couple of tables had guests with some at the bar also.  Started with the Korzo Ale which is brewed for them by a local brewer so had to try it.  Wasn't too hoppy and had an Amber color. Ordered the Original Korzo Burger.  First, I wouldn't have known it was deep fried as it wasn't greasy.  I ordered it medium and they got it right.  The Langos dough was light and balanced with the meat nicely.  Meat came out medium as ordered and their blend was tasty.  Bacon, cheese, pickles,  and the rest of toppings were perfect. The side Salad was also excellent!I took my time as I didn't want this meal to end.  Looking forward to returning and trying other items but it will be difficult to not order the Original.  My server was friendly and attentive.  Lives up to the ""Best Burger in NYC"" billing and hype!","Interesting menu and food. I would have never gone to this place but since it was suggested, I gave it a shot. I ordered the plate the Trout Quinoa Salad. It was interesting to say the least. It has mesclun greens with quinoa and a their restaurant vinaigrette and with half a trout perfectly pan fried. It was delicious but extra delicious maybe cos' I was starving. I also had a little bit of ale with it. Just a few sips.The reason for the three stars is because the service was really slow even on a non busy Friday night. There were three servers and the kitchen had 2-3 cooks but it took forever to get anything from getting seated to getting a drink. I'm not saying I would never come back here but I wouldn't choose to come here if I had to suggest a place.","Stopped here with a friend while in Brooklyn. It was the first time for both of us. It was pretty empty as it was a early Friday afternoon. Nice decor, cool bar set up, the bartender was really cool and offered us some really cool draft beers. I ordered the fried duck sandwich and my friend got the wrap. I loved the whole smashed potatoes with the skin on and the coleslaw was great! My sandwich was cooked perfectly and the jam that was on it was a perfect accent.",Korzo
182,"Food was delicious but service was a huge downer. 2 things.First, we had reservations at 6pm--fairly early to get a glimpse of the view while we eat our meal. The place was basically empty but the maitre d' sat us at the booth in the back where the sun glare was so strong. During the whole meal, a lot of window seats were empty.Second, it's so disappointing to see that a Michelin star restaurant has servers who never smiles. I came with my boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary and I politely asked the server to take a photo for us. No response but a sigh as if we asked something so difficult. He didn't even bother checking up on us throughout our entire meal. We literally waited 20 min each for the entree and dessert to come out. Spent nearly 500 for a mediocre service with no view. I wouldn't come back here.","The food is good.The service is good, as long as you're willing to wait a while for deserts or the check.But after 4 years of going there, dozens of time, we still never got a table next to the window. Always in the back. It's up the the Maitre D to decide who sits there, and given there is at least one table sitting empty the whole service half of the time we went there, it's becoming impossible to not take it personally anymore. Today there were 5 tables next to the window. Nobody sat on 2 of them the whole service.Very disappointing, killed the fun of going there.","Racist, pretentious restaurant with overrated food. They take advantage of tourists from abroad by upcharging them discreetly. Immoral business practice that needs to learn that having a Michelin star doesn't mean you can do whatever you want.","Some things in life are worth dressing up for, and a visit to the illustrious River Cafe is one of them.  Known around the world as a culinary destination, it's the most enchanted landmark eatery in the City and nestled under the Brooklyn Bridge.  Offering gorgeous views of Manhattan, the setting is boundlessly romantic.  However, they don't rest on their looks alone.  A prestigious roster of chef alums includes Charlie Palmer (Aureole, Crimson & Rye), David Burke (David Burke Kitchen) and Rick Moonen (RM, Oceana); ingredients have always been the finest available, and the kitchen team inherently understands what goes with what.  Succulent pork belly with scallops was a favorite until i discovered the glistening duck breast with sweet potato spatzle.  This restaurant may possibly be my all-time favorite. The words iconic and epic fall short in describing the experience.  If you've never been, make it a bucket list item!","If I could leave less than a one star review I would. My partner made a reservation for us to celebrate our engagement here. On our way to the restaurant we got caught in the rain so we dropped our blazers off and called the restaurant to make sure that it would be fine for us to dine without our jackets. The woman on the phone assured us it would be fine. Upon arriving at the restaurant we were treated with more disrespect than I have ever felt from any restaurant. Ever. The doorman didn't greet us, he just asked us if we had a reservation. He didn't even open the door. When we entered, (the empty cafe) the hostess would not seat us because we were wet. We informed her we had called ahead and were told it would fine, but she didn't even go speak to someone else. She simply made us leave. The deep unkindness with which we were met speaks volumes about this establishment. No number of Michelin stars, no food, no matter how delicious, is worth the disrespect we felt upon stepping foot in the river cafe. Save your money. Eat elsewhere.","We decided to come here after our marriage at city hall to celebrate and we were entirely underwhelmed. The place was extremely stuffy, I expected this, but it was a bit more than I thought it would be. The food was outrageously priced for what it was and as a resident of Brooklyn, I've had so much better throughout Brooklyn and Manhattan. We ordered the scallops, crab cakes, lobster and branzino. All was good, but lacking in flavor. Everyone was there celebrating something and everyone got the same treatment, so we didn't really feel special. It's such a great location, but think the whole place could do with a little modern kick.",The River Café

Alternatively, there is a take out area around the corner which you can order at, then take the food to their backyard. Decided on the Margherita Pizza ($17), which took a little over half an hour to be ready. Meanwhile, took advantage of the outdoor bar at the backyard (cocktails from $10, beers $6-8). Pizza is still hot once we get it back to the table - a soft crust with a layering of mozzarella and tomato sauce. Simple overall but great flavor (and not burnt).Despite the crowd, it wasn't too difficult finding a spot to sit down, nor was it too loud. Would come back during warm weather again, can see it being harder to get a spot when it's cold out.",Roberta's
184,"You ever have one of those days when you are really craving something? Well, I seem to crave soup dumplings very frequently. If I want Shanghainese in Brooklyn, I go to Liu's Shanghai. Their soup dumplings are top notch. I also love their thick noodles with beef.The space is kinda small, but we usually get a table with no wait. The only negative thing is that they don't seem to have high chairs for babies. Yes, after becoming a mother, judging and grading a restaurant for their baby convenience is of major importance.","Liu's has been around in Brooklyn for a long time and I've also neglected coming here as my go-go soup dumpling places are all located in Flushing or Manhattan. I am glad that I came here one evening with my family as the seating was quick fast and the food came out even faster.We ordered the pork and crab soup dumplings which was quite delicious. The skin was incredibly thin and the meat was plentiful. The scallion pancake was nicely done. What out-shined the dinner itself was the Dong Po Pork. Overall, you can get better soup dumplings elsewhere, but if traveling out to Flushing or Manhattan is too much work, Liu's Shanghai will do.","*In Response to Elisa.L's response*----------------------------------1) How can I be considered a racist? I never once brought, or even thought about bringing race into this. Calling me a racist because I'm right is very low and unprofessional, and only furthers proves that I am right. 2) I know it's a family-owned restaurant. I just can't believe that you and your brother are owners because you certainly do not act like it. 3) I was told a certain price on the phone and when I went to pay, I was charged way more than what was agreed upon. Original Updated Review--------------------------I used to come to this place a lot but after last time I'm never coming here again. I placed an order for pickup over the phone on Friday (9th August) & when asked for the total, it seemed a bit high. As I was waiting for my order to be done at the restaurant, I pulled out a menu & noticed that the prices were lower than what they charged me. I let the guy know & he said he will fix it. But then he took my card & charged me the high amount. I asked him why did he do that & he went on rambling ""I'm the owner, I do whatever I want, don't disrespect me like that"". Dude if you're the owner (which I doubt) then what makes you think you have the right to overcharge me? Like what?? I'm never coming here ever again after this! I already found a new Shanghainese restaurant so it's not like I'm not gonna miss the food. Btw, they also have a B rating since NYC discovered that they have cockroaches in the kitchen.","I've been to Liu's Shanghai before but, shame on me, I forgot how GOOD this place is. Actually, it's beyond good. It's some of the best Shanghainese I've ever had, and I love that this is a family-run establishment.This place is PACKED even on lazy Sundays in Bensonhurst. Why? Because everyone loves this place. When the food is this good, you don't mind waiting 25 minutes for a table in a tiny restaurant. In reality, I wouldn't mind waiting an hour. This is the stuff dreams are made of.If you're considering Liu's, you've probably heard about their soup dumplings and I'm here to tell you that they are worthy of the hype. Whoever is in the back making these precious pouches? I love you. I don't know who you are, but you are amazing. I would hug you if I could.Everything else here is amazing too. We split the Beef with Scallion which was perfectly executed with the most tender beef, as well as the Ma Po Tofu, tofu in a spicy chili sauce with minced pork. I loved this tofu. Every bite was perfect.Everyone who served us was warm, friendly, and helpful. It felt like we were eating with family, because we were! I love that the family runs this show together.If you haven't been here yet, you're missing out!","This is a great neighborhood restaurant with a strong local following.There isn't much seating inside and it seems like visiting after 7pm might not be a good idea.  Even before 7pm, I needed to wait 30 mins for a table.  There are many items on the menu which were unique and pretty good.  The scallop and crab meat soup dumplings were definitely very unique for sure.  I've had plenty of soup dumpling whereby the crab meat was a mere on topping on top of a pork meatball, but here that is not the case.  There is at least one bay scallop in each dumpling and evidence of crab meat was clear in each bite.  I'm not sure I dig the heightened seafood-ness but I can't say it wasn't unique.  I polished off a steamer tray of soup dumplings very quickly.The chicken fried chow mein was a big noodle portion and also well executed.  There could have been more sliced chicken on the plate but there was no denying the crispy-ness of the noodles.  This dish was topped with gravy filled with plenty of carrots, broccoli, snow peas, baby corn, mushrooms and bamboo shoots.As for the fried wontons, I think I enjoyed the sauce that was ladled on top more than the wontons themselves.  The wontons themselves weren't very crispy after it was drowned by the sauce.  This was another yet unique dish and definitely worth a try.Finally the last item I tried was the Five Spice Beef which was incredibly dry and was the least favorable item ordered.  The food came out super fast after ordering and service was super friendly.  There is only one restroom so keep that in mind if you need it.","I'm so torn about this review because there is a lot of nostalgia for Liu's and a family-run business for the neighborhood is an endlessly appealing idea to me. I've been coming here since I was a little girl for their incredible soup dumplings and various other delicious Shanghainese specialities. However, in recent years it seems the quality of the food, especially the soup dumplings, have gone seriously downhill. The past several times I have ordered the crab and pork xlb, I've noticed that the wrapper is doughy and mushy, breaking apart as soon as I picked it up. This is indicative of the soup dumplings being frozen beforehand and if this is the quality of what they're serving, I might as well just get a box of xlb from Trader Joe's and eat at home. It breaks my heart because once upon a time, Liu's served the most delicately wrapped, juiciest xlb around--it's my sincere hope that they bring that iteration back.It's charming, for sure-- the space is the size of a living room and the staff are nice too. There are also some dishes that have remained consistently excellent all these years, most notably their kau fu (braised wheat gluten) that is jam-packed with savory goodness and generously portioned. I'll keep coming back for that but I'll pass on the xlb.",Liu's Shanghai
185,"Always amazing!!!! There is never a thing we do not enjoy or is bad here! The only thing I would say this trip was the borscht could have had a bit more flavoring or filling, but was still good.",Over and over again I go there to have one and only -Korzo burger (Sinfully delicious) - organic juicy fresh meat deep fried burger ! Can't get the same anywhere else..,"Beet salad delicious with nuts goat cheese pepitos , the chef burgermade of grass fed beef organic . My fish and chips not traditional with sauces yellow squash veg side grilled with chips . Dessert a beet carrot pie with vanilla bean ice cream",This place is a Bay Ridge gem. The service is exquisite and the backyard patio is perfect for a sunny day. I choose a different item off of the menu every time I dine here. The presentation of each plate is an art form in itself full of a variety of beautiful colored vegetables. The food is always fresh and delicious.Not to mention beets on everything!,"Have to be honest about this place... and I don't mean to be disrespectful or insulting to the other positive reviews, as I'm sure they've garnered respect and were created honesty, but to start off with the negative - the burger - it was really not that great. It wasn't awful, but it was certainly not ""the best tasting burger in NY,"" which is a damn bold claim.So that out of the way, the atmosphere is nice, the menu is well put together, and the beet-based food/theme is very cool. Personally I'm a big fan of beet-driven food. For instance, the beet ketchup here is great.Service is so-so, borderline uncomfortable though, as the people waiting on our table were a bit sloppy and disgruntled, which threw off the whole experience a bit.Yes, going full circle with the review. The biggest problem for me with the burger was the deep fried dough/bun, which tasted like an uncooked greasy doughnut surrounding a hunk of meat that just tasted like salt. On top of that, the dough was actually sweet like they had previously deep fried doughnuts or some dessert, and that old oil musk just permeated the whole thing. Really off-putting to be completely upfront, and I hope that's not been the experience for everyone else.Ultimately though, beyond my burger griping, after some time I'll be back to try another burger and see if I just happened to be there on a bad day.","The praise this place gets for its burgers is not unearned.I don't normally gush about a place after a single visit; but this place has without a doubt the best burger I've had, dethroning even an old favorite of mine, BK Jani.I walked into this place on a rainy Wednesday night. Despite the off peak hours, the cramped space was still packed with well to do yuppies. Still, despite it's size, there was a certain comfort to the space... Like a rustic living rooom.I ordered the korzo burger, and at 19 dollars I can say it's a good value. You get a masterfully made burger, fries, a small side of vegetables and coleslaw and each item on the plate was crafted with a special care, not one of them being treated as an afterthought as one would expect.Should the day ever come, I'll be sure to bring dates here.",Brooklyn Beet Company
186,The line for this stand can get to be very long.  Standing in the sun waiting for a lobster roll is not the most ideal. You can order online and pick it up at the window for some convenience.  It seems like its a little over priced for what you get.  The meat was a little dry but very tender.  It reminded me of dry pulled pork that is cold.  It could have used a tad bit more butter to bring out the taste.,Gross. They have gone downhill. Lobster and crab rolls were so cold. Just defrosted i guessCrab roll was mostly the debris vs actual crab meat. See picture. Save your money. Go to shake shack across thebwayI guess they realized that they can make more $$ as a tourist trap,"They're running a $14 lobster roll deal until October 1st! How can you say no to that?Granted, that also means that their lobster rolls are normally prohibitively expensive for a normal meal, especially with their diminutive size. But they are tasty and loaded with lobster chunks. I think Red Hook Lobster Pound edges them out, but only slightly.This location is more of a shack near the water, so you can pick something up to eat on the pier. But they also deliver!",PDG--pretty damn good.  Also expensive.  But they have an excellent gluten free game for a little outdoor stand.We had walked over the Brooklyn bridge earlier and were overdue for lunch.  Our daughter had clued me in earlier in the day that Luke's had GF rolls. Whoopie!  I get to have a Lobster Roll.  We were at the Jersey Shore the day before and we ate somewhere with lobster rolls but they didn't have the GF bread.  I had a nice salad but it wasn't the same. Luke's staff was very careful to make sure my roll wasn't toasted on the same part of the grill as the regular bread.  Also not to butter it.  So I had a lobster roll and a canned cider and my hubs had a crab roll and a canned beer.  Total was a  little over $50.00.  I mean it was delicious but not 50.00 delicious so that's why only 4 stars.,We bought 2 lobster rolls. Each was around $17 (around 20 with tax) which we thought was overpriced for its size. My lobster roll did have a few shells in it. We weren't fans of the herbs used on top of the lobster but thats up to preferences. The location on the other hand is nice. It's a little shack near the Brooklyn bridge with outdoor seating on the side (if you don't mind the pigeons).,"The best lobster roll in NYC!  My favorite Luke's Lobster location.  This location is more of a shack near the water, so you can order food and walk over to the pier and eat it outdoors and get some sun.   There's nothing like eating some delicious lobster and being closer to nature.  Being outside, Walking around the park and and enjoying scenic water views.  So relaxing.  It's like being on a micro mini vacation.Now on to the yummy stuff.  I usually get the Luke's Trio sampler (lobster, shrimp, & crab 1/2 rolls), plus a drink and a side and/or soup.  Lobster rolls are stuffed with fresh from Maine, a 1/4 lb of lobster claw, knuckle, and leg meat.  A bit of mayo on bun and topped with warm lemon butter and secret seasoning.  Just the way I like it.  You can really taste the freshness of the sweet lobster meat.  Crab roll is pretty tasty too.  Very fresh.  The shrimp roll is just okay for me.  There is nothing wrong with it.  It's just not a favorite.  Download the Luke's Lobster app.  For every five visits spending $10 or more, you will earn a free lobster roll. You will also get a free shrimp roll on your birthday.There is indoor seating area in the back of the shop but you have to enter through the rear door.

187,"Ugh. The whole thing was bad. Got mezze, the variety and taziki. First of all the variety of dips came smooshed together in one single container, indistinguishable from each other. The mixture was also floating in a tub of oil. The tazkiki was watery and also floating in a tub of oil. There was also a hair in it. VOMIT. The pita was cold and hard. Update: tried to eat it, was inedible.",I waited TWO hours for delivery.  Never came.  I called and said it would take another 40min .  Unacceptable.,"The worst customer service I have ever experienced! I worked many years in the restaurant business, so I am usually extremely understanding and sympathetic with servers, hosts, etc. I was appalled by the rudeness I experienced on the phone with Zatar's employee.I placed an online order and waited for a confirmation email which said would send. 15 minutes go by and I receive no email, but the charge had already shown up on my bank account. So I called the number provided to see if my order was received and at least in the process of being made, and was immediately met with an extremely rude, impatient man who told me to ""let him do his job because he is slammed right now."" He said my order never came through and said to take it up with ChowNow, which is the ordering service that Zatar provides directly on their website. I tried asking him more questions about my order, and he interrupted me and then hung up the call! I am beyond shocked and horrified at this customer service. I was recommended to try this restaurant, and this was the first impression they gave me. Am I not an ""important enough"" paying customer to him? Is taking my order not part of his job?!I eventually found the ChowNow phone number (which was never provided throughout the ordering process, only Zatar's). I called and they were very nice and refunded my money.","A Cold and rainy Monday has led me to Zatar. A lot of places are closed on Monday in this area. I tried Yemeni Soufflé and it's amazing! Flavorful with a lot of sautéed veggies and minced beef. Pita bread is soft, chewy, and perfect to scoop up the soufflé. Huge portion, affordable price, and friendly service.","So this was my 2nd time here, and it was even better than the First. This quaint traditional Mediterranean restaurant keeps its customers surrounded by positivity. I love all the uplifting mantras and anti-hate messages on the walls and ceiling. Now for the moment we've all been waiting for..... The Food.Absolutely outstanding. Authenticity at its finest.

The vibes are really chill , the chef even plays the dopest hip hop jams all while whippin da pot like a true Brooklyn G!Zatar even has free WiFi , if you're in to that sort of thing,  because some people would rather take pics of their food than actually eat it ‍ j/k snap away Anyways yeah....

Every dish was outstanding!

The space is comfy and casual (and there was no line on a Sunday morning!)Simply delicious!",Zatar
188,"Ordered takeout from here and it was only about 15 minutes for a Beef Soft Tofu Soup. The soup also came with rice and small sides of kimchi and pickled veggies (I think cucumber and carrot). The soup wasn't very flavorful or spicy. It had a significantly mild taste. I'm not sure if they have the option to make it spicier, but we weren't asked what spice level we desired. The beef within the soup also wasn't good. It wasn't soft, seemed like it was cooked too long, and also slightly burnt. The beef also wasn't in small portions, it was a large chunk that didn't come apart easily as most of it was held together with hard to chew fat/tendon. Very disappointed in the dish.I'll probably give the place a couple more tries since it's the only Korean place around this area, but expectations are low.","We tried to like this place, we really did.  My fiance and I came here for early dinner on a weeknight as a treat and hoping to eat some delicious Korean food.Two servings of kimchi and picked radish banchan arrived shortly after we were seated but to our discovery, it was stale tasting and had lost its crunch/bite.  It was a forewarning as to the remainder of our meal. To start, we ordered Truffle Parmesan fries, Bulgogi Nachos and 6 pcs of Soy Garlic wings.  They ""ran out"" of Bulgogi Nachos at 6:30 pm.  The wings were overdone; the fried batter could have taken out a tooth.  Only one out of the six piece wings order was actually a wing. The Truffle Parmesan fries were the safest thing to eat, although I barely tasted any truffle. For our mains, my fiance ordered a Jeyook Dolsot Bibimbap (pork shoulder) and I ordered the Galbi BBQ entree.  The server came out with a Jeyook Tofu Kimchi entree instead of the Jeyook Dolsot Bibimbap and didn't realize it until we brought it to her attention.  Dolsot bibimbap is not the same as meat served with rice on the side.  The Galbi is supposed to be short rib ... but there was no bone and it tasted like overdone, chewy flank steak.The server was nice overall, but it just reflects poorly on management and lack of training at this place.  There were at most five tables seated (including ours) the entire time we were there, so it's impossible to attribute this sub-par experience to the chaos of running a busy restaurant.  The glass which my yuzu lemonade was served in was cracked and very obvious to the naked eye.  We won't be coming back, especially when the beer and fries were the ""best"" things we had and so many things went awry. It's unfortunate I happen to be a stickler for details... is there a reason why the only Korean characters that appear on the menu is on the Soup category??","I ordered delivery from the Yelp app and got Kimchi Fried Rice and Soy Garlic Chicken. The chicken was delicious. Addictive even. I finished that easily! The kimchi fried rice on the other hand... was very different.I don't call myself an expert in Korean food, but I feel like I've been to enough Korean restaurant and ordered kimchi fried rice at many to know what it should taste like. And this was very different from all of them. The kimchi didn't taste fresh, but a couple of days old. It the meat wasn't tender. The egg was cooked all of the way through instead of being a bit yolky. Overall this was a disappointing experience for me.","I came here with my friend for lunch after walking by and seeing how cute it looked on the inside. The restaurant has a rustic interior barn feel to it and has community tables with a few private tables against the wall.We both ordered our meals from the Lunch Specials menu, which had a very special selection. My friend ordered the Kimchi Fried Rice with Bulgogi and it looked very good. It came with 2 sunny side up eggs. I should've asked her what she thought of it, but I hadn't seen her in ten years and so we were busy catching up :). I had the Kimchi Fried Rice with Chicken Wings and I thought it was delicious and satisfying. The chicken wings were sweet and sticky. I normally like my food to be savory, but the wings were an exception. My order has 1 sunny side up egg. The service was fast and friendly. When we arrived, the place was empty and it was still empty when we left. It was odd because we came here in the middle of lunchtime. Nevertheless, I love this place.Will definitely return when in the area!","Inconsistent!I came here on Wednesday of this week, hadscallion pancakes which were crisp, super light, not greasy and very flavorful.Today (two days later) I thought since the scallion pancakes were so good, I'd order the kimchi pancakes. They came out, over cooked on the outside and flouryrubbery and greasy. I sent them back & the waiter kindly agreed to have some more more. Another order came out and they were the same. By this time I was over it. I paid my check and left.Really wanted this place to be good! Alas","Decent Korean food that's a bit pricey. My friend and I ordered three appetizers since the reviews for this place are pretty mixed. The truffle Parmesan fries were very crispy and overall tasted good. They could've been more generous with the truffle and Parmesan though, since the flavor wasn't that strong compared to other ones I've had. The spicy rice cakes were passable. The rice cakes were a bit too soft for this type of dish, and overly chewy because of that. The sauce tasted different from other ones I've had but it's not bad. The seafood pancake was probably the best out of the three. It was crispy yet soft, and not mushy at all -- the perfect consistency! The seafood inside was also well cooked, and the sauce was great. Overall, everything tasted okay but it's pretty pricey for the quality of the food. The restaurant is pretty cute though and it wasn't busy at all on a Saturday night.",SSAM
189,This is my go to spot for REAL hot cacao!Their caldo ix soup is bomb!This place is a hidden gem.,"The rosemary churros are to die for, but their ""matcha latte"" is the most expensive cup of hot milk I've ever been pranked with :(","Smooth dark coffee, not bitter. If you come early you can get the almond croissants, very limited, and not too sweet.Hot chocolate made from raw chocolate, add a little spice and float away in it. Most of NYC has never tasted this.The row of pastries calls me but I can't answer them right now. This will cone in time I am sure. No one tells me where or when, I know it will last forever.","Came in for brunch by myself. They only have one menu, and it has plenty of variety to soothe my need for Sunday brunch. Had huevos rancheros, and crazy corn in a cup. I LOVED the crazy corn.Services is friendly, food is great, and they are letting me sit here and chill with a nice cup of coffee.","Quick recap: this is a soup spot at the end of the day. If you know caldo de pollo and other Latin soups, this is your spot. Clean, friendly, delicious overall. This place gives you chips and ... black beans. May sound different, but trust me, it's delicious. Service isn't the fastest but it's ok. It's a small joint with good food. Got the sandwich with turkey and avocado which was a mistake. It wasn't bad, but their bread is not sandwich friendly. A bit too chewy. The soup my friend got however, was delicious. It had corn, carrot, and rice in there with chicken. Squeeze some lime in there and hot damn. So good. If you like trying new things, this is worthy of a try.","Ix's was pretty close to the AirBnB we stayed at and we walked here for brunch one day. The minute we walked in we knew we had not made a mistake. The restaurant was lightly fragrant of spices and immediately made you feel warm inside.I really wish we could remember which soup/stew we ordered because it was honestly the star of the show. I think it was the Caldo Tlalpeno rojo. It was warm and savory-filled with vegetables and shredded chicken it was plenty filling.We ordered the TPC sub which was a sandwich with chicken, peanut, coconut cream, ginger, cilantro, and pickled carrots. This was okay...I would recommend sticking with the soup.We shared both of these items and it was more than enough food for the both of us. We would have been plenty full on the soup alone! Really nice people and really great soup!",Ix Restaurant

When I asked the waiter to take it back so that I can order something else, she rudely told me that the Manager has to give authorization to take the meal off of the bill.

Yes, I said jerk chicken AND oxtail!The pizza definitely did not disappoint. Flavor was robust & pizza was on point (as what a NYC pizza should be!!!). I was actually longing for this pizza for days after eating here... Oh pizza, how I miss thee!Oh yeah, can't forget the edamame with truffle oil. Yes, you read that right - truffle oil! And what a difference that makes!","Interesting pizza combinations/flavours.We tried the oxtail pizza, the jerk chicken and the South American.All very interesting.I found the oxtail overwhelming but my friend loved it. Can't really say much to fault it or otherwise.They had a good cocktail menu aswell.Service was good aswell.",If you want to try a Caribbean spin on pizza this is the place to go. It's a cute spot off Flatbush. I went here during the week but I'm pretty sure it gets crowded here on the weekends. I tried the Flatbush wings to start and shared the bake and salt fish pizza and the oxtail pizza. Both were good but the oxtail pizza is better. Also more than enough food for two people.

They have a variety of beers on tap. My wife and I travel all the way from Washington Heights to hang out on Fridays, some Saturday nights and we frequent brunch there. It's a bonus that it is also a Rugby friendly bar. Definitely worth checking out!!!","We greatly enjoyed our first visit to The Douglass Public House, or The Douglas as it also seems to be known. We were hungry, and with this establishment residing just a block away, it was calling to us! So, we decided to give it another try on this Sunday evening. Last time we ate here, it was very busy, prompting us to make a quick online reservation. As it happened, it wasn't necessary on this visit.Service was very good, and we ordered our dinners: * Plain Jane Burger (with Swiss): Custom Pat LaFrieda blend and build your own burger from over 20 toppings* Personal Chicken Pot PieWe very much like the friendly pub ambience here and enjoyed the open windows on this warm evening. Our dinners arrived within about 10 minutes, and we found the burger to be perfectly cooked, and the chicken pot pie to be delicious. There were large chucks of chicken in a lovely sauce, with potatoes and carrots underneath a tasty puff pastry.Great comfort food - just what you would hope to find at a local pub. We look forward to our return.","This was the first time in this area of Brooklyn, so we Yelped some restaurants and arrived at The Douglas. It has a pleasant pub type atmosphere, and we were please to be provided an immediate table by the window.  The service was excellent and we opted for the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup, and a build your own burger with fires. Yes, this would not exactly qualify as a low cal meal! While waiting for our dinners, we were able to take in the old tin ceiling, and rustic pub ambiance of this restaurant. And we liked what we saw. Our food arrived quickly, and the cheeseburger was fantastic, one of the best burgers we've had in some time. It was perfectly cooked (medium - as in pink, warm and juicy in the middle). The fries were hot and crispy. The grilled cheese sandwich arrived in three halves (1.5 sandwiches) that accompanied the tomato soup. The soup was slightly spicy and very tasty, thick and creamy. The sandwich was delicious, hearty and filling. We happened to arrive on the early side, around 4:30. By the time we left, a line was forming, as this seems to be a very popular place. If you're looking for comfort food, check this place out. We'd be happy to return.",The Douglass Public House
192,I've been going here for over 40-years and it's consistently delicious.  The roast beef with au jus is just scrumptious and the fries are to die for.  Parking is a little tough but worth hunting around for a spot if the B & C lot is full.,The food was awful they do not know how to cook well done roast beef or medium well either . I had to send mine back 3 times until they understood what well done means.   The food was rare .  The  cooks are terrible.  The waiters how ever were very nice.  Then I got home and was sick to my stomach from what I ate . Never again!!!!!!!!!I will go to Roll N Roaster. I do not know how this place ever got 5 stars.,"People have nostalgic love for this place, its a place I don't remember coming to as a kid. My wife's grandparents lived in this neighborhood and she's been here before.Walking up to the outdoor window, it's Brooklyn all the way. You see the guys with this huge pan of Au Jus, dipping away at their sandwich creations. I ordered the OG sandwich, the roast beef on a roll. The roll is something we're all accustomed to, its a typical kaiser roll you'd get at your local NY deli. But that roast beef.. The roast beef is fresh and cooked medium rare. They put a piece of American Cheese on the roll, fresh roast beef and then they pour on the Au Jus. The taste? It doesn't get any better. I've been to Louis Lunch in Connecticut, its kinda snobby and they don't serve ketchup. This is Brooklyn! I mean, Brennan & Carr didn't invent the roast beef sandwich but they've been around forever and the price point is cheap. If you're a die hard Brooklynite, forget L&B, you need to come to Brennan & Carr for a proper roast beef sandwich.","I've been eating my way through the famous places in Brooklyn, was in the area and this place was on my list. I had the Gargulia burger ""all the way"" meaning dipped AND broth on top so you have to eat it with a knife and fork.Delicious! The burger was cooked on a flat top so you got that crispy carmelization and the roast beef was a perfect medium rareThe sautéed onions were soft and sweet but not burnt and the melted cheese was just enough. The soft roll was made even softer by the broth.My only complaint was that I couldn't eat another one. I will definitely be back.Ps-It's cash only.",YUMMY! The roast beef sandwich is tasty stuff! I had them put the broth on the side as I don't like soggy sandwiches. I am really glad I did. I was able to to enjoy the tender perfectly cooked beef on it's own. The broth was extremely tasty but a bit salty for my taste. As I side I ordered the Corn Fritters and those were just the right thing to round out my lunch. Next time I am in Brooklyn I plan on a return visit to sample their clam chowder and onion rings. I would also try the french fries but I noticed they were under cooked for my liking. Hopefully they won't mind making them well done.Some may feel the interior is a bit outdated but I thought it was rather quaint and told the story of a restaurant that had been visited and enjoyed by many over the years.,"There comes a time when one proclaims the hyperbolic, ""this is better than sex"", and means it. With Brennan and Carr, this is truly the case, but don't worry - you have 0 chance of getting anyone pregnant and no contraceptive needed. One can't argue against the yonic (real word, look it up) feel/texture of the B&C's roast beef, but what do I know, I'm a gay man who loves hot dogs. But if my sexual proclivities leant me towards the opposite sex, I'd be coming here for a release every now and then.I had read about Brennan & Carr's from a ""street walking tour"" book by a fellow Brooklynite, but I, a Sunset Park boy born-and-raised, rarely made trips out this far South. I was pleasantly surprised by all of the proclamations of fandom from my social media feed when I fielded general interest in Brennan & Carr's - it was unanimous, save for a few internet trolls: this was the real deal.I parked my bike on Nostrand while trying to find the entrance to this humble restaurant - it's a stone stand-alone building at the corner intersection of Ave U x Nostrand Ave, and has an accessibility entrance in the back. While I originally planned to have a sit-down meal, I was intrigued by the counter service outside where a larger gentleman was already scarfing down a handful of fries and sandwich. I figured I'd stand outside by the counter and save myself the tip money.The menu was impressively simple - variations of a few things. I waited at the window and peered in to see a cozy waiting service style establishment; a sign proclaiming ""Sit Down Service Only"" and waitstaff in white coats. I asked what they were famous for, and though the ""Gargiulo Burger"" which was claimed to be a roast-beef a-la french onion soup style by a fellow Yelper, I went with the original and a slice of blueberry pie, no ice cream this time (this autumn was the coldest we'd seen yet). As I waited and put my hands on the counter, they came back a bit sticky - strange because I thought it was just water. When I opened my sandwich to go, I realised what it was - the broth they had used to cook the roast beef. They DID NOT skimp on it when making my roast beef. Before I begin, let me precursor this with the fact that I had been in the dark ages before this sandwich. I always avoided roast-beef sandwiches that came with catering due to the inevitable dryness and thick cuts. Brennan and Carr opened my eyes to the true holiness that is a roast beef sandwich - thinly sliced, tender and moist, and dripping with juice. When I took my first bite, it tasted like a home I had forgotten about. Wow, was it good, and the pink rawness in the middle gave me a semi. I was not ready to give it up, but I couldn't stop eating. I realised immediately this had to become a new regular stop for me on my bike route, and that this was the start to something good.P.S. I only ate the pie when I got home, but the blueberry was AMAZING. The crust was beyond belief, flaking in the best of ways, and it was without a doubt, the lard that made the difference. Vegans/vegetarians beware, this is not the place for you.",Brennan & Carr
193,Always solid spot for some thing Frenchie all though it's a huge shame they don't sell their seared  chicken  anymore. Still it's a good spot for a date and escape the craziness of the rest of Williamsburg Been around for years and probably will be for a long time still.,"The strategy: go with another person, split the pancakes because they take an hour to bake, and get 2 entrees. Sorry loner people. Or, if you're a loner, you should shamelessly get the pancakes + an entree and have a little feast. Whatever you do, get the baked pancakes. They're some of the best I've had. Crispy edges and sooo fluffy. Tried the eggs benedict with bacon which is a no fail. Sort of regretting not trying the confit or the lamb sausage, but I'm coming back for those pancakes again.","Came twice. The first time (Sunday brunch) they forgot to put our order in a system so we simply waited for an hour to get our eggs. No apologies, hostess/manager just walked away.  I decided to come on Monday next week to see if it was just a busy Sunday. We ordered eggs Benedict and their famous pancakes. 10 minutes later they brought COLD eggs trying to tell me that they have to be room temperature but they were just COLD. after I told them that, they put them in a microwave to heat it up a bit. AGAIN. IN A MICROWAVE. Pancakes were just too overage. Nothing special. Just don't waste your time on this place.","Bro.. this is my new favorite brunch spot right now. We came here over the weekend and I fell in love. It has the broken down artisan feel to it, with wooded furniture, tables and the like. Right off the bat, the waitress gave us the scoop on those famous pancakes, so we decided to add it to our orders. I had the Eggs Norwegian and the wife had the Avocado Tartine, both amazingly delicious. The special surprise was the pancakes, the pictures are highly deceptive, because these are huge! They are densely packed with flavor, amazing and extremely filling. This is for sure a top tier brunch spot, that will have you wanting to come back. I'm definitely in Love with this place and I just came here once.","So I was really surprised with my experience here after getting recommendations from friends and seeing all these positive reviews. My friends and I came here around 11AM on a Saturday for brunch and the place was pretty full but we were able to get a seat right away. We were brought to a small circular table that had 2 extra chairs at it and a baby stool. Sort fo weird they didn't clear that all, but no big deal. We just moved it all out of the way so we could get around the table more comfortably. Our order was taken fairly quickly.  It took a while for our food to come out so when it arrived we were really hungry. It was all cold. My avocado toast with a poached egg had clearly been sitting for a while. The egg was cold and a little overcooked, the toast had that weird soggy sensation toasted bread gets when it has been sitting with something on it for a bit, and my friend's dishes were about the same. MY friend's french toast was burnt, not inedible, but clearly burnt. We had to ask for syrup because it was never brought out. My other friend's dish was cold and towards the end of eating it, she bit into an egg shell on her poached egg. It was a rather large piece and kind fo got stuck in her throat for the rest of the day. You know when you swallow something sort of sharp and you can feel it for a while? It was like that. We waited so long for our food to begin with, we didn't want to complain about everything being cold and burnt but once she bit into that egg shell, we knew we had to say something. She spoke with the manager who didn't seem to be very bothered but did take her entree off the bill. I was really surprised by this experience and I just felt like if they tried a little harder, this could really be good. Maybe they were having an off day but my friend described a similar experience here a few months ago with burnt french toast. She chalked it up to an off day but this maybe is a more regular thing....They are known for their enormous stack of giant pancakes, so maybe that's all they really can do well? Hard to say. Won't be back to find out.","I came here on Sunday around 3pm with my boyfriend and we were seated immediately! They don't take reservations so I'm not sure how the wait situation is during peak brunch hours. - Spinach & Goat Cheese Croissant: Simple and delicious. Didn't feel heavy at all. There was a perfect amount of goat cheese. The spinach was sauteed with garlic. No complaints on the warm toasted croissant and sunny side up eggs. - Pancakes: Put in the order before doing anything else! It took a whopping 45 mins to arrive but it was well worth it. The pancakes came fresh hot out of the oven with a nice crisp baked top. Unlike your standard pancakes, these were bouncy and pillow soft. The strawberry butter was shocklingy delicious we had to order extra. I ate until I almost passed out. I also had a mimosa which was pleasant. The pancakes were definitely the most memorable part of our meal. It can easily be shared between 4 people. I am glad we didn't order a 3rd entree. I highly recommend these place for brunch!",Le Barricou
194,"I was looking forward to finally trying Fob. We ordered the corn bibingka and sisig w/ extra egg for starters, inasal chicken, side dishes rice and tomato with salted egg. Since it was hot, a mango and ube shakes. The bibingka was good. Not dry or sweet. The queso puti was fresh and went well with the corn. The sisig was ok, nothing special. The bibingka and sisig as starters were out of place. They sort of come in the middle and end of the meal since the bibingka was sweet and sisig is 'ulam'. The disappointments were the shakes and chicken. Inasal chicken is usually flavorful down to the bone with very little need for side condiments. Fob's chicken was plain, dry and bland. The mango and ube shakes were also bland. Not refreshing, something we needed on this hot summer day. Garlic rice and tomato with salted egg were ok.Service was fine, good thing for limited seating. There is a lot of foot traffic with people and rude, bad body odor delivery guys food pick ups. I'm not sure if my expectation was too high or I should've kept it realistic. Either way I don't think Fob is a return for us. Not a recommendation.","FOB is a filipino restaurant that bills itself a bbq joint. The decor was cute, but on this humid July day, there was no AC. We ordered a Sisig to start, filipino bbq, ribs, chicken adobo, pork belly. A ""pitcher"" of lemongrass cucumber with lime, hoegaarden and vermouth, an ube and a mango shake. The Sisig was tasty. Everything else was tasty as you would expect filipino food to be. BUT...The portions to price ratio is ridiculous. The sisig was in a 6"" diameter cast iron pan no more than an inch or so deep for $10. The bbq chicken was 2 skewers. $18. There were 5 ribs about 4 inches for $18. About two pieces of chicken in the adobo $18. The pork belly was probably the most generous. There was a ""CC"" charge (probably not surprised to see that these days, but a little warning woulkd have been nice). Total bill was over $140! for filipino food! I won't be back. I'll go to my tried and true filipino places where I can get bbq skewers much larger for about $4. I'm not coming back.","I was extremely excited to try this place but Unfortunately, I was left disappointed. The Ube shake was delicious but sangria tasted nothing more than just beer. We ordered 3 main entreees, with some side dishes. The chicken came out raw & service was subpar. He was unapologetic, just simply took the chicken and said he'll have it cooked more. At this point we've cut into them already to see if they were both raw and they were. I'm surprised that the waiter decided to take the chicken back to recook it instead of a new dish or asked us if we would like a whole different dish. Never had that happen to be before at any other restaurant (and everyone can have a off day, even Chefs). However, the Chicken came back dry & burnt at this pt we gave up &left it as is and wanted to just finish dinner so we can leave. Garlic rice was a huge disappointment as well, no garlic flavor and all the other dishes were bland.","One of the most memorable meals I've had to date was at Fob Brooklyn. It was a beautiful day and a group of us wanted to enjoy a kamayan feast in Fob's backyard space. You would never guess that an expansive respite from the city chaos exists just beyond their cute little restaurant, but it's one of the best kept secrets of the neighborhood. The moroccan blue printed rug, hanging potted plants, and long dining table make the place feel like you're in a tasteful friend's backyard space. I've never been in a commercial outdoor area that felt this cozy.If you haven't had the pleasure of enjoying a kamayan feast yet, Fob is a great place to start and will set the bar very high for you. Their lavish spread is replete with crab, barbequed pork, chicken skewers, grilled fish, salted egg, and refreshing salad. As a pescatarian, I often refrain from meat heavy communal feasts like this but there was plenty for me to eat, and it was all so, so delicious. The coconut rice that all this meat sat on was the cherry on top. Get your friends together, pick a temperate day, and prepare to get your hands dirty for one of the most epic feasts you can have in Brooklyn.",Food was alright. Never would've guessed it was Filipino food.The service was pleasant and the halo halo above average. But the overall atmosphere was pleasant. An OK dining experience. Probably will try elsewhere.,"Came by for brunch on a warm, beautiful Saturday just before the end of summer. It was the perfect day to sit and eat outside @ FOB's homey, cozy backyard. Between the ambiance and the comfort food, I truly felt like I was casually over at a Filipino friend's house eating their grandma's homecooked food. Couldn't get any better than that!All of the silogs seemed delicious - I had trouble choosing just one. I ended up going with the Adosilog ($16) while my boyfriend went with the Liemsilog ($18). We also shared an ube shake and avocado shake ($6.50/each). The Adosilog (adobo chicken) was incredibly tender but way too salty for me - too heavy on the soy sauce. I wonder if I would've preferred the southern style over this. The garlic rice was so good though as well as the complimenting fried egg. I just wish the chicken wasn't as salty as it was... I barely used the side of gravy that came with it. I should've gone with the BBQ-Silog instead, which would've came with grilled chicken skewers.The Liemsilog (grilled 72-hour marinated pork belly) was AMAZING omg. The char and smokiness of it proved that it came straight off the grill, and it reminded me of Vietnamese style pork chops which I love. Aromatic and delicious. Would definitely recommend this.The shakes were refreshing and good, but not outstanding. We enjoyed the ube shake more than the avocado. The tapiocas / coconut pearls inside the shakes were unusual though and we didn't really like their textures... Overall, authentic + delicious + aesthetically pleasing Filipino spot. I still want to try the BBQ-Silog as well as the other dishes, so will plan on returning. A teeny bit pricier than I'd like (not sure if anyone's mentioned the mysterious ""CC Fee"" at the end of the bill) but worth it.",Fob Brooklyn
195,Very authentic polish food and nice atmosphere inside. The food is very heavy and oily but it was tasty.,"#A big Roasted Hock in Beer, which I had with a large beer. #A lot of food and good price. #Tasty",Best polish food in Brooklyn always fresh..I recommend the salmon tartar ..love the decor and the way the waitress dress...only bad thing is that they dont take reservations,"Karczma, where do I begin? Everything in this place is sooo good. When you walk in, you'll see that this place looks very traditionally adorned. There is a full bar to your left, and there are wooden tables throughout the restaurant. The restaurant is a decent size, and has plenty of booth- seating. They have a few tables that are in the middle of the booths, but it doesn't seem like they can accommodate a large party. The menu has very traditional Polish dishes. They have a platter of Polish specialties which I love ordering because it has a mix of some of their popular appetizers: hunter's stew, potato pancakes, stuffed cabbage, kielbasa, and pierogis. They have several different kinds of pierogis (cheese, sauerkraut) but the meat one is my favorite. I recommend getting them fried. The plate of Polish specialties is generous portion, sufficient enough to be an entree for 1 person, or shared appetizer for 2-3 people. For the soup, I recommend the white borscht soup - ask for it to be served in a bread bowl. For the entrees, we ordered a special of the day - the rabbit stew with potato dumplings and a beet salad, and also the spicy beef goulash, which was served on top of potato pancakes. Our favorite part of the meal was the appetizers. We thought the sauce for the rabbit wasn't that flavorful, but the beet salad that it came with was just soooo good and addicting. It was a nice balance of sweet and freshness to cut the heaviness of the meals. My spicy beef goulash was a nice hearty portion, but I was a little disappointed that it wasn't spicy at all (it was good nevertheless).For dessert, we ordered apple pie. Let me tell you, this apple pie was one of the best ones I've ever had, even though they didn't have ice cream here. It had copious amounts of sliced apples, and the crust portion of the pie was dense and cake-like. The pie was drizzled in chocolate sauce, and served with dollops of whipped cream. It wasn't too sweet nor too heavy, but the portion is quite large and is more than enough to share amongst two people. I love coming back here because of how great the food is, but the prices make it even more appealing to come back. Two large beers, one appetizer, two entrees, a dessert, and a dessert cocktail (plus tip) was less than $100, plus we had leftovers to bring home!","I came with my mom on a holiday weekend evening, and we got the last table. We were asked to switch to a smaller table while we were looking at the menu, which we happily obliged because the table we were at was huge for two.Anyway, we decided to share the Polish platter, which came with 1 sauerkraut & mushroom / 1 meat / 1 potato & cheese pierogi, a piece of Kielbasa sausage, one stuffed cabbage with tomato sauce, 2 potato pancakes, hunter stew, and a container of sour cream. To preface my review, the first time I had Polish food was in Poland, so my standards may be a bit high. The food here was pretty good with regards to other Polish food I've had in the US, but of course not as good as in Poland. The pierogi skin was chewy and not too thick, which is rare to find in the US. The meat one had too much meat and it was basically just eating a chunk of meat without any other flavor, and the sauerkraut & mushroom was sticky, which I've never experienced before at any Polish restaurant. I didn't like the stickiness at all. My favorite pierogi was the potato and cheese one because it was flavorful and light. The Kielbasa sausage was quite tasty as well, even though the piece was small. I usually love goblaki, which is the stuffed cabbage, but this one just had way too much meat and too little rice; the balance was off, and there was too little sauce. The potato pancakes were thick and had a great thickness and consistency, but it didn't have much flavor. The hunter stew was really sour and I didn't enjoy it, but I didn't like hunter stew in Poland either so it may not be this particular restaurant's hunter stew that I don't like.It was a lot of food, and service was present. I would say I might return for the cheese and potato pierogi and maybe potato pancakes if they serve it with some flavorful sauce, but I wouldn't return for anything else we had on that plate.Price was quite fair for the amount of food as it came out to be around $16 post-tax.","PURCHASED: Chicken noodle soup + Pierogies w/ that meat covered in cabbage (see photos)TOTAL: $ ~14.00 with t. and t. PROS:+ excellent portion: once again, cannot express how they fill you up. Most restaurants that you go to will make you pay $14 for something that leaves you feeling hungry. In my last review I made the note that I was a moderate to heavy eater. That means I like to eat a lot like a fat american. I hope that says something about what I can handle. + waitresses: are polish. They're straight forward and nice. Owner is a man. + popular spot: I came for lunch at this most recent time. The other times I have come were at dinner. I have missed checking in on multiple occasions. I have really been here plenty of times. CONS:- NothingIMPRESSION:This is a 5-star restaurant because it leaves me feeling heavy--literally the portions are heavy. If it's lunch time, go for the lunch special (first few pages). Choose the chicken noodle soup (SO GOOD, way better than canned generic chicken noodle soup) + the pierogies with the stuffed cabbage. It is bomb and I will certainly come back. Please see photos for the lunch I received. Note: there are other things that you saw photos of that were from other occasions. I do not recommend the Hunter's Stew with a sausage. Karczma is EXCELLENT.",Karczma
196,"Wasn't the worst meal I had. I ordered the creol vegie burger with tots but I'm not sure what made it creol. It was a fine black bean burger but being served with crystal hot sauce doesn't make all food creol. Overall a disappointment the pictures were nothing like the actual food which was served in red plastic baskets not plates nicely as I was lead to believe. Service was nice but metioker and this wasn't really a restaurant, just a dirty bar. The atmosphere was dingy at best with some random NOLA doller store finds and broken lighting. At least it was only a few steps from where I was staying or I would be much more disappointed.","Consistently greatChicken sandwich, mac n cheeseFood that will impress","When I left this place I was sad. Like really really sad. Note to self Jana, don't go anywhere bringing in your high expectations with you.I was in New Orleans back in September. So when I read reviews and they mentioned the following words:Just like New OrleansAmazing Cajun creole foodBold FlavorsYou get sucked up into that shit! I had this place bookmarked and was ready to take myself back to that New Orleans flavor, but I just didn't get there with this food. I have to go back though I'm just not convinced that this is all this place has to offer. I came to Tchoup Soup before 5 and maybe I didn't get the dinner menu. The menu I had didn't even have half of the items some of these reviews are mentioning. When I come back I'll provide an update but for now this place just didn't do it for me.",Free beer!?!? Can't beat that. Food was good but free beer was better. Second time around and willl be back soon. Staff is friendly chill environment,"I was searching for a beer place with some food options when i discovered the Tchoup Shop. The place is on a corner on Wykoff ave. You may drive by and not even see ot. It is dimly lit and intimate.  It has an old fashioned look and appeal. The bar is fairly large and they have communal tables in the front.  In the back, you have more private tables. We sat down in the bar area near the back and met Anais the bartender.  What a nice person. I got Founders beer onntap and my friend had a nice hurricane. The restaurant is Creole themed. With a small kitchen run by 1 person. The cook really gets things out at a good pace. Ordered the mac and cheese amd the kale salad to start. Both were good. They played an assortment of music to match any crowd. The place has a really nice vibe to it. The most famous item on the menu is the crispy breast of chicken on focccia type bun. I maybe incorrect with the description.  The kale salad may a little small but its full of flavor. Nice mix of onions, cranberries and other things really brings out the flavor of the kale. All in all, a really good spot to grab a quick bite and a brew. They also have a huge assortment of liquors including bourbons, tequilas etc. The staff is very friendly, and you will have a nice time here.","I've had this place bookmarked forever and finally had the chance to go for brunch the other day. It was a bit chilly for me so I wanted to sit inside but there are definitely many outdoor seats. The outside says Heavy Woods and not Tchoup Shop - kinda confused about that. I've been to NOLA before and this place was quite a letdown. This place did not satisfy my cajun craving at all. Ordered the Lucky Lubbock - eggs, chicken fried pork steak, biscuit and country sausage ($16), which seemed a bit steep for the portion size and the location. The chicken fried pork steak was extremely dry even with all the gravy on top. Best part was the biscuit. I wasn't a fan of the jambalaya and the gumbo as they were lacking essential flavors. The gumbo, though, was watered down and had an awkward consistency. Won't be back here again when I have the NOLA cravings!",Tchoup Shop
197,"There is a server there who has the nastiest attitude and then then there is a server there who is awesome. Since bad service kills the vibe for me, my friends and I will not be returning which is really sad, because this used to be one of our favorite spots on Franklin.","Risotto croquettes were good. It's hard to mess up pasta and vodka sauce, but they managed to. For our main, we had the burrata ravioli and orecchiette with broccoli rabe and sausage. The ravioli Was very tough and tasted like plastic along with the cheese inside. The vodka sauce was incredibly watery and flavorless.   The broccoli rabe in the other dish was very over cooked. Also, the sausage looked like breakfast sausage that was cut up. Overpriced, especially considering the food quality.","This was absolutely the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant, me and my friend ordered food and I was appalled. They literally slapped a krafts single on my Mac and cheese and the fettuccine was just... honestly words can't even explain. This was pretty pricey as well and when I called to get a refund they said they couldn't. I don't understand it's not like I'm asking my money back for anything of quality here","Lack of consistency which is unfortunate because when it's good it's good. When it not then your traveling up a cold creek- Staff is nice - Breakfast is solid - Good restaurant to bring a date - Wait can be long - Sat down here a few times & every visit was different from getting cold food, hot food, amazing favors to bland soo 4 stars is the max I can give - I would still recommend because the dishes are good & unique","When it's good its soo good...But the last few times I've come here, the service has been off and the food has not been consistent as is mentioned in other reviews.I've come here for years and live in the neighborhood. And when I didn't live here I'd drive in to bring out of town guests here for delicious and well-priced Italian food set to (my favorite) hip-hop and surrounded by good-vibe humans in an intimate, well-lit space.On my last two visits, I've been greeted by the manager (I believe) earlier in the evening and we have been put off by his demeanor. We felt that our being there was an inconvenience to him - we came just after opening around 5:30/6 and were often one of the few groups there. We were met with a certain apathy and annoyance almost off the bat. Hard to read if it was intended to be deep sarcasm...either way, didn't come here to think about it. Not giving up on you, hoping to level up with you.","Came here as a party of two on a weeknight with my mom who is visiting from out of town to this cute place in my neighborhood. Past the bar area there are plenty of tables and a covered patio in the back. Aside from the bar area and the delivery orders, the restaurant was not very busy so we were seated right away. Our server was very brief throughout our dinner. Although the place was not busy she seemed to say only what was necessary before quickly going away. Once we were seated she came over almost immediately to ask for our orders, and proceeded to ask twice more while we were still very clearly looking over the menus. Having worked as a server for quite some time, this was my biggest dissatisfaction with our dining experience as I could tell she was not very interested and doing the minimum amount to quickly serve us and flip the table. Aside from our server, the other staffs came to our table during our dinner service, but I felt there was a little to be desired. None of the dishes were announced when dropped off by food runners and we had to tell the staff who ordred what when food was delivered. These were small things that add up and that I would expect from a restaurant of this type and at this price point. Moving on to the food. I don't eat Italian too often, but found the dishes tasty and I enjoyed the homemade pasta dishes. We ordered the White Bean Crostini to start, which was served as whole white beans and sliced pecorino over a thick slice of fresh bread. For entrees I ordred Pappardelle noodles with Al Limone, which was zesty and bright, and the Burrata Ravioli (on the daily specials menu) which had large handmade ravioli filled with burrata and what I'm guessing was a vodka sauce? I tend to frequent mostly places with Asian cuisine, so it wasn't something I would normally pick and wasn't blown away, but my mom enjoyed the dishes that we had ordered, so I guess it was okay. Overall, the homemade pasta and fresh bread were tasty but I wasn't overly impressed and was quite disappointed in the service.",Cent'Anni
198,"I came here with really high expectations and specific cravings, some of which were met. I liked their take on lumpia and LOVED the champorado. The stuff of my childhood, yum. The lechon kawali is definitely meant to be shared (at $22, I should've known this) and I found it to be greasy. We also ordered the sisig, which was greasy as well. It was also saucy(?) but I don't think this is necessarily a fault, it's just not my preferred sisig preparation. I seriously would come back just for the champorado though.",The food was flavorful but asked before ordering the server which of the goat and oxtail is softer and he recommended oxtail. It was rubbery and not tender at all. Dissapointed!I live 2 blocks away and might not be paying the visit anymore. I would rather go to Jepney on 13 and on the 1st in the city.Gooduxj to the business!,"It all started good but the last half of the meal left us with our heads scratching. We came here to celebrate a friend's birthday during the weekday for dinner. We started out by ordering several appetizers to share. The first one we got was Amy's spring rolls which was a recipe of grandma's according to the menu. The rolls were crisp with a balance of ingredients and served cut on a bias. We also ordered the daily dumplings (pork) and pulled pork buns. We all agreed that we liked the lightness to the appetizers. It was not greasy or heavy at all.Now here is where the meal turned to lackluster. Several of us were not 100% satisfied with what we ordered. I originally wanted to order the sigg sigg, but they had ran out of it for the night. Instead I decided to get my usual Filipino go to, the oxtail kare kare. I thought that for $22 for a dish I would expect more. There was more bone on the ox tail than meat. It leaves you feeling pretty cheated. The cuts of eggplant were also small and I felt that it was missing the peanut flavor in the sauce that makes the dish. Most other places I've tried this dish had a thicker sauce and also served the dish with string beans. I've eaten better versions in Woodside, Queens.The worst part was the ice cream. I ordered the purple yam flavored ice cream. You would think if you named the restaurant after the flavor it should be good. It was terrible, gritty and I couldn't take more than one bite. You would think that if they named the restaurant after purple yam, they would have more than just the bad ice cream to show for it.I had high expectations that fell short. The waiter's tone was also questionable on his customer service since everything he said came with a slight attitude. I will not be returning again to this restaurant.","You know when you go into a restaurant and you feel at home? That's how it felt at Purple Yam. I didn't catch the chef's name (the older Asian man) but he was so kind and I could taste the love and care he puts into his food. We got the ukoy, the chicken adobo, and the pancit - all super flavorful and delicious. My favorite was the ukoy - it was perfectly crispy and had lots of shrimp in it. I liked how it was served with the tangy sauce because it cut through some of the heavier flavors and balanced out the overall taste.","Excited to have an impromptu dinner tastings at the #michelinrecommended Filipino restaurant in #ditmasparkbrooklyn! I'm undecided on what to order that Chef Romy himself suggested the tastings. He is making my small plates now as I speak. Today's dinner is my pre-Labor Day celebration: recognizing the importance of hard work, drive and commitment of workers all over the world by eating at a restaurant of a restaurateur, artist, author and chef who despite his privileged life from the Philippines and excellent education (UP Diliman, Bachelors and Masters from England and USA), never shied away from WORK. Chef Romy was proud to say that he started washing dishes as his first ever restaurant work.Before all these ube-craze and now-popular Filipino spots in NYC, it was first Chef Romy and Purple Yam.I am excited to be eating with the pioneer! Thank you!#filipinopioneers #curious_eater #filipinocuisine #michelinrecommended #michelinguidenyc #purpleyam #filipinochef #updilimanalumni #updiliman #romydorotan  @ Purple Yam - Brooklyn","Lovely LOVELY homemade ice cream and great food. Their purple yam ice cream was like nothing that I've ever tasted before: creamy, rich, and densely packed with rich yam flavors. I don't care how full you are after dinner, definitely make room for ice cream before you head out of this restaurant. If yam's not your thing, they have other interesting flavors such as avocado and jackfruit as well as your more traditional flavors. Their Filipino dishes were also very solid and tasty. For appetizers, we shared 2 kinds of lumpia and for our entree, we shared the lechon kawali. Both the lumpia shanghai and fresh lumpia were good. The deep fried pork entree was massive, crunchy, fatty and filling and definitely meant to be shared. I love fatty foods so this was a delight. However, if you're not used to the grease, it might be pretty heavy for you.Overall, I had a great experience at this restaurant and would definitely return.",Purple Yam
199,"I gave em a few tries, sadly it's not worth how costly it is.Also it's just remarkably bland.I dont think they use much for seasoning","Dude, their food is good as hell. If you can go to the brick & morter, do it in a heartbeat! BUT delivery can be a fuck show. Tried to order on grubhub & they wanted a $7.49 delivery fee! I know grubhub sets the fee, but maybe don't put the option up there to ppl it'll cost half their order to be delivered.","I gave them a second chance on a whim being that they were the only vegan option still open. The biggest issue with Toad Style is that don't season their food! It is so danggone bland! If you don't use some seasoning then throw in some flavorful produce. I like that they are not based with a bunch of soy and processed ingredients, but man there are better options out there especially for the price. My first order I tried their mock gyro and though the texture was right it didn't have any flavor. I also tried their chili fries... don't do it! They were soggy and guess what also bland. Tonight I had there sunshine burger which was better than what I tried before, but the patty has that sinking mush texture which is made worse by the fact it had no taste. I also had fried pickles, which were not made well as the batter was soggy and not crisp like you'd expect, the worst fried pickles I've had. I'm done and I mean it, with this place.","Vegan comfort food in a punk meets martial arts themed restaurant in Brooklyn. While this might not sound shocking to you the food will shock you with its piquant, sweet, and savory dishes!Food****When people hear the phrase ""comfort food"" they tend to associate it w/ unhealthy--Toad Style is only half that (fries and other fried foods). There is a good amount of healthy, superfoods on this menu. We ordered the Sunshine burger, which features Toad Style's own house made patty (refreshing in the age of BEYOND and IMPOSSIBLE), arugula, cashew dill cheese (amazing), avocado, sweet chili mustard, and served on a pretzel bun and a side of fries--definitely a winner (Side note: ketchup is house made and very good but you must request this as they do not have it out and we accidentally dumped some hot sauce on our burger). Additionally, we tried the Tofu Scramble from their brunch menu (served until 4pm daily!)--made with Burmese tofu and topped w/ Hollandaise sauce and veggies. The  scramble was light yet creamy and delicious! At the end we ordered the raw peanut butter cup by Culiraw. It was much smaller than we expected (not their fault--ours) but very delicious. Service****Counter service and you bus your own tables and dependent on your beliefs you may like or dislike that but I like how I feel when I help the restaurant. Not five stars, not three-4!Atmosphere***Appropriate for all--couples, families, LGBTQIA+, straights, and everyone in between!Price$Great food at an excellent price!","This was my first purposeful vegan food experience. I'd heard a lot about Toad Style so I stopped in. They were somewhat busy but after I got in line they were swamped. Calling ahead or ordering ahead is a must! I had the cheeseburger and small fries. The fries were amazing! So good, somewhat salty, crispy. They make their own ketchup but it's a little in the sweet side. I didn't mind it but something to think about. The cheeseburger wasn't what I expected. It was huge! Lettuce, onion, tomatoes, pickles are standard on the burger. With all of that the burger was still just okay. The ""patty"" was a little too chewy. I was hoping for something more solid, as well as seasoned! The freshness from the vegetables makes the burger but I wish the patty kicked in a little more. Overall would I come back? Yes, especially for those fries. Would I recommend it? I'll tell you after my second visit lol",I ordered from here via GrubHub last night and I must say it was pretty good. I had the cowgirl burger with fries and a lemonade. The burger was pretty tasty and I liked the addition of the fried onion. If I could change one thing it'd be their choice of seasoning for the lentils as I would prefer garlic and onion powder vs what I'm going to assume is chili powder... The fries were hot and the lemonade was the delish (wish it came in a larger size).. definitely see myself ordering from them in the future...,Toad Style
200,Just letting all the dog lovers out there know that they do allow dogs on the outside patio. It's a small patio - even our 15 lb companion was slightly in the way of the servers but they didn't seem to mind at all. Cash only.,"3.5 Pros: Cozy environment, good service, authentic? the owner/employees are French (or very convincingly so to a non-French), unexpectedly large portions, reasonable pricing.Con: Lacking flavor complexity, contrary to the menu descriptions with interesting ingredients- they didn't shine through. For example, I was really looking forward to the mint element in La Sultan, but all I got was a little sprig with no actual mint flavor incorporated with the dish. A garnish shouldn't be included with a menu description imo- just a bit misleading with expectations.","Discovered this place by accident as we got lost finding our way back to Manhattan.. Have been back on numerous occasions.. The first time... a dessert crepe and coffee.. My next 3 times: a savory crepe.. Suffice it to say, I am trying every crepe first then on to the salads. So far.. not disappointed as of yet..","Wow blown away the ambiance is so cool, very European. I had the hanger steak and my wife tried the shrimp curry dishes both dishes were excellent. The shrimp curry is a must try in my opinion. I ate half my wife's plate. If you're in the Williamsburg area and want to try something French... The crepes are so delicious  The cappuccino is excellent!! Def a must try !!","What a cute French crepe place to go on a date! The interior is adorable we sat near the window for lunch and ordered a mocchacino and ice latte for our drinks. For crepe I got the La Normande. Very delicious and creamy but not overwhelming, mushrooms are tasty. Only thing is the chicken was a bit dry wish it was more tender.Waitress was very nice and would checkup every now and then. Bathroom is big and clean! Overall was a good experience!","What a cute French crepe place to go on a date!

201,"Dear Baristas, are you OK?What is going here? It's as though the cool kids from undergrad are now recreating the hierarchy of the dining hall from behind their coffee bar in Berg'n and no, you can't sit with them.I've been here for a while and remember when they first opened. I now live in the neighborhood and it's a good spot to work from, the coffee is good but the service leaves everything to be desired.Don't get me wrong, I don't need coddling. I quite prefer a non-thirsty waiter or barista. I'd also prefer not to speak to the back of your artisanally messy hair and only ask that you provide me with a utensil with which to eat instead of telling me which options are gluten free when I ask for a fork. Or answering specific questions with a yes or no. I just need the basics instead of the paired down, apathetic, desperately minimalist chirps. Oi, no.","Had a drink at the bar and the bartender attended to us quickly. Ambiance overall was nice with the option for indoor and outdoor seating. Tried the chicken wings from one of the vendors, Mighty Quinn's and they were tasty and reasonably priced. Will be going back again!Sincerely,First Time Visitor","There are WAY too many babies if you come during the day, but alas, it's the only place I can bring the boys around to watch soccer and drink. My apartment is too small, you see -- and I don't have cable! Also, the drafts here are 12 ounces. The food is fine.","I came here for a first date once and it happened to be trivia night (which we didn't expect). It was actually a great ice breaker for the first date to play as team ""We don't even know each other."" The trivia questions were great, varied, and challenging without being ridiculously obscure. I particularly loved the music round. Good beers and some decent food stalls. Really best to come for the entertainment than the food and it's a good hang out spot. It led to a second date (mainly because we didn't discuss anything but the trivia) although a third date after our second at Bearded Lady, not so much. (Had nothing to do with Bearded Lady though).","Fun food hall with a good mix of food options. They had BBQ, burgers and salads, pizza, and Asian food. The food all tasted great. But I would say it was a bit on the pricey side. For 1 combo meal and 10 piece dumplings at the Asian restaurant, it cost us about $30. And at the BBQ grill, we ordered two sliders and a side of brussels sprouts for $15.I was a little confused about the sliders though. Before ordering, I saw an order sitting on the table and I asked the cashier what it was. After telling me it was a slider, I proceeded to order the same thing. But what I got was much smaller than what I had seen. So I was very disappointed about that.There was also a bar where you could order beers. I did not order one this time, but it seemed like a nice beer hall that you could go to for a nice sit down with friends. Overall, prices seemed high, but the atmosphere was great and lots of food and drink options available.","Berg'n is a great space. It is quite versatile and could be described as a mix of a beer garden, food hall, and family-friendly bar, though no single one of the above descriptions can encompass the vibe.It has space equipped for four vendors; currently there are Mighty Quinn's, Landhaus, Pizza by charlie and Jiangbing (shangainese street food). Several of the vendors that rotate in and out are featured at smorgasburg. Although I'm hardly ever disappointed, the food is definitely on the pricier side and almost always a-la-carte style (not unlike most new trendy BK spots). Overall, drinks are not bad, but the beer menu, in particular, is not as as robust or impressive or as some of the other craft beer bars in the neighborhood. Overall, it is a fantastic space with a friendly vibe. You can do anything from work to get drinks with friends here. It offers some outdoor space as well and certain events at night such as trivia and board game night. It is also family-friendly, frequented by young parents and kids.",Berg'n
202,"I've been here twice for Saturday brunch. Didn't drink either time so I can't speak to the bottomless deal, but the food is subpar. It's hard to mess up a hamburger, but their's isn't all that good.Also it's too loud, there are a lot of groups.",First time having brunch at this place. They offer a lot of food for an affordable price. I got the Nutella French Toast which was garnished with fresh fruit. The toast was slightly burnt which was off putting due to the overwhelming chocolate hazelnut taste. The rosemary potatoes were crispy and flavorful. It was busy when we went so I can't decide if they didn't want to interrupt people talking or if service was lack luster because it took over 20 minutes to get our check to pay.,"Verde is my new spot in downtown Brooklyn.We were 5 guys here for dinner. The place was packed , the bar was full. It was surprising because most restaurant were empty on the street.Food was very tasty and well seasoned. The service was on point...the atmosphere was cozy and romantic.Great Italian restaurant..I wanna try their famous brunch","Love these guys. How in the world have I not written a review for Verde? The owners have changed in the time since I started coming (for the better, the new guys are so friggin nice), but the food is just as good as it always was. But why should you come here? Brunch. This is one of the last boozy brunches on Smith, and if they ever stop doing it, the soul of Brooklyn will die a little. My go-to is a burger (hold the mushrooms) at the bar with a raspberry bellini or just straight champaign. If you have a larger party (read: more than just you and your significant other), the backyard is a really really nice place to hang for 90 min. The backyard is also very baby-friendly, so if one of your best friends happens to have a kid (cough *Mike* cough), Verde affords you the opportunity to get drunk...er...hang out with your best friends kid and have brunch. Come here if you're looking for boozy brunch (any day of the week before 4PM), stay for the food and the yard.","Just celebrated our baby shower this past weekend, just simply put amazing! The whole family enjoyed the delicious family style brunch menu which included fresh baked chibata bread,virgin olive oil and gaeta olives. Along with classic steak and eggs, crispy bacon and house salad, rosemary potatoes, and pancakes with mixed berries. Topped off with Peach, Mango, and Raspberry Bellini.Will most definitely go back again once our daughter is born and have more of Verde on Smith again! I recommend everyone go and try their delicious food and drinks.",I came here for brunch last Sunday for a pre celebration for my friend's birthday. If you want a tasty and affordable brunch especially boozy please come here. They had a variety bottomless drink options which were tasty and I loved my steak and eggs. The steak was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Even the scrambled eggs were good. The staff was very friendly and were prompt with our drinks. We made reservations and there was no wait. Also they have brunch every day till 4 . I would definitely would come back since it was Father's Day the food menu was limited from their standard menus.,Verde On Smith
203,Overpriced. Very overpriced. Food is moderately good. I brought a chicken quesadilla and Piccadillo taco. Ground beef taco is okay. Very small. Not fulfilling. The chicken quesadilla was $9.50!!! Wtf? Most Mexican establishments charge $10-15 for a large decent sized quesadilla. They literally took two taco shells and put chicken and cheese between them. AND MIND YOU IT TOOK 35-45 MIN TO RECEIVE! Don't see what the hype is about. I live across the street from this establishment. Brings a lot of noisey drunk people. Maybe it's the margaritas.,"Very overpriced. Tacos are tiny on stale tortilla. The only reason this gets two stars is because the fried avocado taco was decent. The Carnitas were dry AF and at $5 they dont even add crema!? The blackened catfish was inedible, I think the fish had gone bad. The pastor was also dry which is insane and had a funky taste as well. Save your money and go somewhere else. Actually, if you want to spend about the same for better quality, go to nacho macho.",Trash! I came here for a date night with Hubby and the guy at the register took our order and failed to mentioned that our entire order was not in stock. They literally were out of everything we ordered. We tried to compromise and order something else to substitute and then they messed up the substitute order. The customer service was deplorable. Deff would not recommend...I should've went to Gloria's...,"If you're not stopping in you're doing something wrong. I came just as they opened on Saturday morning and had to make the difficult decision of what taco I'm going to order. There were many tempting options, but I chose the al pastor, breakfast taco, and the fried chicken. I mean, who can resist fried chicken? I will say the fried shrimp and catfish taco were close honorable mentions. Enjoyed all three, but I loved the breakfast taco. I don't know what it was but the combination of the egg with the cheddar, refried beans, and avocado on the toasted soft taco shell was out of this world delicious. Still thinking about it now and to be honest will probably make one now stop just for the breakfast taco before I leave the city.","Honestly a little surprised by this experience- We ALWAYS go to Chilos (down Franklin in Bedstuy/Clinton Hill), but were looking for another place for dependably good tacos and when we got here, it looked like it might work.We ordered 10 tacos and some beers and waited. and waited. we saw the chefs clear the line of tickets at least twice. And we asked the girls at the counter, and they assured us it was coming at like 40 minutes into waiting.At more than 50 minutes of waiting we finally decided we had to leave and requested a refund which took quite a while in an of itself. FORTUNATELY, I looked at the refund receipt before I got too far because it was refunded to THE WRONG CARD! So I had to go back and get it again.Fortunately she refunded the entire amount, but I guess this won't be my go-to. Back to Chilo's it is!","I come here every other day because my friend lives by and literally this is comfort food ! I could be sad, mad, or happy and the food always makes me feel good ! I am always highly satisfied and the prices are great ! The shrimp nachos are my favorite and the shrimp tacos.",Gueros
204,"I've been to many Meatball Shops around the city as I'm a big fan of the veggie ball. The meatballs are a 4 and the manager is a 1. I happened to come to this location on a food tour for my dad's 65th birthday... The group got their meatball to taste and the manager started to tell us about the establishment/history/etc. Because we were on a public group tour where photos were encouraged my dad took a photo (seated, no flash, not disruptive) of the manager speaking. HE DID NOT LIKE THAT. He starred my dad down for 15-20 seconds and there was awkward silence throughout the group. He rudely told us ""you don't take a photo of someone without their permission."" I totally get that... but we were on a group tour with 20 tourists, you are speaking publically, and you did not state ""no photos"" before your speech. Some people capture memories with their phone, relax, and be patient with senior citizens. What we experienced was unfriendly and unprofessional. Choose another location to dine at.","First let me just say I appreciate they have vegan meatballs and they were ok, nothing special. The menu is kinda confusing. For their ""make it a bowl"" option, according to the menu, you get 1 side for $17.50 and additional $3 for an additional side. We decided for just 1 side since it's already kinda steep for a bowl of pasta. The bill came and we were charged for an additional side which we stupidly didn't question. I ordered the classic tomato sauce and honestly, it tasted like it came from a cheap jar you buy at the grocery. So for the ordinary  taste of a pasta, I'm not sure I'm willing to pay that much to make another trip here.",So I went yesterday to this location with my bf.  He ordered a bowl expecting that the balls and side order will come as separate while I ordered balls biscuit and gravy.  To start my food tasted old especially the biscuit and the gravy was cold.. only thing that was good on my plate were the eggs not even the spicy balls.  And my bf's order was completely wrong.  I mean who eats polenta with alfredo sauce?? Like I said expectation was that they would come as separate instead of being in one bowl; also the little piece of bread was stale and ordered coke which was flat with no bubbles whatsoever.  Had high expectations from this place but they failed me,"This is one interesting restaurant, the interior design will take you back in time.  I found the ambience to be quite relaxing and others conversations did not seem to carry over.  The purpose of coming here is obviously to have meatballs, the question you have to ask is how would you like to have them?  There are many different options, we chose to have them in a bowl with one side.  You choose the type of meatball, the sauce you would like with them and what you would like to eat them with.  They do have vegetarian options here as well.  I ordered the classic meatballs in a bowl with mashed potatoes and a white sauce.  The mashed potatoes were phenomenal, definitely homemade and paired perfectly with the white sauce and meatballs.  I found this to be a perfect lunch, not overwhelming on the stomach at all. Again the price point for this restaurant is just what I would expect and well worth it for what you get in return.  Cheers!!",Had the meatball/mash/BACON!!!! Did not know how these 3 will work perfect together.Returning back with more and more friends and family so they can enjoy what I love so much.,"LOVE the Meatball Shop! I have been to several of their locations, and this location is among my favorite. This is a spacious restaurant. I came here for dinner on a Saturday evening, and I was able to sit at a table immediately. The service was speedy and friendly. And, all of the food I had was super fresh, hot and delicious. I had the original meatballs (my favorite) with the traditional sauce. I always order the vegetable of the day amongst my sides. I always have wanted to order dessert here, but I never save enough room for dessert. Hopefully, one day I will!I'd definitely come back here, again!",The Meatball Shop
205,"Highly rated on yelp so I wanted to try. Came on a Sunday night and it wasn't packed at all. First thing off the bat is the aesthetics. The sign to wallpaper to lighting. Definitely an Ig worthy restaurant. Food doesn't live up to the hype. We were told they ran out of their fish which was disappointing. We started with devil eggs. It was the saltiest devil eggs I've ever had. You can taste the copious amount of fish sauce they put into the filling. The chicken wings were actually quite tasty. Might be top 10 in my books. The dipping sauce paired with it had a nice kick. We got the curry laksa and beef rendang. The laksa came with 2 prawns, half a soft boil egg, cucumbers and rice noodle in curry broth. It was close to $20. Disappointing! Lacked flavor and nothing in the bowl. The beef rendang looks and taste like something that came out of an Instapot. Yes the beef was super tender but it's something I make at home and charge myself $20 for. I left hungry and wallet wanting a refund. Been looking for authentic Indonesian food here and have yet to find one.","Went here for double date dinner and ordered a round of drinks to start which were fun and tasty, but the food was disappointing. We had the wings to start, followed by the pumpkin curry, beef, and fish dishes. Each plate came out extremely delayed; we waited ~ 20-min between each dish, which made it difficult to eat or share. The portions are very small so that doesn't help for group sharing either. The bathroom was also awkwardly situated in the middle of dining tables. Overall, the interior design was vibey but food was not worth the $","This place does not represent the real Indo taste. I tried the otak otak, nasi goreng, and fried chicken. The otak otak did not come with the right sauce. The nasi goreng taste is decent but the additional tempes were really bad. It was bitter af. And the fried chicken is a knock off of Popeyes. If you want some Indo food, this is not the place to go. I also let my 2 dogs eat some leftovers earlier today. It just so happened I have a leftover of Popeyes. I held them side by side to each dog two times. They both chose the Popeyes. Idk what else to say...","Food is okay. But it's so stinkin' cute in there!Neon lights, leafy walls, cute plates- I mean, it's so perfect for friendly dinners.We had the pumpkin curry and laksa. I must say, the laksa was far from authentic (I'm used to the laksa's from the hole-in-the-wall Indonesian places in Queens) but the presentation was great and was still quite flavorful.y favorite appetizer was the shrimp and corn fritter- juicy with a slightly crispy exterior.Service was wonderful too.","This place has cute ambiance, trendy aesthetic and a wine/beer bar. The food doesn't really taste authentically Indonesian but fits the asian fusion bill, in terms of flavor. I was the only asian person in the whole place (customer / server) --  just an interesting observation. My friend and I split the nasi goreng & the coconut greens. We got hot sauce on the side (tomato sambal) to add a bit extra flavor to the rice. Which wasn't that distinguished flavor wise as other nasi gorengs I have had. Not bad taste wise just different. Also the coconut greens were sauteed kale, my best friend from Jakarta who still lives there always says she can't eat healthy like the American food bloggers bc there is no kale in Indo lol.This is a cute neighborhood spot if you're around seeking curries, rice and other asian food. But for the authentic stuff Elmhurst is your best bet!!!",It's really a cute place and the food is quite tasty! My favorite dishes of the night are the sautéed greens and fried chicken wings!Grilled fish wrapped in banana leaves was good too but the portion is kinda small.I'm not sure if this is an authentic Indonesian restaurant but the flavor was definitely good! Glad I came even it was a rainy day,Selamat Pagi
206,"Cute and cozy spot in Ft. Greene. Highlights include the ambience, the arepas and the churro donuts. Drinks and main dishes could use a bit more flavor and flair. We ordered the spicy mezcal drinks and both were underwhelming and a bit flat. The duck tacos also lacked flavor and creativity. Was basically shredded duck with avocado. Hate when you order something at a restaurant that you could make yourself at home!OK experience overall. Nothing super special or memorable other than the arepas and donuts mentioned earlier. In terms of value of the overall meal, not the best you can find in Brooklyn. Our total bill came to $150 for a few dishes and 4 drinks split between 2 people. Just sayin you could prolly do better at that price point.....","I wasn't sure whether to give my stars based on the food, service or the ambiance, so my 4 stars based on my overall experience. While the service and the back garden were absolutely lovely and I would definitely go back for a nice hangout spot with friends, but the food wasn't up to par imo. We ordered duck confit and steak and eggs. There was nothing special about the duck, and the steak was a little tough.","Finally had my last visit to Colonia Verde, which I felt coming on for quite a while unfortunately.We live around the corner and the food is straight up delicious...we've gone to dinner and brunch here likely 30 times over the past year-and-change, but each time we eked one step closer to our last visit. I'll explain succinctly: the service.The training of the waitstaff doesn't seem to include saying ""thank you"" ever, delivering food on time (it was made and sitting on the expo line many a time), filling up water or coffee, or providing perhaps a bit more welcoming service to those you acknowledge as regulars (for real, we would get recognized by our server because we went there so much and were still treated to poor service...and we always tip well as former service folk).Five stars for the food. Negative three because the service is so bad it's now deprived of us a favorite neighborhood place to eat.","I really enjoyed our meal here. Vibe is fun and energetic, and the place has a great outdoor patio space in back.Drinks - interesting selection, lots of spicy mezcal / tequila cocktails. I had the picosa, would recommend.Appetizers - Bangin'. We had the pulpo, tuna crudo, tacos. All were fantastic. I'd go back and just order appetizers.Meals - We split a few plates across the group. Highlights were the picanha, cooked to perfection and seasoned well but was not a lot of food. Baby eggplant was great.","Excellent Latin food in the heart of Fort Greene. Colonia Verde has a lot to be proud of. Drinks- very tastes went with the Big Wheel which is a newer cocktail to the menu. Chili infused tequila. Nice for those who like something with a little kick to it. Apps- the Sausage parrillada was the perfect pairing with our ribeye. Queso cheese, mini arepas, vegetables and sausage. Perfect pairing with our ribeye Ribeye- 40oz was more than enough to share for 2 hungry guys! The sauces that it come with also added a nice touch. Especially the spicy habanero mayo. Cooked medium rare. Was a little fattier than expected but overall a good cut meat. For desert we ended up with churros (2 ordered because we couldn't just stop at 1). Overall, can't say enough about the experience at Colonia Verde. If the weather is nicer out, definitely recommend the greenhouse or outdoors. Reservations are helpful but not completely necessary. If you go with the ribeye, expect to spend ~$100/pp (around $2.75/oz). Not the best steak I've had (Keen's and Luger's) but great Latin based experience.",Lovely servers! Gave us an extra dessert for my mom's birthday.Loved the food especially grilled steak and coconut cake.,Colonia Verde
207,"There were Miti-gating circumstances surrounding my visit here.Honestly it's not very good. It's expensive and it's fake hipster Latin food that isn't really Latin and it's the kind of place that causes non Latin people to write articles claiming that it's racist not to like food based on its lack of authenticity.Part of the reason I don't like it is that it's specifically for hipsters, and is appropriating other cultures - the employee that responded to me corrected me, how can we appropriate other cultures when we're Latin owned - well, it's when you say Mexican, but serve American knock off versions, and that is part of the reason I don't like it - the other main part it is because it's just not that good.In other words, if Taco Bell is owned by a Latin person it doesn't mean it's not appropriation. For me, appropriation is when you say ""Mexican"" and then serve American. But I've given 5 stars to plenty of places that ""appropriate"" and serve fake Anglicized versions of another nation's cuisine (and usually serve them to people not from the culture they're appropriating, otherwise they wouldn't do so well). In the end, it's the taste that leads to the star rating. The appropriation remark just is me shedding light on something that annoys me.And Barbie is Mexican, as a lot of you know, so that's why this issue comes up a lot in my reviews of Mexican food. The anger comes from her, originally. Now I possess it too because I agree with her completely.It's also not the worst thing in the world even though it's overpriced, but considering all of Brooklyn is overpriced these days, mostly, I'm going to give it a solid 3 stars.Which I have since changed to 1 stars because that's what I do whenever I get any kind of negative/defensive/argumentative feedback from the business. If I give 3 stars to 1 star food it's as a favour to a locally owned place. If the place then gives me **** over my opinion, I don't have to do the favour and can give it the 1 star I think the food actually warrants. It's fair enough.","First, please tell your servers to tell people the guacamole and chips are not free. It's offered like its free and you find out that it's $12 for a relatively small portion.. Also the 20% tip is ridiculous for over 5 people. The waitress refused to adjust even though the menu says ""suggested"" not required. We also did not appreciate being rushed out because another party was coming. How about management plan better? The food is great but you guys are getting spoiled.",STEPHANIE WAS A *DELIGHT* -- tacos were dope too~  #maximunrecommend ... Yelp is saying my review is too short though so here are some extra words?,"We came here yesterday for brunch. The decor is awesome here and the restaurant is a lot larger than I thought initially. We opted to do the VIP boozy brunch, which is $30 on top of your entree and they add 20% gratuity to any table that orders the boozy brunch. We ordered the breakfast tacos and breakfast burrito -- both were really tasty and satisfying. The margaritas and sangria were good, which made us glad we did the VIP option versus the regular one, which only includes mimosas, bloody mary's, and beer.Our server was great and attentive as he kept checking in with us throughout our meal. The only thing is, we wish that he would've at least given us a heads up that our time for the boozy brunch was running out but I guess that's just a little thing. We will be back :)","Came here for a bachelorette party dinner on a Saturday night. There were probably 2-3 other birthday dinners going on as well. A nice touch was that they personalized the menu with a little header about the party, and the hosts got to pick out what we ate ahead of time (it was a $40 prefixe + drinks... which ended up being about $80/person). I arrived about 15 minutes early and was not allowed to sit ahead of the group. For 11 people, they set the place settings across four 2 seater tables (one end propped against a wall, so meant for 9 people at most). It was definitely cramped. The food was fine, the standout from the menu was definitely the chipotle corn. We had a great time as a group and enjoyed the various pitchers of margaritas. The restaurant made a big deal of the birthdays, so for our bachelorette party they let us blast Bruno Mars ""Marry You"" - which was sweet. Would certainly come back.","Wow... what a great place!!! Fantastic good and drinks !!! Excellent service , friendly atmosphere !!! We had a good time",Miti Miti
208,Rude ass bartenders. Only serving women! Idiots let customers waiting walking back and forth as if they don't see customers. Terrible service! I walked right down to Casablanca and had prompt service!,"Husband and I went here today. Service is not good at all.Order:Peach belliniBeerFrench onion soupMussels with friesBurgerPros:- The food itself was decent and was 3.5-4 stars. - French onion soup was one of the best I've ever had- Seasoning on burger was good- Peach bellini was tasty- Fries weren't badCons:Overall service was unacceptable. Waitress did not write down what we ordered and she absolutely should have b/c she got almost everything wrong.Strike 1. Table was sticky. I told them and they came over and wiped it, but it still was sticky after and still wasn't cleaned properly.Strike 2. I ordered a peach bellini and the waitress thought I ordered a pitcher but my husband caught it in time for her to change it...why would I need a whole pitcher when it was just my husband and myself, and he ordered his own separate drink? Strike 3. My husband ordered one beer, and when a second lady came by and repeated the name of the beer he requested, it was incorrect. Then afterwards, we learned that what he originally ordered wasn't available, so he acquiesced.Strike 4. I receive the french onion soup and wanted to split it with him. I asked for a second spoon and the one we got was very dirty, with a lot of food residue on it. We requested a different one and it was just as dirty as the first. My guess is that water was splashed on the spoon, and then they attempted to wipe it (there was a smear mark on it), but it didn't remove the gunk. We decided to not even bother so we both just used my initial spoon.Strike 5. My husband ordered a medium rare burger WITH CHEESE. She even brought up if he wanted cheese, he said yes, please give him cheddar cheese. We finally got the burger, and lo and behold, there was no cheese on it. My husband wanted to let it go, but I told him no, b/c they might charge us for something we did not get. We sent it back and it came with cheese. He bit into the burger and it was well done...we were puzzled as to how everything we ordered had some kind of issue, and I also noticed another table also had to send back their burger for being overdone. We didn't want to cause a stir, so we just left it alone and he ate a burger cooked in a fashion he does not like.Strike 6. Some older lady who may have been the manager, shot eye daggers at my husband after him receiving the burger with cheese. Listen lady, it is not our fault you did not properly train your staff. You're not doing us a favor; we're PAYING MONEY and our waitress should pay attention to the order and WRITE IT DOWN so there isn't any confusion.Strike 7. Our bill comes, and our waitress charged us for a pitcher of the peach bellini. Like come on!! How many things can go wrong in one visit? This was our first time here not a good first impression at all. She fixed it and gave us the correct bill eventually, but honestly we were annoyed.","The ambiance was great and the service was too! The food was ok and the prices were fair. My boyfriend and I got god poisoning symptoms an hour or so after we left. Symptoms were so bad my boyfriend went to the hospital. I'm not sure if it was the lobster crepe, lamb burger or ribs. But I'm thinking it was a lobster crepe.","We went for Chez Oskar's bastille day celebration. Everything was just wonderful the service the food and the live music. I had the salmon which was cooked perfectly.  I tried my friends steak special which was heavenly. We tried a selection of desserts the crème brûlée Keylime pie and a warm chocolate dish whose name i forgot. They were all delicious. I don't even like Keylime pie but this made me like it. This is not my first time going and I've never had a bad experience at this place, they just knock it out of the park every time.","This review is long overdue...because this visit is looong overdue. Living within walking distance of this place, it's a shame I waited almost two year to try their brunch.That being said, it was worth the wait. We ordered the French toast and the spinach and goat cheese spinach to share and accompanied it with coffee.The coffee was most certainly made in a French press based on the brew, and it was sooo good. Powerful but not bitter or overwhelming--great smooth finish.Now onto the French toast, quite possibly the best I've ever had. It was creamy on the inside while still being toasted perfectly. Barely required any syrup. The goat cheese and spinach omelette was absolutely divine--eggs tasted fresh and the spinach and cheese were rich and made for a great combination. Service was quick and efficient and the food was out before we knew it. I can't want to go back to try more of the menu.","Very overdue but...THE NYE MENU WAS AMAZING! I had duck confit and my partner had the lamb, both were absolutely delicious. They were on the NYE menu and I can't properly put into words how amazing the duck was... so tender, ugh... please come back.The reason I am only giving 4 stars is that we returned for the mussel special (can't remember if it's on monday's or tuesday's) and we were very unimpressed. Unlimited mussels were lacking flavor and room temperature. I don't know about you, but room temperature mussels are not worth the discount. It's almost if they put them to the side and wait for a table to order them. Would not recommend stopping by for the special. The dinner menu and ambiance are great, so if you're in the area, check it out!",Chez Oskar

Expected better from a supposed bushwich brunch stalwart.,"UPDATE 2/3/2019:I came back for be brunch and all the aforementioned issues were addressed.The food is incredible. The flavors and plating are top-tier. The portions are moderate. The server was prompt and thorough, explained dishes in detail, and was friendly. Food wait time was average.There was only a few people in here on a Sunday brunch. This is definitely a hidden gem.One of the best meals I've had in a long time, and top two brunch meals I've ever had in Brooklyn.---ORIGINAL:Listen. I'm sure the food is great.

But we still did not. Then we saw it on THE INSIDER. The next day, we woke up early, and were the first ones there! It's a small cozy spot. Comfortable nonetheless. The service was instantly phenomenal. We went on a Sunday morning. Upon arrival we were seated promptly despite limited seating. The overall experience was great and the food was a plus. The waiter knew everything about every single dish and was very attentive to details. I enjoyed this very much, coming from a restaurant background this type of service is hard to come by now a days. The biggest reason this place hit it out the park for me was timing and consistency. All the food came out in a timely manner. We started off with our main entrees. I got the sopes and my wife got the egg chorizo scramble. It was then followed up by the pan frances which we had as our sweet portion of the meal. During the entire time we were there, our water was refilled constantly, our napkins were replenished every few wipes and any unnecessary silverware or plates were removed promptly. This was important as the tables are a bit small but we were never inconvenienced by this. ALL OF THE FOOD WAS AMAZING. Every single thing was flavorful and unique. We saw on THE INSIDER, the menu is constantly changed. So we went a second time the following Sunday! This time we got the MOYETE, the huevos benedictos, and chocolate mint pancakes. Uhhhhmaaaazingggg. Everything is just so decadent. Bursting in flavors. Everything is perfectly moist or crunchy on the edges. Perfect yolk porn on the huevos benedictos. Oh and ITS SO AFFORDABLE.  I can't say enough - everything about this place is perfect.","Recently me and my partner split up (I was broken up with), so I did what any self respecting mid 30's new Brooklynite would do, head to Ridgewood!! So as I'm settling into my new digs I went out exploring all the cool restaurants and cafes that my new neighborhood has to offer. First things first, I stopped on myrtle ave and bought an ""it's a queens thing"" shirt and put it on to blend in. After that I was just wondering around and passed by New York titty land. Man this place was good! I looked through the menu and they have great options, I got some tacos. I like the design and decore inside, mad skulls all over the place and jester font up and down that damn menu giving it style for days.As I waited for my food I decided to update my bumble profile and take a couple of cool selfies since I'm desperate and horny. Once I got my tacos and bit in I realized I was so horny and desperate for flavor too and New York titty land delivered! Will be back!!","This place is so awesome. We have been there twice with my girlfriend when visiting Brooklyn. The first time was so delicious we decided to go back on a second trip. Very creative cuisine, very nice people, cool atmosphere. To be honest I will go again next time I am around. The pancakes I got were probably the best ones I ever had, but they renew very often their menu so not sure if it will still be available. Anyway we have never been disappointed and all the menu looked very yummy !",Newyorktitlan
210,"We stopped by for brunch due to the 4 stars ratings on Yelp. The wait was 10-15 mins for weekend brunch after 1pm. Perhaps it was the cold weather hence not a lot of people were out and about. The cafe was packed with hipsters and a few young families - relaxed vibes. We like the big windows which brought in a lot of light. The food was a big disappointment. We got the eggs with sausage and toast; the toast was burned and the edges of the eggs were also burnt (you can see the photos). Furthermore my frittata was a sad small piece of pie and a glob of hash brown. Not visually appealing or appetizing to say the least. Suffice to say, we were surprised this cafe had such a high ratings considering the food was bland and mediocre. The burger and fries were the only highlight from this experience.","Perhaps the woman who seated me at the bar, as a party of one, thought that I wanted to be crammed in on both sides by other diners. Not only was the noise level excruciating, after a couple to my right kindly moved over to give me more room, another woman (who knew the bartender apparently) plopped herself down. She was joined by her friend who PULLED UP A STOOL BEHIND ME next to her and proceeded to jostle me, yell in my ear and insist that she ""couldn't help it. "" The only other way she could have been closer is if she had sat in my lap. $45 later for a teensy plate of pasta, I gulped my water and left. Never again my friends, never again.",It's still 5 stars solid. Full 5.  From service to food to atmosphere. If only we lived closer.,"This place has been 5 stars for many years! Even that one time my appetizer wasn't on point, this team is so great, they had a great save. I love this place. I take everyone I know here because it will always be a solid experience.Through the years I still see a lot of the same faces working here, which shows solid ownership and management. This is one of the few places that runs like a well oiled machine. They have a lovely diverse staff that caters perfectly to their diverse guests.In this age of increasing discrimination, this place has consistently treated me and my guests like human beings and for that, I will always support this establishment!May Walters exist forever and always!I love this place and all it's staff!","Atmosphere: Walter's is dark and romantic around dinnertime. It can be intimidating at first, but once you get a feel for the restaurant, it quickly becomes a cozy environment that feels like a good balance between classy and comfortable.Service: Our server was friendly and professional. He checked on us over the course of the meal and gave a fun, lighthearted tone to the more serious ambience of the restaurant.Food: We started with the grilled octopus and had the Roasted Chicken and Fried Chicken as entrées. The grilled octopus was very well seasoned and did not have a chewy texture. The Roasted Chicken was flavorful and cooked well; we really enjoyed this dish. The Fried Chicken was the best value item on the menu and really filled us up. We also got the Diablo and Walter's Cooler, which paired well with the chicken.Overall: Walter's was a good choice for dinner + drinks. You get the feeling of being in an intimate, fancy restaurant without breaking the bank. Not necessarily the first choice for a dinner date but it's definitely up there. We would love to come back and try their brunch to see the change in atmosphere!","I am new to exploring the Fort Greene area and decided to try out Walters for a late dinner with two of my friends. Upon arrival we were seated right away and greeted by a very cheery waitress who proceeded to provide us with the special for the evening which was a burrata salad. Thank God we were immediately informed because this special was the highlight of the evening. When it arrived it came with a lovely array of roasted vegetables and then we proceeded to ask for bread to dip with. The waitress provided us with a sourdough loaf as well as a baguette. Obviously the carbs were amazing and came with delicious olive oil. For my entree, I ordered the fried chicken. I will say that I thought the breading on the fried chicken was a little thick but the chicken was cooked to perfection and the hot honey was a great complement. Overall I think I'd like to come back and experience their happy hour and brunch!",Walter's
211,"The first time I came here, I was ecstatic because I didn't have to trek too far for some decent ramen (there is a close by L station!). I've been back twice since, and each time, it was just A-OK. Broth didn't seem as good, add-ins sub par (especially the pork), and it was getting annoying cracking my own egg. Each bowl was about $25 plus...I have moved on and will explore other options.",It was okay quality but very expensive. The place was located in a not very good part of Brooklyn. Ummm perhaps the newly opened midtown one is better,"Showed up at 9:58 and there was a ""sorry were closed"" sign. According to the web, they close at 1030. Lady at the front said ""sorry we closed early because there was a big line and we weren't sure if we'd get out on time"".Hungry and disappointed that we wasted a 20 minute drive for this.","This is expensive ramen but its definitely delicious. I can't say if it's worth it just yet because of all the other amazing offers NYC has to offer but it's worth a try.It's definitely authentic and extremely customization giving you options for all compartments of the ramen bowl (firmness of noodles, spiciness of broth, etc.) They do have the famous single booth dining which is quite an odd but satisfying experience.","A really famous place in Japan for Tonkutsu.  Its ramen taste like no other place could do it.  The broth is spectacular.  I love the idea of secluded seat from your friends to enjoy the the savory taste. The place has a unique arrangement for seats and it tells you the empty seats.  There are hooks under the tabje for your purses which I adore. Cold or hot water are available and very accessible for you.Back then, Ichiran was only located in Williamsburg which I visited during winter time.  I believe that you should only go and have tonkotsu on winter time.  My last visit was spring which I thought was a very bad idea.  Since the place in Midtown did not have a/c and just had their door open for cool breeze, the place really smells fishy and distinct of that broth.  I did not  enjoy it since it bothers me a lot in a bad bad way.  It smells like a plate that has not been washed properly.If you want an authentic Tonkotsu ramen visit this place.","I have been coming to ICHIRAN since they first opened in New York . I used to be a fan of Ippudo but started to like the broth of ICHIRAN more .It's a cool experience to dine in a single person booth and you don't need to interact much while ordering . All you need to do is filling out the order form and pressing the button. The ramen is customizable based on the saltiness, thickness of soup, spicy level , firm level of noodles etc. Make sure you order the recommended set ($24) which includes soft-booked egg, scallions,kikurage mushroom and dried seaweed. If you can take a little spicy, try pick the spicy red sauce ,medium level .We love the broth so much so we always end up ordering refill (Kae-Dama). They used to give out noodles refill vouchers in the past but now it's free either full or half order ! We tried the green tea beer ($8.90)and it's different and refreshing . Other than that the drinks there are on the pricier side. Will try their matcha pudding next time since there are many good reviews about it. The service is good and they are no tips restaurant.",ICHIRAN - Brooklyn
212,"The ratings for this place where good so I thought why not try it out!The hummus delivered was a lot, enough for a party and a half. It just didn't taste right, there was just something not quite hitting the spot about it.Btw they give you that humongous portion of hummus and only one pita bread! I guess you're meant to lick the rest of the hummus.","Literally just walked out of Mimi's Hummus - if not for the service, this would have been hands down a 5 star review. However, to my disappintmentd, the lack of service utterly overshadowed the quality of its food, so much so that I felt compelled to write this review as soon as I walked out of the restaurant.The food was delicious in its own right - we ordered the Israeli pickles ($4), traditional hummus ($9), and a bowl of chicken shawarma ($14). The pickles were tasty but on the softer side; the hummus was deliciously smooth; the shawarma was not off a spit as we hoped but flavorful nonetheless. We also ordered an extra pita ($1) for the hummus (yes, this restaurant charges per pita, unlike traditional middle eastern restaurants that provide at least 3-4 from the start). The pita was fluffy and definitely authentic. I would say the food was great but nothing to go out of my way for.Unfortunately, the good review ends there. The hummus came relatively quickly but for some reason, we ended up waiting 45 minutes for the shawarma. The table of two next to us (also a table of 2) got their order not too long after they sat down, while we were still waiting for our pita by the time they finished eating. I think the waitress probably just forgot about the shawarma and the pita as we had to remind her that we were still waiting for it. When we finally got our pita and shawarma, we saw that the waitress only gave us 1 pita when we had ordered 2.We asked for the check soon after we finished eating and When I thought nothing else could go wrong, of course something did. We noticed we were charged for an extra pita and had to ask the waitress to remove it from our bill.The thing that bothered me most is that all of this happened without any acknowledgement or apology from the waitress, which shows that she doesn't really care about her customers. Up to you to decide whether or not Mimi's Hummus is worth the terrible service, but I will not be going back anytime soon.","Yum! Whenever I want a healthy meal in Ditmas Park, I head to Mimi's. This restaurant is small but mighty. I haven't eaten anything here that I haven't liked. Very good hummus, sandwiches, etc. Plus, if you eat there and take your receipt to the craft beer shop next door, you'll get a discount.","Mimi's is a super delicious, cute, and intimate restaurant on Cortelyou. My friend and I had dinner here a couple weeks ago and loved everything! We shared the tabbouleh salad, mushroom hummus with pita, and mujaddara bowl with beet salad. The tabbouleh salad was light and fresh. The mushroom hummus was tasty and actually really filling, especially with the pita bread. The pita here is one of the best I've had! The mujaddara bowl was so interesting and full of flavor. I also absolutely loved the yogurt it was paired with. Although I typically don't love beets on their own, I enjoyed the beet salad and thought it was a refreshing side, especially next to a lentil-based dish.Despite coming in hungry and ordering just a few items, we were both full at the end of the meal and even had leftovers! Taste | 4.5Atmosphere | 4Presentation | 4Service | 4OVERALL | 4.5",I don't want to rate this Fantabulous restaurant.  I'll never get a table again. The food is GREAT!  It's superb!!!,"Mimi's Hummus is one of my favorite restaurants throughout Brooklyn. Every once in a while I take a pilgrimage to Flatbush just to go to this restaurant and enjoy the delicious hummus here.First off the Hummus here is the best in NYC. It is super creamy and has a great lemon zing to it. The normal hummus dish also has whole chickpeas and garnish with it to make it a fantastic meal. The simplest hummus dish they have is reason enough to try this place.Atmosphere wise this place is quite intimate. I would say its also romantic with its candles and nice atmosphere though you should expect it be a little cramp as they don't have a lot of inside space. It seems they started adding seating outside which I haven't tried but seems nice.Overall this is (imo) one of the best restaurants in Brooklyn. The service is good, they have great food and great atmosphere. If your in Flatbush I would highly recommend trying this place.",Mimi's Hummus
213,"I used to love this place, however I feel the quality of the food has changed.. It's also very salty now. I was left with a stomach ache after a sushi cup last time I ate here :/","Left with a stomach ache tbh not sure why. I got a miso soup which was very greasy and a veggie cup, the menu said it comes with quinoa which Is why I got it but when I got it i realized it was 90% white rice then a tiny bit of quinoa and toppings on top. My friend got a tuna roll that wasn't great  either. Don't waste your money.","Liked the salmon roll well enough, didn't like the tuna taku roll at all. Decent prices but wasn't a standout.","Ok, sushi cups!Spicy tuna or salmon Quick & easy meal","We had takeout from this place for dinner on a Saturday night.  This place basically has healthy Japanese food.  It's a bit pricey but the ingredients were fresh and the food was tasty.  We ordered the spicy tuna silver rice cups, spicy salmon rice cups, salmon kombu rolls, and tuna taku rolls.  The rice in the rice cups was interesting, flax seed rice which is healthier and gave it a nutty flavor.  The rice cups had raw fish with cucumbers on top of the rice.  It was pretty easy to eat.  The rice cups were $6.50 each so it wasn't too expensive.  The rolls were pricier but they do put a lot of ingredients in each roll.  I liked the tuna taku roll more than the salmon kombu roll because the tuna taku roll had pickled daikon, giving it more crunch.  I would come back to try their other dishes.",I was feeling for some sushi/chirashi bowl type one day so I looked up some places near me. I found Silver Rice and noticed it got great reviews so I decide to go there. I got the Unagi cup cuz I was feeling some eel. Gotta say the cup was pretty good. I literally finished the cup in a matter of minutes. It tasted fresh and well sauced and the ratio of rice to fish to garnish was well balanced. Its just a little pricey for the size of the cup which is my only down side but overall great!,Silver Rice
214,"Missed the b46 bus and for once,  so I decided to get one of their donuts. I'll keep it simple, I'm glad i missed the bus.*Maple glazed Donut.","Showed up right when they opened because I'd seen comments that they sell out of flavors and wanted to make sure I got some goodies. Problem is, when you show up right when they open, they don't have fresh doughnuts made and tell you Jelly will be ready in 1/2 hour. No thanks. Wanted to try something new but I'll just stick with Dough.EDIT - I see that the owner responded. All of the doughnuts were most certainly NOT lined up except Jelly. No Nutella. No Oreo. Multiple flavor trays empty. So I was inclined to believe what was there was from the day before. Especially with the flavor you're most famous for being unavailable for another 1/2 hour.","I finally decided to visit the donut spot and every time I'm in the area I will def stop by.  I wanted to try them all so I got 6 diff ones.  Rating Vanilla sprinkles 10, Maple Glazed 8, Boston créeme 10, Orange spices 9, Jelly 10, banana nut 8.They are good and fluffy.  I took 2-3 bites of each one and I was done.","bought two doughnuts from here this morning, a maple glazed and a vanilla glazed (i wanted to try their citrus but they weren't available yet and i was pressed for time). they were delicious - perfectly fluffy with a nice chew. for a dessert doughnut i probably would want more glaze but for breakfast they were just the right sweetness.the doughnuts were $3 apiece and enormous. nice service, and the place is very close to the J train. i just moved into the neighborhood but will probably be stopping by whenever i want something sweet for the morning commute.","Made a pit stop in Brooklyn to try these donuts. Would recommend coming earlier in the day as flavors sell out. We ordered 4 donuts: a citron/lemon frosting, glaze, chocolate frosting, and cinnamon glaze. It came with 2 free small coffees which was a bonus. They have a dense, cake-like consistency. A bit too sweet for my preference and I was content after a few bites but this and the size makes it great for sharing.","Just walked 12 blocks to come here for the strawberry filled jelly donut I've been reading about but they've replaced it with some artificial low-grade stuff they don't even use at Dunkin' Donuts. I'm so disappointed and threw my donut out after two bites. I'm only giving it 5 stars because I don't want to ruin their rating - but my initial reaction was a 1... harsh, I know, but  that's what this place showed me today.Edit: I really appreciate the reply from the owner. It's clear there's passion here and maybe I just tried the wrong item... maybe that jelly donut would be perfect for someone else. I will be back to try the other varieties because the donut itself was yeasty and indulgent (which I love). Oh, and the girl working the counter was lovely. My apologies for throwing bad energy out there first thing this morning.",Fat Doughnut
215,"Eh so the corn looked amazing but it just didn't do it for me. We make a quick stop in here because it was pouring out. Our corn wasn't hot. It was like if the corn was just sitting in water for a long time. Besides that, we also had the classic margarita which was quite tasty","I was excited to try this place but it was kind of a letdown for the following reasonsI came in wanting the fish tacos but they didn't have them. I was going to settle for a nice mix of carne asada, carnitas and avocado tacos but they wouldn't let me mix. So again, I settled on just carnitas. The area we sat in smelled heavily of bleach the whole time. My carnitas tacos were decent, maybe a bit dry and I did like that they came with rice and beans. Unfortunately, my drink was not strong enough to make me forget all these transgressions.","Thursday evening for dinnertime, was able to snag a couple of seats near the ledge before the crowds started showing up. Small interior with limited seating and an open kitchen up front.Only one waiter for the entire spot, so took a while to get our orders in. Simple menu with your regular Mexican options. Opted for the Chicken Quesadillas ($14) - a significant tortilla stuffed with cheese and chicken. I like how the meal comes with rice, beans, salsa, sour cream, and even guacamole. Lots of flavors to combine together and work with, especially with the various hot sauces on the table. The extreme cheesiness and toasted tortilla really made the meal.Again, service is slow due to only one guy working all the tables (and assembling some orders). Not really a good place for big groups - yet a nice spot for a low-key dinner.","Man this place is so good! I've been here a couple of times before concerts at Barclays and am never disappointed. We arrived around 7:10 and there was a line out the door! Having been here before we knew that it would be worth the wait. The restaurant itself is fairly small. Most of the seating is at the bar or a few tables. Our group of 4 was seated at the bar around 7:30. We started with an order of the Brooklyn Queso and a round of Margaritas. The Margaritas are made well and the rims are super salty (to my liking). The Brooklyn Queso was super tasty as well. We ordered the fish tacos, carne asada quesadilla and carnitas tacos. Everyone was super happy with their food. The tacos are made with authentic corn tortillas and are super tasty. They have all the fixings and the carnitas were so juicy. The carne asada quesadilla was fantastic. Normally the steak in quesadillas is over cooked but this was medium perfection. We were so happy we waited. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!","Burritos are easy to make. Burritos are fun to eat. Burritos are life. When you come across the food Challenge presented by Don Chingon, you start to see burritos in a new light. Don Chingon has become one of Flatbush Avenue's best spots for a bite to eat and/or have a drink. Delicious Mexican food and tasty tequila or mezcal drinks to help you feel alive. You can even people watch if you get a seat by the window. They have a pretty solid happy hour to take advantage of. Make sure to get there by a good time though. The place can fill up and isn't the largest. The tacos here are my favorite. As alluded to before, there is a food challenge here. I love burritos. I can't quite imagine myself eating an eight pound burrito though. Even if it means a percentage ownership of the business or something crazy like that. Someone told me it changed to a group challenge, but I have no idea. Give them a call if you're that crazy. This makes for a great spot to eat before an event at the Barclays or if you find yourself in the neighborhood.","I'm here right now! Second time and I still love the food and vibe! Open air and delicious. I'm picky and I love this place. This salsa is freshly made, the elote is a must, and the chicken quesadilla could last you two days but you won't want to stop.  There's always space, a game on the two TVs, and the margarita's are carefully made with flair by Marco. A GREAT PLACE!",Don Chingon
216,"Wat in ACTUAL tarnation. We came to NY and stayed for not even 72 hours and felt the need to eat here not once, not twice, but THREE times. My sister is vegan (I'm not) and it's not like there aren't a plethora of amazing options...Champs is just that dope.One late night run and two breakfast stops- there is not one thing we had that didn't rock my world. Seitan asada fries, tatertachos, breakfast burrito, kickin' cowgirl, mac and cheese, the burger with the artichoke dip and onion rings- everrrrry thing had amazing flavor and such a good mouth feel. If I lived in NY I'd be at this place every damn week. Food aside, the service was also amazing, everyone was super nice, and one of the waitresses even spotted us some of her glitter for the pride parade. If you're vegan/vegetarian/carnivorous/human I highly HIGHLY recommend.","ONE OF THE BEST!!!!-Mac n Cheeze, Po Boy, and Buffalo Cauliflower are all worth trying, open late too.","I have never experienced a restaurant where the customer service and staff were as abysmal as Champs Diner. Ever.My friends and I came by (they are both vegan) for a late night crave so we got take out. Upon ordering, the staff was dismissive and cold -- but it's late so alright I'll let it slide. Next, we were waiting by the counter area (NO ONE ELSE WAS THERE) when we were promptly told to literally wait outside -- no please, no question, no nothing. They literally just kicked us out, and it's not like they had any new customers coming in or that they needed the space. Next, when our orders were ready, they stupidly decided to call out our names, even though the restaurant was very loud, we were outside, and we couldn't obviously hear. Once we saw them with the take out bag and checked it was ours, they seemed so impatient, like WE were the idiots for not hearing them over the noise inside and the WALL. Oh, did I mention the food took forever too? And they forgot nearly half the order, at which point we were the ones who had to point it out.The staff also had the nerve to start putting up chairs before closing and while half the restaurant was still packed -- if you want to get out so bad, maybe just close early.The arrogance, rudeness, and unprofessionalism of this staff makes me want to never come back, regardless of food quality.","Chicken and waffles ? Lobster roll ? Someone please tell me why humans keep eating animals at this point ?! LolChamps food is soooo good. They need to expand to ATL (wink*wink) I came on a Monday afternoon. Maybe 11:30 and it was crowded. Maybe 1 extra table. I was surprised. But after eating the food, I totally understand. I had the chicken and waffles and it was delicious! The waffle was a crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. The chick'n was soo good. I loved the breading and it wasn't dry on the outside. Im pretty sure it was soy. Im not a fan on seitan so this was perfect.My grandma had the lobster roll and fries & she loved it. She said it tasted just like seafood & the rolls was crispy & buttery. She loved it. Only bad thing is we ordered biscuits & butter to go and about 10 mins after leaving, the brown paper bag ripped and my biscuit rolled on the nyc streets. I was sad af ! Get better bags :) lol","First visit, came for date night.  Parking is scarce (street parking).  We came around 7pm and the first available parking spot was two blocks down. Restaurant is small and seating is tight, very little elbow room between guests.  Food was good and our servers were very efficient.  We started off with the cauliflower wings.  It was very spicy but good.  For our entrees we ordered the Reuben and the Mac attack bowl.  I ordered the Reuben and was surprised at how closely it mimicked a meat texture. I highly suggest the Reuben. My fiancé ordered the Mac bowl and enjoyed it thoroughly. Spices from the buffalo sauce with the grilled chicken, cheesy from the Mac n cheese, and tangy flavors from the pickled onions, it was a first for him but he was very pleased.  We decided to order dessert, the Cooke dough sundae.  The ice cream looked to be home made.  I wasn't to hot about the cookie dough taste, the cookie itself would have been better enjoyed if it were crunchy but overall it was good.By the way....everything served is entirely ENTIRELY PLANT BASED and FREE OF DAIRY PRODUCTS","I have to say it was quite delicious... Their philly  cheese steak is on point. Their chocolate chip cookies are HUNORMOUS! All the servers were really nice but the gentleman behind the counter who sold me the cookie was mehh as far as costumer service. (I'm really big on that and can read faces really well). The AC was blasting so I was freezing, I recommend a sweater!The food was honestly worth every penny!",Champs Diner
217,"I was looking forward to finding a great place in the neighborhood that I could regularly stop in for a decent meal on weekdays. Unfortunately I left disappointed and later a bit infuriated. Starting with the food, I ordered the prosciutto and pickles to start with the short rib and polenta for the main. Although the restaurant was almost empty it didnt stop the servers from rushing me out the establishment. Both my short rib and prosciutto plate arrived the same time, ok cool they're in a rush. However, the short rib was luke warm, lacked salt, and the polenta was watery with no texture and minimal flavor. Ok maybe they had a bad day I would normally give them another try. What was upsetting and why I will not give them another try is the service. The staff was not remotely friendly and seemed like their main aim was to get me in and out very quickly. I came to the restaurant around 6:30, which is happy hour for drinks until 7. Throughout the course of the meal (which lasted 50min) I had two drinks. When I received my check at 7:20, I noticed only one drink was HH. I asked the waiter if the second should be on the HH price he said no its after 7. Again, irritating but I'm completely fine with that it's their policy. What made me upset is when the waiter swiped my card he included gratuity as if I would not have paid him for his service. I have rarely been treated with such disrespect  at a restaurant and will not being going back, I'd  advise others to do the same.",Incredible Italian food with an equally cool interior.,"I can't speak for the food because we didn't even get to sit down, but I can say the service is the absolute worst I have ever encountered. And that's saying a lot, not even in 3rd world countries is service so unprofessional. We arrived around 8:20pm. The hostess told us it would be a 15/20 minute wait. Being a Friday night, it's normal that there wouldn't be an open table, and after a minute of deliberation, we decided to stay. Soon after, hordes of people began arriving, and waitress asked us to confirm if we were staying, I said yes. I even asked to view a menu while we waited. The waiting space is tiny, practically non existent, but nonetheless we waited patiently. Please note that given the tiny space, the hostess could see us standing there. She even smiled at a us a few times while we waited. I noticed a few people who arrived after us were shown to a table immediately. I let it slide, figuring that they had reservations. Then, about 25 minutes of waiting, I asked the hostess how much longer for a table. She acted surprised we were waiting for a table, and said she thought we were leaving! When she specifically asked if we we would wait, we said yes, and we waited for 25 minutes right in front of her and she still had the audacity to say she thought we leaving! Who in their right mind would think we were leaving when I asked for a menu and then waited for 25 minutes?At this point, we were visibly upset, waiting around for 25 minutes like idiots, while she had shown people that arrived after us a table. Never in my life did I imagine a restaurant with such high reviews to have such an incompetent hostess.Edit in response to the owner:When you asked to confirm if we staying, neither of us said ""no."" We both said yes. That is why I asked to view the menu! Who would ask to see the menu if they were not staying?!?! Better yet, who would wait in a tiny space if they were not staying?!?! Don't worry, after the terrible service, we have no intentions of coming back.","I love this place, I've come here with co-workers, friends, my wife, family-- it seems to work for every occasion.  It's a nice atmosphere, warm and cozy.  The food is fantastic-- I love the arancini balls which they only serve during the week. I wish they would have it on weekends too. It's definitely a must try.  All the pastas are good, I have worked my through their menu and they're all unique in their own way.  In general I've yet to have one bad meal here.As far as deserts go, the donut holes with chocolate or the olive cake are exceptional.","Best happy hour in Greenpoint. Okay, second best after El Born. They give you a choice of their most popular appetizers for ridiculously cheap and in addition to discounts on wine and beer, they have a few cocktail specials for only 8$. I dont remember the bartenders name, but he's always there and he makes an excellent four roses manhattan in addition to the rest. I also strongly recommend the Oaxacan, wow.For food it is hard to go wrong. The meatballs, calamari, burrata, and any pasta. My suggestion if you wanna save a few clams while eating some is hit the bar for the apps and a few drinks then share a main dish from the regular menu. You will be full, happy, and not quite broke.","Great place!! The inside is beautiful, food is good! If you get a chance, get the beer! It's so good!",Naked Dog
218,"Came to Dar for brunch on a Saturday afternoon and was not disappointed at all! They have $30 deals that are inclusive of bottomless drinks (mimosas, bellinis, bloody marys) AND a whole breakfast entree! The price is enough to make you come back, but the food, flavor, and service really topped it off.","We came as a group of 15~ for a birthday brunch celebration. Upon arriving at the restaurant, it looked like a good number of patrons came to Dar525 because of its $29.99 limitless drinks, which basically every table had ordered. Overall, I thought the food was all right, but the restaurant was quite cramped and wasn't well equipped to handle a full house of patrons.Food: 3.5/5Value: 3.5/5Service: 3.5/5 - they tried, but things just weren't smoothAmbiance - 4/5Overall: 3.5/5Food:I had the Mediterranean pizza/flatbread thing as well as the scrambled eggs with sausage dish. Overall the food was tasty, and decently priced (everything was in the $10-$15 range). The portions were a bit small IMO, but then again I might be too conditioned to expect big food portions in general.Service:We were in a big group, so it's understandable that it would be a bit rocky from the service perspective. In general I think everyone's attitude was very good - from the bartender to the waitress to the buser. What did bother me was when the waitstaff would pour mimosas for the group, he'd do it over my chair and the mimosa would drip down the pitcher and onto my coat. It's a small thing, but bothered meVerdict: I'd come here only if it's NOT brunch time",Very good Mediterranean food. Should be 4.5 stars. No wait and very attentive service.,I got here at 1.... I did not get asked for my order until at least 2pm after our party of 13 asked multiple times. Bottomless? Jokes. I didn't get my first drink until more than an hour after I arrived at the restaurant. VEGGIE OMELETTE: The egg was mixed in with a delicate consistency with the other ingredients- very standard and what you would expect to find at any brunch place. SWEET POTATO FRIES: good Service sucked. I asked for my coffee twice before I even got it,"Overall- a good experience! My family and I came here on a Saturday morning looking to do a boozy brunch . The atmosphere was very cool, with a sun roof in the dining area past the bar. Pricing was extremely fair for the 90 minute bottomless, and the options for the Mediterranean food items were plenty. We all thoroughly enjoyed our food, everything was made to order. I got the Mediterranean omelette which was very light and satisfying. My only complaint was the organization of the staff. I'm not sure if the restaurant is still in the early process of training people, but our table was always approached in pairs which I thought was a little strange. And I feel like every 5 minutes a different person would ask us the same question. They should assign each waiter to different tables just to make things run more smoothly.Overall I think I would return for the food and drinks. Not my favorite brunch in Williamsburg but I left content","The ambience is really nice. Its a dark setting with pretty lights, the decorations are very antique and beautiful. For a date night, or for dinner with friends, this place is apt for everything. Loved the food too, and the best part -- the bill for 4 of us was $60. Its so cheap, we couldn't believe it. Will definitely return to this place",Dar 525
219,"SUPER affordable dumplings, very similar to Vanessa's (minus the sesame bread)! No frills, few seats.$2 for 6 dumplings (pork or chicken) and a little extra for the veggie. The dumplings are pan fried, and skin is thiccc. Be careful when biting into it because they're super hot !They also have an assortment of noodles (dry or with soup), rice dishes, and Chinese bun/burgers similar to Xian famous foods.Their 'spicy' is the MALA type, so if you get the cold sesame noodles spicy, be prepared for tongue numbing. I'd rather get that dish non-spicy to preserve its refreshing quality.Come here for cheap eats, but they're not the best dumplings you'll ever eat. I prefer mine steamed or boiled.But I definitely want to try their beef noodle soup.","Dumplings were good. I would go back again for their chicken dumplings. Price is well below the usually, which is awesome. I also had their beef noodles which wasn't the best. The noodles felt stringy and it felt as though A flavor was missing. I didn't end up finishing the noodles. The restaurant has a small homey vibe to it. Overall, a decent place.",Noodles or Noodies or whatever its name is not so good here.  Some other dishes I tasted are good in taste but high in prices,I've been harping about this place way too much but I just can't resist a good deal! This tiny little shop is slowly becoming my go to in Downtown BK. All their noodle and rice dishes are under $10 and they are so worth it. The beef noodle soup ($7) is packed with thick tender pieces of beef. We also got their zajiang noodle special with pork ($9) and it was equally delicious (mix well because it can be very salty).⁣⁣They have 6 dumplings for $3 as well as soup and egg rolls. I didn't personally enjoy those as much so recommend sticking to the mains!,"Dirt cheap dumplings and noodles off the beaten path of downtown Brooklyn. We were due to see a comedy show at Eastville and decided to come by Xifu for a bite. We ordered 2 orders of dumplings (chicken and pork that came 6 pieces per order) and a beef noodle soup. The total of everything came out to $13! Steal of a deal. The dumplings were meaty and well flavored. Leave it up to a true chinese hole in the wall joint to provide watered down sirarcha, soy sauce and vinegar at the table. Classic.I also asked the man behind the counter if they allowed us to bring alcohol and he said it was fine so we dropped by the wine shop down the block to pick up a bottle of wine! I mean, Xifu doesn't have quite the type of atmosphere where people are enjoying wine, but I definitely appreciate the option to.I'd like to believe that the sauvignon blanc brought out the flavors of the dumpling meat.","Chinese food that taste's just like my mom would make; homey, carby and doused in premade sauces from the Asian grocery store. This cheap, hole in the wall Chinese food spot makes fresh noodles and dumplings, and even offers vegetarian options! None of the food is particularly impressive flavorwise and I could easily replicate it at home, but at the price point why not just get some take out? I had the cold sesame noodles and the veggie dumplings. The skin to filling ratio was far too carb heavy for my taste and the dumpling itself was falling apart. Good vegetarian dumplings are a difficult thing to accomplish so I'd say they were only average if not slightly below average. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of fresh noodles in the cold sesame noodles dish. While the sauce wasn't well mixed (first bite was all sesame paste, last bite was all vinegar), it was tasty and hit that high sodium spot I crave when I want take out (because let's all admit there's no hope avoiding sodium in take out foods). There's little doubt that I will return to Xifu foods. While this kinda dinky, unassuming restaurant has a few tables the move is definitely to get take out. Xifu foods is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Fast, cheap, and hits the spot the way a local Chinese takeout restaurant should.",Xifu Food
220,HAIR FOUND IN MY FOOD TODAY!!! Do they not wear hair nets at this establishment?? Im so grossed out. Will never eat here again!,"Usually ok. Today I had delivery and they gave me a burnt, dried out biscuit. Can't even eat it, and the jelly won't save it. For $5, this is disappointing. Especially for this little piece.",I ordered on Postmates. The delivery was fine. The kale salad was ridiculously small. I mean a salad at chopped or sweet green is bigger than what I got for $9. I was highly disappointed. In addition the salad was salty! Not to mention my mac n cheese was missing.,"i struggled a bit with this review, because for me, it's usually easier to pinpoint what sours an experience rather than what makes it mindblowingly good. even after multiple visits, it's still hard to say what exactly tamra's magic is, but i'm gonna give it a try (though i'm still not sure i can do it justice).firstly - the food. it's in a genre of its own: creative, fun, DELICIOUS, next-level comfort food. even the restaurant itself reflects some of that - i absolutely love the brightly flowered, yellow tables that remind me of quick, delicious dinners at home when i was a kid before i'd run back out to play. the tv can be showing anything from an episode of friends to a korean drama or a soccer game.tamra also passed the highest bar a restaurant can for me - i brought my parents there, and they loved it. my old-school korean mom was really excited to have a place nearby that she likes, and my dad recently asked me to bring some coconut oxtail back. we live in deep brooklyn, a korean food oasis, which had been pretty much the only kind of food that gets a thumbs up from them previously. they're really picky and it speaks to the quality of the restaurant that its food appeals to pretty much everyone.i want to highlight a few of the star items that have already been praised by many other reviewers, and confirm that's with good reason - the coconut oxtails are always good, as are the wings. however, if you have a chance, also give the vegan mac and cheese a try - it's rich and yummy and addicting. the grilled mackerel is my mom's favorite (perfectly cooked and presented) that surprisingly won me over, too. also, get the FRIES. their sauces are so good and even better on some perfectly crisp potatoes. and lastly, i've paid extra to have a separate plate of pickled veggies, though many - if not all - of the dishes come with some. they're also super refreshing but with deep flavor, and go perfectly with the dishes.second - the versatility. i came to tamra one night with a group of five people and we each came out with a different favorite dish. that's partly the reason i didn't write too much about the dishes themselves earlier on in this review, though i could have waxed on. mileage will vary. but if you don't like one thing, i will honestly recommend you try something else on the menu, too - i have great faith that tamra has something for everyone.also, check out their instagram for weekend specials or drop by if you're in the neighborhood and check the sign outside. i've come here so many times but i know i can drop by and there will always be something exciting to try, be it a new dish or drink (their drinks are real good, too - everything is).and lastly, the vibe - tamra is so happy, relaxed, and makes you feel good just being there. the staff are great and passionate about their food (and i think are also really involved at different events nearby and in brooklyn), and there is plenty to eat and do - there are even boardgames and books, which will be great for the inevitable time i come here to just enjoy a meal by myself and relax.that all said, Liana L. and i once came here for brunch, hung around the neighborhood for a few hours, and then came back for dinner. did not regret it one bit. tamra is really good - please do yourself and some friends a favor and go visit.","Excellent food!  The service and prices were really good too!  It's a great spot for pho, vegan and gluten free items too.  I came out from Queens just to eat here!  I heard so much about it!  Im really happy I got to eat here today!  Thank you! Very delicious hot and authentic.",Came in yesterday with the intention of getting food to go but ended up just eating there because it was such a chill ambiance. I got the papaya salad and it was packed with flavor and tasted so fresh! The wings were.... wow. I truly didn't expect the wings to be that good. Super juicy and tasty and the sauce that accompanied was the perfect relief from all the savor. Definitely will be my new go-to spot since I live down the block Update: I'm gonna have to change it because the last few times I've been here and had the oxtail.... they gave me two pieces of oxtail. For the price that's ridiculous. If you want oxtail at a good price and hefty amount I would go to fisherman's cove and call it a day,Tamra Teahouse
221,"One star for a service experience - we had such an awkward exchange with the hostess we didn't even eat here lol. We walked in at 5pm, the restaurant was empty except for one two-top. We get asked if we have a reservation regardless, we replied no -- it's always funny to be asked this in an empty restaurant. After staring at her iPad for a long time, she asks if we can be done eating by 6:30 because they have reservations coming in and we reply yes, this is more than enough time for us. She then goes to seat as at a really weird table - right by the open door that leads outside. Since it's warm out we ask if we can move a couple seats over (away from the door)... since the place is empty (we don't state this part). She gives us a stressed out look (I doubt everyone with a reservation has dictated their table choice, and we have already agreed to leave on time) and proceeds to then sit us DIRECTLY next to the only other couple in the empty restaurant. Did I mention it's 'empty' yet?! :)At this point the situation felt comical and uncomfortable - but mostly it was strange how difficult the hostess was making everything. We ended up just saying we'd go elsewhere to avoid any additional back and forth with her. If I was the owner of this place I'd be concerned. She basically scared us off!",Did not love up to the hype. Greasy bland food. I did buy the kitchen a round. The place was spotless.,"Would you knowingly get on a sinking ship? Or a plane that's about to crash? It's only a matter of time before Bricolage eats the pavement, so save yourself the visit. We showed up for our 7:15pm reservation last night, a managers laptop and paperwork is left on the empty bar (huge hospitality red flag). A server ""greets"" us cold by saying ""I'm a server, someone else will seat you"". Another server is complaining about the broken iPad at the POS near the host stand. Eventually the hostess saunters out of the bathroom, says she needs to check if a table is ready for us in the mostly empty restaurant. She comes back almost ten minutes later and seats us outside. On the walk to the patio, we pass the open kitchen which was absolutely disgusting - a hotel pan of nine pans on the pass held out of temp, a mixing bowl of tired looking slaw on the counter. If DOH saw this, this would be a shut down for health code violations. We sat at our table, looking at the few joyless diners on the back patio. A woman at an adjacent table asked a food runner ""do you know who our server is?"" She responded ""I don't know..."" and walked away. Almost 15 minutes passed without a greeting or table touch or water from a server. In that time, we called Claro to see if they had a table, and they were happy to accommodate us with great service and delicious meal. We actually got up and left our table and walked out of Bricolage without anyone noticing. NYC is full of great restaurants, no one tells you about the terrible ones: take note, Bricolage is one of them.","My son and I got together for a nice dinner, and at his suggestion, we went to Bricolage. What a fantastic dinner! Between the crispy egg rolls, pork rims, and steak. I highly recommend it to anyone in the Brooklyn area.Great place and friendly staff.","Decent Vietnamese food in a gastropub setting. The flavors were a bit more muted than traditional Vietnamese food. For example, the Cup of Pho's flavor was mainly salt, rather than the complex broth I'm used to. Additionally, the only detectable flavor in the Papaya Salad was the fried onion condiment. Despite this, the peanut sauce for the summer rolls was phenomenal! Among one of the best I've had - I wanted to eat it plain with rice at the end. The lemongrass tofu dish was really the only familiar flavors I'm used to at home and my girlfriend said it was her favorite dish that night.","The service here is great. The staff especially the bartenders are polite and very friendly. There was a bit of a wait so we sat at the bar. The crepe was delicious, and so was the beef/steak. When you check in on Yelp you also get a summer roll. I liked the watercress salad too",Bricolage
222,"Food went wayyyy downhill. Sacrificed the quality of everything here. I used to be a big advocate of fette sau but I will not be returning, nor recommending this to anyone else.","Have been to this place few times before. It was ok and the meat  was delicious. But this visit was horrible. Meat was completely nothing special taste and have many fat inside (brrrrr) , and I have bad after taste for many hours. The old cashier lady at counter have very mean and not friendly attitude. Like she even almost push me to give a tips(I never saw that before nowhere) and buy their boring sides. Really when you have like this overpriced self service place, at list you can provide friendly and nice workers, like I don't want to pay my money to mean people. So sad that this place is like this now. Never will come back and it's many opportunities in Williamsburg and LES.","This place was quite the disappointment. I was expecting much better, especially for the $75 we paid for the to-go order we picked up ourselves. The brisket alone was $30 for one lb. and it was mainly fat. The brisket itself was plain, no flavor at all. The baked beans were decent. The potato salad nothing to write home about. I was shocked that the dinner rolls aren't even made from scratch. They give you pre-made rolls you might as well buy at the grocery store yourself.  Good for them for managing to stay open despite the subpar food.","I was planning on eating dinner later in the day, but my plans suddenly changed at 5:00 pm and I was near Fette Sau and decided to see if I could get in without too much of a wait.  I pulled up and found a legal parking space directly across the street and then walked in to find a few empty tables and absolutely no line (first time I've ever seen that!). I took a look and ordered a nice mix of Burnt Bacon Ends, Pork shoulder and Beef Brisket. I was reasonable and only ordered a 1/4 of each and then sat down with a chatty and friendly couple from Korea (all those empty tables had filled up while I was on line ;-)As always, the BBQ was superb and definitely worthy of the best of NYC title!","Love the atmosphere, very chilled out barbecue joint where on a nice day you can grab a table outside as well. I was worried about this being very crowded having come on Saturday at 6:30pm but was able to easily get a spot for 4. It is self serve for drinks and food (separate counters), the line for food moved fairly quickly. We tried:Black angus beef brisket: texture was not bad- there were some pieces that were less than tenderBerkshire St Louis Pork RibsBerkshire spicy pork sausage: not enough of a punchBerkshire pork belly: this was the best item, melt in your mouth tenderEverything was not bad, I think everything I had could be a little bit more flavorful. It's a really nice place to hang out with friends.","THE BAKED BEANS SIDE DISH IS SO GOOD. I would even just order this as my main. It's got meat in it and the sauce is nice and tangy (better than the other sauces out on the tables).We got the beef brisket, pork shoulder, and pork ribs. I wish the ribs had more meat on them & the brisket was juicier. I appreciated how the server proportioned our meal for us based on the number of people in our party & the number of mains we wanted. On a Saturday around 6:30pm we waited in line for a good 30 min before we got to order.If you've ever been to Green Street Smoked Meats in Chicago, this place is basically that!",Fette Sau
223,"Honestly haven't had much here I didn't really love in my few visits. An interesting mix of South and Central American, Spanish, Italian. The soft Italian cheese dishes (forgetting names) are to die so are the empaniditas, arepas, rack of lamb. If I had one tiny criticism it would be another menu chalkboard on the other side of the dining room. I don't mind no paper menus but it's a lil awk to have to walk all the way across the room from your table and stand there to see what they have that evening. Otherwise, keep on keeping on.","Overpriced, staff is slow and rude. I've been twice - the second time, it took over 10 minutes for the waitress to take my order. $15 for half a grilled tomato...",Amazing place! Found it by chance and I'm so happy I did! I don't live in New York but if and when I come back I'll stop by again. Drinks were insane and the food.... I'm still speechless.,"So hard to take pictures in here at night because the lighting is so dim! But that's not even a down-side--it adds character to this place.The bartender was knowledgable of the menu and recommended various drinks to go with our food selections. He also made sure to consider food allergies that I have (a plus!).The menu changes daily, I think. But we had the empanaditas, pea shoot salad (YUM), and yucca fries. This place is great for small bites, but also has some larger dishes for the hungrier.As out-of-towners, we asked many questions about the surrounding neighborhood and also asked for food recs in the area. The bartender tried his best but could only really recommend some bakeries. Not a bad thing, though!","Went here with some friends for dinner while I was visiting Bushwick. Was a very cute place. Very friendly staff and their cocktails were very tasty. The food was okay, you can see pictures of some of the things we got. Soft Shell Crab was excellent, as were the empanadas (not pictured). My friend who lives in the area said the pasta is usually excellent... ours was just okay, but apparently that's not usually the case. The simple fried ricotta dessert was probably my favorite. Very delicious. I would not get the squid ink mozzarella again, Cute spot, would recommend just based on the friendly server. Answered all our questions, gave honest recommendations, and checked on us very regularly.","What an incredible dinner spot! Last night we had a double date here, and the strategy was: order a bunch of stuff and share everything. We got: pork cheek empanaditas, burrata with squid ink, gnocchi, pork belly, monkfish, half rack of lamb, and dulce de leche pots. We liked all of the dishes, but the table got especially quiet when the lamb came out. I'm highly partial to gnocchi, and this one was extremely soft, creamy, and cheesy.This would be a great romantic date spot or place to pop in for a nice meal at the bar.",Maite
224,"Food is just meh though and quite pricey for the portions. We got the head on peel n' eat shrimp, king crab roll, and New England clam chowder. Shrimp barely had any flavor even though it was supposed to be cooked in a spicy cajun boil. Quality was questionable as well as some of the shrimp heads were all black. Clam chowder and King Crab roll were just okay. I think after a beer, soda, food, and tip/tax, it was around $80. Cool place to hang out in the summer to grab a drink and play corn hole, but would pass on the food.","Generally anywhere that serves crab I am all for- however, charging $34 for about a pound of snow crab is a bit ridiculous.. there are multiple places in Manhattan alone that have a better bang for your buck, as well as better flavor.I ordered the snow crab basket with cajun seasoning and garlic butter. I'm not sure how they put on their cajun seasoning, but I couldn't even get it off my fingers let alone on the crab itself. The garlic butter was also a bit of a disappointment. Wouldn't order the basket here again.The other people I was with had decent looking meals, but again, the portion sizes were just way too small for the price and the quality. If they elevated the restaurant, I could understand it a bit more, but for what it is - wouldn't go back unfortunately","Solid stop on a quiet Friday post-holiday afternoon with the boyfriend. We were lucky that we got there early enough so we found parking right on Reed and there wasn't too long of a wait for corn hole. The staff is always super kind and very attentive. We did some damage on some king crab claws, popcorn shrimp, a few beers and some mixed drinks.For those who complain about long lines and wait times, you get what you come for. You get in late, you'll wait. No doubt. If you play your cards right and start early you can still have a reasonable experience. I've had the cramped, long line, wave-at-the-bartender, kind of evenings, but that's when I drag a$$ and take too long to get there.","Love! We've been twice now, it's one of the few restaurants I don't mind receiving a longer wait time since the bar/downstairs area is awesome! Food is consistent, drinks are a bit pricey considering the beach shack vibe but hey it's NY. Definitely reccomend.UPDATE: my friend left their work briefcase here after a group of us came for dinner. When we called the next day, we were told the closing manager put it in a safe and we could come pick it up anytime. Beyond grateful for the manager going above and beyond to keep it safe.","Love!

Definitely recommend!","Nice spot to grab a drink in the summer, but in general everything here is kind of overpriced. The downstairs bar has a cool vibe though and there are plenty of tables to chill at or you can play corn hole in the front. The food was kind of blah. My fiancé ordered the popcorn shrimp which was pretty solid, but the Alaskan crab roll that I ordered was really tiny and had a lot of shell in the meat. We also got a side of Mac and cheese that looked good but turned out to be pretty disappointing. Zero flavor, just tasted like a thick unseasoned mess. I'd probably come back to drink here, but I would pass on the food.",Brooklyn Crab
225,Food was horrible! Pics were a fake advertisement. The wait was 30 minutes just for an appetizer. Staff very limited. Shrimp Ceviche was really a Shrimp tostada and the fish taco and shrimp taco taste exactly alike full of dough and grease for the batter. The calamari was so chewy I couldn't digest. I wouldn't go back - bad experience,I did not have a great experience with industry 1332. We had ample amount of problems and the pancakes were terrible. We waited 10 minutes to get greeted and then they ran out of French toast which was the main reason why me and my best friend came. After being so terribly disappointed by that fact that French toast wasn't an option we gave the pancakes a try. Smh. Not good at all. Not the best place to go in Brooklyn if you want a good brunch. The mimosa was decent tho.,"I wanted to like this place so bad. I live three blocks away from it. The first time we went, the server didn't come up to us for 30 minutes so we left. I just went back again today and was disappointed yet again. I had a sangria which was overly sweet and tasted cheap. I also ordered a salad and when it came out it was wrong. When the right salad came out it was flavorless. I would've given it 1 star because this place is such a disappointment, but I gave + another start because the yucca fries were somewhat decent. Hope this place can get a new chef and get there stuff together. Much potential.","Absolutely would recommend this place 100%. Every time I go anywhere my biggest outlook is customer service , and let's say the gentlemen whom took care of us was exactly above and beyond. People don't understand that being nice goes along way.  The food was fenomenal and the drinks really really good!!!   Can't wait to come back and try few other things  Really nice staff !!!","Really cool spot. Came here for brunch and had the Huevos Rancheros. It was tasty with mild flavors and decent portion. The only thing I didn't like was the guac that came with the huevos rancheros. It had no flavor, no salt, no citrus nothing! My boyfriend had the 1332 breakfast and claimed it was delicious. He ordered it with turkey sausage, scrambled eggs, 2 piece toast and home fries and it came with a small mix green salad.  It looked good.For drinks I ordered the mimosa. OMG delicious I totally recommend it. You cannot go wrong with ""Buy 1 get 1 Free""! It was not sweet and I deff felt a kick after the first one. (Or maybe I'm just a light weight haha) I mean it was only 1pm. Very chill ambience, great customer service and with the music alone I knew I was in Brooklyn ... BIGGIE!!!!! Will definitely come back for some live music, drinks & dinner.","Memorial Day Fun! A couple of friends and I walked over after a day party at Nowadays. I had this spot bookmarked and glad we were able to try it out. We were greeted and placed in the back. I ordered the ginger uppercut in the mood for a ginger punch. Unfortunately, i didn't get it. The drink was a miss for me. Too pricey in my opinion and not enough kick. The food was great. The steak nachos were definitely top 3 in my opinion. The chicken  quesadilla was tasty. It was supposed to come with pico de gallo however it was left off our plates and we had to ask for it. I tasted the ribs and fish taco and they were good as well. The fried chicken was a miss. They were kind enough to remove it from my friends bill. Wouldn't recommend. I would go back for happy hour if i am in the neighborhood.",Industry 1332
226,Got 3 pastas and 2 of them were room temperature.Occasionally we'd get a somewhat warm bite.Expected more not for the price.Not to mention all of the buzz.Interesting wine selection and good location. But disappointing overall when you pay that much and get barely lukewarm pastas.,DAMN GINA! Only reso my NY-based bestie could snag was an 11:30 on a Friday. We all skipped breakfast so we could HOUSE pasta...And boy did we house some carbs my friends. Everything was phenomenal and we were rolled out of the restaurant. We got all of the Yelp-recommended items plus the seasonal roasted tomatoes with warm honey. Eat that with your ricotta bread. FECK ITS GOOOOOD.,Interior and pricepoint very misleading and food not really worth the wait and all that. BUT i will say the desserts are phenomenal and the two stars are PURELY for the dessert.,"For 2 people, get 3 pastas. you wont be disappointed, but you will be full. Just so much to try.Classic = Fettuccine with buffalo butterPockets of Sunshine = Sheep's Milk Ricotta filled OcchiMy Favorite = Spinach and Mascarpone filled tortelliGo.","Food: 5/5   Price: 4/5  Service 5/5  Ambiance: 5/5  Bang for your buck: 4/5 Recommendations: You have to get the whipped ricotta crostini. No question. Would I come back?: YES!!! Tips: Put your name down on the waitlist and enjoy the Brooklyn farm across the street as you wait. Review: This place was amazing. One of the best pasta places I've ever been too. The ambiance was perfect for a date or a group outing. There seems to be the right amount of seats at both the bar and table. The people saying that the pasta dishes are too small have not had handmade pasta before at a restaurant. The well-priced pasta dishes was just enough to satisfy you. We had three people and got two appetizers and our pasta dishes, which was the right amount of food. The whipped ricotta with the crostini with the marinated shishito peppers was well balanced, while the mushroom antipasti with lemon gave an umami bomb to the meal. You really can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes, but the one I liked the most was Spinach and Mascarpone.","Came here at 5:00 right when it opened on a Sunday. We were able to get in immediately without a reservation. It was two of us and we were seated at the bar top. We started with the artichokes to share - was just okay in my opinion. Then we got the tortelli which was melt in your mouth amazing. Must try! Also got the linguine which was really tasty but a little less unique. Finally ended with the strawberry shortcake gelato, which was enjoyable and definitely a large enough portion to share. Overall definitely a tasty meal but probably a bit overrated for how difficult it is to get a reservation. Also pretty pricey for the portion sizes. The atmosphere is crisp, clean, and bright.",Misi
227,"I suggested Pearl's for dinner to my family since I enjoyed it the first time I went.From the time we walked in, the young lady (on this Thursday night with a yellow shirt on) had a unpleasant face.After being seated it took a while for our waitress to greet us and then a while to even recieve one drink. After another 15 mins for our appetizers, I tried getting the waitress in the yellow shirt's attention. I said ""excuse me"" and all I got back was a stare and then she straight walked away. We were like wow.When the food came out, everything was warm but not hot. My bake and shrimp however was tasty. My sister enjoyed her Jerk Salmon and Macaroni pie. My mother couldn't finish her Bake and jerk chicken (after it was recommended to her) because the chicken was too dry and my brother said he had way better oxtail.So unfortunately, Pearl's did not live up to the expectations this time. I was really looking forward to it and as it's a Trini owned business. Maybe it was a bad day...",Amazing!!!! The service and food were impeccable! Some will say it's not authentic enough and things should be on the menu and they aren't and the food is too expensive. Go see for yourself! And why should Caribbean foodBe cheap and take out all the time? Food for thought,Please see my Clyde's review to explain why Pearls is now a 5 star contender! Yummmmmm,"THE BEST TAMARIND WINGS EVER. A bit Expensive for Caribbean food in Brooklyn but worth every dollar, quality ingredients unlike most of those other Caribbean spots.I recommend the curry goat! Very succulent and tender.","I had my birthday dinner at Pearl's tonight after having this place bookmarked and on my bucket list for quite a while. Pearl's is an extremely unique addition to this area of Williamsburg but so perfectly essential. Pearl's captures the true essence of Caribbean culture with their quaint tropical backyard that features bright colored picnic tables and chairs as well as vibrant Caribbean flags from different islands and greenery. The cuisine, tropical vibe and relaxed ambiance is an experience to remember. We arrived at 9:00 and were lucky to get a picnic table in the yard to seat 6. We ended up having 2 additional guests and the staff was kind enough to rearrange seating to accommodate our large party. They even had several bug repellent candles on our table to avoid the mosquitoes on this muggy September night. Our waitress was very kind and competent. We decided on the pitcher of the Traditional Trini Rum Punch to be most cost effective which served 2 drinks each person for a group of 5. The punch was nice and strong !!!! Loved the cute flags and sugar cane garnish. Everyone loved it. I was buzzed in no time. We ordered the Bake and Shark, Bake and Shrimp, Bake and Short Rib, Corn Elote, Oxtails and curry Salmon. The Bake here is perfect. Bake is a fried Flatbread. Bake and Shark is my favorite and I've had it at another local restaurant ""Streets"" and it was not as good. Shark was moist and tasty and the pineapple flavor gave it a sweet kick. Pickled cabbage was perfect and not filled with vinegar. The service here was phenomenal. Very happy with how my party was served. Everything was delicious. I especially loved the collection of sauces they provide !!!! I still don't know what a Shadowbeni is. Pepper and Tamarind sauce is my favorite. The combination of sweet and spicy ! Just like me ! The only down side is how small this place is and how packed and long the wait can be. Good food is not fast. Fast Food is not good. They played a lot of Caribbean hits inside the restaurant and Clyde's but unfortunately there were no speakers on the patio due to noise control I assume. This was a bummer. We decided to be our own DJ's. I will definitely come back to try some of the other dishes and the brunch menu. The vibe of this place definitely reminds me of Miss Lily's and I love to support my Caribbean people.",BEST CORN I HAVE EVER HAD.The service was good and the food's delicious.Will definitely come back for some more corn!,Pearl's
228,"Not worth the hype.  A lot of hipster bs and food was mediocre.  Waitress said steak was cooked medium and it came out rare.  When we asked about it she pushed the blame off onto the chef, saying the chef cooks it to their desires.  I would not have ordered the steak if I knew up front that it was cooked rare.  I was not able to finish the meal with how chewy it was.  Will not be returning.",Their wine selection is pricey. Paid $18 for a glass of pino Gris and they poured so little I was confused it was for tasting. Their food is good but again very expensive for what it is.,"One of the worst meals we've had in all of Brooklyn. Can't believe this place gets anything but trashed on yelp. First, don't come here if you want to actually have a conversation with the people you are with. The music is pointless, doesn't set any kind of mood, but it is LOUD LOUD LOUD. I'm not one to usually comment about the volume of a restaurant, but we could barely hear the people we were with and I am hoarse today from having to shout to just have a basic conversation with old friends. Not an auspicious entry.Started out with the slowest, most lackadaisical service I've ever encountered. 20 minutes before we could flag someone down to take a drink order, another 20 minutes before the drinks arrived...We had to leap at waitstaff throughout the meal to get any service whatsoever. The cocktails were icky - the rum quality was questionable, the options were limited. Oh, it's a wine bar, you say, so why are you ordering cocktails? Well, when we moved to wine, we were steered towards a particular bottle by the waitress. Holy crap, it was absolutely undrinkable! It tasted like a cough drop and a package of nails were melted down and served to us. Is there someone actually in charge of ordering at this place or are they just taking whatever is available on steep discount?And to the food. The short rib that CLEARLY wasn't actually a short rib and couldn't have looked less appealing upon arrival. The grainy, plain ricotta dish. The fish with teeny tiny bones throughout (though some had been removed, so it was a surprise when you got a mouthful), the poorly cooked brussels sprouts, the merguez and squid with the white beans that were undercooked, and last but not least, the only highlight, the chicken liver pate, which I doubt they even prepared.  I have never, ever been steered so wrong by a yelp review. This place is AWFUL in every respect.",Old van horn location. June is my perfect wine bar dash gastro pub. Service was so fantastic here.. from a few beautiful boys and girls Happy hour from 5-7 was on point Radish dish for happy hour looks like a million $ babeHighly highly recommend,"What a great find! Of all the places we could've chose from in the area, we are super glad we decided to walk in here. Without a reservation, our server was real nice and accommodated us quickly with a seat outside in their cute backyard area. The backyard is spacious and decorated nicely with a wood barn type feel and nice hanging wire lights above. If its nice out, I recommend getting an outdoor seat.They serve tapas here mostly, so small plates to share. I speak for all of us when I say the ricotta dip got us friggin hooked! so good that we ordered a second one before we even finished the first. I'm not sure how that ricotta was that garlicky and creamy but it was to die for. The toasted/buttered sourdough was perfect for scooping copious amounts of ricotta as well. The Heirloom potatoes were also a big hit for us. Nicely cooked fingerling potatoes tossed in a creamy sauce and chunks of sautéed crispy pork belly. The charcuterie board was simple and delicious. My only comment was the eggplant. The sauce was great but the sesame and flakes on top didn't do well for me, great flavor tho. The also have a nice assortment of cocktails and a huge variety of wines.  I got the Silk and Soul, really refreshing, and I highly recommend it!","CUTE! CUTE! CUUUTE! We were seated inside, but the happy hour crowd started trickling out and we moved to the garden and boy am I glad we did! Noticed other parties did the same. The patio deck and garden seating made the entire experience.When you order wine, they give you a swig first to make sure you're satisfied with your selection before pouring the entire glass. I chose a '17 rosé that wasn't too dry.Now the food is GREAT, suuuuper fresh. There were like 6 figs halved in the stracciatella. Ricotta dip was really refreshing, tomatoes were bomb, and sliced baguette was crusty the way I love. I can also confirm the succotash and chicken plate were decent at the least, only because the older couple next to us looked so impressed as they ate their meals. Yes, the seating is elbow to elbow unless you've got a larger party- just a warning.This isn't a 5 for me because desserts were confusing, plates are small (which I get, tapas = small, BUT for the price), and seating is tight.",June
229,"It's pretty obvious from other reviews - the food is delicious and vibrant! Came here on a busy weekend afternoon. I ordered a bunch of brunch items but the masaman curry was off the hook! accompanied by 2 light and flaky pancakes. Coffee is also on point! Tasty brunch selection BUT service was slow. From start to finish, my group of 3 spent 1.5 hrs in here. While waiting for my table, I witnessed guests experiencing difficulty getting servers attention for ordering or checks and dirty tables not immediately cleaned. Which is why they're receiving 4 stars from me. Staff was working hard but didn't seem like anyone was in charge or directing to keep staff organized. Everyone was doing everything for all tables. Perhaps splitting the room into sections and disignating a person to take care of specific tasks  to keep it organized. Aside from that, I would totally come back.. during off peak hours next time.","Came here for the second time yesterday with group of 3. All the seats were filled and we were awkwardly standing by the door since none of the staff wanted to acknowledge us. I even made eye contact multiple times and they didn't even say anything like ""one moment please"" or a simple smile. Finally a staff came up to us after 5 mins of standing around. However, there was no greeting, she just handed us menus saying it will take about 15 minutes to be seated and walked away. The food was good but service was so unwelcoming. Also we were missing a glass of water which we pointed out to the waiter but it never came.","When I went in, the guy( whom I'm guessing is the owner along with his parents) was very stand-off ish. The whole time I was there he did not smile even once which doesn't make you feel welcomed. Food was decent which is why they're even getting two stars- got the chicken sandwich, grilled jam and cheese, and hibiscus lemonade. The whole reason I went there was to have brunch and to get some work done. Clearly people go there with laptops. But when I asked for WiFi, they apparently don't have WiFi. He didn't seem to be apologetic or explain himself which I also thought was rude. Waste of my time.","Very nice spot that is a little bit away from everything else. The interior is like a typical cafe style with a warm atmosphere. This is a sit down restaurant. Great place to just relax and enjoy your food.The waitress/front of the house was nice and attentive to the best of her abilities. It was basically her doing everything and also attending to the customers.I ordered some Eggs Benedict. They were simply beautiful. Perfectly poached eggs, the whites easily give way to the oozing yolk. Crisp Canadian bacon and just as crispy toasted English muffin. All of that was topped with a light hollandaise that didn't overpower the dish. Then on the side, some seasoned house hashed browns with some bits of green pepper.It is defiantly worth coming here and trying out the place. Great way to start my day off with some delicious food that is appealing to both my eyes and stomach.","A hidden gem that stands out amidst the neighborhood. You might actually miss this place if you don't look carefully but this cafe has some foods that are hard to come across in Sunset Park. My favorite has got to be the eggs benedict, the eggs are usually runny and the home fries are perfectly soft but tasty. Runner-up would be the fried chicken sandwich. The buns are insanely jiggly and the chicken is tender. Have tried the blueberry pancakes and they were decent, though the fruits on the side were pretty fresh. Omlettes aren't really worth it and the pulled pork bun is good but also not worth it in my opinion. Haven't tried the others yet but am a regular here so any time now! Drinks are average, coffee just tastes like any other coffee. Hot chocolate is pretty good however, and would recommend the hibiscus lemonade that is only available during summer. Their service is on point too. Waitresses are very quick on their feet, taking your order and refilling your water. Only main con is that they don't take card and only has an atm machine which charges a fee. Nevertheless, it's a very neat place for this area.","The food is amazing and affordable.  I should try their latte next time, it looks good on the picture .",Parlay
230,We are planning to stay at the One 15 Marina soon and really looking forward to experiencing Brooklyn.  We have been scouring the internet looking for bars and places to eat near the Marina.  I have to say that JTHT sounds like a place we can't wait to visit!The petty ridiculous comments here by frustrated writers and food critics are all we need to know!  See you soon for brunch and dinner!!!,"I've never felt so discriminated against, especially on pride weekend. We arrived for dinner last night, and it was fairly empty. The hostess was extremely unwelcoming and sat us at the furthest table, in the back end of the dining room, behind a wall, away from all windows, next to the food runner doors, and bathrooms. We all felt awkward and unwanted, hoping we'd be able to switch tables. Instead, we waited almost 10 minutes for someone to approach the table, even with water. It was painfully obvious that we were victims of discrimination, so instead of begging for waters from a bus boy, we left. No one said a word to us on the way out.","Weeknight quiet cozy spot to have dinner. However, the tables are too close together, and we heard every single word of others conversations who were sitting 2 tables away. I had the steak and hubby had the chicken. We were disappointed at the price of the half chicken since it was almost as much as a steak. I buy organic chicken all the time and I know that its definatly cheaper then a steak. Also, they did not include the wing. They do have Oregon Pinot Noire which is a great wine. It's a nice neigborhood spot, and I suggest y oi u stop by in you are in the area.","I was put in charge of finding a place for brunch in brooklyn heights recently when meeting up with some high school friends, which was surprisingly difficult, since there seems to only be one other place in brooklyn heights that does brunch. JtHT takes reservations, but upon trying to make one, I found out that you need like a party size of like 6 or more in order to make one. Whatever though, they said that they wouldn't be that full at 11:45 on a Saturday, and they were right.When we arrived, it was probably only half full, and by the time we finished (1:15?) there were still probably 1 or 2 more tables left. It's pretty casual in here, but it feels comfortable, and I enjoyed my time here. Our party only ordered two dishes: the beef hash and the eggs benedict with salmon. They actually have some sort of funky fried oyster eggs benedict which looked... interesting, but I passed on it.My eggs benedict was fine. You don't get any sides that come with it, but it was enough to eat, so I had no problem with it. The salmon is kind of... well, it's not smoked salmon exactly. I mean, technically there is some, but it's actually a blend of cooked salmon and smoked salmon, and the smoked variety probably only makes up like 10% of the mix. It's kind of an odd choice, but it still tasted good overall, so I was okay with it.I don't have much more else to say about this place. It feels more like a 'breakfast' spot rather than a 'brunch' spot, if you can understand what I mean, but it'll work just fine for brunch needs.","What you find when you walk across the Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan and type in ""Happy Hour Nearest My Location"".  What a fabulous place.  The happy hour was reasonable and generous.  I paid $7 for white wine.  Every item on the happy hour menu was tasty, both drinks and small plates.  The Mac n' cheese was so good.  I think it's the best Mac n cheese I have ever had.  Creamy and with bread crumbs on top.  Great flavor.  I had the meatballs on Greek yogurt too.  It was wonderful.  The bartender and even the locals were friendly and funny.  Just really enjoyed the ambience.  I would come back in a heartbeat.","A consistently reliable, welcoming spot. Delicious food, solid wine list, good room. Have been a loyal customer for over a decade.",Jack the Horse Tavern
231,"Best dimsum place in Brooklyn, with the interior aesthetic to match. While the wait may be long (and it helps if you have an inside connection or yellow face - but fear not! gentrifiers are welcome as well), it's worth it for the quality. The service is quite good and you don't feel squeezed next to other tables (which happens at most other places). Not the most quiet, but what dimsum restaurants are?","They offer dim sum in the morning til around 2pm.They got plenty of option.Like chicken claws, shumai, shrimp dumpling, steam pork bun, custard bun, beef tripe, beef short ribs.....etcThey have the dimsum cart running around the restaurant, what you need to do is order what you want when the cart stop by your table.",i go here almost every weekend. tldr they're renovating from march 11 to beginning of may,"This might be my favorite dim sum in NYC.We arrived a little late around 1:30. The selection was starting to dim (ha), but they still had most of the necessary selection going around.We had the siu mai, pork ribs, lotus wrapped rice, shrimp stuffed pepper, rice roll with fried dough, and congee. My favorites were the siu mai, and the shrimp stuffed pepper, but everything was delicious.What I didn't try- the pork buns, pork dumplings, shrimp cakes, and shrimp balls. But hey, gotta leave some things to look forward to (like a tea from Ten Ren on the way home).The best part about East Harbor? Everything comes out piping hot and tastes fresh, as opposed to a lot of other dim sum places out there.","10.06.19 UpdateI wanted to give an update since it's been a while and because they finished renovating about a month ago. It seems like not much has changed after the million dollar renovation - some aesthetic fixes like lamps and ceiling fixtures, but it's the same old same old.Weirdly enough, it never got quite as crowded as I remember it getting, even towards the morning dimsum rush hour (11:30 AM). I'm giving one less star than last time for the following reasons, despite this still being my favourite dimsum in Brooklyn:1) The waitstaff is mostly hit, but sometimes you get a miss. Because the waiters are all rotating, you don't get assigned anyone in particular, but everyone is usually on their game. The person who set up our table already got us tea (strange) and I asked if it was gook bo (Pu-Er + Chrysanthemum) - she vaguely nodded and walked off. It was not. I opened the pot and was disappointed. I flagged another waitress down who was more than happy to help switch it out. I think this was because I was with my white partner, and she just assumed we wouldn't know what was up.2) The quality of some of the dimsum pieces are either not as good as I remember, or just that they were never that great to begin with. The Fung Zhao (phoenix talons; aka chicken feet) were mushier than I like, and Ha Cheurng (shrimp rice crepes) were thicker and less morsely than I prefer.All in all though, I'm still coming back because this is the best bet you have.","They had a wide variety of dimsum but some of the items that are my go to wasn't as tasty as other places. The shumai wasn't great, not sure if the chef was off that day but it was eh. Ordered the pork spare ribs with noodles, and a traditional one with black bean these were delicious. The  shrimp dumpling and shrimp fun noodle was okay, the wrapping was thicker that what i'm use too or the shrimp smaller. This place does get busy so be here on the earlier side and prepare to wait if you have a large party.",East Harbor Seafood Palace
232,"Decided to drop by to try the famous kimchi fries and tacos. Price is reasonable and tacos were pretty decent. Kimchi fries though, I wasn't particularly a fan of. Somehow it wasn't harmonious..","Update:  I was contacted by the owner and provided a full refund.I placed my order through Yelp VIA Grubhub.  They did not deliver or refund my order.  My order was about $35, so not happy with their customer service.","This used to be one of my favorite restaurants. Tonight will probably be the last time I order from them. I ordered 5 piece wings, which was a lie. They were wingettes, half of the wings. I paid $8 for some damn flats. They were not crispy at all and no good flavor. Even the chinese restaurants give you full wings. Also it was cold when it was delivered. The delivery man was rude and nasty. How can you charge 8 dollars for flats?","Always consistent, always lick-smacking layers of flavors in the food.  Every so often, I go on a Kimchi Grill binge, and then I take breaks.  Currently, I am off a break, and realized that I have never written a review for some dope ass food!  I have no idea what came over me, but here we go...The chicken wings are amazing, regardless of which flavor you choose. Crispy, but not dry.  The taco combo is a favorite, because I can never decide on one.  Whoever came up with this idea is a genius! I just wish they would add a little more meat in the tacos.  I love the layers of flavors in the nachos (sans pork for me).  I even order the kids combo, because I like Kimchi Grill's guacamole and black beans.  I usually have this as lunch, with a side wings.  Now, my most favorite thing at the Kimchi Grill is the Big Belly Burrito! I build my own... my signature BBB includes the juicy, exceptionally flavorful short rib, kimchi infused and combined black & pinto beans, kimchi fried rice, and guacamole.  You can select your level of spice as well.  Heaven rolled up!  I rarely finish the entire thing at lunch, but the second half makes the best dinner.  It's packed with layer upon layer of spicy goodness.  A harmonious relationship of flavors. I pray that the Kimchi Grill stays around, close to my office, and remains consistent.","While I admire that Kimchi Grill has attempted to create a unique fusion of Korean and Tex-Mex, its hard to taste anything truly unique. No fireworks here.The menu is incredibly overwhelming--so many signs extending from the main board menu ranging from new thai dishes and Korean tofu stew. There are vegan options there so at least there's that. The rice gnocchi just didn't have the same ring as deokbokki and felt so weird saying. Where's the potatoes and Italian roots in this? The texture of the rice cakes ( I counted exactly 7 pieces after paying almost 6 dollars) were not pleasant--rice cakes are already dense and chewy...why deep fry it? Why fight with its pillowy nature? The sauce was joltingly salty, not in a bad way. If there was less salt, it would be a winning sauce. It'd be great to taste the caramelization of the sauce like in traditional deokbokki sauce.  Then there was the grilled chicken burrito. For 10.75 it was generously portioned but the more I ate it, the more I hated myself for ordering it because without the salsa verde sauce ( a saving grace, really) it tasted so one dimensional--just a thick corn tortilla with black beans and rice and a few slivers of the daikon slaw. Besides the daikon slaw which was the only bright thing about the burrito--there was no cilantro or onions as detailed on the menu board. I don't recommend coming here if you're looking for anything authentic but it is filling.","I looked this place up online a few weeks before my trip up to NYC. I googled ""restaurants near Brooklyn Museum,"" since that's why I came up here primarily for (to see an exhibit). I had already mapped out exactly what I wanted, so I knew what to do. The menu is quite extensive and slightly overwhelming, so if you have food-decision making choices, definitely look at their website and place a ""to-go order"" without actually placing it (obviously). I got a lot of food, and I knew I wouldn't be able to finish it, but I also didn't wanna NOT try something. The only thing I could've gone without was the kimchi fries. I expected some diced/radish kimchee on them, but there was just the flavoring and other items on the fries. They were good, but I just had a lot of food.I would definitely return here without a question in my mind. I can only hope and pray someone where I live can spread the love of Korean food served in Mexican food styles (Korean tacos, bulgogi burritos, etc...).",Kimchi Grill
233,"A really great place. My girlfriend and I dined at the bar. The woman behind the bar was one of the owners and, of course, very knowledgeable about the menu and cocktails. And the food wasn't the awesome -- both imaginative and delicious. (Who would have thought of pairing kielbasa and calamari?) Our only issue was a group with one very loud talker (BTW, I really don't care about your bad drinking experiences) that sat next to us when there were more than enough seats at the other end of the bar. But I guess that's what you get when you sit at the bar.","Has become our go-to neighborhood spot. Specials are usually the way to go, especially if looking for something lighter or fish.","Came here with a friend because of a good review in New Yorker magazine.The food:  Pretzel was good, potato pancakes very good, Chicken and spaetzle in a paprika sauce boring.The atmosphere was the best part - cozy.It was icy cold outside and first thing we wanted was hot tea. They didn't have decaf black tea so we asked for hot water with lemon.The bill arrived with a charge of $6 for the water.  We called the manager over to ask about it.  Didn't ask her to remove it from the bill but thought it was out of line.Next thing, the owner came by.  He said the lemon and packet of SweetnLow cost him.  Within seconds, he flew into a rage telling us never to come back.  He was way in our faces and frightening.An assault over hot water.  Not such a smart businessman if willing to allienate us and probably others sitting near us over lemon.No problem not coming back.  The food wasn't worth another trip.Much better places in Manhattan.  Wallse or Heidelberg anyone?","Gosh, I love this place! Every single thing from the specials to the regular menu items are great. Even better, the servers are so attentive and the owners are regularly around and check in with diners to make sure they're having a great experience. Portion sizes are generous and desserts are fantastic, too. Over the past few years coming here, my favorites are: pork schnitzel, bolognese special, pretzel, rhubarb cobbler, lemon cheesecake, spatzle, salmon, fried mushrooms...pretty much everything!","Big beers and awesome food. The beers were awesome, and the food was much better than I expected. There's a sign in front, claiming this place has the best pretzel, and they're probably right. I would come back here solely for the pretzel; it was fluffy, crispy on the outside, and not loaded with salt. We also had the weiner schnitzel, which was good, as well; it came with a variety of tasty condiments.Service: 5/5Atmosphere: 4/5Food quality: 5/5Food quantity: 4/5Price: 4/5","Consistently excellent food and service! We had our wedding brunch here, and everything was incredible and delicious. The green eggs and ham are my favorite brunch dish, but don't sleep on that schnitzel.",Werkstatt
234,"If you like beer and are in the New York City area you need to stop into TORST.  I'd describe TORST as a minimilist bar.  They have 21 beers on tap and a seemingly endless bottle list (note: 20% off bottles to go). The beers are numbered and generally start lighter and end with mostly BBA (bourbon barrel aged) stouts. Highlights:Burger (dry aged) may look like a big mac but the taste, much better.Amazing staff, knowledgable, attentive and kind.Clean setting.","Talk about a bougie hot dog, yummmm. But seriously, there are always unique craft brews to try and I leave very pleased",I think someone accidentally dropped vinegar on my burger...or the whole kitchen sink! You know the burger patty was quality just masked by all those overly salty condiments.Overpriced beer in wine glasses.   Loud music.  I hate you.,"This is where good food lives now-a -days: in unassuming, middle of the road priced, craft establishments. Not fancy, not grungy, Torst is a blend of Scandinavian minimalism and Brooklyn craft beer culture. Phenomenal beer selection complemented by a small but well-designed menu that is perfectly executed on. Great burger and even better fried chicken sandwich. Forgo $25 burgers/entrees in Manhattan and check out the middle of the road in Brooklyn - where I'm finding the quality of food to be consistently higher and with more value.","Tørst has piqued my interest for months now, and I was finally able to remove it from my bookmarks last night. When we approached the entrance, we saw that it's been Michelin rated for the past 4 years (2013-2017). We were excited to see what the fuss was all about. Tørst makes you feel like you are sitting inside a cabin. The interior is decorated primarily with wood. They have some picnic-style benches on one side and some tiny cocktail tables as well. They have a limited food menu and what seems like an unlimited drink menu. Their beer selection spans across maybe 7 different pages, and they also have a small section dedicated to draft cocktails. They don't have a waitstaff so everything must be ordered at the bar. Their food selection is somewhat tapas style. The portions aren't huge. We ordered the sourdough starter and the sweet potato and chorizo fritters. The sourdough bread was mostly burned, but the butter spread that they give you is so amazing that we were willing to look past it. The fritters were 90% sweet potato and 10% chorizo. A little bland, but the sauce that they give you helps with some more flavor. The beer is served in wine glasses that have these cute minimalist tree drawings on the outside. They kind of have an Old Word vibe to them. I tried the Stands To Reason first which was good but I didn't care too much for the smokey flavor. The Scurry was much better! It had an aftertaste of honey and molasses which was perfect on a chilly evening. The service was good. I didn't have any trouble getting my orders in and the bartenders were nice. Overall, my experience wasn't on the Michelin level I was led to expect but I would return if I'm in the area. 4.5 rounded down to a 4.","Best food, service, food in Brooklyn. Boyfriend's favorite.Nice selection of beers. You will never be disappointed.Bartenders have good knowledge of the beers they carry.",TØRST
235,"The empanadas took years away,  for the first time I ate an authentic Spanish empanada.  You can taste the freshness, the ingredients your tongue can I identify. It's a new beginning making me forget all the Empanadas I've had over the years! Highly recommend their Flemenko mixture of frozen Margariya and Sangria to accompany your empanada.-Yohani","A group came here after a wedding. They service was pretty bad; they didn't clean the table until we asked them to, and it took a while to get anyone to take our drink orders. There was no sign on the door, and we were not informed that their credit card machine was ""broken"" when we came in. When the six of us went to settle our bill, a busboy attaches a handwritten ""Cash Only"" sign on the door.  Who TF carries cash? Moreover, they included gratuity automatically - this was also not posted anywhere. TLDR - the food was okay. The service was so-so at best. And the cash only scam was ridiculous.","Cant say that I loved this place.. Sangria was horrible wotat Ive ever had and that is all i drink, .. It was very cute and cozy. It was empty.. Service was mediocre..Food was okay, not the best.","This place made the best salmon I've ever had in my life. The staff is super friendly and the food is incredible! I have no pictures because I ate everything too fast, hehe.I'm definitely coming back!","Had dinner here  with work friends. We had two orders of the classic empanadas, a filet mignon and 2 orders of the off-the-menu Argentinian $40 rib eye.The alleged imported rib eye from Argentina was tasteless (it was just like any beef bought here) and the amount of mashed potatoes was just insulting, maybe 1/2 cup of mashed potatoes. (Why be cheap with mash potatoes??)They brought us one small piece of bread and when we asked for more it took them 10 minutes! and they just brought 1 single piece of bread!!Same thing with the water, we had to ask several times for water and they took forever to refill us.They only really good thing about our dinner was the empanadas.The two stars are because the price suggests for very good food and service and we had a mediocre experience.Sadly disappointed.","After driving by this place numerous times we decided to give this place a shot. Parking was definitely a challenge, though once inside the service was really good. I tried their Sangria which as a Sangria Aficionado, I found it to maybe need more of a punch (alcohol). The entree we had was the Parrillada which consisted of mixed grill meats like, short ribs, skirt steak, sausage, blood sausage (morcilla ) and grilled pig intestines (rather tasty). There was enough to feed at least four people. Everything was fresh and well seasoned for a mixed grill platter, this impressed me.The ambiance of this place was awesome, it's definitely a date spot. Knowing myself, and as much as I like eating grilled meats, I'll probably be back!",Cafe Argentino
236,"Ordered via Caviar on a friday night at 6pm. Got here pretty quick--in retrospect, probably a bad sign. Got Thai iced tea, Vietnamese spring roll (wanted spring rolls, this was something different), drunken noodles. Thai iced tea never came. Vietnamese spring rolls were four mini rolls that cane crispy but under fried, the middle was soggy and not golden but still white. Pretty bland. Some bits of ground chicken, vermicelli noodles, a basil leaf rolled together and deep fried. Unimpressive. Drunken noodle dish was not spicy but advertised as such. There wasn't any heat. The noodles were over cooked or sat out too long before delivery because it was mushy by the time I got it to eat ASAP. The sauce was also sour, and one dimensional. By far worst drunken noodle I've had in NYC. Will never order from here again.","So, so good! We came here for dinner on Saturday night. After a lot of cocktails with brunch, I needed something for dinner with a kick of spices and seasoning to pep me up. We live locally, so I didn't want to go far and Yelped for Thai Food in the area. At first, I was a little unsure. Asian fusion always worries me and I was concerned it would be another hip little joint that was popular without delivering much. My fears were unnecessary! We ordered the masaman curry (tofu), the duck in a pond noodles and started with the chicken puffs. My only issue is that there are only two puffs in a serve. Other than that, both the curry and noodles were a knock out. Both had so much taste and flavor. I loved it. The broth of the noodles is to die for. We will definitely return for more!",Tasty Thai restaurant that also features ramen. Delivery was fast. Food was a little undercooked. But not bad. Just not great.,"Misc has a new fan!!I'm embarrassed to say I've walked past here so many times (for at least two years?) without knowing what it was. The discreet signage and possibly its proximity to a wine bar had me thinking it was along the lines of another wine spot. Then I randomly decided it was a tapas bar (I don't know where that rationale came from). And finally, I put laziness aside (or perhaps gave into my curiosity having had eaten at most places along this strip) and looked it up on Yelp, only then realizing it was a pan-Asian eatery. That said, I've been on a Thai craze lately and remembered Misc. I did a quick browse through Yelp photos and menu items/prices first to confirm it'd be worth a visit and it exceeded expectations. Ordered the drunken noodles with vegetable and tofu, no egg, with mild heat instead of medium and it was amazing! Its been sort of a struggle to find top drunken noodles in my area. But these had the perfect fresh vegetables to noodle ratio, savory sauce, not too spicy as I wanted and fresh basil.  The servers were friendly and were able to make things right when there was a mishap with my dish. I was mostly there because of the 4-star rating, tempting food pics and reasonably priced noodles. I hadn't done much browsing in terms of the restaurant ambiance or aesthetic, so I was more than pleasantly surprised when I walked into an inviting, somewhat artsy space with blue walls and splashes of gold paint, a smartly positioned bar stacked neatly with a range of spirits--the perfect merge of trendy but chill. I tend to only go the drunken noodle route, but because this dish was executed so well, I trust Misc in the other popular ones and may even revisit pad Thai after many years. I also appreciate their model that caters to the sometimes indecisive, offering everything from Thai, to ramen and pho. Can't wait to return and try more of their menu items.*update: after skimming through some of the reviews apparently they have a lunch menu?! Disappointed that I also wasn't offered a lunch menu, rather a full priced regular menu as another reviewer mentioned (I dined at 2PM on a weekday). Hope that was an honest mistake and they still aren't keeping lunch specials from guests for profit.","This is generally one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. However today I definitely had to lower their rating in my book. My friend ordered food for me through seamless and it took over an hour and a half for the food to get to me and it was COLD. This was after calling them 10 minutes after the initial delivery time and I was told the delivery guy just left. I called 20 minutes later oh the food is here, he's leaving now. I asked if my food would be cold and they said no. They also assured me I would be the first drop off. I called again 10 minutes later asking what the ETA was as my house is 8 minutes away walking. Literally waited another 10-15 minutes and was about to leave my house to get food from the bodega at this point since I'm hangry, light headed and honestly pissed off. At that point the dude shows up with COLD food. I'm honestly disappointed because I get delivery here multiple times a month as well as dine in here. I was one of the first patrons when it opened and always recommend this place for friends. I honestly believe I wouldn't have gotten any food if I didn't follow up. I received no update from the restaurant that my order was going to be late, they had no idea what was happening with the deliveries, they misled me about it being delivered and in the end did nothing to make it right. I won't be ordering from here for a bit cause it's just disappointing.","AH-MAZINGFirst thing we noticed and could not help noticing unfortunately, was the super loud group near the window. All the other people in the restaurant kept furtively looking over their shoulders wondering when they were ever gonna leave/shut up. It's not ok to yell in such a small place, it doesn't matter how drunk you are. The servers were nice and they turned on the heater soon enough. Also of course the food was absolutely wonderful. We ordered chicken Panang curry and shrimp spicy basil fried rice. Also one papaya salad. Wow, wow, wow. They did bring out beef panang curry but had no problem switching it once we told them we asked for chicken. We also ordered a tofu pad Thai to go as well as garlic sauce chicken. Pad Thai had great flavor and the garlic sauce chicken had a lot of veggies which was a nice surprise. I later made lentil pasta with marinara sauce at my Airbnb and threw in the remainder of the garlic sauce chicken and it was perfecto!",MISC
237,"A good place for authentic Thai food in Brooklyn, the food was very good. Just went there the 3rd time for dinner, but I guess they added a new policy for tipping? 18% tips were automatically added on our check- a table of two. And no more 5% off discount even tho you pay in cash?","Long overdue review. I was honestly waiting for some bad reviews to show up before I wrote my review. When I first came here, it was only about 4-5 reviews which were all 5 stars. I honestly feel so bad giving a mom and pops such bad ratings but I was highly disappointed with my experience here. I first found this place on yelp. It came up as a hot new business. It has a very similar name to this wonderful thai place in san fran that I visited. I looked at the photos and it was very similar. Even the plates were the same so I was hoping this experience would be a replicate of that one but I was wrong.We found parking a block away but there were also spots in front of the restaurant. This place is kind of small; it's one long hallway. We were greeted by the owner in thai which was nice. It feels very home-y and nice. My boyfriend and I were starving by this point so we just wanted to order.We ordered 2 thai ice teas with milk, #31(chicken floss with papaya salad, two chicken wings and sticky rice), #26 (steak), and #4 (deep fried salted chicken wings). We originally ordered the chicken satay instead but after about 15-20 minutes of waiting they told us they didn't have any left. I don't understand why it took so long for them to tell me they ran out of an appetizer. They also forgot one of our drinks and we had to ask for it. #31 - This was probably my fault for not knowing what chicken floss was but i was expecting actual chicken. I was so disappointed when the dish came I almost thought they gave me the wrong order. The chicken wings were literally wings with little to no meat. The papaya salad was okay. Papaya was too hard for my liking (not ripe enough) and was way too spicy. Chicken floss was meh... The whole dish was just whatever and the portions were extremely small.#26 - The steak was small. It was also cooked well done and was dry and rubbery. I did not like it at all... also way overpriced!! The steak wasn't even thick it was very thin.Thai ice teas - These were decent. They didn't fill it up to the top so I felt kind of ripped off. On top of that, we ordered two but they only gave us one. We thought maybe they were making it but they completely forgot and we had to ask for another one. Chicken wings - These were good! Classic chicken wings!The owner was very nice. I even overheard his convo with another customer (we were the only two customers there at the time). I heard his whole story about him moving here from thailand. It was also kind of uncomfortable since we were having multiple issues with our dinner/order while he was literally gifting and adding extras into the other customer's food. He prioritized the other customer's food even though we arrived first. The other customer got all her food and more while our table was empty.Overall, not a bad place to come for some authentic thai food. There's probably not another place like this that i've found in NYC. Food is good and decent but way overpriced. I get the prices have to match the 'organic' and 'farm to table' aspect but I could do without. I was also expecting this to be like the restaurant from San Fran but it wasn't the same pleasant experience.","Very traditional Thai food taste here, will come back!","Food here is so legit. The iced tea is not super saturated with condensed milk, and retains a light, soothing flavor. The pad kee mao is not oily or super heavily flavored, so it doesn't mask any lack of freshness you sometimes can taste anyway in other lower quality Thai restaurants, and allows that traditional Thai lightly stir fried taste to shine. There is the right level of ""dry"" spicy which I thoroughly enjoyed. The veggies are still crunchy despite a 45 min delivery window and additional microwaving. Large fresh shrimps. I'm so psyched I found this place in Brooklyn. My husband and I have been die hard Sripraphai fans for years but recently due to pregnancy traveling over an hour to Queens is just unattainable (plus there is a chance this is better). I've been desperately looking for some authentic Thai food ever since we came back from Phuket and nothing so far has even come close to $4 street food in Thailand (plus my taste buds are just super picky now with the pregnancy and I instantly know what's good and what's not). Everything I tried recently was greasy, overly sauced, overly sweet and sour (""americanized thai food""). This place definitely is a game changer - will be a frequent visitor for a long time.","Sad to say, we were underwhelmed by our experience at this restaurant. Portions were small, and prices high. Soy sauce fried noodles (chow fun) with a few slivers of Chinese broccoli and only four shrimp, was $16. Of the six oysters in the oyster omelette, the two I got, and one that my husband got, were like shoe leather, and inedible.  The Brussels sprouts were cooked properly, and it was a large portion, but the sauce was cloyingly sweet. For $10, I expected more than five tiny chicken drumettes. They were OK, but not delicious enough for that price. One last negative is that I found the chairs very narrow towards the back, and had to sit a bit forward.On the plus side, the service was excellent, with our water cups being refilled constantly, even after we were finished and just waiting for the check.","I went to this restaurant for the first time a week ago, and have ordered delivery from there almost every night since. Everything on the menu is exceptional. High quality food, amazing flavors, huge portions, super friendly staff... couldn't recommend it more highly. BYOB",Thai Farm Kitchen
238,"Ugh. We were super stoked to go check out Chinatown in Brooklyn, which, you should totally do, just skip this spot. Feel kinda salty towards my fellow reviewers because we checked this place out because of the Yelp reviews and color me disappointed. I ordered the rice noodles with braised chicken, and I'm 99.99% sure chicken is not brown with the consistency of beef. The waiter assured me it was chicken. Nope. No thanks. Doesn't smell like chicken or taste like chicken, ergo, it's not chicken. The noodles were fine, my bf enjoyed his dish (although it later sought revenge and made him feel sick for a good chunk of the evening), and it's cheap but blah. No thanks. There are lots of other options in the area that I'll try instead.","This is an update from the last review... Although the food is good.. the service is the most horrible service i've received, & ive been coming for over a year.Ny boyfriend and i have been waiting for someone to simply come check up on us and get our check and also to get our dumplings to go. These two ladies just sit on their phone in the front and don't pay attention to anything. We believe that since he boss isn't there, they think they're in charge of everything and even their nasty attitude. My boyfriend brought the bowl up to the front to get it to go because it seems like they were coming any time soon and they gave us the nastiest attitude. After we paid i was waiting for my dumplings and one of the girls( the skinnier one) forgot to put our dumplings to go and started to give attitude again saying we said that we didn't want it. When did we say we didn't want it ?? She then proceeds to grab gloves and go pick up the dumplings from where she threw them out and give to us. We simply left the dumplings at the front desk and left. Never coming back although the food here is my absolute favorite but the service is nasty.","This is an update from the last review... Although the food is good.. the service is the most horrible service i've received, & ive been coming for over a year.","Wanted to try Yunnan cuisine, since my SO and I missed out 2 weeks ago while we were in Toronto. Decided to come here, and we saw that prices were very reasonable. Decided that we were here for the crossing bridge noodles, so we both got those. I've only had Yunnan cusine one other time back in Shanghai, so didn't have much expectations. Good to note that it's cash only.To conceptualize, I'd say the crossing the bridge noodles concept is very similar to pho, but better. I got the fish crossing bridge noodles, and my SO got the beef/lamb crossing bridge noodles. When we first got the bowl of noodles and plates of meat, etc., we were surprised at how big the bowls are (they're huge). Everything came raw, so we weren't sure what to do at first. When the broth came, the waitress was very nice and helped me put everything inside the broth bowl. I did notice that the broth for the fish one is clearer and richer, while the lamb/beef one had a lot more fine ground pepper (both very good). The meats were sliced very very thin, so it cooked pretty fast in the soup. My favorite part was eating the quail egg - the yolk is so good with the noodles. Only one I'm kinda unsure about is the black chicken - didn't taste much better than normal chicken.Would come again. The noodles are very good and filling, definitely worth the price.","I love this spot! The waitress was fast with the ordering and the food came out fast too. When I come here I usually order the beef crossing bridge noodle and the cold cucumbers.The staff brings out the food separately and pours it into the boiling hot soup in front of you. The crossing bridge noodle has a lot of flavors. The soup base is a little spicy because they add a lot of grind pepper. The noodles are my favorite. I love rice noodles. Ordering the cold cucumbers is a must when you're coming here! Favorite appetizer. I love the sauce they provide with the cucumbers. There's a sweet and spicy taste too it. Very unique. If you're around 8th ave sunset, this is your go to spot.","Yun Nan Flavor Garden is hands down one of my favorite noodle soup places, not just in Brooklyn, but anywhere.The crossing the bridge noodles are okay, but I've had better versions elsewhere. The prep is fun to watch but it's boring compared to their other options. The cold spicy noodles are quite good and perfect for the summer. The hot and sour dumpling noodle soup? Amazing and what I order 99.99% of the time. The soup is so tangy and full of very strong flavors, like hot and sour soup but amped up to the next level. The dumplings are meaty and tender, and the noodles have just the right amount of firmness. This noodle soup is wonder, joy, and satisfaction in a bowl.The interior is pretty bare-bones but clean. Sometimes they blast the A/C, especially in the summer, so it feels good for five seconds and then you're freezing for the remaining 30 minutes. They don't give you water unless you ask for it. You pay for your meal up front.Nothing satisfies my just-got-back-from-a-trip cravings like this place.",Yun Nan Flavor Garden
239,"This used to be my favorite coffee shop in this area. They consistently made a high quality brew, and even though the lines are long in the morning, the previous owner/manager/barista kept a smooth flow going. It took an insane amount of time for me to get one cup of coffee this morning.After waiting upwards of 15 minutes to order one cup of coffee - it was watery, flavorless, acidic, bitter and just lukewarm. It's unpalatable. This was such a *huge* disappointment... to waste so much time, spend my money and get a terrible cup of joe, esp. because they used to be so good! I don't know what happened but they really went down the drain...","I visited on Memorial Day. I am not sure if that is why our service was horrible. They told me Iced Coffee only came in one size, however numerous people after me were able to purchase a smaller size. I ordered the chicken sandwich. 1 star. All of the toppings (cheddar, bacon and the 1 piece of onion) were on 1/4 of the sandwich. My bf ordered a smoothie which came after we were done eating, also after several people who came after us received theirs. All in all I was disappointed with everything especially for the price-point. I would not recommend.","Don't think I'll ever come back here , I'll walk past &' turn my head .

It's a neighborhood where people actually smile at you on the street and know the name of the mailman. There are myriad signs on the windows of this coffee shop advertising music lessons, a post for a missing kitten, a posting about a community garden event. This space itself seems like its a popular meeting grounds for parent groups and first dates alike. It's versatile in that way.The menu features a standard array of sandwiches that are friendly to vegetarian, omnivore, and pescatarian diets. They were out of bagels, croissants, and biscuits when I went, which also feels like something that would happen in a small town coffee shop. I was limited to a few options but they whipped up a nice smoked salmon on whole wheat toast for me. My strawberry banana smoothie was quite good.A good neighborhood option for a simple meal and beverage.","The food is good (if slow to prepare), the coffee is good.  So why only 3 stars?Unless you are prepared to stand at the door waiting for the cafe to open, forget about ever getting a seat here.  Once the laptop brigade takes over for the day, they're not moving an inch.",PLG Coffee House and Tavern

When I asked the waiter/hostess if the workers could be more careful, he dismissed me and told me not to worry. Really unkind response. The service wasn't attentive until I was 90% done with my meal and they kept asking me if I was done which made me feel rushed.","Outstanding pancakes! The pancakes are cooked to perfection. Light and fluffy on the inside. They had a thin crisp on the outside. The pancakes were served with blueberries, strawberries, and bananas.Our table was right next to the sink at the bar. Unfortunately, we got splashed a couple times. We asked the staff if they could be a little more mindful since we didn't want us or our food to be splashed with dish water.

241,"We drove two hours to Brooklyn as Tanoreen came highly recommended from friends. The food was fantastic, but we were disappointed at the level of customer service. Our waiter highly raved about the shawarma sliders and suggested we try it, so we ordered it. It never came out, so we approached the waiter about it in which he told us we never ordered it. Instead of saying ""I'm sorry, that's my mistake - will bring it right out"" he argued with us and insisted that we didn't order it. He could've handled that more professionally. After that instance, he wasn't attentive to our table whatsoever. Another waiter came over to wipe our table down and asked us if we were interested in coffee and desert before we even ate dinner. We were expecting a different customer experience as we were so excited to eat at Tanoreen.","I went for lunch by myself and had soup and a fish entree. I was writing in a notebook while I ate, just relaxing. The restaurant was only serving two other tables--- nearly empty. And the other patrons had been there long before me and were having leisurely tea. Still, without asking me if I needed anything or seeing if I was finished, the waiter plopped a togo container and plastic bag in front of me. So rude. I was not even halfway into my entree. I really don't understand why he rushed me out.","Overated wish I could give no stars...Heard this place was great, but was very disappointed. Ordered 3 apps a salad an entree 72 dollars. My entree was over cooked and lacked flavor besides the over seasoned dry over done chicken that had the texture of cardboard, the seasoning in everything else was linear and quite boring for such a large menu. To make it worse the service was horrendous. Our waiter Paco was non attentive with only 5 tables and three servers there is no excuse and when I complained about the chicken being dry he only took half off when I didn't eat a much of my plate at all. I tried to be polite but that did not help. Never coming back here and I wouldn't recommend it. I work in the industry and this treatment to guests and food was offensive. What a waste of money I should've got bagels. Also to top it off I got food poisoning and am in excruciating pain thanks again!","I've been here twice, both time the service was on point (even when they were BUSY), and the food came out amazing.Everything I tried was completely full of flavor, so get your taste buds ready. The ambiance is alright, for the type of place it is.Pretty decor, and low light- excellent place to go for a dinner date, because you'll be able to hear each other well.","Dropped by with no wait on a weekend afternoon after a day of exploring Bay Ridge. I'd heard great things about Tanoreen, and wasn't disappointed. We split the eggplant napoleon and lamb shank - serious yum, especially the eggplant. I loved the combination of flavors and textures with that dish, and never had anything like it before.The lamb shank was good, but some parts were slightly dry. The parts that weren't, though, were out of this world delicious.","The fatoush, the eggplant, the hashwa, the talamee . . . where do I start? Seriously.The customer service here is on par with the best, too -- always attentive, always smiling.Tanoreen makes me happy -- genuinely, deeply happy.Here's to Levantine comfort food at its best!",Tanoreen
242,"Went for their pasta night special, and I got the taglionini ai funghi. It was very good! But it was soured a bit by their policies - be warned, their half price pasta dishes on Thursday nights are also half portions. (Our server told us this - I wouldn't have known otherwise.) Also we made a reservation, but they were busy and seated us at the bar anyway and then had us pay a surcharge for counter service. It was a small fee, but still weird seeing as we didn't choose to sit there.","We came here after work to try the tasting menu. In our opinion, the food wasn't worth the cost. We started with The broccoli rabe Caesar salad which was overdressed. Then we had a pasta and chicken dish to share. For the portion size, it just was not worth it. Then the dessert was a surprise and we both didn't enjoy it. The cost per person is 55. Go somewhere else. If you really want to try this place, def do for your own opinions. For us, it was just ok.","The food was great but because it's ""tapas""style, they rushed all the food out at once. We ordered 8 dishes - a few from each menu section. They brought out 5 of them within seconds of each other. They brought 2 dishes 5 minute later. The last one came out 45 minutes after, with no apology and no offw cancel it.Many dishes were cold before we could eat it and it made our meal much less pleasant. They also delivered one of the ""small plates"" (mussels!) at the end our meal. Very strange.","How, oh how, can you go wrong with $10 pasta Thursdays? I cannot find an answer.This place is always solid and the service is friendly and helpful. I honestly believe their cavatelli with pork and pecorino rivals any of Lilia's pasta. The polenta with sausage is a must as well. So creamy, so meaty, so delicious. And happy hour $5 muscles are a steal.","The Saint Austere is a pizza and wine bar that serves up delicious pasta dishes and entrees. I came here on a weeknight without a reservation and was able to sit pretty quickly. The environment here is dimly lit and good for a date night or just catching up with a friend. To start off, my friend and I got the creamy polenta and broccoli rabe. I love polenta and think this place executed this dish pretty well. The broccoli rabe was delicious as well; the dish was topped with Parmesan cheese, breadcrumbs and an egg. For entrees we got two of their most popular pasta dishes (per our server) which was the tagliolini ai funghi and the cavatelli. While I enjoyed both, the cavatelli definitely stole the ribbon for me. The pork sauce that the cavatelli came with was just divine. We also got the tagliata, which was a hanger steak with truffled mushrooms and parmesan. I liked the truffle flavor and that they cooked this to a perfect medium rare. For dessert we got the tiramisu which actually is not your standard version you'd expect. The one they serve here is a uniquely executed frozen dessert with toffee pieces on top. A bit sweet for me but it was a nice ending to our meal regardless.","had a really wonderful date here last night. all food was delicious, (polenta, octopus, lasagna, tagliolini**, tagliata*) service was friendly and welcoming, and playlist was on point (gangstarr, hi-tek, atcq, the roots, etc.). standouts: tagliolini -- perfectly creamy, fresh & homemade pasta, tagliata -- combo of horseradish cream + arugula + parm made for an amazing compliment to hanger steak. most certainly looking forward to returning.",The Saint Austere
243,Blah 1 hour wait for our food we decided afterWe ate to order another drink another server Came an told us we had to get u cuz they had a group coming never again food was good tho we arrived around 750 food didn't come till 9,"If your in a rush to go somewhere after, do not come here. After over an hour wait my guest and I only receive drinks and apps. While still waiting for the apps we asks for our entrees to go and still had to wait another 20 mins. I will say the drinks are good and the service is decent but not worth the long wait in my opinion.","my first time at this place I couldn't stop talking about it.  Today 5/26/19 it was a terrible experience, and not looking forward to going back no time soon, so I place an order, andOnly 1 portion was served, and the waitress forgot about the additional part of the order.  I try to patronize black owned establishments, but that was very messy, and no compensation at all. I can go on on, but it just wasn't a great experience, and I'm quite annoyed ‍Two starts because the service was not good.",I came here on a Friday night and the food and drinks were delicious! Service was fast and I have no complaints at all. The ambiance was also really nice. The waiter accommodating my party was so nice and helpful. I ordered fish tacos and Hennessy and Pepsi to drink. This is definitely my favorite seafood spot in Brooklyn! Will be coming back often !!,"So last night I came here for dinner with my boyfriend. We enjoyed our meal here. Our waiter was really nice. ( I'm mad I forgot his name it started with a B). We were seated in seconds. The place was kinda packed for a rainy day. Food: Lobster and 1/2 shrimp with jerk butter. Very tasty and slightly spicy. If you like spicy this is somewhat on the milder side (3/5). We also added potato, corn, and sausage for an additional fee.Buffalo wings were crispy and their buffalo sauce was on point.Drinks: They offer samples of their cocktails. Majority of the drinks however are on the sweeter side but you definitely taste the alcohol. We got the Brooklyn sunrise. We got the large to share and it did it's work. lol.   I will come back to try the other food items.","Don't waste your time or money! I will never go back! I called at 8pm on a Friday and asked do I need a reservation, and the receptionist said No, they're taking walk-ins, and there's currently no wait. I get there 30 minutes later, and I'm told they're only seating people with reservations. After going back and forth, the manager gets involved, and made a table for our party of 6.After repeatedly ordering water for the table, it was delivered halfway through the meal. The waiter said they ran out of glasses. But, they had glasses for the chargeable drinks that we ordered. Shrimp tacos - shrimp were still in the shell. Who wants to bite into a taco, and get a mouth full of shells? Plain wings - we're still red in the middle. I broke open a few pieces once I bit into the 1st piece of raw chicken, to make sure it wasn't just 1 bad piece. All pieces were raw. The waiter told me when chicken is over cooked it turns red in the middle. WTF?!The drinks are pre made and sitting in containers behind the bar. All the drinks we received were watery.The catfish and fries are very tasty! My brother in law enjoyed his crab legs, mussels, and shrimp boil. The macaroni and cheese was good.",King Of The Sea
244,Love Is A Battlefield Remix - Pat Benatar We are strongNo one can tell us we're wrongSearching our Yelp for so longBoth of us knowingBrunch is a battlefield,"I came in here to get Brunch with my boyfriend on a Tuesday. The place was pretty empty and they had these passive aggressive signs on the table that say how many people can sit there. (Super rude and lazy. I've worked in hospitality for years. That's not cute) We sat down at a corner table for 3. The place literally had three customers so I was not concerned. The waitress comes over and says ""I like how you decided to sit there even though the sign says its for three people."" I looked up in disbelief at her snarky attitude. My boyfriend kept it light and said, ""yes but when the place is empty I'm sure its not a big deal"" and she said ""how are you going to tell me where its okay for you to sit"" She was smiling, but I don't know you for you to assume that this banter is familiar or appropriate. We walked into a restaurant and despite wether or not you disprove of my seating selection or not, I don't need your smart ass remarks about it and your rude way of managing your dining room. I said to my boyfriend, ""Were leaving I don't like her energy, and I don't want her serving me food."" And he said ""oh no its okay, calm down."" I said ""not its not. I didn't come in here for this."" She says to me ""I'm sorry if you're uncomfortable"" I just looked at her and then walked out. I don't have time for that energy. Period. Especially not around my food. Do better.",Came around 11 one Saturday morning. Out of pretty much everything I wanted. Barista was rude. Why were there 10 year olds working the register?,This is my first time here in Brooklyn New York City and we chose to eat at Brown Butter for breakfast. When you first walk in there is a line leading to the cashier didn't see the menus behind the back wall but that was a good choice for themafter looking at the menu we decided to get the Belgian waffles and I had the strawberries and cream with the side of bacon coffee and orange juice.the Belgian waffle was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside maybe a lil too sweet and the bacon was okay It wasn't the greatest The coffee was good and the only juice had pulp overall the food is good. as for the service it was so so I guess they're getting busy and did not have enough waitresses at the time. could have had one more just to make sure everybody was waiting on at a decent amount of time but she did eventually had asked if everything was okay and we said yes. They also had outside seating I didn't see that coming in but I wish I had cuz it was getting hot inside. Thank you for the experience brown butter I will recommend to friends but I have many to conquer as I will be traveling to New York City probably monthly.,Absolutely the best breakfast biscuit I've had since my mom last made a batch. Perfect fluffiness and great organic eggs (yep you can taste the difference). This place is a must stop when looking for delicious human portion food.,"I'd come back for the vibe (and free WiFi) but probably not to eat.I was super excited to get some work done on my day off at this new cafe, but the food was overly salted and I couldn't even use my laptop at a proper table. I got eggs with potatoes and bacon... the eggs were way too salty and the potatoes were just lackluster. If I come back it would probably just be for the free WiFi and work environment.",Brown Butter
245,"The Hive not only has amazing food and drinks but their service is INCREDIBLE. I ordered take out from there and went to pick it up. When I got home I realized my salad was wrong so I called and was cranky of course after a long day. They felt so bad and realized they read the take out order wrong. They refunded me and within No joke, 5 minutes someone came to my apt with the right salad and A ROSE! This has NEVER happened. Thank you Hive and thank you so so so very kind person for bringing this with a rose as well!You guys are the best!",The steak I got was mediocre. But the pasta is very yummy. The Katsu is not that good. Beef tartare is on point very good. Hummus nothing special. Calamari nothing special. I'll come back to try other things. It's a good place to try but disappointed in some of the food on the menu,"The service was great the food??? I ordered Chicken N Waffles. I've never had Where  the breaded coating was falling off the chicken. Normally you fry chicken with flour.!The table we sat at was too small for 4 people. We asked to be seated at a bigger table. Request denied & mind You the place was particularly empty. We did a brunch there 10:30am. I chose The Hive b/c it was a woman run restaurant. That's what I get for being biased. My Mom said she didn't enjoy the Hive Burger, when I asked her to explain her response too average. Oh, well.","This is a nice bar to grab a few drinks with friends (especially during happy hour), but I feel compelled to warn you:You don't need to upgrade from a regular order of fries to a table share for four people with a flight of four dips. First of all, they are steak fries, and not quite as crisp as this man would like for the purposes of lots of dipping. Secondly, this giant bucket of potatoes is way, way more potatoes than anyone need ever eat. I suppose there were only three of us, but we all walked out in considerable pain. And while the dips were solid (although the super spicy mango habanero"" was not very spicy, let alone super spicy), we did order some ketchup also because some things just go together. The brussels sprouts are excellent.","This spot was definitely a good selection for lunch during a stroll through williamsburg.  The staff was friendly and quickly accomodated my guest and I.The food was pretty decent also.  The flounder with lentils was absolutely flavorful, and the chicken sandwich was good as well (was a little bready).  Especially the sauce that the chicken was covered or fried in definitely gave it a yummy kick!The cocktails were delicious as well.  The cocktail with sorrel infused mezcal was one of a kind that I would definitely return for.  The entire cocktail menu looked stellar and was well presented as far as how the cocktail would be delivered.The interior decoration was well balanced, neutral, and had intriguing accents throughout.  The only thing is that although it was named the hive, there are artificial spiders located which is a slight throw off. LolOverall a good experience and would definitely recommend.","With all of the great restaurants in this area of Williamsburg, I expected better from this place. Food was very average, drinks were above average, but the service was absolutely terrible. We were in for brunch on Sunday, and it wasn't terribly busy - there were plenty of open tables. Once we sat down, it took us about 20 - 30 minutes to get our drinks, including our coffees. I can't remember a time I've waited so long for a drink other than at a craft cocktail bar...It then took another hour for us to receive our food. During that time, only once did our server check in on us to ask if we had not yet received our food (uh, duh, do you see any food on our table?). We waited a good 20 minutes after this check in for our food to actually arrive - no apology from the waiter, no more check-ins, not even after we did actually receive our food. When our server was rushing by us another 20 minutes after we had eaten, we asked for the check. He appeared miffed by this request, and when he returned with our bill basically threw it on the table. Overall, don't waste your time. Plenty of other, much better options in the area.**Update** After I also left a review on Resy as well as here, the restaurant reached out to me to let me know they had heard there had been problems with service the day of my visit, and hoping to get more info on my experience to solve the issue with their staff. They also offered to have me and a guest come back in free of charge to give them another shot. It sounds like this was an out-of-the-ordinary case for them, and they are very concerned with ensuring they improve, and I will be (hopefully) updating this review once I have the chance to make it back in!",The Hive
246,"I have been going back for work lunches and a few dinners, and after the experience the past few months I think it's time to break up. I've experienced nothing but slow service without any explanations, meals that I've had to send back, unfriendly hostesses, and some salty meals. Food is generally really good- but the service since they opened has gone downhill.","Unfortunately, despite calling ahead to ensure we would have a table, the hostess was intent on articulating that the restaurant is not a welcoming place for customers. We arrived with less than 5 occupied tables in the place, and the restaurant remained largely empty through the course of our meal. Yet, when we walked in, no one greeted us, leaving us to stand by the door for nearly a minute, wondering if they were actually open for business. When the host finally graced us with her presence, she started the interaction by rolling her eyes while asking if we made a reservation. We did. Went downhill from there.There were leftover food bits on the unwashed drinking glass at our table. When I pointed the dirty dish out to our waiter, instead of handing us a clean glass from the multiple unoccupied tables next to us, he left to ""get us a new glass"". This took over 8 minutes. The water we asked for took over 15 minutes to arrive. Drinks (draft beer) also took unusually long, considering that the restaurant was empty.The food was clearly microwaved and drenched in stale olive oil to compensate for the rubbery texture. Previous reviews also echo this. The view is nice, but not worth the abusive service athmosphere! If you want to watch the view from here, be mentally prepared for bad vibes and extremely overpriced and subpar food.",The good was okay but way overpriced for the minisculeportions.  The staff have no knowledge of allergies and actually kept bringing the very things we are allergic to.  The shakshuka eggs came raw.,"Celestine has such an amazing location right under the Manhattan bridge, the views can not be beat. They also open all the exterior windows in summer that you're basically sitting on the water. The menu has some standard Mediterranean dishes plus some more unique things I hadn't tried before. But, literally everything was delicious. We had...-baba ghannouj -pistachio feta spread-Manti (so good)-reginette-cauliflower & broccolini -mjuderah-Persian potatoI recommend anything I listed above. This would be a great place for a special occasion because the view is so spectacular. I'm excited to come back later in fall/winter and check out the cozy vibes.","This is a new place near my office - and a great option for a nicer dinner with the team or clients. First, the view is phenomenal, I could sit there with a bottle of wine and be happy.I went with a few friends and we immediately went back a few days later, I want to try their brunch! We each had a cocktail and loved them. I can't recall the names. We split a few dishes both times:1). Baba Ganoush - 5/5 so yummy2). Muhammara - 5/5 very yummy3). Hummus - 5/5 4). Flat Bread - 5/55). Branzino - 5/56). Short Rib Dumpling - 5/57). Green Bean Salad - 4/5Service was good, but the food was amazing.","Extremely pricey with unfocused service.   You are mostly paying for the view, which is the underside of the Manhattan Bridge, which makes me wonder if even that is worth the price.  Still at sunset, with the all glass walls and the gentle setting, it is a lovely moment.Drinks were novel and good.  Room pretty.  People also pretty.However, the service left much to be desired.  The room was not full, and yet we suffered long waits for our courses and for our server's attention. Our server floated about the room, exhibiting a casual, chatty manner, which, although it might delight some customers to have one's server making extended small talk at one's table, failed to deliver the attentive experience that I would expect for the very dear price this establishment demands for its Mediterranean offerings, many of which are simply street food with lipstick painted on (falafel, hummus, etc...).I had the Flatiron steak, which consisted of 8 or 10 slices of tender and nicely seasoned meat but for the price, I could have enjoyed a formidable, dry aged 16 oz New York Strip at many a well known steakhouse in NYC.  My companions ordered the whole Branzino.  Again, delicious and tender, but for the price not so sure it was worth it.The bill when it arrived, was heart stopping.  Never again.The walk along the water following the dinner was the highlight of the evening.  It was a lovely night, comfortably temperate, with a light breeze.",Celestine
247,"Bozu is a decent spot for their so-called sushi bombs.  I came here many years ago and remembered it being so amazing.  On my most recent visit, it was just okay.  I sat at the bar and it took some time before being acknowledged.  Service in general isn't their strong suite.  I ordered two sushi bombs, which really are just oversized nigiri balls.  The flavors were good but the rice sort of fell apart when I'd pick the pieces up.  Not a big deal, just not the special treat I remembered from so many years ago.",Veggie sushi bomb. Yes. That good.There is something thatabout the shape of these delicious little mounds of rice topped with roasted Brussels sprouts that keeps me coming back.,"We came here for the sushi bomb as they look nice. We tried the pink bomb (salmon), Mexican bomb (salmon), shiro bomb (white tuna), hotate bomb (scallop) and una bomb (eel). Una bomb is my favorite, followed by hotate bomb. Their spicy seafood miso soup has 3 shrimps, 3 mussels, 3 baby scallops, cabbage, corn, snow peas and enoki mushrooms. The taste is ok.","TLDR: Dim lighting, Good sushi.I got the party bomb which comes in 12 pieces. The unique thing I liked about this place is that they gave pre made soy sauce with 3 different levels of wasabi spice in it. 1 was regular soy sauce, 1 had a little bit of wasabi, and 1 had a lot of wasabi in it.The fish was soft and I would come eat at this place if I was in the area. The dim lighting makes it hard to take IG pictures!","I'm only knocking off one star because of the awful, awful lighting in here. Half of our table was lit and half wasn't. They tried to go all out with the decor and while a lot of the decorations were very tastefully done, lighting of the tables weren't. The food itself was splendid. We got the pork belly and fried chicken as appetizers. The pork belly was very soft and served with a steaming hot broth underneath which I felt like had so much flavor and depth in itself. The fried chicken was dressed with a red vinegar. I've never had fried chicken and red vinegar but oh my God. I didnt even realize how much I absolutely love sour flavors! They have sets with variations of fish and rice. It reminds me of a rice ball with fish on top. Each one had it's own pairings and flavors and they have this premixed sauces for you which include regular soy, medium spicy soy, and very spicy soy. I enjoyed this because I would spoon just enough sauce per piece and I wouldn't be breaking my rice by dipping it into soy sauce. I also got a roll called the YYG stinky bomb. I thought it was funny to call it that just because there was garlic in it but I definitely understood afterwards. The smell and taste remained in my mouth well after the meal had ended and as a garlic lover....I loved it! Be careful though if people around you don't love garlic and you have to get up close and personal with them!",Delicious!! The bombs are the must try at this spot.. shared the party special and was impressed by the tasty and bold flavors. My favorite and most unique bombs include the Spicy McBomb and Mexican Bomb. Also tried the ika which was fantastic and served with a vegan spicy mayo as well as the miso soup. Cocktails are on the sweet side. Service is attentive and food is prepared quickly.. we were in and out in 45min-1hr. You can place yourself on a waitlist on Yelp during peak hours. Prices are also very reasonable. Would definitely come back!,Bozu
248,"Why would I ever go here again? From paltry appetizers that did nothing for us to an average steak we could make at home, this was not worth it in the least. So needlessly expensive. Reminds me why I don't go out to eat in New York unless it's ramen or bao. Don't believe the hype.","For 30 dollars, the piece of fish filet we got was very tiny, and it wasn't even special. It was swimming in some oil and there were a few decorative greens, but no vegetables, no rice or potatoes, not even bread. Just three bites of non-remarkable fish filet. Service was friendly and wine was decent, but we were disappointed.","Delicious food that are tiny portions (e.g. one ladle of risotto, a few slices of steak) at an expensive cost. Sorry, I cant roll like that unfortunately.","Even though the waiter wasn't extremely excited about the food during ordering or questions, the actual food itself made up for it. Super fresh and beautiful presentation with a great and unusual blending of flavors!We had the foie gras, the potatoes, the fish rillette, Israeli couscous, and fish of the day. Everything was equally amazing","Even though the waiter wasn't extremely excited about the food during ordering or questions, the actual food itself made up for it.

Everything was equally amazing!","The food was good, this was our second visit. The service was not as good as the food. On a Wednesday evening it seemed that two people were working as host, server and bartender. They were trying to serve the full restaurant, but really couldn't keep up. The entire experience was slow to the point of annoyance. It's never good when the server responds ""No"" to guest requests, without any attempt to accommodate. Can any of the cocktails  be prepared without alcohol? No. Can we substitute the fried potatoes for the mashed? No. I understand that the restaurant can have whatever policies they choose, but there is a more hospitable way to handle the inquiry.Certainly when the FOH staff is overwhelmed, it's difficult to provide excellent service. The quality of the food preparation earns a return visit, but the service needs to be as good as the food, or it may not be more that one more try.",Le Garage
249,"I finally got to fill my craving for some Guyanese style chow mein at Island Express! I ordered the bbq chicken meal with a side of macaroni pie. Everything tasted just as I expected -- authentic! I wish the bbq chicken wasn't boneless, but still tasty nonetheless. What Island Express offers that most local West Indian shops in this area don't is their excellent customer  service. The service and food will keep me coming back! Their prices are also very affordable. I will be back for some roti and curry!","#I thought they said the Oxtail Stew was $17. But after I ate, I looked at my receipt and it said $7.50, but it was marked as BBQ Chicken. There's no price on the #menu board of how much Oxtail was. So I'm not sure if they had to just put BBQ Chicken in the system, because there was no Oxtail on the menu? Or just made a mistake.Anyway, it was #cold and not that good and I love oxtail. If it really was $17, I would say 2 stars. But if it was $7.50, I would say 5 stars. Because that's a pretty good deal, especially if you microwave it.I noticed there was a #guy in front of me in line that wanted the Jerk Chicken and the server asked him if he wanted the Jerk Chicken platter he just packaged up for another guy that didn't want it anymore. I could see the guy in front of me #hesitating, but he accepted it anyway. He ate it for about 3-5 minutes and then threw it away. He probably shouldn't have accepted it.",Terrible service ..the female servers attitudes are horrendous. Food is not that great for the attitude. There is one younger male worker I have noticed with great service.. only reason I didn't put 1 star .,"Island Express serves a variety of different palates at a low price point. The menu is simplified in the format of most quick serve establishments, letting you pick a base, a protein, and a couple of sides. As a pescatarian I was pleased to see a couple of seafood options, including shrimp curry and fried fish. I ordered the fried fish over rice & peas with a side of plantains and veggies. Without the veggie stew, the rice, fish, and plantains would have been exceptionally dry, and my generous dousing of hot sauce over my dish only set my tongue on fire, which was not my intended effect. The fish was okay, but contained a lot of little bones that I found annoying to eat. I'm going to try the shrimp curry on my next visit. My partner really enjoyed her jerk chicken bowl and found it saucy enough to offset the dryness of the rice.They have several shelves full of different patties and pastries. I thought the guava tart was delicious with a perfectly flaky crust. I'm most excited to try the other pastries on return visits.","Stopped by this great Guyanese restaurant while awaiting the start of a comedy show at Kings Theatre. There's a choice of a small or medium/large size meal with either white rice/rice and peas with jerk/stew/oxtail/curry chicken and another side (choice of channa, plantains, spinach, okra, or another veggie). I had the stew chicken and spinach and they tasted really yummy. The chicken was moist and well seasoned and the spinach was sautéed just right.Will be back again!","Walking my way to the best Guyanese food in Brooklyn. First the staff is amazingly friendly. That is sometimes a very rare find. Just super cool people (and cute). Then then the food is amazing. Veggie Lo Mein w/ curry shrimp - the shrimp is perfectly marinated and perfectly cooked. Non of that rubbery mess. And the curry hits the spot PERFECTLY.Guyanese patties - savory filling, flaky pies. Perfect way to tempt someone to break a fast. Coconut Drops - Don't remember if they are called drops or buns. But get one! You'll be blessed if you get it warm. Golden brown on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.

250,"I love speedy. The problems I have are twofold:1. They raised the price of a pie to $23-25/person. This explains available tables. I could have left, but I didn't because I love the St Louie. 2. The lights are not working for the seats along the south wall of the restaurant. They brought my pizza and I realized after 3-4 slices that I hadn't tasted sausage (on the St. Louie, which I've had ~30x before), so I turned on the flashlight from my phone and to my chagrin there are indeed no sausages! It is that fucking dark. I asked for them to sort me out with the right pizza - which they did. But seriously... our poor waitress is apologizing for problems she can't fix. I feel for her.Speedy:get your shit together or reduce your price to match the experience.","Provel with class. Speedy holds the pizza throne in Brooklyn. My kids agree, so long as we arrive before 6.","Go for the grilled octopus and then leave. Ok, the pastrami pizza was good, but the everything seasoning was burnt and there was too much dressing.

We had three servers over the course of the meal and no one made eye contact.","Got to check this place out after my friend's cousin suggested to have dinner here when we officially arrived to New York for our mini vacation. We almost missed the restaurant since there was no visible sign outside, so we had to double check the GPS we were following to get there to make sure we were at the right location. When we got inside, it was low lighting inside as we were seated at our table near the door. Deifnitely, had a hard time picking which pizza to get and ended up getting the White Album one. When our pizza came out, the server also presented us a pepper topping mixture that would go great with their pizzas. And boy was he right! We nearly finished the little mason jar he gave us after adding it to our pizza slices. The pizza tasted great on its own and better with the peppers. There was definitely a lot of cheese on the pizza I got, which I ended up not finishing all of it, but apparently made great leftover cold pizza for my friend latter on for our trip lolzI would deifnitely come back again to try their other pizzas, though I did get a bite of the anchovy pizza as well as the other pizza with two kinds of cheeses and mushrooms on top, which equally tasted great too. Wished they had sold those peppers though because those were amazing!",The best lunch in Brooklyn! The $26 special with salad and pizza is such a good deal. I always order the mushroom pizza with the farm egg and the Ceasar salad that they always say it's a side salad but it's more like an entree size! It's not in a location that you would normally pass by but I will go out of the way to dine here because it's that delicious!,"I've been here twice now after recently moving to the area and am happy to call this my local pizza joint!""Joint"" doesn't quite seem to do Speedy Romeo justice, however. It's elevated pizza for the laid-back persona. Not too fancy, but not your average slap-a-pepperoni-on-a-pie place. I'm not sure that justifies the sometimes steep price tags ($25? Really?), but they have a fun menu with a great beer and wine selection that will please everyone from the picky eater to *that* gourmand friend.I've had the margarita, the White Album (you can't not!), and King Salami. The toppings are divine, the crust is juuuust right, and the service is great to boot! I had to send my sister off to her Megabus so our waitress graciously hurried up our service to get us out on time.A solid option for your go-to pizza place.",Speedy Romeo
251,"We were there before and it was packed, didnt want to wait so we left. This time we are lucky, seated right away. Food was nice but nothing wow. Decent food i would say. 3 entree and 2 soft drinks for over $120. Pretty pricy","Steak was on our minds and we decided to satiate that craving on Saturday and it was a disappointment.  We have our usual spot and decided to venture off the path by visiting El Almacen.  I don't know I read somewhere that this place was dark and sexy, but it was more dated and made me feel slightly uneasy.  When we approached the door it looked Victorian.  When my bf and I had to walk to  our table, he tripped because of plank possibly or step that was difficult to see in the dark.  The water glass wasn't the cleanest.  I ordered the entrana and it was tasty, but not mind blowing.  My bf ordered the Churassco and he wasn't too happy with it either.  My rose wine was fine.  Our sides were poblano mash and truffle fries.  The poblano mash was decent, but fell below expectations.",This restaurant is over priced. I order the Paella and it was very salty and it had to many red pepper.,"Hmmmmm... The appetizers were ok but the 14oz Ribeye Steak I had  was F!@#$k¡G awesome !!!!! Great place for date night ... I can skip the appetizer but you should try it anywayz... next time, I go straight to the steak and drinks ...","El Almacen is definitely one of the best Argentinian places I've been to. It's decor is. Quaint and the setting is very intimate , perfect for dinner with friends or that special someone. My girlfriends and I went for dinner after work one day and spent maybe three hours there. Amazing ambiance ! Their guacamole with hot chips is amazing - flavored beautifully and pairs well with the warm lightly salted chips, the steak was super juicy and cooked a perfect medium and paired well with the house red. The lemon chicken was also well seasoned, super flavorful and juicy. It is definitely one of our favorites and we will be back.",I came here expecting some amazing steak because of the reviews and the prices but the steak I got was really chewy and didn't have a lot of flavor. Maybe it's my fault for getting a skirt steak? The empanadas were good though. Inside it's like a long dark corridor so I didn't love the atmosphere. Service was good though. My friend liked his food.,El Almacen
252,"They had horrible service and a disrespectful manager. I asked for a margarita without ice and they filled the glass half way.  I wasn't aware that no ice meant a half glass, asked them to return it and they refused.  Then they accused me of drinking it when it was clear that I did no such of a thing. If the waiter mentioned that I would receive a half glass before I ordered it, I would have a clear understanding that I would receive a half glass.  They were stubborn and said that I had to pay for the drinks.  I cancelled my food order and asked them to return my drink, since they provided me with a check with the drink order.  I paid it and gave them zero tip.  This was inappropriate and I will never to again.","This should have been a five star EXCEPT for the blaring Telemundo soccer game -  sound turned on deliberately & it wasn't the World Cup.  That said -if you're from the Wild West and crave basic Mexican food with a kick, this is the place.  We walked in at 6:30 on a Saturday night & got a table immediately.  Lots of pick up and delivery going on.  No pintos, only black beans on the side, but the rice was killer.  Beers by the bottle, and sodas by the can.   We had burritos and enchiladas & both were good.  There are a few outdoor tables","Wooooooooow. You know a restaurant is bad when there's a disclaimer on the menu that if you are unsatisfied with anything they won't make it again OR give you a refund. Unfortunately, I had never encountered a menu that doubled as a contract, so I didn't read the fine print.  Big mistake. When we got there, we were given the normal chips and salsa (very small serving of chips) and asked for waters.  Had to ask three times for water. Finally we got 3 lukewarm waters, no ice, and none of us got refills for the rest of the meal. The three of us smashed all 10 chips in our basket (and I am being literal when I say 10) and asked for more. She explained it would cost ""a little more"" for another basket -- SIX dollars. For 10 more chips and 2 oz of Ortega tasting salsa.  Frozen margaritas, though! Yay! $12 each, but we were ready to spend moneyyyy on lunch so we got strawberry and pineapple.  They came on the rocks in a very small rocks glass.  We didn't know we had to specify, so I guess it's technically our bad, but our waitress did not give a ffffff that we were clearly dissatisfied.  Without taking a sip of our drinks we explained that we misread the menu and meant to order frozen margaritas.  She looked at us and was like, ""I'll get you frozen margaritas but these won't be taken off your bill.""   Then she just stares at us until we were like ""uh okay?"" And she walked away. No attempt to seem remotely apologetic but just openly annoyed.  I've worked in restaurants, everyone at the table has worked in restaurants for a long time-- when a guest is unsatisfied with an item for any reason (and they haven't clearly been drinking or eating it), the house buys back the drink. Policies like that are built into the budget of a restaurant because it is a customer service industry. We finally drink them and there isn't a trace of the flavor of tequila. If I were judging it as 8oz of sugar water over ice I'd say 4/5. $12 margarita?? Bch are you crazy?  Food though? I've never had a bad enchilada in. my. life. When I say this chicken was dry, I'm talking like crunchy dry. Like when we walked in, did you take some chicken out of the trash from yesterday and put it in front of the fan until it lost any trace of flavor or moisture? Because if so, touché. Tacos were fine, burrito was fine. Obviously, I paid full price for the 1 terrible bite of enchilada. SIXTY DOLLARS FOR EVERYTHING.  I never review restaurants, but I read them and came because this place has great reviews... They bought all those 5 star reviews! I have literally nothing good to say about this place besides I guess that the air conditioning worked. What really bothered me about this place was the service. I've worked in the industry for a long time and I would have gotten written up if I treated a table like this.  It's the service industry, customers can and will be the worst but your job is literally just to make them happy. I have had customers make ridiculous requests, insult me, touch me without my consent, sooo much crap, but ""the customer is always right"" and you smile through the hatred and give them what they want. We were nothing but kind and polite and our server was unapologetically unhelpful, inattentive, and just rude. 0 stars. It's a no for me, dawg.","after eight years of living in NYC and being so very far removed from my beloved Tex-Mex of Texas, i think nacho macho is NYC's gifted apology to me.no! i don't at all mean to suggest that nacho macho is ""Tex-Mex"".  not at all! but it is, indeed, absolutely *uckin' good mexican, which is enough to remind me of home. the beer selections. the margaritas. the tacos. the enchiladas. that's all i've had so far in my two visits to this establishment but upon first bite of my carne asada tacos, i knew nacho macho was legit.most importantly, it's fairly priced. they're not trying to pull the wool over your eyes. yes, i could still get cheaper carne asada tacos in texas, but who am i kidding? NYC is more expensive and nostalgia comes at a price!needless to say, i'll be back here multiple times. so far, this is definitely my go-to taco, burrito, enchilada, margarita spot and i don't see that changing anytime soon!","I came here about ten minutes before close time with the wife. A person (or couple; can't recall) was ahead of us. We were hungry and had just gotten out of a show. We were glad that we were able to sneak in to grab a quick bite. After a few minutes of standing in line waiting, we were told (along with the person/s standing ahead of us) unceremoniously that they were closed. Now, you might think it unfair for me to criticize them ten minutes before close time for turning me away... but then I say this, ""Can judge me for writing a harsh review as a consequence of being turned away when they were still opened?"" If they can turn me away when they were still opened, I can surely criticize them for not serving me when they were listed as 'opened,' yet not serve me."" For all I know, their food is excellent. But that night the staff was dismissive and clearly did not need my/want my money. So I went to a pizza place close by and, I have to say, pretty darn amazing pizza! I wrote them a great review for it too! Good luck to these guys and their business; they lost me as a costumer! They must be doing financially well enough to lose new costumers.",Top notch tacos pairs with marvelous margaritas makes a great night out for me and my lady. The staff is warm and friendly. Recommend to all my friends and neighbors. Will probably have my retirement party. Oh and if you like futbol then prepare to fall in love with Nach Macho,Nacho Macho Taco
253,"Ordered take out with my co worker, I had really high expectations for this place because of the location and how busy it was.  The food was mediocre, and for the price tag it shouldn't be that (regardless of their ""lunch special"". ) There was zero quality in their dry pepper chicken combo.  The chicken was all breading and loaded with hot peppers that weren't even edible.  The presentation was nice and appealing to the eye, but for what I pay, I want food - not cheap ingredients and breading.Later that night my co worker and I both got sick.  Maybe an odd coincidence, maybe not.  I won't return to find out.",After all the running around I searched high and low to find somewhere to eat and charge up my phone. Sigh... I wish I was able to look under yelp 1st before ordering. This place looks cute but the food didn't do it for us. My son wasnt happy at all and he would eat just about anything I tell ya.His spicy beef soup was not good. His words not mine. The beef was too chewy he had to spit each one out after chewing forever. On top of that he said it was too salty. I had the cris,"+ Takes reservations+ Food was a bit salty but tasty and spicy. We ordered: dumplings in chili oil, ginger sour string beans, dan dan noodles","I'm always here.Food is consistent on flavor and cook. I've had dishes that came a little too oily or salty but I eat it anyway lol. My favorite is the extra spicy dry work tofu, and my husband loves their garlic chicken.Prices are average and the staff are always pleasant. Bathrooms are clean and if you have children, they easily accommodate them sealed off beverage cups, practice chop sticks and milder simpler dishes like noodles etc for them.","I come to this place way more often than I should. My partner and I always get the dry pot style and cumin style tofu at max spiciness (10). We've tried their other entrees but they are far worse in quality so we never stray from these two anymore. Last time we thought we'd be adventurous, we got Kung Pao Style tofu (too sweet and not flavorful enough) and Crispy Rice Style tofu (also too bland and the the crispy rice was so stale already - even the parts that hadn't touched the sauce) and we thought, NEVER AGAIN. Thankfully, the waiter had offered to switch us out for a different dish if we really didn't like our new choices so we took up his offer up to switch out the Crispy Rice. That was very generous. If we're feeling extra hungry, we'll get either the Dan Dan Noodles, Spicy Mung Bean Noodle, or Cold Noodle with Chili Oil. They are all delicious. But whatever you do, DO NOT get the Cold Noodle with Chili Oil at Spice Level 10. You will be crying in the restaurant and again in your bathroom the next day.","Always great service, food gets fast to your table!Even faster than the drinks!Súper affordable , bartender is super nice ( he even gave us recommendations for our honeymoon in Hawaii ).Dan Dan noodles are a must!",Han Dynasty
254,"First, want to talk about the service. It was just terrible. We got to dinner before the rush and there weren't that many people seated, with many open tables. Despite it being only half full, we were rushed to order and felt like we couldn't take our time / enjoy our meal. When we did put in a drink order, it took a decently long time to get it. When we get our entree, the waitress almost immediately brought the dessert menu over - as if she wanted us out ASAP. The waitress was also quite rude to us and was pretty unpleasant. I don't know if it was us or she had a bad day, but it made us both uncomfortable. The food was pretty good, but very small portions. We really loved the pepper shrimp and the lobster Mac n cheese side. It's a shame that we had such terrible service because otherwise, I would go back.","A friend of mine hosted her birthday here and we were allowed to use the rum bar(had no idea this even existed) we were checked on constantly, the drinks were flowing and the food came out fast. The only downside was that we weren't allowed to do separate checks even though we were sitting at the bar. Something to work on for next time.","I've heard mixed reviews about Negril but decided to see for myself. Went on a Sunday evening around 6, we were seated immediately which was great. The waiter was subpar, wasn't really attentive, he took our order and I didn't see him again. I ordered oxtail with rice and peas while my boyfriend had their jerk chicken. When the food arrived we were not impressed, I barely touched my food and neither did he. To say the least I doubt I'll be back. I'll stick to Negril in the city.","There have been a gaping hole in the Caribbean dining experience for a long time and Negril BK has filled it and then some more.  Attitude free food, ( my Caribbean folks know what I am talking about) a warm and inviting staff and live music and DJ on certain nights keep it lively and social. The crowd here is professional who don't take themselves to serious and the family vibes and energy is part of the reason why I visit frequently. The menu is diverse with an international flare of Caribbean and a few other countries. They cater to your vegetarian or carnivore preference. The food is cooked with Love and passion and you may need to be reminded to chew as your tastebuds will be taken on an adventure.I encourage you to make a reservation or come early especially on the weekend as hungry patrons who come in large parties to devour their scrumptious  meals and assortment of rums from every Caribbean island. Negril BK is exactly what you don't know you need. Do yourself a favor, bring a friend and escape to the caribbean for a couple hours without getting on a plane.","Hurts my hart to give a poor rating to Negril. Let's start off with the menu revamped. No more Mofongo!!!! I was instantly sad . It was the best item on the menu. Then the other issue is the side items are small, and resemble kid size meal. To be honest the flavor is always amazing, example jerk oysters had tones of flavors. But these oysters must come from Jamaica Bay because they are really really small. I was eating more sauce then oyster. Then wine was good, can't complain about that. Clean bathroom friendly-ish staff (host was rude). My waitress was lovely.Food/flavor: 7.8/10Food portion: 4/10Bathroom: 10/10Red","I've heard so many positive things about this location so I wanted to check it out for myself.  I came here in a Saturday night for dinner with a few others, and you can already sense the energy was lively. We were acknowledged and greeted then given an estimated wait time (45 minutes) my friend gave her name and number. As time elapsed we realized it's been awhile so we went back in to check on our RSVP. I realized it was a different hostess by the name of CHARLIE. Not friendly at all. Apparently they tried Calling and even texted us, but as explained to her we got neither. She was even asked what number did she have and she could not find it, because it was canceled (understandable). We went back and forth with no resolution until I said "" ok what can we do to fix it"" Clearly a mistake was made, and it happens. She wasn't understanding nor tried to accomadate us not until the surcurity guard felt bad, and said next available table is yours. (Thank you). CHARLIE then gave us another wait time of 20 minutes smh!!! Thankfully the hostess we originally took our name down came and remembered us. We waited about 10 minutes before being seated.To help avoid mistakes like these maybe the phone number should be recited and people should be told to check their phones, and make sure we get that first confirmation text to ensure it's the right number. Mistakes happen let's just try to resolve without being rude.Now to the food and drinks.... I had the jerk salmon and rice and peas which were delicious. The salmon had a nice kick that wasn't over powering. To Drink I had the drunken dread. If you love coconut this is the drink for you. Delicious!!!  The waiter was knowledgeable of the specials and menu. He was friendly and smiled. He made sure we happy and very attentive.  The manager even came over and made sure everything was okay. (thank you)Overall I'm happy we stayed, and didn't let that little hiccup ruin our experience. First empression are so important. Hopefully my next visit will be slightly different.",Negril BK

At a frequency of every couple of years, it's worth revisiting my favorites. And they have never disappointed me, or broken the bank.","I keep coming back here for the Bánh mì and rice dishes. I would say it's the best place in Brooklyn for either types of these dishes. The place is very no frills. Cheap, fast and good!The decor is nondescript, a hole-in-the-wall. Very little seating available, and you eat out of disposable take-out containers, even if you're dining in. It's fast food Vietnamese style...","It was like being back in Little Saigon (also known as Santa Ana, CA). We tried to wait to eat the #1 bahn mi (combo pork, pate, etc.)- we even went so far as to dutifully wrap it up in preparation for the long subway ride home. But then... it got to smelling real good. So we just took it out of the wrapper right on the hot Brooklyn Chinatown sidewalk, and devoured it in 3 minutes flat. No regrets...The best traditional banh mi we've had since living in SoCal. Not to be missed (as I dab the joyful tears from my eyes)...","This is my top spot for vietnamese bahn mi in the entire NYC area. Even though it is a bit inconvenient to travel to this place, I still do it because it is that damn good and affordable! I always buy 2-3 bahn mi's everytime I visit. I also highly recommend their iced viet coffee.I usually ordered #8 (Grilled Pork) which is extremely delicious and full of flavors (grilled pork, cilantro, shredded pickled carrots & radish, mayo & peanut pieces in it). The baguette was so soft and crunchy. Highly recommended!","Excellent fresh and juicy vietnamese sandwiches! It's a small hole in a wall with 4-5 tables, shelf of snacks and at least 2 drink coolers. It has the feel of a chinese take out joint. I came here twice so far, fell in love with it on my first visit.I got #8 grilled pork with pate and asked for it to be spicy. It wasn't spicy enough for me but has a kick. My hubby usually get #1 which is the most popular- ham & bbq pork with pate. All sandwiches comes with pickled carrots/cucumber and parsley.",Ba Xuyen
256,"Had to drop this rating to a 1 after deciding to give them a second chance. We made reservations here for Thanksgiving and they literally gave us a table that's right next to a door on a 20 degree day. There was a table open that was tucked away in a cozy corner, but they refused to give it to us because it was ""reserved"", which would be fine if weren't for the fact that it was unoccupied through our entire meal, with the people  arriving as we were paying for our check. The galls . . . The food itself was alright, our entrees were a little oversalted and a more than a little overcooked; not worth the $160 bill in the least bit. Quick frankly, the entrees wouldn't be out of place in a diner. Despite this, we would have left contempt if it wasn't for the terrible service. I get it, you upcharge for Thanksgiving, it's fine. But coupled with the terrible service, no, not worth price.","Took a good 10 minutes to seat us despite having tables ready. Multiple waiters noticed us, but went about their business, desperately trying to please the larger tables. We were sat at a filthy table in the back with ants crawling nearby. Our waitress seemed uninterested, likely the result of being burdened by the lack of coverage during a busy brunch day. I was never asked if I wanted any sugar or milk in my iced coffee, it was simply brought out black, which I happily drank anyway cause I just wanted to eat and get out at that point. It took about 40 minutes for a plate of French toast and a bit of duck tossed in a sauce with some corn tortillas (ahem, Chicaquiles) to arrive to our table. The food was good, but the experience was ultimately soured by poor service and filthy furnishings. I doubt I'll be returning.",Accommodated a group of 7 on a hot weekend day for brunch with no problem.  Food was spot on and the drinks were plentiful and tasty. Great local spot with some charm to add to the Park Slope brunch rotation.,"The food was good, but pretty overpriced and really small portions for anything under $35. I went with a group and got ceviche, yucca fries and a salad. The ceviche was delicious but maybe like 1/2 cup of fish for $18, so don't order it thinking you can eat it as a small meal. The salad was also tiny and about the same price.We went with a group for a birthday dinner and they brought out several desserts at the end which were all incredible. The service was great.All in all, it was good, but overpriced. Not sure if I'd come here unless it's a special occasion. I believe others felt the same, and the restaurant was empty when we went (dinner time on a Saturday night).","It's a Saturday night. We're a group of friends looking to have a wonderful night of fun all over Gowanus. Unfortunately, our experience at Palo Santo set a dampening mood for our evening.Don't get me wrong, our main course (Berkshire pork chop and fried chicken) was really delicious hence the deserving two stars. BUT it took an hour for our main courses to come after our appetizers. Our patience was wearing thin and we were hoping to be redeemed by the dessert. To add salt to the wound, the dessert also took around 30-45 minutes to arrive after ordering. We would not recommend any of the dessert options. Here's why:Chocolate bread pudding - I'd say chocolate bread pudding is one of my top dessert picks so I expect a moist soft warm delight to enjoy. The opposite was what I received. It felt like a half defrosted brick  with a few pieces of chocolate chips and runny whipped cream. Two thumbs down for me.Papaya Sorbet - I'm biased and have an expectation of sorbet being tangy and sour-y goodness, but papaya sorbet...? Already not a great combination despite our party ordering 3.

257,My 3 friends and I went here for a farewell brunch  the food was delicious and the cocktails too.    They were turning over to dinner so we went to the bar for a farewell drink but the bartender said that we were there too long and that he wouldn't serve us.  After speaking to the manager he said that it was a liability question.  And that  bring we were not intoxicated we could order another. But I refused saying we could spend our money elsewhere.  I was very humiliated by this event and will never go there again.,"Terrible service. Order taking was slow, check took forever.OK food. Not worth the wait. Terrible Bloody Mary. Small and basic. Amazing blood orange margarita. Come to the bar just for that and then leave.","Most disappointing restaurant I've been to in Brooklyn. The restaurant is small, loud and crowded. Service is very slow. Our cups were not filled with water when we arrived even though we called head and reserved the table.  We had to wait 10 minutes to get water, which was warm. The server didn't leave water on the table, so we had to wait another 10 minutes to get refills.The menu is embarrassingly lacking. There's no poultry or basic salad options. You can get some pieces of lettuce with some drops of lemon for almost $20. Ridiculous. Wine list is also minimal and lacking.We came in a larger party, and multiple members ending up getting nothing except water. If you're looking to entertain guests, go somewhere else.","Brunch review only!We came here on a Sunday around 12:30 and didn't have trouble finding a spot for the 2 of us. We sat at the open kitchen, which was great to see all the dishes being made! Also helped in our decision making since most of the pictures on Yelp were for dinner.We ended up getting the cherry salad, turkish eggs, oysters, and donuts.- Cherry salad: very light and refreshing with prosciutto, manchego and mint! The cherries are a bit tart but still refreshing and sweet! It paired really well the cheese and prosciutto. I thought this was a good combo to the heavier egg dish we shared- Turkish eggs: my first time trying this! It's basically poached eggs, yogurt, and brown butter sauce with fresh dill and spices! SO good! It comes with a side of freshly fired bread. Mix it all up, dip your bread in, and hellooo flavors! We liked it so much, we were inspired to make it at home!- Donuts: we were immediately tempted to get this when we saw it on the menu. The donuts are more on the cakey side, so don't expect airy/fluffy. But flavors are bomb. It also comes with this creamy light lemon sauce that I couldn't stop eating! I'm glad we ended up coming here because I was a littttle skeptical when I first saw the menu and wasn't that impressed. But I was so surprised and can't wait to return!",Been here twice for brunch and blown away each time.  Donuts and monkey bread go well with French press coffee to start. Ricotta is smooth and lemony - goes well with toasted bread!  Shrimp and grits always good. Turkish eggs truly unique and flavorful!  Sunchokes are potatoes make for good sides!  Best of all - we got to sit at one of the corner tables in the front for a sun drenched brunch!,"Pesto Bianco...is..back people If you know anything about Brooklyn heights, you know there are several restaurants in a 4 block radius and many of which are your general Thai, Mediterranean, or Sushi restaurants. If you live here, you also know how difficult it is to get your Manhattan friends to make the journey. I'm happy to announce Colonie is golden ticket we've all been waiting for. Firstly, sit at the chefs table. Watching the chefs work their magic is incredible (shout out to Kone (sp) on the pasta. They put so much TLC in their food it really is a treat to watch. All of their drinks are delicious, I especially favor the detox retox, and cuc cocktail. The apps are also fantastic I would recommend 1 per person. Everything is fantastic, esp the sweet potatoes, Brussels (shaved and light not fried) and sunchokes. For dinner- get the spaghettoni. The pesto blanco is almond based and has a spicy after taste. I could eat this for every meal for the rest of my life. It can be made vegan or they can make it into a cheesy delight of that's what you're into. Everything here is A++++, but just expect a $100 for a party",Colonie

I'm not sure if they were overwhelmed by number of patrons but it took a lot to get their attention.  The drinks during happy hour were just ok. The male bartender was better at making the drinks. The woman bartender was not friendly and made the worst drink I've tasted at a bar.  They had a taco special, those weren't bad. Also the fries were good as well. I will not be back. After using my card here the very next day I had fraudulent activity on it. I won't say it happened here but I would use cash if I were you.",I work in the neighborhood and try to stop by every Friday afternoon. Janna is the bartender on duty and she is amazing. She always greats me and my coworkers excitedly and remembers our drinks. If she is busy it is because she giving visitors to the neighborhood dinner recommendations or being generally charming with other customers. The backyard (frontyard?) is great in the warm weather and the WiFi reaches the far back. The food is also very tasty.,The Rookery
259,It's as if they took a meatpacking restaurant and gave it Williamsburg chill flare. Will skip next time!,"Starting off by saying I've got some credibility in experiencing great food and even better service - I've got no problems with most of the hyped up restaurants in NYC that live up to their reputations- Olmstead, Four Horsemen, Roberta's, Metta, Lilia, Maison Premier, every Andrew Tarlow restaurant on the planet - love them all. I'm also not a complainer at restaurants at all unless it's bad. That said, I do not understand the hype here and I just have to air my grievances and we went months ago... to warn my fellow good citizens not to waste your money...Soooo - My friend and I were SHOCKED at how rude the service was (we sat at the bar). We're not too precious at all we don't mind non smiley people but this was .. different. We were ignored for so very long every step of the way. It was excruciating waiting at those dreadful barstools to order a drink, to ask for food menus, to ask for drink menus, to ask for anything at all. I had wondered if there was something I did to this man in a past life. Seriously what the actual .... was going on. Fine we'll put up with it I guess if the food was as good as the hype. But sadly it wasn't.  Overly salted and I LOVE salt. We ordered clams that came in a thick creamy sauce with no shells you had to fish them out of the sauce. Everything was so small and I LOVE small portions. Too smalll Girl bye never coming back.","Don't get me wrong, the food here is incredible. The complexity of the chef's palette is what I must applaud. However, the service did not justify the quality of the food.First impressions, we were seated 30minutes after our reservation time (given that we came 5 minutes earlier), it was unacceptable. Yes I wouldn't mind waiting by the bar for 10minutes, but 30? Also did I mention our dinner reservation was at 10:15pm? I just really hope that the restaurant will get more organized with their reservations and take into account the time it takes to set the tables as well.Another bad impression was that we didn't know the portions and wanted to order more food after our first set of orders, but was unaware that the kitchen closes at 11. Our waitress said that our hostess shouldn't informed us, its not a good look to take blame on others like that. We were in a bad mood, but eventually they realize that we were dissatisfied and take our second order and also gave us the beef tenderloin on the house. It was a good ending to the night actually, because we were very full and satisfied. I'm giving this a 3 stars because I was very unhappy with the service.","Don't come here looking for a llama hotel and/or llama. And definitely don't come here without a reservation. Located in Williamsburg-North in Brooklyn, Llama Inn serves up some of the finest Peruvian cuisine I've ever tried. It's a little pricier here than your typical Peruvian fare, but definitely worth every bite and sip.From their drink menu, I chose one of their Llama Classics called the Llamarita. Made with tequila and mezcal, it tasted of almond, avocado, and lime together and topped with a rim of cinnamon salt. At a price of $16, it was worth every penny and more.From their food menu, the skewers are found within the second group of items from the top. We ordered three skewers (Scallop, Pork Belly, Purple Potato) and they were all so tasty.One of my favorite dishes was the Rock Shrimp, Mussels, Clams, Calamari, Aji Panca, English Peas, Rice. Yup.. that's the name of one dish from Llama Inn's menu. They really spell it out for you. Anyhow, this dish was amazing and I highly recommend it. We also tried the Charred Octopus Ceviche, Togarashi, Avocado, Crispy Squid and loved it as well. Ordering on the first visit might be a little difficult, but our server took the time to explain the whole menu beforehand and she gave very detailed answers for any questions that we had.As mentioned earlier, reservations are a must. Without one, you might be turned away. Go to their website at llamainnnyc.com and book an available time slot and seating arrangement. We were able to find one or two open slots for the next day. Would definitely come back here again!",I love this place so much my friends and I try to replicate the dishes. The restaurant is really beautiful with the big open windows. The locations is very unassuming. Good is always extremely depictions and amazing cocktails as well. Highlights:Pork shoulderCevicheBeet SaladQuinoa SaladBeef tenderloinHeaven for your tastebuds. Don't waste another second.,"Just left the restaurant and well I was underwhelmed. I guess, I was expecting something else?? I wouldn't go back as there's other places that aren't as pricey and more tastier. I did like the service and our server was super nice. She went above and beyond as I asked her about sitting on the rooftop. There was seating, but only the bar area. We declined.Anyways, we decided to order the llama del Rey  and llamarita for drinks. The del Rey drink tasted like sangria but with a slightly different kick. My friend has the other drink. For the food we ordered the locro, fluke ceviche, mariscos, chicken thigh skewer, pork belly skewer, and scallop skewers. The skewers were great, but the locro which tasted like mashed squash soup was interesting. The fluke ceviche was good as I liked how everything was seasoned and the fish was good too. Otherwise, everything else was subpar. Yea, I wouldn't go back especially for the over priced entrees.",Llama Inn
260,I got me the butter milk chicken which was good It's similar to the shake shack fried chicken sandwich I'd go again but I don't have the coleslaw thingy if I'm spelling it correctly but yea,"Oh. My. Gosh. Get the Beatles (spicy fried chicken sandwich) and the Grateful Dead burg. The food was phenomenal. The sandwiches were moist, made to order and so so so flavorful. Beware. This can get messy...","I'm going 1 star, and that's because the food is pretty good. I'm also going 1 star because as a business they have pretty questionable practices. They seem to exist as Gnarly Eats, Gnarly Eats 2, Gnarly Soup, Basic Salas, Bar Basico, and probably more. Each one open for business from the same address. Quit flooding all the apps. Just stop. It's horrible customer service and really annoying. This isn't a cool trick to game the system. It aggressively leaves me wanting to leave bad reviews and never order from you again.","We ordered delivery from here and we've done it. We have discovered the best delivery burger in Brooklyn, MAYBE the world.First of all, they offer to package the burger unassembled so you don't end up with a soggy mess by the time the burger arrives. Second, they freshly grind their meat every day and it shows. It is a juicy, tender, but not crumbly or falling-apart patty with the right amount of fat to keep it from drying out. The red cabbage is super flavorful and makes the burger in my opinion - it's garlicky and not too crunchy or too limp. Perfect bite to it. The burger also comes with lettuce, tomato, and pickles on the side. There are caramelized onions on top that, again, add lots of flavor to the burger and that I loved. I liked their special sauce too (basically a tartar sauce).We also got fries, tots, Buffalo wings, and mac and cheese jalapeno poppers.  The fries were ok, not super crispy but tasted really good. The tots were great and we'd probably order those next time. The order of fries and tots were also each HUGE so one order can easily be shared among two to three people. The Buffalo wings were ok - the sauce didn't feel like a true Buffalo with the hot sauce and butter mixed into a sauce. It felt more like purely hot sauce. Tasty but not what I'd want if I'm craving proper Buffalo wings. The wings were juicy though, so I'm intrigued to try their other wing flavor next time.The mac and cheese poppers are a must-have here though! They were so good, perfectly fried, super crispy on the outside (even after delivery), flavorful with the jalapeno, and creamy on the inside from the cheese. It came with a spicy mayo for dipping that was really tasty too.This is DEFINITELY our new burger delivery spot from now on.","This is a rounded up rating . Gnarly scores well on pricing , being a byob and portion size . Taste wise it is anything but almost perfect which is what it's rated on yelp. My review is based on their fried chicken sandwich and their Brisket sliders , both seemingly popular choices . The chicken sandwich - Massive pieces of lightly breaded chicken seasoned well but not quite as juicy as I'm used to . The chipotle sauce was an absolute mess dripping out the sandwich on every bite and did little to add any flavor to the sandwich.The bun was not toasted and again didn't help the sandwich . A thicker less watered down sauce ,juicier chicken and more slaw would have made this sandwich alot better. Overall I'd rate the sandwich 3.5/5.The Brisket slider was again generously portioned with heaping amounts of brisket in two good sized slider buns. The brisket was drenched in a too sweet somewhat honey ish sauce that was yuck ! The brisket itself was not melt in your mouth quality and took a lot of chewing to break down . A simpler sandwich with wonder bread and better brisket would have done the trick way better. Gnarly has a lot of potential but it's not a place I can say I'd surely visit again . I rounded up because the lady manning the restaurant was extremely kind and  outgoing and made my meal a little  more enjoyable than it should have been .",Little hole in the wall with great burgers and chicken.Friendly and helpful staff. Only 3 small tables...I would come again!,Gnarly Eats
261,"I used to love this place. Came there dozens of times. Now after a few months I came back to find out they jacked the price of mezze up to $25, it's no longer unlimited (?!) and the additional dish is $17 instead of $6? And to add insult to injury, they now charge $6 for more lafa bread? I always wonder why businesses suddenly decide to put themselves out of business.Last I came here it was $19 for unlimited mezze, $25 w/the main dish.More than just doubling the price, the person that made the change completely misunderstands the nature of the middle eastern mezze offering. And, given that LamaLo and similar places give you so much better quality for less $$, I sadly see no reason to come back.","Went on a Saturday night, way too loud (92+db). Food was good. I wouldn't go back because of the noise.",We were extremely disappointed with dinner at Glasserie. The food was very heavy and the flavors were off. We found it extremely overpriced for being outside of Manhattan. The mezzes do not come with bread and the griddle bread ($8) was very greasy. We also did not care for the wine we ordered and ended up leaving half the bottle. Overall there are much better Mediterranean/Middle Eastern options.,"Come here for brunch or dinner!! Or have a drink because the decor is beautiful.Mezze feast for brunch (the bread is to die for), the cauliflower, spring salad, and lamb.. their menu is seasonal but everything is delicious!","what came on the plate didn't match the price(s) that were charged AND the ""scam"" pricing structure for the bread to eat with dishes that traditionally come with bread in the first place was a complete turn-off.$8 for 4 pieces of grilled bread as an add-on to a dish that one would expect to come with bread in the first place. two orders of bread were needed to properly compliment that dishe(s).$19 for a standard Manhattan is also a price point that was WELL above what was in my glass. ESPECIALLY since their signature cocktails are listed at $14. ($16 for the rye and +$3 to complete the cocktail.  scam!)I won't be going back to this restaurant.","Oof, madon'! Really charming Mediterranean restaurant. For starters, I loved how all the tables were around this big central bar. The vibe was rustic chic, as many of this cuisine tends to be.We had this fun, funky wine. Delicious.The chicken was juicy and cooked well. The fish was well-cooked, but a more difficult dish. Both cooked super well, though I preferred the chicken. The clams in rice dish was good, more for the rice drenched in clam/whatever sauce.The olives were plentiful. The labneh is delicious. So refreshing. The smoked eggplant was great, too. The pita breads are sooo good, but the baked, crispy, buttery one is phenomenal. We ordered it twice.A bit pricey, to be honest. But such a great vibe, whatever.",Glasserie
262,Amazing unexpected vibe in a converted old school pharmacy with even better food.  A little packed but could not recommend this place more.,"I went again, but wasn't as impressed.Ribollita: as good as usual. Pici: simple but tasty. Duck: it came barely warm, we sent it back, it came back burned, we left on the dish. Although the dish was sizable, this was not good. In addition, the chick peas were uninspiring and boring. Braised short ribs: very tender meat, and very generous portion; plain and boring beans. Chocolate cake: not even close to the old saker torte they used to have... a huge disappointment. Pistachio cake: tasty. House red wine: ok. Service: very accommodating; Filippo was very understanding after realizing the problems with the duck, which were substantial. He took it off the check (we barely touched it) and comped 1 dessert. He couldn't be more gracious. Overall, it's not a nearby place for me and it's not cheap, so I can't hide that this time I was disappointed. The first time I went I was wowed by everything they brought, but this time there were some issues with some dishes, and they totally murdered the duck.","Do not order the wild boar pasta. What they claim is boar is really very under seasoned brisket beef, with buttered and oiled plain flat noodles it looked and tasted like diner quality beef stroganoff. I had even asked my waiter and he assured me it was boar but what does it matter if the food is not good and the plate has a disgusting look to it or as Chef Ramsay might say ""dog turds with noodles."" If I ever come back here, not likely, I know to never order this but I feel like they should fess up about what they are really serving or take this ""boar"" off the menu","Love this place. From the old-school sign out front to the delicious cocktails, I am all about Locanda. Truthfully, I've only ever had drinks and apps here, but it's always a cozy, wonderful time. Sitting at the bar is probably my favorite spot because the bartenders are friendly and very willing to offer recommendations. I usually opt for the charcuterie, but everything looks delicious. I highly, HIGHLY recommend the ""soup"" pappa al pomodoro (I probably butchered the actual name, but you'll get it when you see it). This soup is SO ridiculously, unbelievably good. I look at it and don't understand why it's so good, but it is. You always want more.","Been on an Italian food kick due to vacationing in Italy! Food was good, not great. Solid neighborhood spot, but probably wouldn't travel again to eat here. It did have a pleasant, low-key vibe that I appreciated. Was in the mood to try a new restaurant, but not stay out too late because it's a school night, and Locanda Vini e Olii was kind of perfect for that! They have a pretty extensive aperol spritz / negroni selection, which was fun! I got a mezcal negroni that was alright, a tad sweet. For food, we got the truffle taglierini, the ragu, and the arugula / corn salad. The taglierini was pricey ($30), but very generous when it came to truffles -- that was my favorite despite the price. Wasn't a huge fan of the orange zest in the ragu, but overall it was not bad. Salad was pretty plain though (should have tried the charcuterie board). So yeah, a solid 3 stars for the food... But I still enjoyed my experience there -- it did feel like I was back in Tuscany for a little bit. Would recommend if you're in the area for sure.","Lovely, cozy spot with homey, well-executed, no gimmicks Italian food. Prices are reasonable although it quickly adds up when you start wanting to order multiple apps and a pasta and a main. We had:Fava / peas salad - Perfect, refreshing salad to start off the meal. Cauliflower sformato - Unique dish, like a soufflé, with a creamy fluffy texture. Delicious.  Taglierini al tartufo - Fairly basic pasta imo but with generous / large shavings of truffle. To be honest didn't feel like the truffle was utilized to its full capability in this dish. Grilled Piedmontese beef ""tagliata"" - Steak is seared to the perfect level of rareness and salted with those nice large salt crystals that really bring out the flavor of the beef. Arugula rounds out the dish. So simple but executed so well.",Locanda Vini e Olii
263,"Food is average and edible, but the service is what really brings down the rating. The waitress kind of sucks. I asked her for something and she brought me the same thing. Her personality is not very welcoming. The food the first time I went was amazing but this time around is was tasteless. No salt, no ketchup, nothing. They don't have many condiments either. A place who doesn't have salt or ketchup to bring a customer, is not a place for me. There's also flies flying around and the music is always way too loud.","The food is good...IF you have the time to wait for it.  Almost an hour after we were seated, we still hadn't received one of the items we ordered, and finally decided to take it off the bill.","I dont know what you people are smoking. The food was gross, bland, and greasy, and this magical coconut shake was nothing to write home about. Another dump propped up by hipsters who want to order food in a different language.","So I just recently moved to the Bushwick area from Boston. I was born and raised in Caracas and lived there until I was 12 years old. With that said, I also grew up in Miami where it's heavily populated with Venezuelans and Venezuelan food.This place is as traditional as it gets. Delicious arepas and empanadas cooked fresh to order. The pabellón criollo is as criollo as it gets. Amazing place, highly recommend if you're a fellow Venezuelan or just someone who would like to try some Venezuelan/Latin American style food. Our faves: Pabellón, Arepa Reina Pepiada, Arepa de Pernil, Arepa de Pabellón, y todas las empanadas, y las salsa verde es la que ES!","Another one of my favorite restaurants in Bushwick!This is a great spot if you're working from home and want to step out for lunch and continue working because the food is great, you don't feel compelled to drink, they have WiFi, and play great music that makes you kinda feel you're someplace lush and tropical.I normally order 2 or 3 Arepa's [cuz I stay for a while]:* A Mariscada - is a red sauce/sea foodie type'a dish that makes me want to lick the plate.* A Reina Pepiada - is one of their cold dishes.. super refreshing!And for my third, I often let the server direct me by giving them a few guid rails.. [ie: i'd like something with pork thats savory].If you're looking for a great place for a quick bite, or take a date, or even work, they will make you feel at home here!","Pickup was ready on time.  Restaurant is super casual.   It was not crowded Thursday night, May 2019, at 9pm.  Service was excellent-- the waiter was fun and friendly.Pollo $7.50 and pabellon $8.50 arepas are tasty, especially with their green sauce.  Wish they allowed me to substitute tostones for maduros because I don't like sweet plantains.  $5 Cocada (coconut drink with a maraschino cherry) is a delicious splurge-- get it!  There are no good cooked vegetable options on this menu if you are vegan (mostly jalapenos, green, and yellow peppers).  Yes, I would recommend Arepera Guacuco, but only for meat eaters and pescatarians (NOT for vegans).",Arepera Guacuco Bushwick
264,"The sandwich was very salty,when I visited lunch yesterday, then l throw away.Because this is my first time to visit this restaurant ,so l don't have a lot to say.On the whole, l throw away all food wen my family were tasting, they said,this sandwich is too salty,it's no good for health.","I have lived in park slope my entire life and have gone to stone park cafe countless times over the years. Today will most likely be my last time. My order today was fairly simple: two coffees, two mimosas, and two omelettes. It took a few minutes to get coffee but that's fine. Then the omelettes came and the server said he didn't have our toast yet but he would be getting it soon. That's fine, I have patience, but the toast never came. We also never received mimosas. I very nicely asked our waiter Tim if he could get our mimosas, and he returned several minutes later with only one. Never once was I asked how the food was or if I needed anything else. Then a different waitress brought us our bill without even asking us if we wanted anything else. I noticed on the bill that we were charged for two mimosas even though we only received one (by the way, one mimosa is 13 dollars). We told the waitress we never received toast or a second drink. She didn't seem to know what to say, then walked away and returned with another mimosa. She just dropped it off on the table without saying anything which was a bit odd. An hour into being seated and after finishing my food, I was not interested in the drink at that point. And then on top of that, we saw our waiter Tim leave the restaurant and walk away down the block while we were still seated. I understand that the restaurant closes at 3:30pm on Saturdays and employees need to take breaks, but I found this to just be totally unprofessional and disrespectful. He kind of just disappeared without saying anything. So overall this was a very poor experience. I like to think of myself as a reasonable and patient person, but at some point too many instances of disrespect and poor service become unacceptable. So as I said before, I have been a longtime customer, but that will be coming to an end today.","I most likely would have given it 2 stars due to my disappointing steak and eggs but, I came here about 6 months ago and had the Oyster Po Boy and it was delicious. However when I came back and had their steak and eggs it was very disappointing. The steak was small, thin, and over cooked... For the price hovering around $20 (I would expect it to be much better). Another thing, I may get heat for this but... If you want a relaxing place to talk with friends this isn't it. I may have lost some hearing from over 13 babies screaming the entire time. I get this is Park Slope, I grew up here, but it's very tough to enjoy a meal. You can't even classify me as a grouchy old man, I am in my early 20's... Not sure how they can fix the baby situation lol (sounds horrible and funny when I read that out loud).","Schlepped to BK to have dinner with a friend and this place was completely worth it. The food is phenomenally executed with the perfect level of done. I thought the flavors paired nicely with the food without being overwhelming and taking over the flavor. Our service was top notch and the bartender seemed to know all of her patrons - lovely to watch. I had the pork chop and my friend the half a chicken both were excellent. Although I did want another pork chop the first was so good!Would absolutely come back and it's a great date, friend dinner or meal out with family location.","Great spot for brunch!The wait can be pretty long a the weekend so make sure you get here early and put your name down. I came with a group of 5 and it took us an hour to get seated. Lucky for us there is enough to walk and see around the area to kill time. Once seated, the service was prompt and proper. Our waitress was really nice and she took our food/drink orders quickly and our orders came out pretty quick. I got the steak and eggs: perfectly cooked NY strip and sunnyside up (you can choose the style) eggs make it the perfect breakfast for me. With addition of their buttermilk pancakes with berry compote which were super fluffy and light, made this the ideal end to my meal","There are surprisingly few true brunch spots in Park Slope, so it's no wonder there is a line for Stone Park Cafe before they open at 10am on the weekends. Their patio is pup-friendly (although a small dog would probably be most appreciated, space is limited) so we opted for that seating. The brunch menu has your eggs and French toast staples as well as the more high-end items like short rib hash (very good) and the Hangtown Fry, described as a tempura battered oyster frittata. It was really just a bacon and cheddar omelette with fried oysters on top, but it was really tasty. The oysters had just the right amount of batter on them so they weren't too greasy or heavy. There are lots of other options on the menu that looked good, so we'll have to return and be first in line!",Stone Park Cafe
265,"We're really sad we paid money for this. I had a flavorless pad see ew: when I finally found beef, it was a colorless mush. My wife got labb and chicken dumplings, and could finish either of hers.",Do not order food here!!! It's under-seasoned and underwhelming. There was hair in my pad Thai and the duck roll was all fat and stale duck. Even the lettuce they snuck in there was old. GROSS!,Customer service needs improvement . Wanted to walk out after 5 mins . They made me feel very uncomfortable but I was hungry . The food didn't taste good to me . I will not come back I had better Thai food in Long Island .,"I cant even tell you how long I've been wanting some REAL Thai Food. Not from those Asian fusion places, I needed the real deal. And in comes Am Thai Bistro. I cannot express how great everything I had was. It's kind of small (not a bad thing) definitely hole in the wall and intimate. Decor is very chic, and simple. Our server was great and very engaging. Started off with a Lychee Lemonade which was homemade and sour (just how I like it). Appetizer I had the Shrimp Roll which was a chicken spring roll wrapped in a shrimp roll.. kind of hard to explain but see the picture! Tastes amazing, with a side of sweet chili and spicy mayo. Now for the entrees... We ordered 4 things to try. Chicken Pad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice, Basil Fried Rice & Volcanic chicken. All of the above had flavors that made you feel like you were out of Brooklyn. So much bold taste, juiciness, the right balance of everything mixed in. But let's talk about the Volcanic Chicken: it's this fried chicken with a sweet chili glaze, topped off with more chili glaze in FLAMES. Yes real fire. My chicken was on fire and it was nothing short of amazing. The presentation, the taste. The fire show, I would get it again and again. Thank you for such a treat, I cannot wait to be back and literally do it all over again!",I ordered the crab fried rice and the Thai satay chicken. My fiancé ordered the Thai wings and the veggie pad Thai. His meal was absolutely amazing. I loved the Thai satay however the crab fried rice was very fishy. I put the sauce on it that it came with and it tasted better. I ordered a mango mojito and it was amazing. Food came out pretty fast. I would definitely recommend. FYI: space is extremely small,"$10 for a jug of margaritas/mojitos? SAY NO MORE!This place is so great- from the pricing, to the dishes and very importantly... alcohol. My classmates and I were coming off a VERY stressful clinical day and this place was definitely worth the Uber ride because it was AMAZEBALLS. They have lunch special running on weekdays for only $8.50, which comes with a side salad and a veggie spring roll. I ordered the green curry, whereas my friends ordered drunken noodles and basil fried rice. All were delicious, especially the drunken noodles, which my friends RAVED about. The green curry was SPICY- and I'm Asian. It was a very, strong, punch you in the face spicy, which I can thankfully appreciate. The fried calamari was also delicious as well.As for the alcohol, it's so cheap. $7.50 for a glass or $10 for a jug- come on, it's gotta be the jug! They have a huge range of alcoholic beverages from mimosas to wine to cocktails. And if you're feeling like you don't want double vision today, their jug of Thai iced tea is only $6. Oh my god.Highly highly recommend coming here. The place will satisfy your food and drink cravings!",Am Thai Bistro
266,"I ordered late from here a week ago and paid for extra sauces and items added to my falafel. I did not receive any of the sauces I paid for and the food was cold and soggy by the time it arrived. May be amazing during the day but don't order within 2 hours of closing. Also, $6 delivery fee? Plus I tipped... always disappointed when you spend extra and it's poorly done. - Update, I ordered from here again and after waiting for over an hour and a half, the delivery was cancelled. I was told it was because the driver has an issue with transport. He cancelled 30 minutes after the delivery was supposed to be here. So maybe this place is best for walk in as opposed to delivery. My suggestion would be to only offer delivery within a 5 block radius.","I ordered late from here a week ago and paid for extra sauces and items added to my falafel.

Workers are stuck in the back cranking out food, no one there to greet or take orders. It was telling to see Seamless self order screens.When I finally got my food and took it home, I found out my order was wrong!Food is still quite good, but a bit pricier than it was. I see no reason to visit again, but would possibly order delivery.","Taheni Mediterranean Grill is one of my all time favorite places. Strangely enough, I've never ever visited the brick and mortar location (once I walked by and had a fan girl freak out). Let's say it's excellent for takeout.I'm not totally sure where in the Middle East/Mediterranean the majority of dishes stem from. I am half Egyptian, and I do know I grew up eating a lot of things on this menu - like the Mujadara which is rice, lentils, tomato sauce, and caramelized onions (also know as Koshari). They have some of the best falafel around, and their falafel wrap is probably my favorite ever. Did I mention their fries are amazing? Especially when they're covered in zataar seasoning.My fav middle eastern dessert of all time is Kanafeh, and I challenge anyone to fine a better version than they serve at Taheni Grill. It's the best one I've ever had in all my years. I've also read they serve Kanafeh pancakes for brunch? That's a must try for me.Long story short, Taheni does everything on the menu well. Their bread is amazing, their fries are amazing, their dessert is even more amazing. Be careful, you'll probably be hooked like me if you try it out.","It can be great. I usually go in to get the falafel and every time I do, delish! But lately, I have been asking for the falafel and I have not been getting as much. maybe the place is picking up on business and they now need to sparingly use it? I dunno. Maybe this is bad timing. Don't wanna base the whole longevity of this place on a few experiences, but hey, we're here to share, and I'm sharing.","This was our second time here, and for the second time both my kids finished their plates! I mean, seriously, if you have kids, and they are picky eaters - bring 'em here and enjoy their silent (or not so much) chewing for 15 minutes! We had chicken shawarma, lamb shawarma, zaatar fries and fried halloumi cheese. Also got some cold  red hibiscus tea - so so good! It was that good that we even ordered another lamb shawarma sandwich to bring home for later (guess who ate while husband was at work *evil laugh*)",Taheni Mediterranean Grill
267,"So I had one good experience here before. The food was delicious though the portions were small. It did take awhile to get our food and there was only one other table present. Waitstaff not really attentive or actively checking on us. But me and my date were low maintenance so didn't matter at the time. Fast forward to 6 months later. My sister is visiting from out of town and I really wanted to have her try authentic vegan Caribbean food. We arrive about 15min after they were supposed to open. Someone's sleeping at a table and the other person doesn't greet us. After an awkward confused minute sleeping beauty wakes up and says, sorry were not open yet. And I said I was confused I thought they opened at 2p and the door was unlocked. She said that the chef wasn't here yet and to come back in half an hour!! Which is outrageous. No apology or offer to wait inside in freezing 30 degree weather. So of course we leave. And then another employee just arriving says the chef should be here in 5ish minutes!! So obnoxious.",I can't comment much on the food as it never came out.What I know is that my dinner guest and I waited too long for our order of salad and stir fried vegetables and decided to leave when the food still had not come out an hour and a half later.An hour and a half for SALAD...The service here is so terrible and slow that it is comical.Come on a full belly.Of note- at least they didn't make us pay when we left.,"No, no, no...Never mind that you walk through a messy, open kitchen to get to the outside area... And totally cool with them being out of the main ingredient in the drink and dish you wanted to order... But 45 minutes for two entrees when you're one of four tables? Finally put your food out only to make you wait even longer for rice while you pick at your stew and realize it's so, so bland--but not as bland as your husband's (who will now never be convinced to eat vegetarian again, and is quietly grumbling something about ""frozen college food"").Finally eating the meager, unjustifiably priced food, the chef come out and sits in a chair five feet away. He then starts smoking a pipe right next to us.  I'm full-term pregnant, and the table next to us had a kid with them. I'm all about laid back and casual, but this was something else!","First off, lemme just say, the food here is superb! We had a spicy green thumb salad for starters, which had a delicious vinaigrette drizzled on top and all the vegetables were fresh and made to order. For an entreé, we had the salmon with rice pilaf. When the salmon arrived to the table, it was plated with perfection. Every detail was put into place skillfully as if it came from the hands of a master chef. What was even better than the craftful aesthetics was the taste. Everything on the plate was magnificent: the sauce, the spinach, the fruit and the salmon. They all complemented each other. The salmon was charred flawlessly. To finish off, we ordered the sweet plantain. It was the ripest, sweetest, most delicate and savory end to our meal. Hats off to the chef who prepared everything by himself to order. I highly recommend this clean, laid back establishment to anyone looking for the perfect meal.","Definitely try this place.  I had the ""jerk chicken"" and it was well seasoned with a variety of herbs and spices and soft and chewy.  I liked the spicy flavors.  Try the yellow plantains as well.  They were soft with a moist texture on the inside.  The sugar that hardens on the outside is a nice touch!I want to eat in as it is a nice setup to have the kitchen open to everyone dining in.  If they ever move to a new bigger location, keeping that element would be a plus for me and maybe others as well.","Delicious vegan-friendly Caribbean food in a snug & colorful atmosphere. The staff are super friendly. There are only 1 or 2 people working in the kitchen, so food may take a bit of time to come out, but you can really tell they care about the quality of their dishes. Also they are plastic-free! If you're in Crown Heights, definitely check out this wonderful spot.",Ital Kitchen
268,".:WHAT I LOVE:.- Friendly staff- Place was a lot bigger than what I thought it would be- I got Tom Yum and my boyfriend ordered the crab fried rice. I don't usually eat spicy food, so I ordered a mild and it was soooo delish..:WHAT I DON'T LOVE:.- Ambience was a bit dirty and small- Lighting was terribleDefinitely need to come back again for the desserts, since this place looks like they specialize in their desserts","These noodles! This spice level! Fish sauce! As authentic as northeastern Thai/Lao food goes in downtown-ish Brooklyn at the right price point as far as I've encountered. I love the aromatic, strong flavors of all the noodle soups, but the boat noodle soap is my go-to. Zabb wings, khao kha moo, and som tum are always high on my list if it's not a soup day. Be warned, the spicy is SPICY.",Come here if you want authentic Thai food. The dishes I tried were all bursting in flavor.,"It was our first time dining at Look by Plant  Love House. The place was small but cozy. Three of us were there on Sunday evening. We took about 10 minutes to look at the menus. The servers were really friendly. They were really patient and helpful even they got slammed with take-out/delivery. The service was very fast too!! We decided to share Som Tum Tard Salad Tray. We were so glad that we ordered. The dressing was perfect and refreshing, the chicken wings were really good, the sides that came with the salad were good flavor combinations.I ordered Yen Ta Fo for myself and I LOVED IT. The broth was perfectly prepared. My sister-in-law got Guay Tiao Gai Toon. The broth was really good as well. It came with a huge slow cooked chicken drumstick. My husband ordered Kuay Tiao Num Tok. The broth was a little too sweet, we asked for the sambal to add on. It turned out very tasty.We couldn't finish our food. Every single dish came with a huge portion so we got leftover for the next meal. We ordered the mango coconut sticky rice and durian coconut sticky rice. The mango was delicious but durian might be too smelly for someone who doesn't like durian. I personally loved both of them. Service was great Food was delicious We will definitely go back and try other dishes!!","I have had a lot of Thai food these past few years (mostly because it is a popular lunch choice amongst my colleagues) and this place has some of the best Thai food I've ever had. I have frequented Spice, Fish Cheeks, Thai Villa and it all pales in comparison to the simple goodness that I have had here.While other places are mediocre or try to hard to be upscale, this place and their food hits all the right spots. The staff is also really friendly. You'll find families dining here and a really authentic menu. I would make it my mission to come back here and try everything at least once.","Very Brooklyn Thai vibe to this little cute restaurant- if that's a thing. We've actually ordered delivery from here a ton of times. It made sense for us to stop by when we happened to pass it on our way back form another restaurant (we're pigs).We were already full but we still managed to wolf down a very tasty (but very spicy- think ""Thai spicy"") noodle soup, crispy wonderful fried chicken wings, and the traditional mango with sticky rice dessert.All very nice, just like the sweet ladies who work here.",Look By Plant Love House
269,"I came here for a company dinner and there were flies everywhere. Throughout the whole breakfast there were about four flies all over us, flying into our food and onto us. It almost seemed unreal and was quite disturbing . Which sucks because this is a beautiful place, with a DOPE bathroom. The staff is friendly and the food is very good and filling. However of that doesn't matter if there's flies everywhere interrupting your meal.","One of the brunch dishes we ordered had a worm crawling in it. We called the waiter over and sent the dish back and cancelled the order for the dish because we felt a bit finicky post incident. We were shaken by the incident but proceeded to not make a big deal about it. I was hoping that the restaurant would make some reparations for the incident and provide a discount of some sort (or a totally free meal) but to my dismay, no such thing happened. I have sneaky feeling that the treatment and service for such an incident would have been handled differently for more Caucasian patrons of this establishment. This review has nothing to do with the food itself, which I find to be quite delicious. I've been here here in three separate occasions  however, I'm disappointed by the level of service offered and how the situation was handled and will not be returning back as a result.",Recommendation:1: Soya Marinated Tuna Tostada2:Tlayuda OxomocoThe tuna really made my day!,"We have eaten at Oxomoco many times but I only just now took photos to give readers a glimpse of the amazing food here. The restaurant has a nice outdoor seating area and a well-decorated interior as well which gives off a very ""hip"" vibe upon entry. The staff is accommodating and friendly which helps tie everything together. We've eaten dinner here before (which was great as well) but I find the Oxomoco brunch experience to be the most enjoyable. Drink wise, you really can't go wrong but we really love the Spicy Mango margarita (don't worry, it's pretty mild) and the Smoked Strawberry. Appetizer wise, we enjoy the guacamole (which comes with large tortilla chips) but recently discovered the Chorizo Tlayuda which has a tortilla base topped with cheese, beans, salsa, and chorizo. Believe it or not, the tlayuda was not as heavy as you'd expect but very delicious. Lastly, we tend to order the Hamburguesa Pambazo, Bacon Burrito, or the Concha Especial. Between the three, the Hamburguesa Pambazo and Concha Especial are the best tasting and most unique in terms of flavor and presentation. The Hamburguesa Pambazo has a salsa macha that adds a nice flavor to the already juicy burger while the Concha Especial creates a wonderful sweet and savory taste by combining the pan dulce (Mexican sweet bread) with chorizo verde. Overall, I highly recommend everyone to grab brunch here ASAP and get a taste of the Oxomoco experience. Oxomoco consistently offers great food, drink, and service. We look forward to coming back again soon!","Located in the heart of greenpoint, this Michelin star restaurant boasts and authentic feel with some delectable eats.I came for brunch and sat on the outdoor patio which was cozy and chique. To start, I tried a few margaritas-both the spicy Mango and mezcal strawberry were excellent, and, very aesthetically pleasing.The tostadas definitely intrigued me. We ended up ordering the tuna and it was, unsurprisingly, savory and delicious.I tried the chilaquiles rojos for my main meal, which I'd definitely recommend. Overall, the service and ambience of Oxomoco is quite pleasing. I definitely would return to taste other brunch menu items, and of course, the renowned tacos. Definitely recommend making a reservation in advance.","My boyfriend is obsessed with Bobby Flay so we were watching the Flay List and this restaraunt was in it. Bobby Flay's daughter recommended it. I come to Greenpoint all the time and walk past this place but never went so we thought to try it.We knew it was going to be expensive so was prepared for that. But we were really disappointed in the food quality for the price. You get two small tacos for $17. In the chicken taco the flavor was good, but I had a huge bone in mine! Good I didn't chomp down or would have lost a tooth. The steak one was very chewy. Also wasn't crazy about the tortilla used, it was too starchy tasting. And The horchata agua fresca was mostly ice. We ordered two desserts. The flan and the chocolate cake. The chocolate cake was definitely better than the flan. The cake was dense and rich, i liked the crunchies on top which added a nice texture with the creamy coffee ice cream. The flan dish was a mess though. It was a rectangle of gelatin. Totally the wrong texture, and it was swimming in a blueberry sauce. That blueberry sauce did not go with the flan or compliment it in anyway. There was supposed to be lemon on it and I tasted no lemon. I just tasted overwellming blueberry jam with gelatin. The corn crisps on the top added a crisp respite to the gelatinous dish but did not compliment it in flavor. The best thing we tried was the $4 smoked mango. My boyfriend loves smokey, spicy things and dried fruit so this was right up his alley. The mango had a nice chewy juicy texture to it and the spices were a nice combo. A bit too spicy for me but he really liked it. Also the bathrooms have disco balls in them. A very wierd experience. Not a fan. So we paid $100 for an icey drink, some dried fruit, bones in tacos, chewy steak and gelatinous dessert. We are okay with spending $40 on tacos but they better be the most amazing tacos we ever had. And they were very far from it. Skip this place and go to los tacos no. 1. Which is my favorite taco place and also coincidently Bobby Flay's pick on the show.",Oxomoco
270,"New to the neighborhood and decided to stop in to try out some Venezuelan cuisine. I got LA BESTIA arepa filled with steak, chorizo, fried queso blanco and pico. I was hungry when I came in- it really hit the spot. It's a cool location with a very diverse menu filled with different arepas, bowls, burritos, empanadas, and other specialty foods. I have no doubt this will be the first of many trips to this establishment. Shout out to White Maize for bringing this cool concept to Smith St and executing it flawlessly.","I got food poisoning today after eating the avocado chicken salad. According to reviews below, a couple who also had the chicken salad less than a week ago got food poisoning as well... I have enjoyed their food many times before in the past, but am now worried about returning.",I came in with my girlfriend on Saturday I ordered a chicken bowl without quinoa my girlfriend ordered an appetizer of tostones with a guacamole chicken Salad & a pabellon arepa we both ended with food poisoning  we were in the hospital to 7 the next morning. After that meal  not a place I would recommend to my worst enemy,"Got the vegetarian arepa and wow! Is it good! Better than those east village area spots Caracas and Arepa Factory. Totally shocked me as I've been going to those places for years. The arepa itself is so fresh and fluffy and grilled and corn-flavored, while the avocado and sweet plantains give it a creaminess and sweetness. The beans keep it filling and the white cheese is the cherry on top.Can't wait to come back and try the beef arepas and their appetizers.5 stars!!!!!!!","Yummmm. Tried the pulled beef arepa. It was delicious, but not a 5 star. I was still a little hungry after one arepa to myself, so maybe I just eat too much.  We got it to go, but the staff were nice. Maybe I'll try this place again.","Ok so I went in today all excited to find out about their special which was a seared salmon bowl with black beans, white rice, quinoa, pico, some cheese, avocado and fried plantains. At first, the dish was delicious but afterwards, it made me want to vomit! I then opted for a desert hoping that something sweet would help. I received the cake and the presentation wasn't great but I dug in anyway. In the middle, the cake was chalky like undercooked flour. They gave me an UNDERCOOKED cake and told me they could refund me for the cake but if I wanted to finish the cake I could go ahead and do so as well. I am highly disappointed as I was very excited to be eating here & surely I will never return!",White Maize
271,Ordered beef stew with rice take out.   The beef stew looks like someone's leftover.   I got four pieces of beef stew and there was barely any sauce.   The beef was tough.   It was a total disappointment.,"8 months ago, I first tried Pho60 and loved it. It became my go-to Vietnamese place. But ordered today for delivery, but what I got looks like vomit. And I'm not kidding. I'm so disappointed on how their quality had gone down. I ordered the beef stew with bread, but there were like 4 beef chunks and the rest are either tomato peel or beef fat (or i don't even know what it is). I also noticed that the way the cut the beef wasn't uniformed, that makes it look nastier and inedible. Posting a pic just for proof, but I suggest not looking into it. It's so gross!",Sugar Hot Ice Tea! I was just about to finish the soup of a #1 noodle soup then I found a tiny piece of metal under the bowl. No more mood for eating!!,Best pho in BKLove the pork chop noodle soup! The way they make the pork chop is Delicious thinly sliced. The soup is tasty! The spring roll is not overly fried! And not oily like other viet place. Acevedo shake is so good!Bunbohue is so tasty! I will be back again,"One look at Pho 60's menu makes me want to order almost everything on the menu! I'm so happy this place opened up in a convenient location for me. I honestly was a little hesitant about trying this place at first because it's not your typical Vietnamese restaurant concept. The food is really good. I love starting with the Fresh Beef w/ lime juice and their Vietnamese Steamed Rice Crepe. Also love the Shrimp Paste Noodle Soup and Hainanese Chicken Noodle Soup!Service here is on and off. One time, my order was forgotten and my dish took about 40 minutes to make. No apology, no recovery.","This little Vietnamese spot is just what the Dyker/Borough Park border needed. In the past, I've ordered from a couple of other Viet take-out spots in Bay Ridge that are willing to deliver to Dyker, none of which were any good. Pho 60 is where its at though. Although on the pricier side, I will say that Pho 60 is authentic and quick.If I was writing this review based on my first experience alone, I would be giving them 2 stars. The food arrived lukewarm, strewn about in the bag haphazardly, and the portions were totally off. I ordered the Grilled Sliced Pork with Rice Vermicelli ($8.95) but the bowl consisted almost entirely of rice noodles and a few small pieces of pork. I also ordered the Pork Spring Rolls ($4.95) which were left in the fryer for too long. These were also super oily and tiny, and not worth the price. The saving grace this time was the Rainbow Ice ($3.95), which I haven't found at too many other Viet spots in Bay Ridge/Dyker. It was super yummy and I was happy to see it on the menu.My second experience was much better. I reordered the Grilled Sliced Pork with Rice Vermicelli, the Vietnamese Rice Cake ($6.95 for 8 pieces), the Vietnamese Rice Crepe ($8.95), the Tapioca Cake/Pie with Coconut Milk ($3.95), and another Rainbow Ice. I opted to skip ordering those tiny, tasteless spring rolls altogether. The Vietnamese Rice Cake was something I had never tried before, but we really quite enjoyed them. The Vietnamese Rice Crepe was awesome and the portion was huge. The vermicelli bowl was much better than the first time I ordered, and even though we were SUPER stuffed, we managed to devour the Tapioca Cake which was delicious and arrived still hot, as well as the Rainbow Ice. If I has to nitpick a little bit, I'd say I just wish that I had known the tapioca dessert came with sesame seeds on top.I'm happy I gave this place another try. After reading a lot of other good reviews, I'd like to visit the actual restaurant next.",Pho 60
272,"TLDR; Food: healthy but mediocre.Atmosphere: loud/chaotic, run by a bunch of bratty kids. Seat yourself, order yourself at the counter, but read the menus plastered on multiple walls quickly. Overpriced for what it is.","I really like this place! This is the second time I've been here. Got the French toast which is great !soft on the inside and crunchy outside with a little chocolate sauce and a lot of berries! Absolutely delicious. Also got this dish with scrambled eggs, bread which was ehh, really good roasted potatoes. Added haloumi cheese  to it, which was also amazing.   S'mores latte was really good, but didn't really love their tropical fruit tea, as it was really bitter even with 2 sugars and lots of honey. While I love the food, it is quite annoying that you have to fight for your own table after you order, then they bring the food to you and especially on weekends for brunch, it's extremely crowded.","It's always busy which is a good thing. I got myself an ice brew, croissant & tea. A bit overpriced but when you need coffee, it doesn't matter!",Love this place...huge selection of healthy food and drink options galore!!!Any avocado/bowl/egg variations you can think of! Def my go-to neighborhood place,"Good place to grab a quick bite! I like the vibe here - the interior decor is adorable and the employees are friendly. In terms of the actual food, the menu items are a bit overpriced and taste just mediocre. I ordered the Eggcellent Breakfast Sandwich, which was tasty, but way too oily. The oil from the chorizo drenched through the pastry onto my plate, making it almost uneatable. I'd recommend ordering if you ask them to drain the oil before serving. My friends ordered the Not Your Father's Bagel, Madeline Breakfast Plate, and one of their wraps. They all looked tasty, but didn't seem out of the ordinary. I think I personally ordered the wrong brunch item, so I'd stop by here again to try something new. Overall, a cute spot for brunch if you're in the area!","We were unimpressed with Café Madeline. This brunch spot seems overpriced, considering the average quality of its ingredients and execution.Food: OK (3 of 5). Dishes We've Had:- Prosciutto Breakfast Croissant: $11.99. - One Hander (as a Spinach Wrap): $11.99.- Custard Egg Toast with Prosciutto and Pecorino: $16.99. Café Madeline's portions are reasonably large, but too plainly executed to justify the restaurant's high asking prices -- the beet and grape tomato garnish that seemed common to all of our dishes isn't enough of a differentiation. Further, the prosciutto in both of our dishes that included it was chewy; of a middling quality.Service: OK (3 of 5). Order your food at the cashier, pick up your drink at the drink counter, and find a seat -- not necessarily in that order. The food is brought out to you when it is ready. Atmosphere: OK (3 of 5). There is one reasonably-maintained uni-sex bathroom.Value: We've Had Better (2 of 5). There are two points in Café Madeline's favor: suggested tips are calculated on pre-tax subtotals, and there is a 5% discount for your Yelp check-in.",Cafe Madeline
273,"Honestly , the food was delicious BUT  I ordered fried chicken with collard greens and candied yams. The fried chicken was supposed to come with a leg and a thigh. Instead of a leg and thigh I received 3 wings. Where on earth is this acceptable? For $14 ? AND I'm 8 months pregnant. You know I was pissed. Disrespectful.","My receipt clearly says sweet potatoes but received corn and receipt with sweet potatoes crossed out. What if I was allergic to corn, they didn't care cause I didn't receive a call saying they were out of what I wanted. This is a lack of respect, laziness and flat out negligence. Won't be ordering from them again. The nerve.",I waited 45 minute for Collard greens and a fish sandwich. The had no smoke flavor and sugar was added to it the  and the fish was slightly burnt.,"I'm a customer at Mother's seafood and needed to do a catering order for my best friend who's mom passed away and needed to cater for a repass . All the guest enjoyed the food, it was delicious , consistent with taste and the seasoning were on point ... I highly recommend Mother's seafood for large orders , or small orders .   Love the turkey wings , string beans , collard greens ,fried chicken wings , fried fish (just naming a few) overall food is for sure delicious.... Keep up the amazing work ....",I visited this restaurant once but I don't see my self returning in the future. I say this because specifically the level of customer service definitely needs improvement. The ordering process is not very clear from the time you walk in. I had to ask where I could order to go meals.Eventually I was able to order two meals to go and was given an approximate time that the food would be ready. When I returned I asked about my food and was told it should be ready soon. Standing there watching I saw food come out that looked like what I ordered and the woman behind the counter begins packing the food. I see her douse the food in butter and immediately I ask again about my food. I also inform her that the food she had in her hand looked like my order. Of course it's my food! So I ask her why she would be adding things to my food without asking me first. Her response was that they season every order the same. But I don't want my steamed fish doused in butter I reply and I would've told you so had you asked.- I would've ordered fried fish if I wanted the grease? She ignores my statement and hands the food to me anyway and looks away. Nope they won't get business from me again SMH. Im not in the habit of paying for disrespect! There are too many restaurant options to have to deal with that kind of service again SMH.,"Today was my first time here, came to BK to visit my family and was craving seafood. Checked yelp and saw this place had 4 stars so I gave it try. I called in my order for pick up and arrive 20 minutes as the young lady said it will be ready in 20 minutes on the phone. I get there paid and she said it will be a few. I realized she never put my order. So I sat down because I figure it won't take to long to fry shrimp and fries. After 35 minutes at a empty restaurant I finally got my food.       The shrimp was jumbo and not to bad, the fries were ok and the green beans were blah. Now for $22 I don't feel it's worth it especially how the establishment looks. Now if the customer service was great and the place was clean then $22 would have been looked at different.",Mother's Seafood & More
274,"This place is really a victim its own success. The food and the staff were both great but the wait to be seated and the wait for your food was almost unbearably long. Also, there is no personal space here. I bumped elbows with the person from the table next to me several times throughout the meal. If they ever move to a larger location I would go back.","This place is really a victim its own success.

Other than that: I loved their brown butter pancakes, avocado toast was above average (as expected), my scrambled egg cheddar sandwich was a bit mediocre but everything else was memorable.","AMAZING brunch! I came here with 3 friends on a Sunday mid-day and the place was packed! They have both indoor and outdoor seating available; luckily we did not have to wait!We ordered the fruit salad and ricotta pancakes to share, along with the Moroccan scramble and steamed mussels. Everything was super fresh and delicious. I had the crop top cocktail which was amazing!The service was fantastic! Kevin was our waiter and he was able to give us recommendations on popular dishes. Our food came out super quickly and piping hot. Sometimes, with popular restaurants, I feel rushed through my meal, however this was not the case here. We were able to enjoy our meal and linger after our meal was over without being pushed out. Check this place out for a quality brunch! Make sure to get there early and beat the lines as they don't take reservation and it gets crowded.","I'm not too sure what the hype is about this place. My friend recommended it and since I've never been, I figured why not. We got seated at the bar and despite seeing a few empty seats inside and a slew of people (and I mean a slew) waiting outside, the restaurant did not rush to have them seated which I can't figure out why. I started it out by ordering their ice coffee only because the bartender highly recommended it. To my disappointment the coffee was so diluted that I could barely get my caffeine fix. Instead it tasted water downed and it was only confirmed when I actually saw the bartender doing the same thing to other ice coffee that was being ordered. I would see him adding the coffee half way, then ice and water to fill up the remaining cup (ewww) When he asked me how my food was, my friend tried to tell him I wasn't happy with the coffee and his remark was yeah it weak isn't it. You prolly think you ordered tea instead. Like wtffff?? First he said it's the best thing and highly recommended me to order and now he's being sarcastic (thumps down). As for the food, I ordered their eggs with hashbrown and two choice of side. It wasn't bad but it wasn't mind blowing either, just satisfying. As for my friend he ordered their pancake and it was under cook and tasted more like a cake then a pancake. Overall, I feel with all other brunch places around Williamsburg, this place is definitely not worth the wait.","Came here today on a Sunday around 2pm. While there isn't an official ""brunch"", they offer breakfast and lunch menus. No reservations allowed. We waited 30 minutes for our seat. We were seated by the window so it was absolutely TOO HOT!!! There are many seats outdoors/window-facing, so definitely ask for an indoor seat for a little longer wait. We first got hot chocolate and iced latte. The iced latte was a super steal because it was around $4 for a GIANT glass. We then got our orders which were the ricotta pancakes and Big Brekkie. Big Brekkie is standard around ~$16 with two free sides. I chose the sautéed mushrooms and bacon as my sides. YUM! The hash browns come in a croquette-looking shape. I absolutely loved my food and had a lot leftover so I took it to-go. The service was alright. The staff were friendly and smiling but were a bit busy so we had to call them a lot of times to order or to grab the bill.A really nice thing about this place is their Coffee To-Go window! You can literally walk by and grab coffee. I would've really liked to try the green tea noodle but I didn't see any photos of it on Yelp. :-(",Five Leaves
275,"They have good decent food and such a big selection of dishes but they lack so much in one thing. Service. Service makes or breaks your enjoyment in an established like this. And this server, extremely rude and not pleasant at all. Her name !?! ARIANA mark my words. I never review an establishment like this unless they absolutely ruin my night. And Ariana the server has done that thoroughly.","Reasonably priced all you eat hot pot and Korean BBQ spot.  The space is really big, so they are able to accommodate large parties.The menu is expansive with lot of options for meat/seafood/vegetables.   They also have a sauce bar to flavor things up a bit.","Good service and good food but it's always crowded. If you didn't make a reservation, you have to wait at least 1 hour for seats. This place gets crowded after 6PM","The first meal of our trip we chose AYCE hotpot and 99 Favor definitely hit the spot! We dined in on around 5 pm on a Saturday and there was no wait at all, however, our party of 4 got seated at a table with 4 individual burners instead of 1 family-style pot (what we were hoping for to get the full experience) No big deal, we each had our own personal pot but it would have been nice to get to taste the different broths that they offer rather than being confined to the one you choose for your own pot (it seemed like a hassle to have each person order a different broth and taste them all that way since they were so spread out). They have a good selection of meats, veggies, seafood, and noodles. Everything tasted quite fresh and they gave enough servings for our party of 4 every time. The servers were very attentive and came over to refill our broths and water cups often. The dipping sauce bar was very well stocked and had a great amount of variety. Since it was exactly 3 days before my birthday I got to dine free (with a party of 4) and they also brought out their singing mascot and gave me free ice cream! Definitely a memorable experience and after a wonderful meal here! If you and your friends are in town and looking to do AYCE I'd definitely recommend 99 Favor!","Been here a few times and every time it was to get Hot Pot and it was great but this time our group decided to get BBQ. Needless to say, the service was not what we expected. Maybe because we are a group of teenagers and that is why. Who knows?Can you believe 3 rounds of food took close to 3 hours? I get that the cooking process does take some time but essentially no one was paying attention to our table and most of the time the meat came out burnt. By the end, we decided to serve ourselves. Another thing to note was that in the middle of our third round, one of the server had come and taken away the table that was supposed to hold the raw ingredients. We weren't done by then as none of us were full but maybe that was a sign telling us that we had to get out. We tried getting a server's attention to inform that we would like to continue eating but basically everyone ignored us. Not the very best BBQ experience ever as it did not feel like an all-you-can-eat situation. The end result was that we actually paid $35 (included tips+tax) per person for 3 rounds of food. The Hot Pot should have been a better choice.P.s. I know that lettuce was a free service but one of them came out with a dead bug on top of one of the lettuce. One of the server, (didn't get her name) was nice enough about it and exchanged a fresh new patch for us.","We did reservations and didn't have to wait at all. I'm not sure if it'll make a difference if you make reservations or not.We did bbq. Food was eh, flavoring could be better. Food was oily and there was a lot of fatty meat :(Aside from that, we had a great waitress, Ariana, she was very sweet and patient with us. I hope you'll be lucky enough to have her as a waitress.Thanks for serving us, Ariana!",99 Favor Taste
276,"Came here again and was disappointed. Had a burger and it was very plain. Fries are frozen, a few fries on my plate we're gross. Atmosphere is still nice but tight. Service was extremely slow.","UPDATED:I've given this place a shot again, and they are right back on track and I couldn't be happier ! The food is back to the old days, with great new options on the menu. I see they hired new staff, which are courteous and attentive. THEIR BLOODY MARY is back to a 11/10, and some new menu items are NOMZ! Try the salmon or steak sandwich for lunch","Not much of a wait here but it took a while for our food to come out. We got the French toast and the chicken & waffles. The French toast was disappointing honestly, which is a shame because I absolutely love French toast for brunch! The whipped cream wasn't anything special and sadly made my toast very soggy, very quick. I wasn't able to finish my toast :( The chicken and waffles were great though! It's not on the menu so make sure to ask if you do go.","My elderly mom passes by here often since this has been our neighborhood for like 20 years. Sometimes she catches a breath on the chairs outside and they treat her nice despite not ordering anything.I'm in town to visit and the first place she wants to eat with my wife and I is this place. She is genuinely excited and is real happy to finally try the burgers.I just got off a red-eye and took a quick nap and so I'm not totally alive just yet so I elect to share a double burger with her. Restaurant staff is totally cool. Wife had a fish taco, I had local craft beer as well.Being a part of the community is cool. Being a good restaurant is cool. Being both is awesome!Try this place out!","The close proximity to The Kings Theater brought my girls and I to the Ox Tavern before a show. It sits on the corner and is very quaint with al fresco seating. We started with drinks and they were all on point! They even let us switch gin for vodka in the Eastside Cocktail. It was refreshing with a kick! I ordered the Pan Seared Scallops with Mushroom Risotto, Sautéed asparagus and a Lime Butter Sauce. There is truly an art, in my humble opinion, to cooking the perfect risotto. Oh the sweet taste of perfection! The lime butter sauce truly elevates the flavor of the risotto. The scallops were perfectly seared and juicy! As if it couldn't get better- dessert. There is nothing better than a good bread pudding. My Nana made the best bread pudding in the universe, but this was pretty darn good! It was prepared in the shape of a muffin and dotted with the sweet taste of blueberries and strawberries. This was not overpowering of the typical sweetness that you associate with bread pudding either. my friends all said they weren't sure about this place when we arrived but they were pleasantly surprised. They all agreed that the food was excellent! The Crispy Brussel Sprouts and Black Beans and Rice received rave reviews from our Vegan-ista!Needless to say, I'll be returning to the Ox Tavern over the summer to sample a bit of everything. I only rated this a four because one of my friends said the codfish cake was just okay, and the strawberry shortcake was as well. Looking forward to my next visit!","Quaint tavern in Brooklyn. Food was really quite good. My wife enjoyed the fish and the lamb lasagna was excellent. In terms of the service - ugh!  Place was busy when we arrived. There were 2 open tables for 2 available when we arrived. The waiter informed the 4 of us that they don't put tables together. So the 4 of us waited outside for 20 minutes in a light drizzle. Then they called us in to actually sit at those 2 tables for 2 pushed together. Explain that!After ordering, we could not get the waiter to come over. He was too busy watching the Yankee baseball game. Seriously!",The OX Tavern
277,"Not a great experience.  Their ""roasted chicken"" was actually pan fried. It tasted ok but not what we ordered. The bbq chicken sandwich was really sad. Not much chicken and soooo dry. I could see how this place would be great for drinks, appetizers and live music but their dinner menu needs some work.","We sat outside in the back yard, enjoying a terrifically sunny day. It was one of those rare perfect New York Spring Summer afternoons, not too hot, not too cool. The mosquitos were all still in bed, saving energy for their 'reign of terror', due to start in a month or so's time.We supped on chilled rose whilst trying to secure the wobbly table and avoiding a persistent drip from above (it was some kind of drainage issue or a very localised rain shower). Feeling a might peckish our table of five ordered a selection of boards and a plethora of oysters.My consternation and surprise return to Yelp (aren't you happy I'm back?) was motivated by what lay beneath the cheese, olives and deviled eggs. The board on which the food was served was centrally coated in what appeared to be BLACK MOULD! We discussed this as a party but were too meek and shy to bring it up with the waiting staff (who forgot an order of drinks at some point in the afternoon). Was it mould? Could the wood be burnt? But why would it be burnt? There's no pizza on the menu or reason to place it on a stove or in an oven. Oh no, it must be mould?!I did the only reasonable thing to do to get to the bottom of this mystery, I posted it on my instagram stories. Let the people decide if it's mould or not! Of course no-one really knows for sure, but the general consensus leans somewhat to the mould side of things. I would like to point out that the boards were black on both sides, all the boards we encountered had the same ugly patches of suspected mould and that it's not a good sign for a restaurant that you're even having to  question dubious hygiene standards. Also the non-black bits of the boards were dirty. The boards had splits in too, which surely is a preferred hiding spot for bacteria, e-coli and associated gunk.If the black stuff was not mould I would give this place 3 stars - totally generic ye-olde-Brooklyn spot, that you will probably enjoy enough for an evening but never need to go back to. There was no live music whilst we were there it should be noted.If the black stuff was mould (what else might it be?!) then it's 1 star and an ill feeling in my stomach this morning.",Food was bad. Chicken sandwich had about 3 tbs chicken and massive bread. Should have sent back. Happy hour wine are light pours. Solid pass.,"Went there to hear live jazz on a Friday night and was not disappointed. The trio was excellent. Nice selection of small batch gins and single malt scotch.Had their signature burger which was great.The atmosphere was festive and loud. The space is setup well so if you really want to listen to the music you can sit close, or hang out in other areas where the music will be background and the vibe social.","If yelp had 4.5 stars, it would get that. Atmosphere was excellent! Why?! Well, the lighting was that of your therapists office but dimmer. The type of place you'd go to meet a stranger to tell them about your life and learn the secrets of life. The space has a surprising spaciousness. Skinny and long, really gets the job done ;)There's also a spacious outdoor space, with plenty of spaces for you. The food was delightful! I shared the mussels, creamy mushroom risotto, and grain bowl. All were tasty though the muscles were the best, particularly the coconut, lemongrass sauce those little crustaceans were soaking in. The risotto and grain bowl were good, but couldn't keep up. These two dishes are why this place didn't get 5 stars. They had a some good ol fashion string band gypsy folk jazz. Really added to the overall experience though was a bit loud for the indoor space, especially when there were vocals.Last but NOT LEAST, the pina colada, amazing (insert drooling emoticon). It was frozen, because it was so good, time stood still...and because of temperature and stuff. A MUST GET!!!Would definitely go again :)","St. Mazie is a dreamy, lovely spot for good cocktails and live music. Both times I've been I've loved the drinks that I've ordered. I've only done small plates for food but everything I've tried has been great! They have a super cute outdoor area in the back. It gets very busy though so I recommend making a reservation. The only reason I wouldn't give them 5 stars is because the service is pretty mediocre if not below average.",St. Mazie
278,Cool atmosphere. Decent+ service. Huevos r-cheros bland afShould have probably gone w/ the muffuletta. Lady one table over got it. Took a bite when she wasn't looking,We stopped by for a drink while walking down Van Brunt Street in Red Hook. Their seating was full outside so we grabbed the seats outside along the the windowsill. I had an octoberfest beer from Jack's Abby. Service was friendly and attentive.,"Fort Defiance is a New Orleans restaurant and bar on Red Hook's main drag. The restaurant is adorable and the food is delicious, but the restaurant could use a scrub down. I visited the restaurant for brunch on a Saturday and we were quickly seated at the bar top. I cleaned off the bar top as I sat down since it had sticky syrup on it and to my dismay the counter was disgusting. Think black residue and grime - I don't think they had cleaned the bar in months. I was pretty disgusted. However, the food was delicious. I ordered the Huevos Racheros and my boyfriend ordered the red beans and toast. Both dishes were great. Now, if only they can scrub their counters because I worry what there kitchen looks like...","Brunch as good as it gets.  A 'thing' for us recently has been to throw our 2 1/2 year old on the bike seat and roll down into Red Hook for breakfast on the weekend.  Ft. Defiance is a bar primarily, and I would venture a guess that if you hit this place later than we do, there are a fair number of liquid breakfasts happening.  But we have a kid, we get up early, and we roll in around 10, 10:30 or so.  We've never had to wait for a table, the service is efficient and pleasant, and the food is excellent.  The french toast is pretty nigh-on perfect, served with bacon the way I want to learn to cook it one day; the huevos rancheros are my wife's go-to.   They're happy to stir up a plate of eggs and toast for our daughter, and we aim to not be a pain the way so many parents can be.  Everyone happy.And the coffee is solid.","Came here for breakfast... WOW.I had their mushroom, cheese and kale omelet. I am not a huge fan of kale but decided to give it a go. I made the right choice because it was fabulous. The hash browns are like nothing I've ever had and I loved that the breakfast came with a spring salad that was refreshing. The service was good and so was the coffee. Overall I would totally return.","My cousins and I ventured here for brunch and got a quick bite. The place is pretty cool with nice artwork and feels cozy. Our waitress was nice and took our order quickly. For my entree, I got the huevos rancheros which was pretty amazing. It tasted great with the runny egg and sour cream combining with the tostada and pork chili to create a flavor explosion in my mouth. Very filling and tasty. However, my cousin ordered the all American without bacon, but it still came with bacon. They went back in the kitchen to make it new and came back in 2 mins, obviously not making it new. My cousin just said whatever and ate it but I didn't like the principle of the matter. He shouldn't have had to eat the food that had the bacon on it. Anyways, I enjoyed my food but just wish they were a little bit more accurate.",Fort Defiance
279,"Looks are deceiving - the pictures from this place got me excited to try out the food, but I was taken aback by how different it was from traditional shawarma flavors.We decided to go with the meat platters ($15.95), which comes with 2 sides of your choosing (I went with tomato bulgur and babaganoush), plus pita, and tahini sauce...while it's a good portion of food, it's also quite pricey.I got the lamb shawarma for myself, which I didn't like very much. In my opinion, it didn't really taste like traditional Mediterranean shawarma - flavor profile was just really off from what I'm used to. The chicken shawarma was better than the lamb, but overall, I wasn't a big fan of it. I also wasn't too fond of the pool of oil it was in within my platter box.Babaganoush was good, and I enjoyed the tomato bulgur. Hummus was meh. And the pita was just a thin piece of roti wrapped in foil - there is a difference between pita and roti, and what we got is not exactly pita...",First of all Ive already done a review to say the food is soooooo delicious and taste FRESH!!! I like my food savory and flavorful and that's exactly what they deliver! Anyway Im writing because I ordered a chicken shawarma platter with rice and lentils and salad. (Wish I took a pic but I was starving ) LISTEN the amount of chicken they gave me I could feed myself and someone else with what's left over. Tomorrow's lunch: chicken shawarma on pita!!! Check out my pics. That's ALL chicken left after I ate half with the rice and lentils! This spot never disappoints!,"I am highly asthmatic and the staff smoke right outside the restaurant and leave the door wide open so customers can enjoy cigarette smoke and get cancer as they dine. I got up once and actually closed the restaurant door and then shortly after, a staff member opened the restaurant door again....after that, I just got up and left. Food lacks flavor and is inconsistent with respect to salt levels.","When you have friends who live close by to Wafa's and they invite you there for a big get together of OG Yelpers you don't even think about saying no!This newer location is more grab and go, but there is a large table for groups in the front along with some smaller tables around. There is more than enough on the menu for meat eaters and those who have more of a non-meat diet. Think hummus, warm pitas, baba ghanoush, shwarma, and baklava! Oh My! Staff has always been warm and welcoming, and even held the large table for us as we told them in advance we were coming. Great service.Also, they have a terrific BYOB policy and didn't mind at all that our group was being pretty loud, drinking heartily, and engorging on their awesome eats. Home cooked delish food made with love by Wafa and the family.You can't go wrong here. Honestly, ignore the two and three star reviews. Their palates are damaged. This is damn good food.","My favorite place to go, it's a family run business where wafa's is the one cooking and doing the magic.Everything taste like home, with so much love.If you never been there, do your self a favor and dine/lunch there!","When our beloved Wafa's left Queens a few years back we were heartbroken. When Wafa's returned to NY (this time in Brooklyn) we were thrilled. This location is definitely more of a grab and go type spot but there are tables to sit and eat at. Since we had a group of 8 joining us we made sure the staff was aware.So yep, we pretty much took over the spot on a relatively busy Saturday night. We started with rounds of appetizers, The crowd favorite was hands down the cauliflower. The Baba Ghanoush and hummus also went well with the warm pita bread. For meals each of us had a different type of sandwich. I had the chicken schwerma which was just as good as it was at the old location. Of course it ended up being a knife and fork job but it was still delicious. We ended the meal with warm baklava that we didn't mind getting all over our hands. Oh and it's BYOB so you best believe we had quite the craft beer selection going.The staff, as always, was great. Wafa herself presented some of the apps to our table and Yousef chatted with us the entire time we were there. They did not mind one bit that we were loud as all hell when we weren't stuffing our faces or when we loudly made inappropriate jokes. It felt like we were sitting at a friend's house eating and chatting and just overall having a good time.Wafa's, never leave us again.",Wafa's
280,"Our waiter appeared to be the manager also. There were no others. We asked how they make a certain dish: Do you use more of this flavor, or that flavor? The answer began: Let me tell you how this dish is prepared.... and a lecture ensued in how to cook a dish that, actually, I learned how to cook from my grandmother. That was not what we asked. So our lunch began with a helping of mansplaining. The cooked food was bland. I kept eating, too much, in what I later realized was a desperate search for flavor. The salad though was crisp and tasty. The service was slow although the restaurant was almost empty. At the end, they hit us up for the restaurant's own raffle. (Is that legal?) Two stars for the salad.",I cannot recommend this place more highly. The food is delicious and the service is out of this world. I order food from Athena about 3 times a week because I crave it that often and it is consistently so high quality.,"First visit to Brooklyn. Had lunch here because of the 4 1/2 stars on Yelp. Offered a limited menu of ""specials"" (read pre-made food). I ordered the pastichio which was over baked yesterday's or maybe two day old pasta, re-nuked. Flavors were ok but texture was terrible. Served with what the menu called Greek Salad. This was a cloudy mess of cucumber and tomato without any pepperoncini, olives, feta, red onion or a proper oily Greek dressing. Instead it was an over dressed and over handled pile of unappetizing gooMy wife ordered the vegetarian pasta. This was also reheated. Not just the sauce but the pasta as well. Same terrible salad. Also, the owner pestered us for a cash payment every time he visited the table. Must not like to report all his sales.   Pay your taxes, pal. God bless the American way. Do the regulars know what Mediterranean food is supposed to look and taste like?","One of the best restaurants I've been to in awhile.Food was fresh and delicious, the owner who was also the server for the night was very friendly and kind. Everything from the appetizers to the main course was delicious.I had the salmon over lentils and spinach and was very satisfied. The calamari was very good and the spreadable appetizers were also amazing! I deffinatly will be back and recommend this restaurant to everyone who loves food and good service!","I've always been a fan of Greek/Mediterranean food. Visited last Sunday  for early dinner  and fell in love with the service, the food, great selection of Greek wines and the ambiance of the place.  I ordered the Oktapodi Scharas-grilled octopus  served with lima beans on a bed of lettuce with an Elliniki Salata-more like their house salad. I also ordered a glass of white Greek wine.  The octopus was grilled to perfection and very tender and my salad was well prepared with an even balance of each ingredient. The food was fresh and nicely presented. Our server was a lovely girls, sorry I am not good for names, but she frequently came over to ask if everything was well. There were other customers dining there and everybody seemed happy with their food. Many from what I could tell were regular customers. We will be one of them!Athena is not the typical restaurant where you only  eat gyros. Their menu seems very well developed and  balanced  with a nice variety of homemade Greek dishes, besides there are also daily specials. This is more like a mom and pop restaurant where you can tell from the first bite, that the food was prepared right after being ordered.  If the wait is too long for you, just ask for a bottle of Greek wine, sip and enjoy while waiting for your food. Their bottles of wine are either half price  on Mondays!We sat inside, I think they can make the outside terrace more appealing to customers, however, it would still be ok with me to sit outside on a cool day. Athena is definitely a place where I will return to enjoy one of my favorite cuisines!",We went on a Monday and were seated right away. The weekday dinner special is a great deal. If you don't do the dinner special there is also a 50% off bottle of wine deal that's so worth it. For vegetarians - they make vegetarian versions of their classic dishes so you won't just be eating sides of vegetables and hummus. Be sure to save room for dessert!,Athena Mediterranean Cuisine
281,"I really wanted to like this place, the decor was beautiful but I am deeply disappointed. I had to wait 15 minutes after being seated, before the waitress came to my table and when she did she was very curt. But I wasn't too bothered, as I was hungry and hoping to eat some good ramen but out comes my ramen delivered by a person who just banged the damn bowl on the table and left, didn't even pause for a bit or look at me. These are small things but if I am paying $14 for a sub-standard dish, at least the service be better? I ordered the spicy miso ramen and it was really average, barely. It had corn in it and just two paper-thin pork belly slices, and the broth was not that great. Great ambience, terrible service, average food - won't return or recommend.","I ordered veggie ramen with rice noodles to take out. Total disappointment, i wish i can take my money back. Big chunk of noodles came with raw shredded carrots and couple of edamame beans. No mushroom, broccoli or any other nutritious veggie just shredded raw carrots and papaya (i believe it was raw papaya) I don't want any hard veggies in my ramen, first of all. Secondly at least add some good veggies if you call it veggie ramen. Waitress was kind but she said it has lot of greens whereas there was none. Even the broth was so less around 8 oz i believe. Very disappointing dish.",miso-pork ramen flavor was good. 4 starsbutit was warm. my needs to be hotbroth too thickand way toooo saltynoodles passable onlyi hate corn in my soupservice and ambient. 4 starsthank u!!!,"Dock Asian Eatery is a beautiful restaurant with 3 chefs that specialize in 3 different categories of food- Thai, Japanese/sushi and ramen.⁣I had the following: ⁣Seafood Ramen⁣Soy sauce flavored chicken stock and fish broth soup topped with snow crab, shrimp, scallop, cherry stone clams, shimeji mushrooms, mitsuba leaf, yuzu and seaweed⁣⁣Green Papaya Salad⁣Shredded green papaya and carrots with peanuts, tomatoes, string beans and garlic in spicy lime dressing⁣⁣Summer Rolls⁣With special hoisin & peanut sauce ⁣⁣Coffee Jelly⁣Topped with vanilla and coffee ice cream, caramel coated walnuts and churros","Ok so the food is...   not great. I'm super surprised. Ordered here twice and both times I wish I didn't. 1. Why did you put egg salad in the pork bun? The meat and bun should speak for themselves, but between the dry and dense bun and unripe tomato plus a ton of onions, I was left underwhelmed. 2. The corn fritters are really dense, and to be honest the corn was really tough, dry and you get stuck with the corn skin in your mouth and in between your teeth. Over all it lacked any flavor and the corn was overwhelming and underwhelming. 3. Shrimp salad, again, underwhelming. It was fine? Again so much corn. Shrimp had zero flavor so I fed it to my car. But it was lacking something special, and I don't know what.","My lovely beautiful friend found this place on social media and I was so impressed there are so many fantastic places in this area nowadays. The restaurant looks very artistic. I love everything, painting, interior, food, seats, service, light etc. We sat outside, enjoyed nice breeze and delicious food. They have so many kind of Asian food: Thai, Japanese, Vietnamese, Chinese. Next time we have to sit inside, I have feeling that it will be fun.",Dock Asian Eatery
282,"The positive aspects of the restaurant was that the food was edible and the service was great. However, the food they served wasn't authentic korean food. I would definitely recommend this place to my Caucasian friends unironically and perhaps to my open-minded Asian friends to see their reaction to the ""korean"" food. In all honesty, the food was just-decent and doesn't warrant for a one star, but advertising themselves as a ""korean restaurant"" and selling horribly inauthentic korean food left a bad taste.","This Korean place is a good example of 'good try' or a really bad modern version of Korean food Tonight we had the kimchi fries, soy ginger wings, spicy pork bulgogi, and the eel dolsolt Let me get started with the good things. The kimchi fries? Bomb. It was the best thing we had there. And the service was impeccable. Let me start off with how dry and over cooked the wings were. Happy hour or not. That's just not acceptable. And the soy ginger sauce, not a good combination. The eel dolsolt bowl was the worst one. Dolsolt is known for the crispy bottom of the rice. And yet my dolsolt was drowned in this sour soup kind of thing. I was soul upset when they brought it out. The eel ontop was cold and the rice was mushy and not at all what I expected. The spicy pork was okayish. Not really authentic with the taste but it was editable","The kimchi fries with ketchup GREAT. With the honey ginger mayo? Sad! I struggled through half of my fries with it. It sounds appealing, but in reality is weird in texture and the chunks of candied ginger strewn in between just don't pair well. When the waitress eventually returned, I asked for some ketchup which I guess is the American thing to do, but it really made the flavour pop. I could taste the heat in the fries and the coarse salt wasn't so overwhelming. I peeped a few vegetarian dishes, so I'll have to return to give those a try. And who can beat $3 pilsners. Yum","So glad White Tiger is back in full swing!  We missed all the delicious dishes and creative cocktails.  Even though there were pockets of wait for tables, you can hang out at the bar with a drink or two. The vibe inside is lively and the entire staff is very cheerful and accommodating. We will definitely return on a regular basis. I wish I took some photos of the dishes but I was too eager to eat it. Until next time...",The food was just ok. It wasn't real Korean food. I didn't see much Korean people in there. I had the Korean fried chicken which was more bread than chicken.

283,"Kitchens can have bad days. People can have bad days. But when you do food poorly AND back it up with smug service...you've got a very real problem. We arrived at opening time on a Sunday (no customers there) and sat outside, as we had our dog with us. The whole ordeal took almost 2 hours--an obnoxiously long time considering we had 1 drink round, 1 app, 2 ""salads"", a kids meal and sliders. We'd be thrilled to wait for good food, but this food was uniquely bad at every turn. When our waiter finally came back around at the end of our meal and saw little had been consumed of one diner's spinach salad, he made a quip about the diner not liking spinach--to which our friend offered up the real reason: the dressing wasn't good. Instead of any kind of apology or further discussion, the guy laughed an ""ok"" and walked off with the plate. He did come back around and remove the salad from the bill--but this time I asked about the dessert my daughter was supposed to receive from the kids meal. Instead of apologizing for yet another lapse in service, he had the gall to blame her appearance, claiming he thought she looked much older than 12. By this point we were all a little incredulous. Everything we ordered that wasn't drinks or my kid's mozz sticks & soup cup was bad: black bean slider was water-flavored mush, pork belly slider had gobs of untrimmed fat hanging off of it, and my husband's ""bacon salad"" had 2 dry, over cooked half pieces of bacon on it and was absolutely drenched in dressing (see pic). Unless you just really need an excuse to sit & have a drink outside with your dog on 5th, I'd stay far away from this place.","This is too late and I'm sorry. But I never saw this message I received from the owner. I am appalled. I am appalled at the fact he felt every other review was worth publicly replying to but for me he needed to reply privately. His response to me was a BLATANT lie. To tell me that the Mac and cheese balls are ""never frozen"" when we received them completely frozen to the middle with the servers there to witness, is unacceptable. Why would you reply to every other review publicly except for mine? Was it to hide your blatant lie? I would have accepted just being told it was a mistake. Hell if I was told the truth, and a sincere apology, I would have raised the rating! Unacceptable",Previously:Horrendously slow service.

Embarrassing.Update pending of my review.,"We went on a Thursday around 6pm and were seated quickly. Nice selection of beers. We had a mix of burgers made custom and some straight from the menu. The toppings and bun were delicious and the various meats were cooked to order. The branded bun was a fun touch. Two of us had the loaded fries. They were tasty, but sadly the toppings made them soggy before we could eat very many. The tater tots were crispy and delicious. Overall, we had plenty for the table as the fries/tots came with each burger.","Randomly stumbled in, sat at the bar and was not disappointed! Had a lamb burger and Mac and cheese bites. Delicious! Also, for an app we had the cheese fries which were amazing! Great ambiance, easy to get in and have a table. Would come back.","My friend suggested this place and we decided to come for our monthly outing event. I was glad that they have a full vegan menu, that includes multiples kind of vegan cheese, since two of my friends are vegans. Ambience and decorI love the high tables although the tiny stools are not very comfortable. There is also seating outside and a long bar. Overall the place is pretty cool. DrinksI had the sangria and it was very tasty more on the sweet side with fresh cut green apples and grapes and a slice of orange. The drink was sparkling and light. I didn't taste much alcohol, which was fine with me. FoodWe ordered some tater tots and they were really good, crispy and not too greasy. I ordered the B&B burger in a pretzel bun. The meat was good but the bun was dried and it wasn't even toasted. The bacon was horrible. I don't ever think I've ever had bad bacon or if that was even possible for bacon to be bad, but this one look like it was still frozen or look like fake bacon... anyway, bacon was sad. The aoli was only on one side bun. Oh that bun... please toast the bun!I'm giving it a 4 stars because of the side dish. I got the cole slaw. I can honesty say: Best Cole Slaw Eva!!!! Dried, not saggy, slightly coated with mayo but not bathed in it. It was just perfect. I could eat that cole slaw as my main dish. Service was good and our waiter was friendly. I like that they brought us separate bills so we didn't have to split. I'll come back just for the cole slaw!",Brooklyn Burgers & Beer

This business is affordable, fast, and delicious. The people who work there are cool. Eat their food and pay with the meager amount of USD you have left after paying rent and these outrageous broker fees.","I love Banh Mi Place! I come here all the time. The service is consistently quick and gets you in and out. It's a small place mostly for takeout with three tables for dine in. The Banh Mi is great, the bread is a great crunchy consistently with good flavor. The Pho is also well flavored and a good portion. I get bubble teas a lot too and I like that they offer decaf ones because I have trouble sleeping if I have caffeine past like 2pm. Love the kiwi flavor.","I come here for a quick lunch every so often and get the same thing every time: spicy grilled pork bahn mi. It's simple and has everything you're looking for -well toasted baguette with mayo spread, grilled pork that's reminiscent of char siu (delicious!), pickled carrot and cucumber, cilantros, and if you like them spicy like I do- jalapeños. That's just my opinion though. Order one and see if you agree.","PURCHASED: Banh Mi ($6.75, see photo) + Beef Pho ($9.75, see photo) TOTAL: less than $15PROS:+ Pho: It was okay. THe price is ridiculous. Go to Houston, Texas or Los, Angeles for your pho. You'll be blown away by the size of the bowl, which is at least 2 times larger at a price that is wayyyyy less -- Lived in Houston AND Los Angeles... I might know what I am talking about.+ Banh Mi: same thing as above. You can get each 'wich for like... $2/$3 ... go to Lee Sandwiches if you're ever in Houston or along the west coast in California CONS:- owned by Chinese: Surprisingly the food was good. When I did the ultimate assessment to test whether the food was good by ordering in Vietnamese, I was told by some asians that they didn't speak it. I know one shouldn't judge a spot, but that's like going to a sushi restaurant served by chinese. IMPRESSION:too expensive, it satisfied my crave for Vietnamese food. It is not saying a lot. There is just a disparity for good food at affordable prices.",Banh Mi Place
285,The restaurant is very neat and clean. Bar area is the main attraction as you come in - seems to be like a good weekend hangout. Appetizers were good - easy choice of hummus and pita - though the pita bread was a bit hard the first round - second round was better. I was craving lamb - I ordered the lamb chops which were disappointing- lots of fatty parts. My gf's salad was decent. - Service was attentive but a bit of a barrier language - to be fair I think the waitress was new (she was a bit lost with orders and questions we had). Overall a decent spot but not the best.,"So one of the owners reached out to me and offered to re-send out our previous order. The first time we had this place it wasn't the best. But the second time... pretty darn good, actually.We'll chalk the first less-than-great experience up to bad delivery. Hey it happens... mea culpa.","Another neighborhood disappointment I'll be brief - the food was not fresh and service was severely lacking. I wanted to like the place and wanted to come back. Oh well... let's see how long it will last in Park  Slope.  It wasn't all that bad. Good amount of food was served, the place is cosy, clean and neat, nice tableware, loved their plates.Good baklava and spinach pide. Hence 2 stars. But this is where it ends. Food looked a lot better than it tasted. I had a seabass which was far from fresh catch. It was salty and drowning in spices. But that didn't help its semi-rotting aroma. I stopped eating after second bite as I was afraid of getting sick. Lamb sautée was very bland and same - not fresh. I didn't think I'd ever have to point that out at this time and age.Interestingly enough, none of the wait staff inquired how our food was, seeing the entire fish sitting untouched. We were also never served bread, whilst all other tables were. Not sure why. Never even offered it. Waiters were just running back and forth, back and forth. Nobody offered to pack our food either. Not that I'd have taken it home.Ordered dessert since dinner was a failure - waited half an hour for baklava which was already pre-made. Asked for a Turkish tea - and got a tea bag next to a glass cup with a lukewarm water. At that point we were so very ready to leave.Not coming back.","This is our favorite Turkish restaurant and we always have a wonderful dining experience here.

286,"I got a strawberry topped cheesecake to go. I'm not sure if it was because I got it to-go or what, but the cheesecake just didn't  taste good as everyone says it does. I thought the cheesecake portion was very very very dense. One bite of the cheesecake was good enough for me.I would come back to try other cheesecakes, but that was my experience with Junior's thus far.","Such a disappointment.....I've heard nothing but amazing things about the legendary cheesecake and was very happy to have my hotel right door. The first day I arrived in Brooklyn I stopped in for lunch and thoroughly disappointed. I ordered wings, fries and catfish. The catfish was good but the fries were boring and bland and the wings were terrible. I thought maybe it was just a bad dish so I came back and ordered the breakfast of scrambled eggs and two pieces of turkey bacon. For a $17 I got a huge order of bland eggs and turkey bacon. Overpriced doesn't even begin to describe the experience. After all that figured I should stick what they're known for and order cheesecake. I ordered a slice of strawberry cheesecake to go and was again disappointed. The cheesecake tasted dry due to the fact that it was sitting in the cooler for sometime. The strawberries were even hard.On top of that the people I encounter except for one guy are very ""who cares"" about customer service. Not worth it...","we came only to try that famous strawberry cheesecake milkshake they have. overpriced for what it is. there was nothing special about the cheesecake, milkshake, or the strawberry. it was just good for pictures. the milkshake is definitely not as sweet as it looks, so that's a good thing! but it's more of a try once type of thing. since i only tried the milkshake, i can only rate for that.","Cheese cake is delicious. It's creamy, sweet and crunchy all at the same time. It's unusually tall for a cheese cake but it has a good topping to cake ratio. Also they sell it in different sizes and well as single slices . Would've been 5 stars if the price wasn't so dam high. New York","The grits are okay. Pancakes are good but a little dry, the eggs are okay. The orange juice is good, the coffee is okay; not that hot.The service is horrible. I've never had a friendly waiter here at all, and I've come during slow times and busy hours. Slow moving waiters who don't care about your experience. Pretty amazing.Also, they sat me in a corner booth today that smelled like musty omonia. Probably because the area they wash dishes in was literally next to me. Don't get how they sit people there. Not right.","Juniors restaurant is the heart of downtown Brooklyn on Flatbush Avenue , it's been in downtown Brooklyn for ages or decades ( probably a landmark) it compares to ""Cheesecake Factory ""but better, since I'm a Brooklynite I prefer juniors. the cool thing about juniors there deliver all over . so if I wanted to move out of New York there can deliver to me the store is located in DeKalb avenue and Flatbush avenue, right near the City point building (where there have century 21 department store, Trades joe supermarket, Target stores, Flying tiger store, etc stores ) and right across the street from the Long island university-Brooklyn campus.

287,"This place had promise last time I went out with a friend but upon returning last night I can certify that I will never forget this experience...and not in the best way. Besides the drinks being poorly constructed (unmixed, syrup sitting at the bottom), I had a full can of BEER hit me in the back of my head by the bartender...apparently he was trying to throw it to a customer. What possibly could have compelled a fully grown man to toss beer in the midst of a crowded bar I will never know. He apologized, asked if I was okay, as did the guy who was supposed to be catching it. I didn't get drinks comp'd and looking back I probably should have but I was in a fair bit of shock and confusion. This was a nice divey little place for casual dancing at one point but the disregard and carelessness is not worth tolerating. Get your act together Commodore.","Yikes.... this place has gone down hill. I normally wouldn't bother to write a review for a bad meal, but my gfs and I had terrible food poisoning after eating there on Sunday. As usual, the bartenders were rude. This is normally ok because the food is good, but if you are going to be rude and give us food poisoning, you can step down.Tables sat dirty for 15+ minutes. Waitresses walked by and cared not at all. We bussed our own table. They claimed the pina coladas had four shots of alcohol in them and there is simply no way. We would have blacked out. They were weak as hell with barely any booze in them!Fried chicken was all breading and little chicken. The nachos I've been ordering for years were half their former size. I'm almost glad the portions were minuscule, as our food poisoning has been awful. GOODBYE commodore, your ship has sailed.","Chicken sandwich delicious! Drinks OKAY. Service HORRIBLE. Went with my sister and our husbands on Saturday night and our bill was overcharged(bartender working that night should be fired for how disgusting he speaks to female customers). When we went to tell the bartender, he gave us such a hard time and he was very defensive. I told him to please check the receipt and his response was ""well I don't have it in front of me"". Instead of listening to the customer and trying to find a solution he decided to argue with us. Not professional at all! Turns out that he charged us for an extra drink plus some. When we told him he never gave us the drink he yelled at us and said ""yes I did, I handed it over to you!"" Unfortunately, he really didn't, but he kept arguing with us so we left it alone (I really wanted to tell him to check the cameras to prove him wrong) it ended with ""I don't have time for this"". Not only was he rude but a very big liar. I can't believe that an establishment can just steal customers money like this. I will definitely file a complaint with the BBB. Point is, MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR BILL. Do not leave your tab open. Unfortunately, you must order food at the bar which gets super crowded and leaves a lot of room for error.We left commodore with an overcharged bill. As delicious as the chicken sandwiches were the horrible service and rude bartender ruined the whole experience.","Probably my favorite bar in all of Brooklyn, if not New York.Free pinball and that super sprint alone make it 5 stars. Add to that a great cocktail menu, fun vibe and the best bar food in NYC? Yeah, go here.Get the fried chicken or burger.","""I need to find the best chicken sandwich in the city,"" my cousin declared out of nowhere as we were shopping in SoHo this past weekend. Happy to oblige, I quickly pulled up Yelp and did some research and The Commodore came up. So, we ambitiously walked from SoHo across the Williamsburg Bridge and into an unmarked dive bar that we correctly guessed was the right place with the help of a dusty neon sign advertising ""breasts"" out front. What have we gotten ourselves into? That was the first thought that went through my mind. This certainly didn't look like a place where, an hour and a half later, I'd be sitting in sheer bliss thinking ""this was the best meal I've ever had in my life."" And yet...We placed our orders at the bar: she had the chicken sandwich ($13) and I had the chicken platter ($14). Along with the food, she had a frozen mojito and I a frozen piña colada (both $12 I believe) after admiring the ones our neighbors were drinking. We headed out to the back porch, and after admittedly a little bit too long waiting (we think they forgot our orders initially) our food arrived.BEST. CHICKEN. EVER. Perfectly fried, crispy but not too greasy, the perfect layer of breading, tender and juicy and cooked throughout. 3 large pieces with practically no bone and no grizzle. Served with two hot sauces (both delicious) and a honey butter that was to-die-for atop the three phenomenal mini biscuits. And for only $14? Absolutely unheard of. Already planning my trip back. This place changed my life.",A hidden gem in Williamsburg. The outside of this spot make you not want to go inside. But once you have a drink and order the fresh fried chicken or the chicken Sandwich you going feel like you went to heaven and came back down. The chicken is fresh and crispy. I really enjoyed my meal and drink with my family at this hidden gem,The Commodore
288,"The restaurant pretty much captures cuisine scene and vibe of Russia circa 2000.Hearty, nostalgic and tasty.","Decent place with good food. Of course you get the full Russian experience, so don't expect smiles and white glove service.","On our last day in New York we decided to go to Coney Island. I knew there was a large Russian Jew population here and really wanted find something authentic. That's how I found Skovorodka. This place was incredible. Their extensive menu listed all kinds of authentic Russian dishes that I had never even heard of before! We ended up with traditional Russian dumplings and salmon tartare. Both were amazing. Their beer list was a bit disappointing as they only had a few light beers. However, their vodka selection was not lacking at all. I had half a mind to sit in there after our meal and get drunk off Russian vodka.","great food. If want to experience Russian food definitely recommend this place. Is not that expensive, competitive to other places. It's kind of lightly air-conditioned considering temperature outside close to 100 degrees. Inside no that big but nicely setup with wooden chairs and lots of Russian stuff on shelves; samovars, nesting fools...etc.food served with basket of bread, bread is homemade style and tastes really good and butter that comes with bread is actually soft and you able to slice a thin layer onto bread, unlike most of restaurants including fancy once where butter hard as a brick.....    I ordered Ukrainian style borscht that is made in chicken base; there were only few small pieces of chicken but that's how it should be I think, chicken suppose to add only taste, well it tasted really good, and amount is great, not too big not too small, definitely for one person only, it costs $6. Then I had a plate of fish with mashed potatoes...; fish was flounder, full size fish with tail and head and bones..., actually real fish for once!!!   Fish was wonderful, skin came off easily and bones didn't stick almost didn't realize there were any bones. Mashed potatoes were great also, felt like homemade!!!! Price for fish plate was $18.for whole meal and visit it was $34",EVERY ITEM WAS BETTER THAN PERFECT. Best restaurant in the world for their dishes. Hats off to the chef whom I believe is a magical wizard.Yelp requires me to write more so: compote was very flavorful and not diluted.,"Skovorodka is a Brighton Beach classic. I'm pretty sure I've come here for every single one of my grandpa's birthdays in the past 15 years. While I was not very excited to go here again, I must say I was pretty impressed with the food. It is pricey (I'm not sure how much, we had a banquet style meal) but there were many options, big portions and actually mostly delicious food! Some of the most memorable aspects of the meal included pickled tomatoes, duck salad, the pasta with fish (so. good.), and of course their potatoes with onions and mushrooms. This place is not a bad spot if you are craving home-style Russian food and want to be super full and satisfied for a long time",Skovorodka
289,"Modest sized restaurant with seating around the bar and a humble outdoor patio.  Easy finding street parking around dinner time during the week.  Was surprised to have difficulty making a reservation on a Thursday - so book ahead - they fill up fast.  Our waiter Daniel (I told you I was going to yelp about you!) was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu.  Like - could tell you the history of ingredients ""knowledgeable.""They'll recommend 4-6 plates to share, but really you should order more.  Not to satisfy your hunger, but to satisfy your curiosity.  You can pretend you're a pro and plan out your meal ahead of time, but you'll just be left bewildered when the waiter begins to list off the many delicious daily specials.  Even though the sardines were disappointing, the spreadable sausage, croquets, and fried artichokes made up for it.  I hate to comment on specials because it'll just break your heart when you go and it's not available, but the foie gras and the scallop special were quite memorable.",Was hoping for so much more. Highly disappointing. Flavors wereBland and prices were high for what you get. First and last for us. F us one timeAnd that's enough. Service and atmosphere is nice enough.,"I'm sad to give this place a 2 because we had high expectations going in for our reservation. We were a reservation of five people at 8:15. Our experience went from good to pretty bad by the end of the night.Our first waitress was really good and was knowledgeable about the menu and experience. But we definitely over ordered even though it's tapas style dining. Dishes like the artichoke (alcachofas) and garbanzo fritos can definitely be shared by 5 people. We got two of each and it was too much.Here were the highlights:Garbanzo Fritos (one is enough though)Migas Aragonesas (this was delicious)Fideua (noodle paella - also delicious)Escalivada (market vegetables - probably the best) Berenjena con meil (eggplant - very good)Foie gras (special on the menu)Good wine list and sangria was good.Here were the average:Stewed beef in stuffed peppers was ok Octopus with mushrooms was ok Here were the terrible:Pollo Asada (super dry and tasted of raw spices) Artichokes (really bland)Gurullos (this had to be the worst, it was sooooo flavorless and had all the wrong textures but it was highly recommended by our waitress and so we got two)Bread pudding (it was just terrible I can't even begin to describe it) We told our second waitress that the Gurullos (homemade pasta) was bland and really not good. She didn't comp it for us.The bread pudding was so bad that we didn't even get through half of it. 5 people taking one bite of a small dessert. We noticed a cockroach crawling right behind us on the wall. Other customers noticed it too. The waitress tired to pass it off as a ""New York thing"" which was very inappropriate. In all our years of living here and paying 70+ dollars per person for a meal, we've never been joined by cockroaches. It was not pleasant or reassuring.We reluctantly paid our bill and left so we didn't have to be there anymore. You can't see the roach clearly but it's there.","Wow. Just wow. I think this is the best tapas restaurant I've ever been. Everything was just so authentic, fresh, yet creative. If I had to, my only gripe would be the ambiance. A bit bland, but that's super petty. This is the best meal I've had in a while.Berenjena con Miel: Weakest meal for sure. I could hardly tell they were eggplant. And I know it's eggplant, but it just felt so soft. Didn't get much of the seed really, either.Alcachofas: Delicious, salty aioli. And the anchovies were cooked super well, very crispy.Salmorejo: I had no idea what to expect, and loved this. Plenty of fish, one of the larger dishes. All the ingredients came together so well and just made sense somehow. Loved the egg.Migas Aragonesas: The chorizo was cooked so well - tiny, little crisby bits. Delicious.Albondigas: Pretty standard, but you can tell the meat was such high quality. And cooked so well. And loved the mint yogurt.","I went to La Vara because of all the good reviews and was sorely disappointed, so I thought I'd leave one for those with high standards out there. On the surface, La Vara looks cute. Waiters seem nice. The menu doesn't look half bad. But then, you discover that it's far from an authentic Spanish restaurant-- the wines they offer are reallyyy sub-par for what they charge, and the waitresses don't know much about them at all. The food is not good (I had the octopus, which was chewy, the lobster risotto, which I swear was microwaved before we received it, and the duck which was flavored well but entirely too fatty). While we were in the middle of eating (!), the waitress began pushing us to order more food. Maybe we Americans are desensitized to this, but I still think that's tacky. Waiters are not meant to be salesmen who intrude upon your dinner. I gave it two stars for the cute patio but will not go there again. Too many good restaurants in New York.","Great seafood options -- paella was decadent.Torn bread stuff was a little salty. They tried to balance it with grapes but the ratio was still off.We went on a rainy Sunday night and there was not need for a reservation, exec though we had one. Reservations available via Open Table but you probably need to reserve a couple days in advance (unless it is rainy like previously mentioned). It has easy subway access via the Bergen St station and the G or F. Very quiet neighborhood and there's a park across the street where you can wait if there's a line.Olive oil ice cream is the best. Don't knock it until you try it!",La Vara
290,"We came here with a reservation, as a party of three around peak brunch time during the summer. Service was prompt and efficient, and the food was excellent. Prices were about the same as other brunch places in NYC. I would recommend this place, but it wasn't so amazing that I am running back the first chance I get.",Iced matcha which is $6 had clumps of powder in every sip I took. My avocado toast was barely even toasted. What kind of toast is not toasted???,"The waitstaff are really friendly during Saturday brunch. Portions tend to run small. Presentation is good. Service is leisurely, sometimes crawling along. I ordered the shakshooka, left (less) hungry but not too interesting when compared to the dozens of other brunch spots, cafes in the area.","Great spot for a weekend brunch!Came here on a really hot day and it was pretty busy inside, so we were going back and forth on either waiting for a seat indoors or just take the heat outside. BUT the staff here were so nice they informed us that if we sat outside (there were umbrellas for shade) they'd be more than happy to throw in some free Frose! Couldn't turn that down so we went with outdoor seating. Once seated our server was the just awesome. She constantly checked on us to make sure we were okay in the heat and even got us extra ice for our waters. The owner/manager of Reunion was great as well. He would come out to constantly check on us and asking if were were doing well out side in the heat, he even brought us lemonade! I gotta say, service and staff here really made this a great great great experience and we haven't even started on the food yet!For our brunch my SO and I got the classic hummus: very smooth, clean/fresh taste, well seasoned and the pita that came with it was perfect. We also got the Lah'maajun: I really enjoy the lamb, very slight gamey taste, crumbled salty feta, a nice runny egg sitting on top laffa which was this really nice yeasty, chewy flat bread. So good! We got the Shakshooka as well, clean tart tomato taste mixed with a runny egg, and we opted the challah bread for pita, this dish was my favorite. And if that wasn't enough, we then wanted something sweet so we got the pancakes: light fluffy with fresh bananas and strawberry, topped withe syrup. Great finisher.Overall, amazing service, staff, and really delicious food. This is one of my favorite brunch spots!","Good vibes, live music, friendly service, and very tasty food. The presentation was great and the vegetarian options were able to be made vegan (all the ""in betweens"" and one entree). The portions were somewhat small, but that's what you pay for in New York. The live music was a little too loud for a small space, but otherwise it was great. Pictured below is the Egg-Plant, made vegan, which was excellent. After the food arrived, the server asked if we'd like pita or anything for two of the dishes, so we said yes. When we got the bill, they had charged us for it. While it was only $2, we didn't expect to be charged based on the way and timing she asked us. It should've been clearer that it cost extra, so more communication on that would be helpful in the future.","I came here somewhat randomly with a girlfriend after a different restaurant refused to honour our reservation. The staff was very attentive and we got seated without an issue. Overall the food was decent. It's definitely not worth venturing to for its own sake, but if you are in the area and having an issue finding a table somewhere (as you can in that area) then it is definitely a good option!Also, as an FYI I don't think they have a full liquor license.",Reunion
291,"Cecconis used to be my favorite restaurant. The food is to die for but the customer service I experienced was HORRIBLE & quite frankly rude. You can also expect to be in here for 3+ hours because the servers just don't come up to your table. I've talked about this with other customers & they say the same. I called to change a reservation & was hung up on, then when I came in and had to wait 45 mins even though I had a reservation & the hostess was rude about it. We finally sat down and we waited 35 minutes for someone to approach the table. After got our food it was like the waiter became a ghost again. Expect to be in this place for 3+ hours. Make sure you say everything you need bc you will not see your server again until the check. Although we hardly saw our server he was very hasty when trying to receive our cards for payment? Confusing. I would recommend going to sugarcane next door for a better dining experience in beautiful dumbo.","Outdoor seating and the views are a plus.Some dishes are well prepared.So that sones up the good.As for the bad, Cecconi""s will try repeatedly to suck the life out of you.  To begin, you should not expect to be welcomed with anything more than subtle contempt.  Are you the first of a party of two looking to sit at your table?  It does not matter that there are over 50 tables empty and nowhere near enough reservations to fill them.  You will be dressed down and told to sit in the waiting area until everyone in your party is present and accounted for.This place is the epitome of the opposite of everything that DUMBO once was.  It survives off of the vestige of a long lost memory and it crushes and belittles that memory in the process.Despite that suffocating culture you may find yourself surrounded by posers and pretentious wannabes.  It is a mockery of a sham.  A travesty.Enjoy!",Second visit was mehHost was not friendly to everyone lining up to ask for a seat. If you don't like your job just don't do it.Be aware the happy hour was from 3-6 not 4-7 (on their website) bartender was fine at the beginning and later turned unfriendly when we continue ordered the same HH drink and didn't know it's no longer HH.Then we moved to the patio to have dinner.Steak Tartar was okay.Branzino was not as amazing as I remembered when I came the first time.Tiramisu was good.I didn't feel like the service was snobby the first time but second time totally felt it.,"My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary last night and had a wonderful time. I called to make a reservation a few days before (open table said no availability but...) and settled on a 9:30pm seating.We arrived at 8:30 to get a few cocktails and take in the view and hang out. The decor is similar to the West Hollywood location but larger and more tunes to Dumbo in terms of lighting and mood.After about 45 minutes we were taken to our table but after noticing how close we were to other patrons promptly returned back to our seats at the bar. It was just more intimate and more space to breath and talk. Our bartender was great , attentive and even put our desert on the house!  We will surely return and can't recommend the place enough for special occasions and date nights.","I've eaten at Cecconi's several times over the last couple of years. I've sat at the bar, indoor tables and patio seating. We've made reservations ahead of time and just walked in and were seated fairly quickly.The decor is rich and spacious with white marble bar tops, dark wood, velvet chairs and brass accents with many different styles of art hung on the walls. The kitchen is always very kind to accommodate my food allergies and make me a special mashed potatoes side dish without the garlic they usually add. The salmon with steamed spinach is very good. Their bread basket is good too.  The people I've dined with always like their meals.The table servers attitudes are hit and miss, sometimes very nice, sometimes very curt and rushed. The patio servers seem especially curt.  Eating at the bar, the bartenders are always fantastic servers with great attitudes. The view from the patio is beautiful. You can see the Manhattan bridge, Brooklyn bridge Park coastline, Janes carousel, the east Manhattan skyline and the Brooklyn bridge. The sunsets are really nice and its great people watching. Go check it out!And leave a huge tip. ;)","I had a perfect experience at Cecconi's. Myself and 2 friends slipped in around 6:30pm and we were able to snag a table on the patio outside. I have to start by staying that Cecconi's has possibly the best view of any restaurant in NYC. You are 50 feet from the water and have sprawling views of Manhattan and the Manhattan bridge. If you sit at 7, it's the perfect timing to catch the sunset around 8:15. It was stunning. Cecconi's interior is also beautiful, and they did an amazing job with the layout and taking advantage of the space. The service was wonderful. The host was helpful and was able to accommodate our request to be outside. Our server, Adriael, was a total doll and did a great job getting us excited about the menu. He offered much appreciated suggestions and was super engaging. The timing of the food was perfect. They must really have their processes down because it's an enormous restaurant with a full house and no one missed a beat. Everything we ordered was delicious, but my favorites were the honey ricotta and bresaola and burrata pizza. The pizza was perfect, and possibly one of the best Neapolitan pizzas I've ever had. The texture of the dough was super delicious, and I loved the flavors and toppings. The hamachi crudo was great and we enjoyed the summer chop salad.Definitely put Cecconi's on your NYC restaurant hit list!",Cecconi's Dumbo
292,"The service here was terrible!!!! When my friend and I arrived we opted to sit outside because the wait for inside seating was too long. We were the first table to sit outside. Shortly after there were about four to five tables seated. We ordered before everyone but noticed that the other tables were getting their dishes before us. We signaled for the server and she did little to rectify the situation. We had to get someone else's attention... was told that the kitchen didn't have our order.  It took nearly two hours for us to receive our order, while others who came after us were nearly done eating. Long story short.... It was a terrible experience!!!","TAJE THE BAR MANAGER DOES NOT MAKE DRINKS , EVEN IF U BEEN WAITING 15 MINS . And ever since Dread left I'm not gonna lie the pasta has fell off terribly. I haven't given up on it tho . There's one lady who works here as a waitress whose so FKN RUDE it's crazy . She'll mess your order up and then suck her teeth when u ask her to fix it . Her name starts with an S . Tho i can't remember it in full . Drinks still strong AF tho .",Parking is terrible. The wait for a table is terrible. And the menu is overpriced. But the drinks are well worth the money. I had jerk wings and they were over cooked and fell apart after one bite. It had more heat than flavor. I had a Brooklyn Iced Tea and it was worth every penny. The flavor and alcohol content was well balanced and one is all you will need.,"I really enjoyed this restaurant. I've heard a lot of good things and I finally decided to take the trip to Brooklyn for it. I had the bbq salmon, Mac an cheese and cabbage and it was great. I was indecisive between that and the seafood roti but I definitely think I made the right decision. Also, the portions are really big. My boyfriend and I both needed to go boxes for our meals. Besides the food, I love the vibe of it. Jamaican music playing, everyone talking and enjoying themselves. Definitely, a nice place to go to with a partner, friends and even family. The drinks were kind of pricey but very strong. I ordered a Jameson with coke and I barely could finish it. My boyfriend had to drink some for me. Overall, I will definitely be back before the end of the summer. Also the seats outside are nice if you decide to go at night.","One of my favorite place to get rasta pasta...they have a nice happy hour menu for drinks and appetizers. Drinks are ok not too strong but gets the job done. This place is busy so food took a while but it was worth the wait, its definitely small and can gets packed fast, the music is a mix of reggae, soca and afrobeat, noise level can be average to loud depends, there's outside seating, there's tv if need to watch sports, the atmosphere is very live. Overall my experience was pleasant and I enjoyed my rasta pasta.",Went to footprints for a drink on a summer afternoon. The staff was friendly and very interactive as we sat at the bar and the drink was amazing. I had a sex on the beach which was delicious made more than enough alcohol and was super refreshing.,Footprints Cafe
293,"We were staying at the hotel and try to come for Breakfast and Dinner. Both times, the restaurant was 1/4 full and we were told there was a wait but Opentable had slots available on their site.On the second day, we decided to eat breakfast. I ordered the avocado toast and country breakfast. The food was good but over priced (it's inside the hotel) and the service was very slow. It took 30mn to get our food. They forgot one of our drink orders and brought out the wrong food.Osprey is good if you're staying in the hotel and don't want to venture outside and if you're not in a rush.","This place is all about location, which is truly worth coming to. Brooklyn bridge area is beautiful. Restaurant itself is overrated and simply not good. Service deserves -2 stars worst service ever. My recommendations is... get coffee next door don't waist $ here",The atmosphere is great and I love the location.Cauliflower dish and beets salad were delicious.But do not order steak. It was too hard and not edible. Chicken was ok but nothing special. Desserts were fantastic.I will come here for drinks and desserts not for the main courses.,"The Osprey and Harriet's Rooftop & Lounge at 1 Hotel hosted a Yelp Elite Event here. Had such an A-mazing night!First got to experience the beautiful city views at Harriet's Rooftop! Sat at a cozy reserved area near the pool. Cool attentive staff who greeted us and frequently checked to see if any of us needed another round of drinks.  My pick for cocktail of the event was Noon Glow! The magenta passionfruit color cocktail was a  perfect pick-me-up for the event. Led to Osprey for dinner. But before that we got a little intro to the Osprey outdoor seating area where we had some white wine and finger foods. The outdoor area was nicely lit and the Osprey Chef Denevin came out to show his excitement in hosting the Yelp Elite event. Mingling was especially fun with some fresh tuna tartar on chips and bbq buns. Loved the carrots on the bbq buns that made eat each bite crunchy and summery.Dinner seating decor were perfect with specially printed Yelp Elite event course menu presentably set on the plates. The Osprey general manager Sterling came over to each of us to give selections of the wine for the night which I thought was a special touch of hospitality. Not to mention the dinner course was all soo good! Perfectly cooked scallops with chorizo. I thought the the squid ink tuile was a great aesthetic touch to the dish. The slight bitterness of the tuile complemented the mouth filling scallops. Fossil Farm NY strip was cooked perfect medium rare on a bed of wasabi spinach. Amazing tangy and smoky dish.  Cavatelli was also so flavorful it could have been its own main entree. It was a good mix of flavors that worked so well together and together with the scallops and NY strip. Im so glad they brought these dishes out all at once! Dessert came in a cute oval cup - the spoon that came with it surprizingly scooped an even amount of the parfait like stacked mousse dessert. Not overpowering sugar load but just the right amount of sweetness to end the course. The Coconut Passionfruit was a my pick for the night with slight crunch from first layer of breading to the zesty coconut lemon mousse topped with mango sorbet and passionfruit.Such a memoriable night at Harriet's and Osprey with great group of Yelpers. And ofcourse two thumbs up to the Harriet's and Osprey team!***Came to Osprey another occasion for lunch with co-workers. Awesome large portions! My favorite was the brussel sprouts cooked perfectly. Hen of woods again did not disappoint! Had the Seafood Cobb as entree and added a side of french fries. Portion on the picture is half - I shared the plate with a co-worker due to size. Super colorful dish with fresh seafood assortment next to avocado, crispy bacon pieces, etc. The mix of flavors were great especially with the fries. Planning to be back for another dinner!","Have been to 1 Hotel for their roof top bar several times since they opened and the service is excellent. It's cozy and of course, the view is spectacular. Cocktails are really delicious too. The manager up there and his staff give such amazing service.Also went to The Osprey for lunch today for the first time with my family.  The menu is so so much better now that Denevin Miranda is Head Chef there.  Thank you Elvis Escobar - you and your staff treated us so well. We will be back with more friends and family for sure!  Cannot wait to go for dinner next time! Excited to see what delicious food will be on menu.","Such a gorgeous place to dine at! You can easily come during the light or dark hours and be  astonished by the beauty and atmosphere of this place! When I walked in, it was still light outside and the place looked like the upscaled backyard with quite and romantic feeling. When I was leaving and all the lights and lamps were on, it looked like a magical fairytale. Fresh salad with heirloom tomatoes and peaches is a mix I've never tried before and I'm sure if I order it somewhere else, no other place will be able to top it! Fried shaved Brussels sprouts with sliced almonds in sweet sauce were to fight for! This will be my family dish to prepare for all the future gatherings! I just wish there was a little less oil added to it.Hen of the woods is an amazing way to prepare mushrooms and keep thinking about it long after you are done eating it....still thinking about... yep, still thinking.Cavatelli what a way to prepare pasta! I stopped eating pasta for a while now and just try it sometimes, if someone at my table orders it, because all the restaurant make it so simple and boring that I regret ordering as soon as I try it. This pasta with pea pesto and a light mint and lemon aftertaste is something to dream about when thinking about the ideal pasta meal. NY strip, again I haven't ordered NY steak for year because no matter what restaurant makes it, it is always a good piece of meat..., but so boring! The osprey takes NY steak to the next level with wasabi spinach and puffed buckwheat. Dessert Campfire s'mores and coconut passion fruit were just big enough and diverse enough to satisfy the sweet tooth and not force yourself to eat more than you should.",The Osprey
294,"The food was average... I ordered fish tacos and it was nothing special for the price and the kale salad was just kale, croutons and dressing.  The service was terrible the waiter was no where to be found and I had to get up multiple times to grab what I wanted. When I tried to get his attention he would just walk right passed my table.  The place wasn't even busy, if it was busy I would understand but there were maybe 3 or 4 customers seated outside at the time. It was still very daylight out before the dinner rush.",love this place! need to write a more in depth review soon but it's temporarily closed due to a fire,Walking around the neighborhood and stumbled upon drag brunch... nuff said... here I am!,"This was my third visit to Forrest Point, the first two visits having been when I first moved to NY about 2 year ago. I had enjoyed dining here in the past (I remembered enjoying the tuna tartar tacos and the jalapeño Mac n cheese burger) so wanted to come back and bring a friend for dinner in their outdoor garden. I had made a reservation for a Friday night but the restaurant wasn't too busy and we got seated immediately outdoors. The ambience was perfect and the garden wasn't too loud so it was perfect to chat and catch up with my friend. For drinks we ordered the Purple Rain cocktail and a beer. We started with the Tuna Tartar Tacos, which I had remembered from a previous visit and had seen pop up in many yelp reviews. We were a bit underwhelmed. The tuna was tasty and fresh, but overall the tacos seemed to be lacking something to compliment the tuna and guac, and the shell was a bit oily and overpowering. For entrees my friend ordered the Breakfast Burrito and I ordered he King Louis Burger. The burger was well cooked and the ingredients were flavorful. Overall the food was good, not great, but the ambiance made up for it and we had an enjoyable dinner","I sat at the bar, bypassing all the posh outdoor seating, so I can only speak to the interior. It's a little dive-y, and the menu has some really good deals, if you know what to look for. (Hint: Look for the beer+shot combos.) My friend and I each did a whiskey+Narrangansett ($7), slamming back the shot then steady sipping the beer. I got great vibes from the laidback bar staff, and the people eating lunch around us seemed to be enjoying their food. It's the kind of place where no one looks twice at you, and everyone is welcome. Or at least, that's what the whiskey in my blood made me think.Cool spot! If you want a classy, upscale experience, that can be arranged; or, if you want an affordable drink, no questions asked, it'll happen.","Forrest Point is one of the best places I've tried in the area. I've been here on a number of occasions and the second I sit down, I'm already planning on when I'm coming back. The jalapeño Mac n cheese is incredible; the portion is large so it's usually enough for me to share with another person. The fajitas are amazing, though I ordered them from a special menu they were offering at the time (still, check it they're available). They also have amazing s'mores hot coco. The atmosphere is very very chill, especially at night. They put up a small projector and play movies.  I recommend this spot to everyone.",Forrest Point
295,"I can only judge this restaurant based off my delivery order this week. Honestly the food was fine but the portions were TINY. I mean so tiny that I paid $10 for ONE lamb skewer? Overpriced beyond belief, which is a shame because the flavors were good. Will not be ordering from them again.","When they microwave your falafel, you know you don't have to go back there. Such a bummer.",Just ordered delivery from here for the first time. The delivery window was something like 60-80 minutes but the food showed up in about 20/25! The two of us are completely stuffed with enough food for another meal at least. A++ will order again,"* 5stars = i (would) love to come back again...and again and again *We came here for lunch on a saturday afternoon and it was surprisingly not crowded -- and after eating there i cant imagine why but hey maybe we can keep it nice and quiet. The sides you get when you get an entree or a platter are smaller than ordering it by itself -- which was good news for us because we got to try more things on the menu!We got:- tzatziki 10/10: YUMMMMM. Do yourself a favor and get it. It was the perfect start of our meal on the hot sweltering day- gyro platter 9/10 (with the following two sides): meat was really good and the flavors were great. Also loved the salads that came with it (and the other entree we ordered). Our only woe was that we didnt get any more pita with it (but maybe we had to ask? Who knows)- spanakorizo 7/10: our least favorite if we had to pick just because we didnt know what to expect and wasn't quite sure how we felt about it..? My first time having it but it was a little underwhelming in terms of flavor (but maybe its supposed to be..who knows) but next time i'd rather try any of their other yummy-sounding sides- grilled veggies 8/10: these are literally all my favorite vegetables and i loved having them as a side to my meal. By itself, i think it could use a litttttle more flavor and a little less oil- pastitsio 8/10: for those of you (like us) who are having it for the first time -- imagine a non-saucy less-cheesy lasagna. I love pasta so i really enjoyed this, and again that side salad was yuuum- greek fries 10/10: we'll probably get a real order of this next time because YUM. The fries were a perfect texture and the oil+cheese were a really nice addition","I don't find myself in Brooklyn often, but last weekend my wife and I were exploring the town luckily stumbled upon Avlee! Greek food is one of our favorite cuisines so we were ecstatic to see other great reviews before stopping in. My wife and I split some fried calamari with our friend we were there with. It was very tasty, especially with the dipping sauce (I'm not quite sure what this sauce was, but we could have drank it that's how good it was). We got our usual dish that tests a new Greek place for us - the Chicken Souvlaki Sandwich/Pita without onions. The chicken was fresh and cooked really well, while the Tzatziki sauce was just right. I think my favorite part was the warm and delicious Pita bread. While there are a ton of other places to try in the area, it will be tempting to skip out on them to go back to Avlee!","Avlee is a good Greek restaurant in Brooklyn. I'm Greek-American and been eating in Astoria since I was a little kid, so for me to venture to Brooklyn for Greek food is unusual.  With this said, Avlee is a solid choice for the area.  Service was efficient and polite, and the ambiance is pleasant.  The food was all decent to good.  The halloumi was semi fried like a piece of saganaki rather than grilled which was not something I prefer, but this isn't a big deal.  Beyond this, everything else was just fine.  Nothing was outstanding, but I'd come back for sure.  Recommended.",Avlee Greek Kitchen
296,This place is overrated. The food was ok but not great. My steak was ALL fat. Service was a little lacking. Seems like if they have an event going on in their back space everyone is distracted. Don't think we'll be making a second trip.,"Of course food quality is important but what irritates me the most is the lack of common sense and hospitality of employees.  We came in as a small party of 2.  We were told that there was a wedding in the adjacent room and that the outdoor patio was not available.  Our only option was sitting in the main room so we agreed.  There were several empty tables of 4 available but we were told that we cannot sit there since we were only 2.  Fine, we agreed.  I'm not a small guy so the table made me feel like I was sitting at a desk in 1st grade.  The wait staff saw that I was uncomfortable but conveniently did not attempt to remedy the situation.  While going to the bathroom, I noticed that the adjacent room did not have a wedding and there were actually 2 guys having dinner.  That room was about 90% empty so we could have certainly been seated there.  The outdoor patio was also empty with just 2 or 3 occupied tables.  What makes this situation even worse is that while we were eating, the available tables around us remained empty and were even empty when we left.  Lying to customers about closed off sections of the restaurant when they are actually available, and refusing to allow a larger table because a bigger party ""might"" come in doesn't seem to portray the kind of hospitality that restaurants strive to achieve.In terms of food, it was very much below par.  I ended up with a poached salmon.  It was extremely small and had absolutely no flavor.We avoided sticking around for dessert.",I gave this place 3 stars because the food can be ok..depends on the day..The service is atrocious and the attitude worse.This is Brooklyn not Paris..,"I came here for my cousin's bridal shower so there was a pre fix menu. First off, it's a lovely venue if you're wanting to host an event. There was a baby shower happening right next to us but weren't bothered by them at all. The food all in all was absolutely delicious. I seriously do not have anything negative to say about any of the dishes I received. Crab cake was full of crab meat and really good. The hanger steak is making me drool just by writing this.The creme brûlée as you would expect. Perfect. I'd definitely come back again to try the rest of the menu.","I just held my bridal shower at Bacchus this past weekend, on Saturday. I want to extend a big, big THANK YOU to Meryl and her team for the wonderful experience my guests and I had. Everyone is still raving about how delicious the food was. The service was perfect and the staff were very accommodating for our event. My decorator and some of my friends were able to come before the restaurant even opened to set up. Everything was perfectly timed out (with the passed hors d'oeuvres, appetizers, entrees, and dessert), even with some of my guests arriving a bit late. (I warned people about parking being tough and to even avoid driving if possible.) Someone was always checking in with me about when I want the next dish brought out, how much time to wait in between courses, when to cut the cake, etc. I had previously been to Bacchus two years ago for a friend's wedding and loved the food and outdoor garden space.I decided to host my bridal shower here and was so fortunate for the beautiful weather, as the garden was just the perfect area. There is a covering overhead with blinds that can be drawn down to cover from the sun. I loved the ambience of the garden space already, and my decorations looked great within it. I opted for the 4 hours open bar including mimosas, wine, champagne, beer, coffee, tea, and soft drinks. I also pre-selected two appetizers, four entrees, and two desserts for guests to choose from. I chose to print my own menu to match the theme of my party. I was allowed to bring in my own cake and have a dessert table set up by an outside vendor.Everything was coordinated prior to my event. I informed Meryl how many tables I would need (for guests and other displays including photo props, favors, etc.), sent over my Spotify playlist, and confirmed the menu. Everything went smoothly and the time flew by! Everyone greatly enjoyed themselves and is still talking about the wonderful party!Once again, thank you so much!! I will definitely be back !! :)","Bacchus is a wonderful little restaurant nestled in downtown Brooklyn. The atmosphere was inviting as well as the staff. Even with several events going on, the staff was alert and attentive. The drinks and the food were absolutely delicious! From the plating down to the very last bite- excellent!Totally recommend and definitely coming back!",Bacchus Bistro & Wine Bar
297,"Customer service is not a priority of theirs.  Watch your bill.. lots of additional charges for sauces and such that they don't tell you about.; the manager Allison states ""customers get offended when you tell them about extra charges, they feel like you are saying they can't afford it.""  I CAN afford it BUT I would like to know what I'm being charged for.  First and last visit!","Have you ever had a bad feeling about something? This is my second visit to Black Swan and the ish just got real. My friend and I decided to go for drinks and JoJo the ditsy waitress seemed to have forgotten she was catering to a party of two. On the night in question, Dec. 4th around 10pm and 32 degrees outside (Bloody COLD), we entered the pretty empty establishment and was seated in the back area - not far off from the bar, but in front the kitchen. My friend ordered a Rum Punch for me and a Rose beer for themselves. There was one additional drink, but I can't recall the name, but just the horrific bitter taste. It took 30 mins to get our drinks after ordering it. The waitress explained Black Swan hired a new bartender, but I think she failed to give the bartender the order. When we got our drinks and were converting Jojo ONLY asked my friend two times if he would like anything else, but FAILED to ask me if I would like to replenish my RUM PUNCH. I must be invisible or I must've had something hanging from my nose. After, he started sipping on the 2nd beverage and asked that it be returned. The drink was very bitter so he requested a refund. There was no reluctance there as she may have went behind the bar to taste it herself (YUCK!)I was pretty much done after that....we left unhappy and pissed.  Yelpers please don't bother going. Bedford Hall was my first choice, but they're no longer in business. P.S: Jojo if you're reading this or any of your friends can pass this message along to you - always remember the female party likes to be treated with the same regards as the male. DITS!One star is due to a good rum punch.....SMH!","Don't do it.... the service and food are horrible. The waitress was cold hearted and the bartender was worse. He actually put the drinks on the table with a serious attitude and then when we asked a question about the drinks he says, ""I'm not your waiter, ask your waitress when she returns. I'm the bartender"" and storms off. Nah dah that's why we were asking you, dumb dumb!I can tell you from that warm reception I was ready to leave. We were both starving and ordered the Friday special ""Fish Sampler""- OMG disgusting. The calamari, shrimp and fries were soggy and not appealing to my taste or my girlfriend. There was not enough salt that could make this food taste any better. When we asked for the check we were charged $2 extra for the drink shot on top of paying for the drink. Who does that? This will be my first and LAST time coming to this establishment. You've been warned!","My partner and I came here on a Sunday afternoon and I was impressed.I ordered the chicken and waffles. I must say I'm glad I did. (She ordered the vegetarian breakfast meal- she's vegetarian so there's that.)The waffles were perfect- warm, fluffy and not too sweet. The chicken was fried to such a delightful crisp. Combine those two w the syrup... delicious.The mimosas were truly bottomless. We never waited for a refill.Thank you to Marlene and Anuhea!! Amazing service and amazing food! We'll be back next weekend.",This was my worst experience at an eatery in a long time. There were bugs and flies flying around the restaurant. My friend found 2 fruit flies in her beer. My other friend margarita tasted like Leomonaid. They don't use the correct glasses for the mix drinks. They add on numerous charges to your tab that's not listed on the menu and without telling you. You find out when you get the tab. The tables need a good cleaning and the service was terrible. We agreed we are never going back!,"Came in on a Sunday night for some beers and bites. Expectations were pretty low after a long day in the sun at the beach. We started with some draft beers and eventually ordered fish and chips and a side of brussel sprouts. The fish was flaky and lightly battered, not soggy at all; the portion was also huge! Brussel sprouts came with chopped up bacon, and the texture of them was good.I'll also add that this bar has tons of weekly specials for each day of the week. They also have drink specials that apply all day! Like buckets of cans of beer for $15 and a can of beer and shot for $7. Great local spot with good bar food!",Black Swan
298,Not only my favorite Mexican spot it may be my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn. Every single dish is amazing.... In the summer there's a cute patio area too.Obsessed with everything about Claro,"Took a while for us to get seated for our reservation, which we were totally cool with (we were drinking anyway, and they gave us champagne to make up for it) but I would just warn you not to sit outside. After we were seated the service was very slow, I don't think they had as many servers in the back yard. The food was very good, there wasn't anything on the menu that we didn't. The beef dishes were particularly tender and the mole was very tasty. We didn't love all of the cocktails so we stuck to beers.","We recently visited Claro and felt that the flavors were very one note. The aguachile was extremely spicy, to the point of being inedible, and we could barely find any scallops inside the dish. The same was true of the tuna tostada (very little tuna). Our server also recommended an absurdly expensive fig quesadilla ($24) for which we only received two portions. All in all, the food was lacking but I was particularly shocked by the outrageously bad value. My sister and I each spent $100 and we ordered six tapas and had two cocktails total. Mind you we did not even order the entree-style mole dishes. How does this restaurant have a Michelin star? Baffled.","Everyone should go here! It's in Brooklyn but totally worth it to travel out there. I'm also pretty sure they have the most extensive mezcal list I've seen in New York, outside of Austin.  It's a small kitchen and space but they dominate in every aspect! I was especially impressed with their beverage program - definitely one of the better cocktails I've had. I came here with one other person and we basically had the entire menu... and every dish was well executed but their Tortas were my favorite. I also loved how the bone marrow dish came with a mezcal pairing (so clever!)Can't wait to go back!","Pro tip: if it's nice weather out, ask to be seated in the outdoor back patio area, especially if you have a larger party. We stumbled upon Claro for a quick dinner before a show at Littlefield's, and they obliged with quick service. I was in the mood for classic tacos, but I still enjoyed the edgier dishes I ordered. A friend and I split a fig quesadilla, which didn't look like the quesadillas I'm used to, and it looked more like a flat taco. But it was really good and not too sweet, so it still felt savory. Our shrimp tacos came on blue maize tortillas, so that was pretty cool. We were so hungry that we scarfed it down while it was hot and it was really good. Shrimp could've been more plump though- these shrimp were...well, shrimpy.I get that Claro has a Michelin star, but for its prices, I don't think I'll be back again unless I'm attending a celebration here.","Would like to give this 4.5. If future visits are as consistent as our first, I will happily update to 5. Delicious Oaxacan fare in an unsuspecting neighborhood in Gowanus. What we loved:- Tuna Tostada was our favorite of the 4 dishes we had. Exceptional. I could eat this every day. Must order. - Barbacoa Tacos, second favorite. These were some of the most satisfying tacos I've had in a while. Juicy barbacoa, squeeze of lime, fresh tortillas... I give them an A- Quesadilla, good but not incredible. An interesting quesadilla for sure, but didn't have the wow factor of the first two. - Mole Negro Short Ribs, so good. The short rib was insanely tender. The veggies that accompanied it were great with the mole sauce. Pretty big portion too, we were absolutely stuffed by this point. - Cocktails, cannot remember which two we ordered but both were great. I doubt you can go wrong with the cocktails here. We enjoyed sitting on the back patio under the market lights. Seating could be more comfortable and with some small changes could be a really amazing patio. Some candles, comfortable chairs, maybe some lounge seating or an outdoor bar would really be special. Service was very fast and attentive. I could have used more spacing between dishes to savor each more fully, but appreciated how on top of things their staff was. Can't wait to come back here and (eventually) try everything on the menu!",Claro
299,"Came here to get the 30 piece wings with a side of fries. That was a bit overly ambitious...as 30 wings for 2 people is a bit much, especially if you are getting spicy wings. We got the extra hot ones and mild bbq.While each wing might not be hot....once you pile in 4 or 5, they stack up big time. Another lesson, I think if you keep drinking water due to the spicy wings, you probably can't eat as much, so 20 wings for 2 people (with fries) is probably the perfect amount.The hot ones were less saucy so maybe a little easier to eat than the bbq ones. They were both quite good, not super tiny wings either, very reasonable sized.I don't go to a lot of wings joints, but I would come back here.","It's a cool place. The people are friendly. The menu is typical American eats and from what my fiancé an I ate it was yummy. The milk shake selection is vast, but disappointing! We originally just went to get milkshakes but got some snack too. When we got the shakes they weren't flavourful or good! They were really watery and runny. I was disappointed. The chicken tenders and fries were good and portions were huge!My response to the restaurant's comment is my fiancé and I were holding up the top of the straws that's why the pic is cropped! Also, I don't doubt you got good reviews in the past but the key is making sure that experience continues for EVERY customer. You gotta maintain the rep, not doubt the customer's experience. If that was my only gripe with the spot, clearly I'm not making it up.","It's a cool place. The people are friendly. The menu is typical American eats and from what my fiancé an I ate it was yummy.

So many flavors and pairings and the staff is super sweet. Every time I visit I get a different pairing of their 99 different ice cream combos. My favorite it still the vanilla and strawberry but sometimes I like to mix it up and add something more interesting. It is the perfect place to relax and stop by after a long day at work. I definitely plan to return many more times.,Old school pub!!!!We've ordered from here In the past for super bowl and were all amazed  by the wings!!!! So we figured why not stop by for some dinner the staff was totally amazing the drinks were really good and the food was AWSOME anyone lookin for a great spot to have a few beers and enjoy some great food ya gotta stop by!!!!,"I'm not in Brooklyn much but I was able to stop by for some grub after checking out Prospect Park. I ordered the four piece order of chicken tenders and, while they were pretty good, I think I would've enjoyed them sooooo much more if I hadn't gotten any sauce. The server asked me if I wanted any hot sauce or barbecue sauce so I went with medium buffalo sauce, but I assumed he meant it as a dipping sauce; he didn't, and the chicken was actually coated in the sauce so they weren't crispy anymore!Aside from the uncrispiness of the chicken, the chicken quality was actually very good. You can tell it's 100% chicken (or at least it tasted like it...), and the fries were also very tasty. They were surprisingly crispy and it was all well-salted, and you could also see the big salt crystals on the fries.It definitely wasn't a bad visit and I am certainly open to returning if I'm in the area and craving chicken fingers! For $10 I think it was very solid.",Buffalo's Famous
300,"Meh, it's ok, if the service was better it would get another star however the three times I have been there the service in the bar area has been poor and a number of employees just kind of lazily look around for something to do other than serve customers. Pizza is ok, I think I went there due to proximity of the park and accessibility, I will end up waiting until I get back in the city next time for pie.","I came here on August 31st 2019 for the second time. We ordered the antipasto salad and a large pizza half cheese and half sausage with mushrooms.The line outside side was long and hard.  We were taken to the third floor buy stairs no elevator. Our antipasto salad came out and it was horrible. The tomatoes were not riped, they were green and hard. The mozzarella cheese tasted store-bought and the salami slices which where four of them, were okay. We  informed our waiter that the tomatoes were hard and unchewable. Once the pizza came out the cheese side was horrible. Tomato sauce tasted like can tomato sauce. And the cheese tasted store-bought with no flavor whatsoever. I gave them two stars because the sausage on the pizza was good sausage. I would never go back and I would never stay in a line to  eat there again.","Let me start by saying, Dumbo Brooklyn is a very quaint place to visit especially when its with my daughter.  Now for the pizza.  Get ready to wait on line outside.  I have been here before and there is always a line.  Once we were inside we were taken to the second floor to share a table with another family.  We decided to wait longer to have our own table.  So the wait was about an hour. Finally got a table in a very cramped area.  We a ordered the anti pasta, one large regular pie and one large mushroom and sausage.  Both pies where good but were lacking salt.  Very bland on seasonings.  The anti pasta was small but ok.","My wife and I, being from the Chicago area, recently visited NYC and wanted to try out a NY slice/pizza while there so we could compare it to Chicago's pizza.  After searching on the internet I chose Grimaldi's in Brooklyn based on its reviews.We arrived via taxi around 1:30PM and found a long line outside the door extending about 40 feet.  We decided to wait and after about 30 minutes or so we were seated at a table close to the brick oven where they were making the pizzas.  We ordered a small pizza with pepperoni, onions, mushrooms, sausage and extra cheese.  They don't serve wine so we opted for two soft drinks.Watching them make the pizza was great.  They applied fresh low moisture mozzarella slices all over the dough, then added the mushrooms, onions, pepperoni and sausage, and adding small scoops of tomato sauce around the top of the pizza (rather than brushing the tomato sauce all over the dough as most places do).  They then put 3-4 fresh basil slices on top and placed it in the oven.The fresh mozzarella was so different than most pizzas.  Sausage and pepperoni had a great taste.  Crust was done perfectly.  We told the manager that we were from Chicago and that this was one of the best, if not the best, thin crust pizza that we've had.  He chuckled and said that Michelle Obama was in here about 10 years ago and said the exact thing.Now if we could just duplicate that at home!!!","CATFISH LEVEL: 3.5/5: looks good, tastes good, wouldn't get againAfter trying Juliana's not too long ago, I had to try out Grimaldi's too! Keep in mind this place is CASH ONLY.We ordered the Margherita, the pesto, and the chicken BBQ special pie. The Margherita was good, nice and crispy and thin, with just the right amount of sauce to not overpower it. It was nicely cheesy, but a bit bland. After adding garlic powder it was a lot better!The chicken bbq was a bit soggy (expected given how much was on it), but the BBQ sauce wasn't overpowering like I expected it to be. It was the most flavorful out of all three. The cheese was a bit too much, it was very heavy and chewy. Compared to the cheese on the other pies, it tasted like the pie was made before and re-heated rather than fresh. The pesto pie was a huge disappointment...it was pretty oily, which is expected from pesto, but not to this extent. The pesto flavor was missing as well. Although we saw the green sauce, we couldn't taste it at all. Overall, the pizza was okay. It was definitely overpriced and not exactly memorable, but this place is a tourist trap so it makes sense. If I'm craving pizza in the area, I probably wouldn't go back since it wasn't necessarily worth the money.","This review is not about the pizza, because I wasn't able to try it (although all the pizza around me looked burnt). My friend and I came here after hearing it's the best pizza in Brooklyn . We got to the restaurant at 1:20 and there was no line, walked right in and had our pick of several tables on the first floor. We ordered our pizza around 1:25 and begin talking. As the time went by the restaurant begin to get busy and all the tables around us were occupied. As my friend and I talked about what we would do for the rest of the day we noticed the tables around us begin to get their pizza and we still hadn't. Our waiter noticed us looking around confused about where our pizza was. He came over and informed us that there was a mistake and they had remade the pizza and it was in the oven.  20 minutes after the waiter letting us know that it was in the oven we saw at least 10 pizzas get delivered upstairs. At that point I told my friend that if the people who just ordered next to us got their pizza before ours we would be leaving. Sure enough they got their pizza which was the last straw. I'm not sure if the pizza ever got in the oven, but that is unexceptionable! A 50 min wait without getting a pizza while everyone else around us waited 10-15 minutes. My advice would be to go to Juliana's. We left Grimaldi and went next door to be seated immediately and receive our non burnt pizza in 10 minutes.",Grimaldi's Pizzeria
301,I got drunken noodles with pork for take out and it was mediocre. The noodles and veggies were good but the pork was really dry and tasteless. It has a convenient location and pickup was smooth. Probably come again for take out if I'm looking for something quick.,Updating this review because I had a really tough time getting a refund on Seamless for an order the restaurant cancelled on me.  It took many phone calls to get the refund on food I never even received.  Extremely unprofessional.,"Started out really good! The veggie dumplings were some of the best I've had and the grilled pork and sticky rice was excellent. The pork wasn't dried out and was still juicy. Enjoyed my Thai iced tea but I've had better. The main problem was the pad kee mao. The noodles were decent, veggies way to oily but the main problem was the container and lid were cracked in different areas and just broken.","Went here for date night and loved it. It's a simple restaurant with great food. The staff were very accommodating! I had the pineapple fried rice with chicken. I asked if they could kick the spice up and they did just that. It was great! My boyfriend had the drunken noodles which were delicious! Idk if it's NY but the Thai food I've found out here hasn't been anything to ride home about, but this place gave me hope lol Oh the Thai iced tea was bomb too!",The BEST DRUNKEN NOODLES IN TOWN!! Papaya salad is a must! Fast delivery! Great space in there-they are very friendly!,"Seriously delicious eats and fast, friendly service is how they roll at Dannee. Have eaten here twice and gotten delivery another time, and all three times I've been (pleasantly) surprised at how good everything is. From the variety of choices to the freshness of the food, Dannee feels like a hidden gem in Bed-Stuy. My favorite dishes are the ones with the mock duck (are you ducking kidding?!); with the current popularity in plant-based ""meats"" (Beyond Burgers; Beyond Sausages; Impossible Burgers), I'd avoided most soy- or gluten-based ""meats,"" but the mock duck has me hankering for it. It has great texture and flavor, and it livens up an already tasty fried rice and Drunken Noodles. Since I've been here/gotten delivery during dinner time, I haven't yet tried the Thai Iced Tea (caffeine o'clock), but I've seen Dannee's version and I might just have to get one to go for the following morning.",Dannee
302,"Came here for dinner and it was OK, not sure why it got 4 stars.Pros:- Delicious and freshly baked pita bread- Friendly and service was attentiveCons:- Although the dishes were decent sized, our dishes (Lamb Kebabs, Grape Leaves, and Baba ghanoush) were standard and nothing really stood out on flavors. - The worst part was that the restaurant was incredibly hot and we had to leave because we got so sweaty and uncomfortable.","$11 for a lamb gyro... barely any sauce, dry as hell!  Horrible!  The sauce is the best part of the gyro and they cant even be generous with that?  Not asking for more lamb, which is more expensive, but you can't sell a dry sandwich!  Now I have to remind them every time for extra sauce!  Stop being cheap!","Cheap and easy neighborhood joint, not particularly great but gets the job done. Actively bad falafel in my opinion - too fried and dry, with virtually no seasoning.","The food is wonderful. The space needs a little upgrade, but they make do with what they have. I will say that the meat is usually a little colder so they should improve on that, but the lentil soup was fantastic. Service is okay.","ok we aren't trying to be haters here. (my boyfriend and i are writing this on the bus.) but one of the things we ate here LITERALLY tasted and smelled like the garbage we passed on the street minutes earlier, back in the naive days when we hadn't experienced black iris' chicken ouzi. believe me -- we like weird food. pickled herring, yes. fermented bok choy, yes. we are not picky so this isn't the common yelp review case of someone having a delicate-flower tongue. it tasted like actual garbage fresh out the can.the labneh was good.service was fine.","I adore this place. I always order the labana, baba ganoush, spinach pie, zatar bread and hummus. Literally 40 bucks with tip for a huge amount of food for two people. Also, the baba ganoush is smoky and delicious. BYOB!",Black Iris
303,This place reminded me of one of those 3D illusions where everyone sees the image within the squiggly lines except you...like George in that Seinfeld episode. I was turned off immediately upon perusing the sake menu. Least expensive choice was $13 for a 6oz carafe. Tasted like any other generic rice wine. Yuzu salad dressing had zero Yuzu and I know my Yuzu since I order it from Japan regularly. Jalapeño ponzu had no jalapeño which was disclosed by a gentleman who appeared to be the owner. They have no house chili paste...they offered sriracha from the plastic bottle. Japanese fried chicken nuggets were raw. They were taken back; refried and dropped down in front of my teenage daughter as if it never happened. I love dark meat chicken but these nuggets were all sinew. Maki rolls were 6 tiny pieces cut from half of a normal size maki. The cooked salmon and black cod were ok but in no way make up for the creative deception going on here.,"I ordered this online through Yelp. I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, (can't go wrong, right?) Yes.. yes you can. Overall, it was an okay experience. The only thing is that there was barely any mean and the broth wasn't as rich as I'd like it to be. I had no desire to finish off the broth like I do at many other ramen restaurants. If you're craving late-night ramen and are in Brooklyn, I'd say this is the place to order from. But if you're looking for a nice ramen dinner, I'd say that this isn't the best place.","The food here is great! I thoroughly enjoyed every dish I ordered. Unfortunately, the service was terrible. The waitress didn't smile at us once. She looked like she really did not want to be there. Very unfriendly. It's too bad. If it weren't for the bad service, I would give this restaurant an easy five stars. And I would have definitely returned. The chef is too good for this place, in my opinion.","Came on Friday night at 6pm. No wait - which was great cuz we don't mind sitting at the bar. My boyfriend and I both got the Brooklyn bento box course, which has Amuse, Chawanmushi, seaweed salad, miso soup, salmon roll and karaage with rice. Any each one of them can be switched to other type (extra charge might apply). Everything tastes perfectly. But it was actually a big portion in total. I could barely finished the karaage at the end. And my boyfriend finished all but feeling very full. The price for the bento box is $32.5 w/o tax. Each costs around $40 plus tax and tips so it makes sense because one bento box really have a lot of food.They also have matcha beer! Maybe we'll try it next time.","I had Chirashi. The slices of the sashimi were delicious. They were fresh and nicely flavored. The sushi rice was also good. Moist and extremely fragrant The miso soup was okay. A legendary Mrs. Tanizaki, the widow of the famous writer Zunichiro Tanizaki, told me at our dinner in Tokyo that she could tell the quality of the food by first tasting the miso soup. The soup would not pass her test but the sashimi would.",They have very yummy specials. They are usually not crowded on a weekday for lunch so it can be a spacious place to come in and have lunch with kids and strollers. Inside the decoration is very minimal but it is a bigger space and very clean. We seemed to have a waiter that was inexperienced but the manager or owner came over and was quick to rectify the situation. I ordered the cod lunch bento and the fish was delicious. It is a little bit pricey for lunch but the quality was great. The smoked duck roll was also unusual. I have never seen that in another Japanese place so it was great to try. It was yummy but not sure if it is my favorite roll. It is a great option for a cooked version for a sushi roll though.,Wasan Brooklyn
304,Tucked Away from the main chaotic 8th Avenue with solid Taiwanese dishes. Service is fast and friendly.,"Book marked this Taiwanese spot for a quit while now.  Finally made it for dinner with another friend to try them.  After reading reviews on yelp, we were very skeptical, due tot eh reviews either had five stars or one star. We gave it a shot since we both like Taiwanese food.   When we arrived for dinner, there were no other costumers just us.  They were also in the process of making promotion posters, new menu or promotions.  They had a photographer there taking pictures of items from the menu.  We were sad as well to be told that the pictures on the top of the wall are no longer available.  So we ended up ordering popcorn chicken( bland), oyster pancake( bland and soaked in sauce), three cup chicken(too salty), beef roll (cold! And hard, maybe they were the one they were taking picture with) and spicy wonton( worst ones I ever had, mushy and no flavor from the meat or the sauce).  Overall rating is due to how disappointed we were on the flavor, the food took forever to come, maybe they were too busy with the picture taking project.  The server was nice.  Later, there were a few more tables that came.  We were skeptical to try their shaved ice, so we left it there.  Hope they will improve and stay in the community.","Disappointed...very disappointed at this place. Came here and had to wait for a table of three. In total there are two large tables for 4, two small tables for 2, and 4 seats on the edge. The place is cold and does not have heat. They do not provide any drinks, not even tap water. Service is terrible because the lady was either on her phone or in the back talking to her colleague. Had to constantly get her attention to order and for check. The Taiwanese beef noodle soup was the only thing I liked. However, it is overpriced for two long strand of noodles. Don't let the bowl deceive you because it's not filling and the portion is small. Only four pieces of beef. The oyster omelette is no where like Taiwan and very disappointing. The oyster was not fresh and there were barely any oysters, the pancake had a very thick dough batter and not enough eggs. Ordered the braised pork rice and the bamboo shoot does not pair well with it. In Taiwan, they don't add bamboo shoot but more braised pork. I guess the bamboo is used to reduce the amount of pork they wanted to give. Lastly, the beef and pork combo was good but there was no beef. It was pork ear, pork intestine and pork knuckle. Overall not worth it, probably won't come again.","Warning: this place serves authentic stinky tofu, so be warn because the smell isn't for everyone. In terms of the food, portion runs big so you get your money worth. They have a wide variety of Chinese Taiwanese food so it's definitely worth checking out. We came here for the stinky tofu hot pot, and ordered the oyster pancake, beef burrito, fried pork blood and popcorn chicken. Overall, the stinky tofu hot pot was very smelly and pungent. In terms of flavor, it was good but the hot pot makes the tofu a little soggy so I think the basic fried stinky tofu might have been a better choice. The oyster pancake was my favorite, it came in a huge portion with real oysters and a savory sauce on top of it. MUST TRY. However, the beef burrito were not crispy enough and lacks crunch. The fried pork blood and popcorn chicken were mediocre - I would skip those next time. I'll be willing to come back and try more stuff!","Love this spot! They have a great variety of Taiwanese dishes and are spot on with the flavors. The owner is super nice along with all the staff. Fast service and great prices make out this place in permanent rotation. Three cup chicken, Okayama mutton hot pot, and the scallion pancakes are a delicious must order. Giving this five because the owner brought out my fav, zongzi, as an appetizer on the house.",Great spot for some traditional Taiwanese dishes. The location is a bit hard to find  and the parking around is difficult too. We might be able to find other options for great Taiwanese food at Flushing.,Golden Rich
305,Meh. Moved from South Florida...this is not even close to a good arepa. I don't even know if I would call this place an arepa place because of how they are made. Their arepas are very tough and instead of using 2 they slice one and try to make it work. Drinks were straight juice - couldn't taste any liquor. We went on a Tuesday around 7 o'clock and the bar area was starting to get crowded. Happy hour isn't really happy hour - drinks are still at least $8 a piece.,"Not the best arepas, but not the worst, pretty standard. The sangria was also pretty basic. It gets pretty loud in there so I definitely wouldn't try to have an intimate dinner. The customer service was decent.","After 2 hours waiting for our food, we got arepas that are barely stuffed that for the price it's kinda a scam. The pabellon plate it's so small for the price also. The passion fruit juice was acid no that sweet. Not happy at all.","Omg what's not to love? This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Williamsburg area and the best arepas I've had in New York City. I always get the De Pabellon which is shredded beef, black beans, cotija cheese, and fried plantains. It's one of the best things I could ever imagine having in my mouth. I also like the tequeñas or the tostones as an appetizer. The ambiance is intimate and a little dark. Service is usually pretty good.","I've never been to the brick and mortar in person, but I've ordered takeout.   Though not cheap, most run about $12, arepas here are delicious. Awesome $9 cocada drink if you like coconut, milk, and cinnamon.  This might even be my favorite item on their entire menu! Arepas here are tasty.  Vegetarians rejoice, for many tasty vegetarian arepa options and modifications abound.  I ordered delivery via their website.  Purchased 3 arepas and 1 cocada drink.  Arepas: La Surena $10.50; Los Muchachos $10.00; La Mulata $10.00.  After taxes, mandatory delivery charge, and tip, these four items cost almost $60.   Quite a pretty penny for something that's supposed to be simple Venezuelan street food.  La Mulata is a great vegetarian choice, and tastes even better if you choose to add their tangy zippy yellow sauce.The food here is fantastic, but I'm docking a star for the hefty $3.75 mandatory delivery fee.  It took 40 minutes for my food to arrive.  If you live nearby, or only have a small order, it's more worthwhile to pick up.  In any event, eat good food... eat Caracas!","Super cute place with a lovely back area, highly highly recommend sitting back here. We just popped in for a quick bite and had one of the Arepas and a drink. We ended up becoming immediate friends with the table across from us and sat down together with our new Israeli friends for our meal. The arepa was delicious and the drink very solid. More than anything, the staff was so lovely and accommodating. We weren't really hungry or looking to get anything but they were so inviting that we ended up from the outside looking in at the menu all the way to the back enjoying a meal. They also deliver which is huge. Much respect @Caracas. One love",Caracas Arepa Bar
306,"We love this place with my husband, the hamburger is in our top 5 of the best burgers of NYC but what we don't find good/fair is that it says in the menu that the orange juice is fresh squeezed. Which is not true at all. it is the same Tropicana juice that I can get in the market and that really sucks! Don't lie to the customers.","So sad to learn there was a fire and they will be closed until September, but glad that no one was hurt.We were there with friends for dinner 2 weeks ago, it was quite busy even on a Tuesday night. Small menu but decent food and the outdoor garden at the back is a plus! I was looking to make reservation to try their brunch this weekend, and that's when I found out about the fire.","I come to this spot regularly because I live a few blocks away. On NYE I was disappointed because the servers were impatient and rude. My little brother asked what beers they had and the server retorted do you want me to list them??! That's the definition of your job and if it was tough to remember she could have easily brought the list. My $36 scallops were cold, I asked for more bread and they said they couldn't ""sell me anymore"" due to some bread shortage, everything was super rushed and after this experience I won't spend money there again.","Dope little spot in Greenpoint Brooklyn. What I loved is how simple each dish is but packed with flavor. Was here for brunch with some friends great little greenpoint vibe and spacious outside seating. Drinks were great and so was the food- I had maybe the best BLT of my life and my friends enjoyed all there dishes as well. Loved the healthy brunch options as well, so if you go in alittle banged up from the night before the food gets you back and doesn't make you feel like a total piece of shit.

My meal was good, but not as memorable as the restaurant's great atmosphere.

307,"It's been years since I stepped into Michael's.   It hasn't changed at all.  The menu is upgraded, but that's about it. I had  Veal d' Michael.  Butter soft boneless veal topped with spinach and mozzarella in white wine shrimp sauce.   They make a chicken version too.   The menu is very big but I don't think you can go wrong with anything.  It's like walking into a 1970's MOB movie but everything is fresh. Service is second to none and this time I won't wait so many years.   I missed you Michael's. I'll be dating men in my future who can afford to bring me there.","Michael's of Brooklyn,Your jarred sauces that you sell in select grocery stores across the US are the best thing that's ever happened to me. My rigatone will never be the same. I will be seeing you in person soon. Don't change. I love you and take care,A crazed Guido","It depends on what you order. We have come here twice. The first time was a great experience. Anything pasta-related is delicious. They know how to prepare mushrooms. Not so sure about seafood. The risotto with seafood was very good with the exception of the unpleasant sand/crunch in the shallots. We tried the Michael's Seafood Hot Antipasto and were disappointed (something here did not agree with our stomachs) and we tried one clam...not worth eating the rest. What was most upsetting was what they did to our lobster tails. We asked for broiled lobster tails and we got chewing gum. Impossible to eat. Two beautiful specimens treated with such disrespect and excessively overcooked. We asked the waiter to rely the comment to the cook...but we will never get seafood-related dishes from this restaurant for sure. If we return, to give it a third try, we will narrow our selection to the soups, pasta dishes or polenta with mushrooms. On another note, the plates in our table were dirty with grease, the interior could use a renovation, the bathrooms were not very clean, and over all, we have been 50/50 satisfied with the food. What they did to the lobster is unforgivable and they definitely need to be more selective with the quality of their seafood.","I had a classy, fun dinner here a few weeks ago for date night. We arrived around 7 in a Saturday night and the place was buzzing. We were promptly seated. The dining area is pretty formal, yet informal. We were quickly asked if we wanted a mixed drink from the bar - though we opted to look at the wine menu instead. Our waiter was very attentive and made a nice fuss over us. We ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer. It was delicious- the sauce obviously made it even better!For main courses, I had the Parpadelle Bolognese and my SO had the Veal Milanese. Our portions were huge! But again, everything was served fresh, hot, and delicious. Will definitely be back!","My so and I decided to go here for dinner because he was craving Italian.  He had this place bookmarked I guess and I only recognized the place after walking in and remembered that I had seen glass jars of their pasta sauce at a deli somewhere in Dyker Heights.The ambiance is old school Brooklyn and it's apparent when you walk into the place. The lamps are al la Art Deco and the waiters are dressed to impress in their attire.  The ceilings are low, but there was enough space for a big party.  The patrons that night seemed to be mostly locals.  Our waiter was a very friendly guy who gave us a low down and was a real Italiano.  My so and him hit it off and I always like the super friendly demeanor of Italian places and how they make you feel welcome.  The spread they brought before the wine was very nice.  Olives, Parmesan cheese, and salami.  The bread variety was a nice touch also.  We both ordered a glass of rose.  For the main dishes we ordered the seafood platter and ravioli.  The seafood platter could have used slightly more seasoning because the flavor was a bit plain, but I'm betting they were trying to incorporate the natural seafood flavor.  The noodles were cooked al dente.  The butternut squash ravioli had amazing flavor, but the inside could have incorporated slightly cheese for my preference imo.  It was slightly too hard.  We didn't get dessert because we were so full from our main course.  The food was good and I liked how there was no dress code as we were dressed causal.  I found it humorous though how at the entrance it said no gym shorts or sneakers I believe.  All that was missing music from Pavarotti or a night of watching The Godfather.  Yeah let's just say something was missing after a night of Italian food here.  All in all, it was an experience of old school Italian dining and I enjoyed it.","Came here for an early Valentine's Day dinner and we were seated promptly for our reservation. Service was great, checking in on us intermittently but not overbearing. They started the meal with a complimentary selection of bread, focaccia, breadsticks, and crackers along with a trio presentation of cheese, olives and sliced preserved meat. I'm a sucker for good bread and butter, which was incredibly creamy and fragrant. We ordered from the specials menu. We started with the Eggplant Rollatini for appetizer, which consisted of two pieces; the ingredients were very fresh and the cheese very light and soft. For entrees, I ordered the Squid Ink Linguini & Calamari Marinara and my husband had the Veal Chop Parmigiana, the famous ""Smash Job"". They were both delicious and huge, enough for us to take home a good portion of leftovers. As a nice touch, they also packaged some of the extra sauce.For dessert, we shared the homemade spumoni slice, which was a perfect end to our meal. They also offered complimentary biscotti cookies, but we didn't order any coffee so they were too hard to enjoy. All in all, it was an excellent meal, on the pricier side but worth it for the delicious food.",Michael's of Brooklyn
308,"So I just came from Samurai Mama and the food wasn't too bad, however service was not good. The waitress spilled some oil on my friends dress and also accidentally dropped a dirty spoon on my arm. I know it was clearly an accident, however it's ridiculous that they require a 20% tip for a party for a party of 5. With the accident we would have tipped way below 20% because they didn't even try to offer anything for consolation. Their service definitely does not deserve the 20%. I was considering to fight against the bill, however it may be a losing battle and just not worth my time.","We were a party of 8 - 4 adults and 4 children (kids 6 and under) - the place was decently busy, but we didn't have to wait. The host seated us within a few minutes, but then returned to say that there was a $30 minimum per person, including the kids. Confused, we asked him to clarify a few times. For a place that sells $10-$16 udon/ramen mains, I don't get how they expected the adults to eat/drink that much to ""make up"" for the childrenI'd get it if they had a line out the door and were worried we would take up too much space and not spend enough, but wow, talk about not family friendly. Too many options in the neighborhood to deal with this kind of nonsense.",This restaurant was so unfriendly. Ramen and Katsudon were all tasteless. So I gave the tip 15%. The restaurant took a 35% tip from my card unilaterally. This restaurant was the worst restaurant among the restaurants I have ever visited.,"This place is beautiful. It's a nice spot to go with family and friends, or even by yourself. However on a date I'm not so sure. You would have to grab a booth for privacy. It's a traditional family styled setting which leaves your conversation open to everyone to hear. And although we weren't talking about anything crazy, it's a little annoying to see people staring at you from a cross the room. I didn't like the edamame because it's cold, although I was informed it's a supposed to be served that way. But it's a beautiful , little hole in the wall that I would definitely try again once.","Came in for lunch and realized this place has a similar ambiance to bozu, then I found out they have the same owner. The lunch specials come with salad and homemade miso soup. I had the kakiage donburi, which is bits and pieces of veggies like carrots & burdock fried in tempura batter. Reminded me of my childhood and came stacked high on a bed of rice. My husband got the dry curry donburi, which is ground pork in curry sauce on top of a bed of rice. The pork comes about fist size, with a huge potato croquette + poached egg. Great service, they never let our water glasses go empty and made sure we enjoyed our food :) would come back!","Super tasty! We got pork udon soup, pork udon dipping style and the sushi tacos. All were very tasty. I felt that the soup udon broth was a bit bland but they provide spicy chili powder on the side that you can add in to kick it up a notch. The sushi tacos are a must get and as far as we could tell, you can't go wrong with the udons",Samurai Mama
309,"I really really wanted to love this place but unfortunately have to give it a 3 star after my 2 visits there. First visit: Tried the 12/15 fish sampler (forget the actual name) but it's the choice where you get several dishes to try. What's good: the dishes sampled were 90% Indonesian authentic and delicious.What's bad: the serving time was more than 1.5 hours. The waiter seemed disorganized and frazzled and admired that our dishes had been ready and sitting out there for awhile. Second visit:Tried the mee goreng and shrimp curry dishWhat's good: service is faster this time.What's bad: the food tasted completely different from the last visit. My guess is the chef must have taken the day off as the dishes did not taste great, especially the shrimp dish. My conclusion: it's too stressful to go to a restaurant on a Friday evening after a week of work not knowing what to expect : ie very slow service and good food or very prompt service and bad food. I won't be going back for a while.","We came for dinner and the restaurant was completely empty. There was no one in the front, so we stood there for a few mins until we had to wave down the lady in the kitchen. She told us to sit anywhere and rushed back for at least five mins before returning with menus. She dropped it off and went back to the kitchen again. We waited and waited until someone took our order and guess what? It wasn't until twenty mins later with the same lady. We realized she was working by herself but really? Apparently, she was taking phone orders and cooking the orders until another employee came a while later. We ordered the 15 dishes meal to share between us. The soup came out first, about 20 mins after ordering. It took a little over an hour for everything else. Let's just say, we waited an hour and a half for the whole meal. Reminder, we were the only table there. I honestly wanted to get up and leave but my partner really wanted to give it a try. Now the food. The food were ok. Actually, no it wasn't the greatest. We probably enjoyed four out of the many. It was definitely not worth the wait. Not at all! There were still a lot left. My Indonesian partner was so disappointed but at least we can say we gave it a try.","I love Indonesian food and of course I have to try the tapas. I like most of the dishes but felt the taste was not strong enough to warrant a five star but still deserve to be tried. One thing I remembered the most is the curry chicken, it lack taste and it was really dry. Went in a busy Saturday night. Remember that this is a very small restaurant so reservation is highly recommended. We toke the last 4 person table. Overall it was good but not great. Lots of fish dishes in the tapa sample for 2. I think ordering one or two main might be better than having the tapa dishes.","Can't believe I found an Indonesia restaurant which is extremely authentic in NY. As I always mention in other reviews. It's so difficult to find the right south East Asian restaurant in NY, because they need to use a lot of different ingredients to cook. Also, food shouldn't be expensive so not many restaurant owner would do it authentic way. We ordered 17 dishes menu for two. Yes 17 dishes which is only 49 dollars. Portions are small but I think it's perfect size. Every dishes taste completely different. Different doesn't mean they just look different, every dishes are cooking with the different base ingredients so you can tell they cook every dishes in the original way. Restaurant is also family welcome. For this food and this prices, I gave 5 stars","Cute little authentic Indonesian place. Food is pretty good, it taste very home made. Not overly seasoned. We had the 17 dishes course for 2 but it was enough for us 4. It's tapas style, small tasting dishes. Good if it's your first time trying Indonesian food or if you're like me that can't decide and want to try everything. The 17 dishes are soup, 3 appetizers, 10 entrees (shrimp, curry, lamb, chicken, veggies), one dessert and a tea. The soup is light and flavorful. The lemongrass give it a nice touch. The coffee is really really good. Strong but not overly sweet. It was perfect. The Garuda drink is nice too. The food does take a while to come out so don't come too hungry. Service is good.","Stopped by here on a Thursday evening around 8 pm. The restaurant was pretty empty besides one other table. Service was really good! We asked for recommendations since we had never really had Indonesian food before and were only sharing 2 dishes among the 3 of us. We got the mie goreng and the daging belado. The mie goreng was really good - there's slices of fried garlic and onion which add so much flavor to the dish. The daging belado flavorwise was great, however the beef chunks were so hard to chew. I literally chewed a piece of beef 50 times and it still wasn't broken down completely. Super sad because the flavor of the sauce itself was so flavorful. Definitely want to come back and try their tasting menu though!",Java Indonesian Restaurant
310,The chef burger was to die for. the Sangria out of this worldand lets not mention the fries.. this was my third time and it won't be my last.,"Cute space, but I wouldn't come back. The restaurant is one small square room with a center door that lets in the cold air, we were freezing. They had a space heater above the door and in the bathroom, but it was uncomfortable.I ordered the one hot drink on their menu only to be told that they were out of one of the ingredients, then told they were actually out of all the ingredients (it was empty except for two other people). I instead ordered a Kahlua whipped-cream and cinnamon concoction that was honestly the best thing I had there that night.They don't have a full liquor license so they use lower ABV liquors that are made out of wine. For some things this works, for others it doesn't. My friend ordered a margarita and it tasted very off, not like it's namesake whatsoever. I just don't think that there's a replacement for tequila. At least not one that comes from wine. They do offer beer.I ordered the beet, burrata and arugula salad with balsamic glaze. The balsamic drenched the entire salad. it was soggy. I was trying to just scrape it off to the side but it was impossible. The ingredients were fresh, this should have worked, but the ridiculous amount of goopy balsamic (not a dressing, a glaze) made it hard to eat, overpowering everything and messing with the textures. We also split an order of their chicken wings, in a Chipotle bourbon sauce. The Chipotle was undetectable, the sauce itself was extremely light, more like a brushing or a glaze. And also very mild in flavor. The wings themselves were tender, but the sauce really didn't hit the spot.Finally the cheese on everyone's burger was extremely pungent and overpowering. One of my friends ordered theirs with no cheese, but they were told that cheese is incorporated into the meat, which he thought would be fine. But he said it tasted like he was just eating a regular cheeseburger, that's how strong it was. That it was hard to taste the meat through all the other flavors. I really felt the same way, even though I just got a beast burger with cheese lettuce and tomato, it was definitely hard to taste the meat, it was a saucy gooey mess. The burger itself was very dense but tender, it almost seemed like the meat was very compressed and soft. It didn't have a grilled taste, it was very thick. Just an odd texture, odd flavors, very mushy. Fries were solid.They were doing a lot of take out orders, that seems to be a good chunk of their business, and their delivery man was rushing as best he could but people were still calling to ask when their food would be arriving.","Prices are a bit high for just regular burgers and small appetizers... For that price, I rather go elsewhere. Their appetizers portions are quite small (similar to tapas style).However, their menu is pretty unique and the decor inside is nice. They give you a tablet but you can't order on the tablet. The tablet just shows you what's on their menu. Overall, I would come back if the prices are lowered.. Else, meh, I don't think I will. The food they serve isn't worth the price.","i was craving real good burgers and i came across this place. from the outside view it doesn't look like a restaurant but my momma always told me to not judge a book by its cover! once you walk in the perception of that place changes . it's so cute and cozy to eat with a small family or friends. me and my boyfriend cane because we live in the neighborhood and was lazy to travel far and we was so glad we came here to try there delicious burgers. the seating arrangement were great i have a very tall man and the fact that they even accommodated to his height by having high table w chair options was a plus from the both of us. we came around were there was a festival going on down the 3rd ave so they have good drinks specials which the spike lemonade was my favorite and came in a good size glass. the waiter was very attentive and even we waited longer than usual for a our food and made a mistake in our order he made it up by giving a round a drink on the house which i was certainly please. the place has so much diversity in staff , music , and demographic that cater to that i felt so welcome. we wasn't able to try a thing else but i could def see this not being our last visit stay tune for more! the venue is def a diamond in rough !  gender neutral bathroom  family welcome accept cards and cash of payments no outdoor seatings  lady one business","i was craving real good burgers and i came across this place. from the outside view it doesn't look like a restaurant but my momma always told me to not judge a book by its cover! once you walk in the perception of that place changes . it's so cute and cozy to eat with a small family or friends. me and my boyfriend cane because we live in the neighborhood and was lazy to travel far and we was so glad we came here to try there delicious burgers. the seating arrangement were great i have a very tall man and the fact that they even accommodated to his height by having high table w chair options was a plus from the both of us. we came around were there was a festival going on down the 3rd ave so they have good drinks specials which the spike lemonade was my favorite and came in a good size glass. the waiter was very attentive and even we waited longer than usual for a our food and made a mistake in our order he made it up by giving a round a drink on the house which i was certainly please. the place has so much diversity in staff , music , and demographic that cater to that i felt so welcome. we wasn't able to try a thing else but i could def see this not being our last visit stay tune for more! the venue is def a diamond in rough ! * gender neutral bathroom * family welcome* accept cards and cash of payments* no outdoor seatings","Fantastic burgers !!Wednesday night karaoke !!

311,"Bring back Glechik! The food here is not that good and the service is surprisingly worse. I called to let them know that I have a service animal, they said no problem over the phone. When we got there, the hostess again confirmed with the owner and he approved my dog being there. Then, about midway through our meal, the owner came over to our table and proceeded to scold us for bringing a dog, saying not to come back with a dog next time. If it was such an issue, then he shouldn't have given the A-okay from the beginning - not midway through our meal after we had ordered about $200 worth of food. Mind you, the dog laid under the table without making a sound for the entirety of the time we were there and the place was practically empty aside from one other table.","I was very disappointed,  the food is very overpriced.   Kalduni were not tasty at all.  The sausages I wanted to order were not available.   Prices are pretty high for the amount of food and the quality of the food.","The atmosphere is great. Did not like the food, though. Potato with meat was not salted at all. The feeling was like you chewing something hot with no taste. Draniki were over fried and also no real taste. Salad was ok. Croutons with garlic were good too. After that food my stomach was so full that I did not even want to walk, only seat. I did not eat that much, though. Not sure if we gonna come aga","I love this place. The first time I came here, I never forgot their Kompot and shishkebabs with the delicious fried potatoes, Russian pickles, and pickled carrots on the side. Whenever I am in the area I try to stop by and bring people with me who have never had real Russian food.This please tastes as authentic as it gets. I love the interior; it reminds me of a little Russian village. The staff there can all speak either Russian or English, it seems, so don't worry if you only can speak on of the languages.The bread with butter that they give you while you wait for food is always so fresh and soft. When you order tea, they even give you a little sweet to have with it. Such great service. I look forward to coming back here again soon.","This place is so delicious!  I had their kompot to drink and, to eat, pork kebab which came with potatoes, onions, pickles, and sauce.  The food is so authentic and awesome!  I'll be definitely coming back here again.","A pleasant surprise ! This place has been open for some time now, I've passed it several times, tried to eat here a few times but there was always a long wait. Finally , no wait & tasty dinner.Inside of the restaurant is very cute , looks like a village , & pleasant waitress and bus boy(usually not the case at ""russian"" restaurants in Brooklyn) .++There is a 10 dollar cork fee Friday /sat/sun and the prices are a bit on the higher side as oppose to ""russian"" restaurants within the area- but totally worth it.Vodka Infusions- they have homemade vodka infusions . I tried two flavors, the cranberry flavor was awesome!Food- (not too many fresh salad selections) but I have avocado salad which was good and not stingy on the avocado.Galubtsi- haven't had that in at least 10 years were amazing! And haven't seen them on a menu in other restaurants I think ever.Potato pancake with beef was delicious too , next time would try a different meat.Great food and drinks, if youre looking for something super healthy too eat this might not be the place but great for russian food .I shall return.",Belarussian Xata
312,"Food is amazing and tasty, just takes 30-40 minutes for you to get it. Their kitchen is small and staff is limited which is probably why. If you have a lot of time for brunch, would visit but if you want a quick meal, try another place.","Spectacular food, accommodation, wine, and dessert. Not a single thing was off or wrong. Can't wait to come back. Simply Stellar","Came here for brunch. Slow service, baked polenta had no flavor, will never come back.","Really closer to a 3.5. Went for brunch to celebrate a friend's birthday. We all ordered recommended dishes off of Yelp, although the reviews are quite mixed. After trying several items on the menu, I can tell that it depends on when you're coming in, as most additions to their meals are seasonally based; i.e. fruits.We ordered:Peach buttermilk pancakesChallah French toastAvocado toast and grilled asparagusFried green tomato sandwichBreakfast tacos (not pictured sadly)Strawberry bellinisMimosaWhite winePersonally, I tried the French toast and pancakes, and the strawberry bellini. The French toast was good, not soggy, but could use a drop more sweetness to cut into the tart fruit atop it. Overall a solid 3.5/5 for me. The pancakes get a similar rating. They were good, and the fresh, tart peach slices baked into the batter were a nice surprise. The lemon butter added the perfect hint of flavor. They, likewise, could have been a bit sweeter. A part of the pancake was also a bit raw and doughy which took away a bit of the yum factor.Though I didn't try the other 3 dishes, they received good feedback from the other people at our table.The drinks were well-made and nothing was overly sweet or tasted artificial, which is probably their biggest plus.The biggest negative was that there is no AC inside. Though they have fans working, on a hot summer day, such as the pushing 90 degrees it was today, the cool air was lacking and it was definitely stuffy inside. It's a small space with cramped tables so they should truly consider getting better air flow and keeping the place well-cooled in the summer months. Our waitress was also meh. Nobody was rude, and most everyone else was quite pleasant and although she didn't do anything rude or wrong, she just wasn't super inviting or as pleasant as the others. Perhaps she was too hot inside, too. ‍Overall, the ambiance and food are good and serve as the perfect little brunch place if you're in the area and I'd return out of convenience of locale, but I wouldn't make a special trip to come back.","tldr: great food, poor treatment Our waitress was kind + attentive, but the host/manager was a little inconsiderate when one out of our five party members was running ten minutes late.The staff at the upscale restaurants I've been to have never acted this way - especially after the customer made it known it was their birthday celebration. Our meals were delicious but unfortunately I can't recommend going here since other restaurants in the area have better service, a similar price point, food that's just as tasty, and a shorter wait time.","Pros: unique menu, great food, clean space, authentically pleasing to the eye, reasonable prices Cons: service, they do not take reservations, tight space. Awful experience for my birthday brunch. Will not be returning even though the food was great. The manager (or host? Couldn't tell what his role was) was very rude and probably came to my table 3 times within 10-15 minutes, asking when my 5th of 5 guests was coming and that we could not place the rest of our orders (even though we had politely asked and been waiting about 25 minutes for a table we were starving) and then told me if my friend did not come soon we would be asked to get up and wait outside in HOT weather. Thankfully, my friend showed up shortly after but still even before she got there the worker asked me to place the order for my friend, but I explained I sent the menu to her but she had not made up her mind and she was around the corner... just trying not to get lost again. It was the day of the pride parade and all of our trains were delayed (mine you none of us were from the area but we traveled about an hour to try the place out) The last thing I needed was a worker who wouldn't stop nagging me!OH I ALSO FORGOT TO MENTION, they had a 20$ minimum per person (which was fine by us) but they very shadily upcharged it as 2 drinks, meanwhile the difference of what my friend ordered was 12$ short (8$ avocado toast) was charged additionally 18$ + the price of her toast. We asked our waitress to break this down for us but the same gentleman we were working with came by instead. He couldn't explain how he got to that number. We figured it was at least 2$ off but were so fed up we had to just get out of there!",Rose Water
313,"I've been to Skytown about a dozen times for brunch only on Saturday and Sunday. I enjoy coming here, it's always a good experience. The food is good. Plus it's a great deal - $15 Pre fixe includes a bloody mary, mimosa or any beer. I've literally had everything on the brunch menu and some of my favorites are the tacos, morning burger and egg sandwich. I like to add on a mimosa and drip coffee. The coffee is usually self serve at the bar and if you ask for almond milk they will provide it! There was only one instance where the coffee was terrible and they redid a new batch but it was still bad. They still get 5 stars for trying though!","I stick with the Salmon & potatoes with broccoli. Maybe because the lighting is so dim inside they weren't aware they left a sticker on the lemon. I mean, it's no big deal in my opinion but a few people I was eating with took issue with it  saying, ""For the price I'm paying if it's not edible it shouldn't be in my plate."" Personally, I found that my potatoes were soggy, which has never been an issue before. Nonetheless, I'd still go back if and when I'm craving salmon.",Very rude bartender as soon as I walked in asked for a menu she completely Ignored us and continued to stare like we interrupted her conversation. As we walked to a table to observe the menu she continued and to stare at us from the bar and roll her eyes. She has two pig tails. Her attitude made us feel very unwanted resulting in us finding a new location for dinner. Could've possibly been to us being of COLOR now that I'm reading other reviews smh. Please. Stop creating establishments in minority communities then treating US a certain type of way. Beware they are prejudice here,"Came on a stir day, the waitress on the floor is awesome, super friendly and attentive, I used to think that the service was slow here but she definitely changed my mind. Also - the salmon is good, try it out!",Stopped in on a Sunday around noon and got a table immediately. Boyfriend and I had two mimosas and I ordered the chicken and waffles while he had the French toast. The chicken was incredible - really crunchy and juicy. The waffle was thick and delicious. His French toast looked amazing and he took the whole plate down. The service was fast and friendly. Great local spot - can't go wrong.,"Came here a few weeks ago on a Saturday with friends for brunch. I got their black bean tacos, while my friends got other standard menu items off of their menu. All of their offerings are sold as part of a $15 pre-fixe offering, replete with an bloody mary or mimosa or beer, and fries or a salad, which is a pretty decent deal.My tacos were fine, as was my bloody mary. My friends all liked their food as well. Service was a little slow, but since we weren't in a huge rush, it wasn't a big deal for us. We had gone when it had first opened up for the day, so we had the entire place to ourselves for a good hour or so. If you're local to the area, this looks like it'd be a great place to do some work at during the day.",Skytown
314,"ME: delivery was about 2 hrs late, chicken entree was cold had to heat it up came with a side container of rice and 2 plantains that were also cold the chicken was not too tasty and had mostly unions and peppers, there were a few chunks of chicken but the majority was small tidbits of chicken not worth $19, the soup arrived boiling hot which has me believe the rest of the order must of been sitting there and the arepa de chocolo was cold and bland did not taste fresh, it had shredded cheese on it and it looked like more cheese was just put on top to make it look fresher, it arrived cold and upside down in the containerDelivery service: Please give me a moment while I contact the merchant.Me: we usually order from this place and food is usually delicious but this order along with the delay on delivery we are not happy with, there was a delivery issue with our last order to this  place the restaurant claimed they never received the order and I was charged and sent an email confirmation so delivery seems to be an issue with the restaurant.also the chicken entree says it comes with rice tostones and avocado, it only came with rice and tostones. there was another side container with rice and avacado but that came with the order of the Ajiaco soup.Delivery service:  the merchant states that they are unwilling to compensate you for this orderME: my only issue was the chicken entree and arepa and delivery latenessDelivery service: the merchant states that this order was confirmed with them at 8:49, they stated that this order took ten minutes to be received in their system so they stated that your order only took about an hr to completeMe: Order #: 25419562Placed: 9/29/2018 at 8:07 PMdelivery. com receipt states this.Delivery service: that's correctbut the merchant states that this order was made in an appropriate timeMe: order  was placed 8:07 they didn't look at the order till 8:4942 min in between my order being placed and the time they actually confirmed my order, what was happening during the 42 minthe order ticket must of just been sitting there and someone looked at it 42min laterThis is a transcript of my issue, the restaurant was unwilling to compensate for delivery lateness, food quality and why it took so 42 min to confirm the order. Anyway, the delivery service gave me a partial refund because the restaurant wouldn't budge, I wont order from this place based on the customer service and food quality and repeated delivery lateness. It used to be one of our go-to favorites in the neighboorhood but they just lost a long time customer because of this.","Their take-out menu has lower prices but they charge the eat-in menu prices which are significantly higher by $1-$2 more per item and they claim the take-out menu is old but they seem to have lots of them in front where folks are placing orders.  They also did not honor their Yelp offer for 2 free mini empanadas, claiming it was for eat-in only.  The mini-empanadas as literally smaller than child's pinky finger for $1 a piece.  Their Batidos or fruit shake taste like water with a little bland fruit flavor added.  This place is terrible and a rip-off, please avoid!","I came here with a couple of other friends per a friend's recommendation. As our group of 4 people walked into the restaurant, we immediately felt the lively and crowded atmosphere. We had to wait a while to get to one of the hosts to put our names down and give an estimate of how long it would be until a table opens up. They estimated 40 minutes and we decided to grab a drink at a nearby bar while waiting. When we came back, the table of 4 who was waiting ahead of us were just getting seated (we came back 50 minutes later). We were brought out menus on an iPad (which was a huge turnoff for most of us), and when we asked about the different dishes, the waiter wasn't very informative. We ended up each ordering a cocktail and a dish...and here is where the story really begins...To start off, I ordered a blackberry mojito. As the server brought it over my shoulder, he spilled the dark red drink onto my white blouse, and although I did say it was okay, it wasn't until one of my friends asked for something to get rid of the stain did the server/bartender offer a glass of club soda..that he proceeded to get 5 minutes after serving us our drinks. And while he wasn't very apologetic about the incident, I was hoping for the food to come quickly and lighten everyone's mood..The food was brought out by a different waiter who inevitably did not know who ordered what dish, and was just placed haphazardly in front of each person. We were all confused and trying to reorganize our dishes as best we could. His whole attitude seemed like he could not care less.Onto the quality of the food. While the appetizers (guacamole and chips and empanadas) did taste delicious along with the entrees--I ordered the coconut shrimp with rice and plantains, I did happen to find a hair in my food that did not belong to me or anyone else at the table. Tl;dr--if you want a restaurant with good quality food but one of the worst services that you could possibly get, go to this restaurant. I will unfortunately not be revisiting..may possibly consider take out.","Saw the menu and had to give it a try!!! I've actuallyBeen to Colombia before and the food was very authentic and phenomenally delicious! I highlyRecommend trying the table side guacamole served with fried plantain chips!!! Service was impeccable, also. Ask for their special sauces!!!$5 happy hour margaritas from 3-6pm.","Delicious, delicious, DELICIOUS! Every time I go the wait staff is fast and attentive! The food is perfect every single time and the portions are beyond fair for the price! It's a cute and cozy little restaurant that always has wonderful music playing! The perfect little spot to settle in with a group of friends and have great chat over PERFECT food!  We love Colombia In Park Slope!","Updating my review, The restaurant would not refund the $8 for these sorry looking slivers of fried dough. Grubhub did refund $5 for the trouble. What's funny is the restaurant manager said those empanadas they sent me are their regular size. HA HA! I dont think they looked at my photos, if they did I'm sure they'd be embarrassed. My husband is from Bogota Colombia, and he says the food at this place isn't authentic Colombian food. Save your $ and go to Queens",Colombia In Park Slope
315,"Went for dinner on a Sunday. The restaurant was pretty full but there was only 1 waitress on. While she was nice, she was distracted and missed taking all our orders before walking off. Our later orders were incomplete and my merguez platter didn't have any merguez sausage in it. What they call merguez looked suspiciously like an oblong burger, made of minced meat rather than spicy red sausages. I triple confirmed that this was indeed the merguez and she said that this is what merguez is at this restaurant. Apparently, kofta, to this restaurant, is comprised of thosse succulent spicy red sausages. Unless they were covering for a mistake, better order the kofta if you want merguez and vice versa.","We where extremely disappointed with the waitstaff at this restaurant. We ordered a side dish of whole wheat pita bread and falafel to go with our main meal. The waitress after asking us twice would we like our appetizers brought out first served everything together, which was not what we wanted, too add insult to injury after waiting an unusually lengthy time for our meals to begin with! She forgot the side of pita bread and charged us for it too!!! It truly was a shame. It was not our meals that left a bad taste in our mouths  but the inexperienced waitstaff. The food and I would have loved to tell friends and family about a new found ""Jem"" , but I will not take a chance with this waitstaff and possibly embarrass myself. The food is worth telling other about though... I would suggest Takeout :/ wonk wonk","Venturing out again into our new hood, we came upon Zaytoons. We're going to give them another chance so not going to write so much here. I'll just say that the first visit was very uneven.We had tasty lamb kebab and shawarma. But there was this annoying slightly sour sauce on top of everything. And there were some things that were obviously overcooked.Anywho, stay tuned for a future update. This one could go either way.","Cash only! Visit the ATM machine a few blocks down!My new go-to spot in the area! Based on all the reviews, this place looked super casual and unassuming, and reality exceeded all my modest expectations. We got a reservation for 7:30pm Wednesday night. The place was empty when we arrived. Indoor and outdoor seating available. Indoors felt a bit too casual and steamy for us, so we went around the corner, to the back of the restaurant, where they have an outdoor seating area, secluded from the public. Very peaceful and relaxing. Highly recommend in good weather! Service was courteous and swift, since there were barely any people to serve, so cannot complain on that front.Food was on point--everything we ordered was delicious, which was a total shocker. Small Hummus $6 and Small Baba ghanoush $6 were superb--so delicate, creamy, flavorful, and rich. Felt very indulgent. Would definitely eat it nonstop, especially with warm, freshly made flat bread that was good for leftovers for the following two days. Definitely try these spreads. The small size is enough for two people to share.Small Fasoulia $6 was served cold, which was a bit surprising, since I imagined it would do very well if warm. It was a medley of flat beans, garlic, onions, and sautéed tomatoes in a delicious gravy full of veggie juices. A new find for me, so I enjoyed this refreshing, hearty dish.Kibbeh $15 was another surprise for me that I would definitely order again. Four large 'meatballs' with a crunchy shell, stuffed with mixed lamb, beef, bulgur wheat, onions, and mixed nuts served with tabouleh and cucumber yogurt. Very delicious! Hearty, filling, full of flavor. Enjoyed the contrasting textures of crunchy, chewy, cold, warm, delicate, soothing. Tabouleh was delicious and plentiful too. Lovely dish.The prices are very reasonable--our dinner of four sumptuous dishes was around $43.Definitely will return to explore more menu items!",Love the food. We were frequent visitors to the smith street location for years. It is really a hassle and annoying that it is cash only. The bank machine in the restaurant charges 2.50 fee. This whole cash only thing is really much. What is the motivation behind it? I'm sure it drives many customers away.,"Zaytoons is a small but busy Mediterranean place not far from Prospect Park. Very reasonably priced, my friend and I spent $34 on dinner which included two wraps, hummus and a glass of wine. The hummus came out with a large fresh baked pita and was super flavorful. My falafel wrap was perfect-the patties were well seasoned and crisp and the tahini inside was super yummy. It was all cooked fresh and came out fast. Great service and a nice family restaurant vibe. Excellent food at a fair price. Highly recommend if you're craving Mediterranean and in the area.",Zaytoons
316,"Service was extremely poor. From the time of seating at the bar, to getting transferred to a table. Not one server seemed interested in taking an order, serving water, providing bread or recommendations. After finishing our drinks we were never offered another refill on cocktails. We had to remind the manager about to please check the status of our main course. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.","Really yummy food, no complaints. Just a bit pricey for what it is. I had the mushroom ravioli and was not disappointed - very pillowy and creamy!",I went to Aurora to get a pasta to go. It was delicious! Will literally go back for the food. Unfortunately like many other reviews the service was not up to par with the food so I can't give this place 5 stars. The hostess is there to Host and provide customer service. Unfortunately that was not my experience.,"Nice wine collection, knowledgeable friendly staff. The octopus was grilled to perfection, the gnochetti was delectable and the homemade pasta amazing . This place is a must if you want simple good Italian with great service.Couple friendly w nice atmosphere","A day in Brooklyn @ Aurora.Since it was a Sunday, we only had the pleasure of having the brunch menu.As an Italian restaurant, the pasta menu selection was much better than anything else - Rigatoni with Ragu sauce & squid ink pasta.They also had mostly Italian wines on the menu ....As for the service, the bus boys were very ""rushing"" ... almost throwing the dishes, not even making the room for us before serving the dishes. Should be clearing the empty plates first !!!!","My friend suggested we do Aurora for brunch on Sunday, so we made a reservation via OpenTable and headed over. Making a reservation was super easy and quick! We were able to be seated in their outdoor patio right when we arrived which was great. The patio is gorgeous and the whole place really has a straight out of Italy vibe to it. The ambience was very lax and this is a great place to have a date or go to brunch with friends. The food is superb! We started out with the pancetta appetizer. Which was great, however our service experience was not so great. It took our waiter almost 15 mins to acknowledge us. Once he finally did we decided that we would order everything at once to avoid the wait. Our appetizer arrived 20 mins later and at that point we didn't even have drinks- just the Lukewarm tap water. We waited over an hour for our main courses- to the point where our Waiter, who I believe his name was William(listed on receipt) asked us if we were Interested in dessert????? I was extremely disappointed because had he checked in on our table he would have realized we hadn't been served in over an hour- no drink refills-nothing. Out of frustration , we spoke to the manager Stefano who was very courteous and made sure we were taken care of for the rest of our time there. However our waiter never apologized nor did he make an effort to try to mend the experience for us.

317,"Worst ""fine dining"" experience. Everything is bland and inconsistent. I don't even know how they have a Michelin Star. On top of that the head chef is a narcissist and not a people person. A plain and simple ASSHOLE. He yells at his staff constantly and it can be seen during service.","Meadowsweet: a hidden gem in Brooklyn!Recommendations:1. Spiced duck breast2. cavatelli & braised duck ragu 3. Smoked St. Louis ribs4. Squid ink fettuccine, chorizo & rock shrimp5. tajarin & truffle","Came here for brunch over the weekend with some friends. We had noon reservations and our party of 5 was seated promptly. Chorizo HashTwo eggs with some chorizo and potatoes with green sauce. It was tasty bc the chorizo had a bit of a kick to it. But the assembly wasn't anything impressive. It's basically chopped chorizo and potatoes with an egg over green sauce on top. I was expecting more chorizo and hash in one. Its prob less effort to just throw chorizo and potatoes together with an egg on top than if u were to truly make a chorizo hash. Wasn't impressed. Chicken SandoHubster had the chicken Sando and he thought it was average. It was a little too heavily breaded for him. He had better. Donuts We shared the donuts which are chocolate and cinnamon flavored donut holes with a sauce. That was decent. Again nothing special. Service When we walked in it was confusing to figure out who to tell we had reservations. There were a bunch of staff behind the counter all conversing so we thought we had to walk further in to tell somebody but as we did, someone finally approached us to ask if we had reservations. When we told them we had ressies, she wouldn't seat us til the entire party arrived. This is something that bothers me bc if the restaurant isn't super busy, why can't I be seated comfortably so that I can order something to drink. I HATE being forced to sit at the bar when I don't want to order an alcoholic drink. Food took quite some time to arrive as well. Would I come back? Probably not.",soooooo good. best place to eat in brooklyn for brunch or for a night out,"The Sun - Thurs Price Fixe is amazing and belt loosin'A great experience, from food to service.","Had an absolutely fantastic bachelors weekend brunch here.

318,Got soggy fries.Did not enjoy.Fish burger was gross and had to throw it away. Way to fishy ! The bun was the best part of the meal. A sad story for sure. Was surprised how bad this take out was,"I've only ever ordered delivery from 212 and wouldn't normally leave a Yelp review for a place I haven't physically visited if not for the disturbing behavior of their delivery person.  With all four orders I've gotten these last two months, the same man has delivered and has given me scathing looks and scowls each time. He doesn't respond to greetings or thank you, which honestly doesn't bother me that much; I'm not looking for a new friend. However, when the same person consistently comes to your apartment with a surprising level of disdain clearly written on their face and refuses to speak despite how cordial you are, you can't help but feel a little unsettled.  I have to admit that the burgers absolutely live up to the hype. They travel surprisingly well and have great flavor. I always said that if I'm ever in the neighborhood I'd stop by to enjoy one in person. That said, the delivery experience has left a very bad taste in my mouth and, right or wrong, it's tainted my opinion of the place.For those whose first introduction to a restaurant is through delivery, the delivery person becomes the face of the brand. Especially if they're a recurring figure. It's disappointing that, in my experience, it was such a hateful face.","Disappointed all the reviews said the fries and wings were great. Wings were gross, really fatty and sauce wasn't good (buff or the hidden valley blue cheese they give you). Fries are frozen for sure. Def not fresh cut. Threw away the meal cannot believe this place is so highly rated. Should have ordered my go-to Thai.","I've ordered from 212 burger several times on seamless, they're always on time and the food is always in great condition. The burgers themselves are delicious and filling.  My entire family always enjoys them. It's great to have a good burger spot right in the neighborhood and I'm looking forward to visiting the new location in the near future.","They were delicious at the prior location, and have not skipped a beat at the new location. We often get the lettuce wrap, and it is perfectly wrapped. Always precisely cooked to medium well, thanks!! PLEASE put up a sign!

Burgers. Wings. Salads. Sides (mostly a variety of fries...) and Milkshakes.  Note - this spot is basically a window in a kitchen.  You order, and then go take a walk for 15 minutes or so while it all cooks up.  Having it so close to the park is awesome though - picnic with your fam or friends?  Pick up some burgers and friiiiies. We opted to keep it classic with some burgers and fries and gosh were they good.  My own consisted of a Beef Burger + good ol' American cheese + lettuce, pickle, ketchup and mustard on a Brioche bun ($9).*  First impressions?  This burger was big!  The menu says all burgers are 1/2lb but this babe felt bigger, which I was totally OK with.  Cooked exactly how I asked, seasoned well - it was super juicy, proportioned right (meat-to-bun ratio) and oh so melty with that american cheese. Other topping offerings include swiss, cheddar, tomato, onion, mushrooms, avocado, a fried egg, turkey bacon, siracha, garlic mayo, etc.Hubs and I also shared an order of cajun fries.  These fries... are so darn good.  The order is decent in size and you can def. share them... but next time I'll get my own.  Give me alllll the cajun fries!Yup - this place is awesome.

We took a nice stroll down the long bridge, took scenic pictures like classic tourists, and made our way down to this foodie event. We tried a variety of food.

Everything was fantastic. It's also the reason I began attending the Smorgasburg events in Los Angeles.","The experience at Smorsgasburg comes from walking through all the diverse food vendors and trying to find something that catches your eye. There are some interesting choices like lobster nachos or ramen burgers, and more traditional choices like fried chicken and baos. Although the food here is a bit overpriced, the options are plentiful and you'll certainly find something you like.I tried the yakisoba Japanese pancake ($16), the lobster nachos ($15), and the baos ($9 each, pork belly is the best). As you can see, the prices are a bit high! These are restaurant level prices for not so restaurant worthy food. Fortunately, each vendor I tried was pretty good. I'd recommend the Japanese pancake if you want something that's more filling, and would recommend avoiding the baos as you can find these in tons of restaurants for much cheaper.Overall, Smorsgasburg is a nice experience that you should try at least once. There are a ton of different options that you're bound to try something new, which is the Smorsgasburg experience. Now the hard part is choosing what you want when everything looks so good...P.S. it's pretty crowded so be prepared to have a hard time finding a place to sit and eat.","One of my favorite food experiences of the year; Smorgasburg more than lives up to the hype. With dozens of vendors on site, theres literally something for everyone. While here, I was able to try the infamous mac and cheese doughnut, the fried dough balls from Petisco, the famous mozz sticks from Big Mozz, perfectly grilled skewer of Shrimp, a Japanese style pancake, an ice cream sandwich as well as a delicious egg sandwich from another newer vendor, Crack'd. Everything was outstanding, while the egg sandwich and fried dough balls were a personal highlight. Will return on my very next time in Brooklyn.",Williamsburg Smorgasburg - Saturday
320,AskaAbbreviated Dining Room Menu:Favorite:1.HAKE2.LICHEN3.BEEF: 120-day dry aged rib eye4.VENDACE ROE5.MIGNARDISESA restaurant only serves approximately 10 tables per night.First time to see the bread comes with pork fat.,"We did the 12 course menu as we had a party of 6, and thus were in the private rolls in the backAs others have said, the food is incredibly inventive, delicious, and unique. It was a great culinary experience.My rating though is based on two things:-Our meal took FOREVER - literally four and a half hours. We weren't actually waiting that long between any particular course, it's just an incredibly long drawn out experience, so be prepared.-The presentation and overall style of the restaurant is the height of pretension - talking about choosing wine as if it's supposed to be a transcendental spiritual experience, or describing how you picked the kolrabhi off a tree in a Williamsburg neighborhood garden down the block. The opposite of unpretentious, good food presented simplyIt was a unique and worthwhile experience, but not one that left me wanting to come back, at least not unless I have another 5 hours to kill",This was my first tasting menu... Every dish was so carefully put together. I tasted flavors that I've never dreamed of! The staff and atmosphere really made it a memorable experience. Worth it.,"Loved almost every single bite I had here. Other than gravlax and IKEA meatballs, I'd never had Scandinavian cuisine before, so this was certainly an amazing introduction. Out of the tasting menu the courses that stick out most in my mind even a month later as I'm writing this are the bladderwrack (laugh at the name but it's a delicious seaweed chip) and the lobster brain/claw/tail combination. But I could just as easily rave over the potato pancake, or the beer bread (the ""correct"" description is Manitoba loaves leavened with IPA, but let's be real, it's just beer bread) accompanied by butter and whipped pork lard, or the savoury af quail and black truffle dish. I loved it all! Even the ones that weren't my personal favourites - razor clams, osetra caviar and peas, hake - were still beautiful in both taste and presentation. My table's least liked course by far was the blackberry tart that was the first dessert - there was something about it that straight up tasted rancid and bitter, and most of us couldn't finish our tarts, small as they already were. But the other two desserts were incredible - toasted hay ice cream with meadowsweet-filled aebleskiver, and a piece of bark with several candies on top. Probably the only time in my life I'll try something as interesting as their blood truffle. If you come, I HIGHLY recommend the juice pairing! It's definitely unique - how many high-end juice pairings have you come across in your life? - and I couldn't pass up the chance. Our selection came with ones like Douglas fir, rhubarb soda with rose vinaigrette, huckleberry spruce, bronze fennel blossom, etc. I didn't like all of them but absolutely don't regret such a one-of-a-kind experience like that. If you opt for alcohol instead, don't sleep on their many choices of aquavit. Service is impeccable, as to be expected. There's also a lovely garden in the back and a basement bar downstairs - the space is unexpectedly large. And don't worry if you don't catch or understand some of the waiters when they explain the courses - you'll get a take home menu at the end.I'll absolutely be back to try their winter menu!","KenScale: 9.0/10The last time I visited Aska with my wife Jun (who was still my girlfriend then) a couple of years ago in the winter, there was snow blizzard on our way to the restaurant. We were heading over to Williamsburg from downtown Manhattan so obvious the ride wasn't quite pleasant, but I was very glad we ended up making the trip anyway as the meal that we shared was one of the best we had had together. In the quest (starting this year) to find restaurants that we would plan to go more than just once, I thought of Aska as one of the strong candidates. Of course, the tasting menu price at $265 per person (to be secured by $95 non-refundable deposit on Tock website) doesn't make the restaurant a place to visit every day, but if the menu changes on a seasonal basis, I figured it could be one of those places that Jun and I can go three to four times a year (just like I recently designated Atomix as one such place on the KenScale All Star list). I'm happy to report that our second meal at Aska was just as memorable and I'm ready to give the KenScale All Star badge to the restaurant.The tasting menu at Aska has certainly gone up in price (last time I had the 10-course tasting at the restaurant, it was $145 per person), but it was clear that chef Fredrik Berselius's kitchen doesn't settle or play safe even after the restaurant has gained accolades left and right. The plating, starting from the opening bladderwrak with blue mussel emulsion, and ending with the petit fours of ""mignardises"", was just as thoughtful as last time, and the addition to flowers here and there greatly enhanced the visual appeal as well. If I wake up with a bite of potato cake with roe smoked in dried carrot tops and elderflower every morning, I will certainly start my day a much happier person. The razor clam with tiny slices of preserved black pine and cucumber was one fine piece of work, and the textural contrast between the caviar from Poland and the dried cabbage submerged in the sauce made from fermented asparagus juice was quite outstanding as well. You don't often see the tiny brain part of langoustine used in a restaurant, but that's what the kitchen sent out, alongside the tail and claw meat; Jun thought the brain was a little too buttery but I liked its rich flavor. Following another outstanding dish of grilled onion and scallop and the warm Manitoba bread accompanied by butter and whipped pork fat came my best dish of the night, a perfectly poached hake with sunchoke; I was astounded by the silky smooth texture of the fish that was melting in my mouth and contrasted very well with the sunchoke's texture. I don't usually get quail for a meat dish because it doesn't have the same satisfaction in texture that other types of poultry provide, but I had no compliant about the roasted bird (with a rather intimidating display of feet) with summer truffle. After the end of the savory dishes, the black currant tart with fresh cheese served as a nice palate cleanser before we moved to ice cream made from toasted hay and summer flowers that was quite a treat to end the meal.Because getting a reservation at Aska requires the non-refundable deposit mentioned above and the restaurant is still quite popular among fine dining aficionados in the city, I would highly recommend advance planning to secure your table. There is full bar with rather esoteric list of wines (we really enjoyed a pinot noir from Oregon outside of the famed Willamette Valley that developed quite nicely in the air over the course of our meal) from lesser-known regions of the world. It was almost two and a half years ago that Jun and I had visited Aska, so we were greatly surprised by the greeting from our server who noted our previous visit; even chef Fredrik who we had taken photos together last time came by to say hi. I couldn't be sure if anyone working at the restaurant remembered us (even though we were probably the only people that still made it to the restaurant despite the horrible weather outside last time), but the extra gesture of hospitality certainly helped with my impression of Aska even more. As we headed out of the restaurant, Jun and I promised our server that we will be back sometime in November. And we certainly will.","KenScale: 9.0/10When I visited the original Aska at an unassuming dining space inside Williamsburg's Kinfolk Studio several years ago, I instantly knew I would love this restaurant. At that time, I had yet to get enough exposure to the taste of Scandinavian cuisine that stresses freshness of ingredients, clean flavor and minimalistic aesthetics, so the dining experience at Aska was certainly an revelation. When chef Fredrick Berselius decided to close shop about a couple of years ago, I was therefore devastated. Thankfully, chef Berselius promised to come back in a new location, but the new opening of Aska 2.0 has been delayed for a long time until it finally happened last summer. I've been yearning to visit this new location in southern side of Williamsburg to see how it has evolved. On my recent Saturday visit, my girlfriend and I had to brave through the heavy snow, coming all the way from Manhattan. Was it worth all the trouble? Absolutely! I'm so glad that Aska has come back, even better than its original form.On my first visit, I was pleasantly surprised by the use of novel ingredients and techniques inspired by the nature of the Scandinavian region. Compared to the original location, I would say Aska 2.0 has matured tremendously and turned into an awesome dining destination in the city. Compared to the tasting menu that never passed $100 per person in the original location, the new Aska offers two pricier options (19-course option for $215 per person and 10-course option for $145 per person), but I wasn't complaining. If the first Aska was a nice introductory course to Scandinavian cuisine, the new location is an advanced graduate studies course, with so much more technical sophistication and boldness in experimentation. Every dish stands out on its own. Maine oyster was a nice start to the meal, and the next dish of grilled onion and Finnish caviar looked deceptive simple but so marvelous in the complexity of flavor that I was desperately scooping for the leftover caviar to make sure that I have it all. The ""lichen"" dish consisting of chanterelle mushroom and preserved pine shoots was another beauty, with rich, aromatic broth from mushroom seasoned with chanterelle vinegar that was simply wonderful. I've had outstanding beef dishes last year, but I don't know if any of them can top the 120-day dry aged ribeye accompanied by preserved black currant and salted plum. The ribeye was more or less perfect in its juicy, tender state, and the seasoning was toned down just to my liking so that I can savor every single bite of this astounding piece of meat. Desserts certainly didn't lag behind either in terms of creativity of the kitchen. Fermented blueberries and milk sorbet made for a nice combination to clean my palate, but I can't stop thinking about the one that came after, a bowl of birchwood ice cream accompanied by caramelized pine mushrooms. The clean, delightful flavor of the dish was such a joy to savor that I would love to get a taste of it at least once every week. We finished our meal with two delicious bites of chocolate ""truffles"" inside a little bowl that looks like a bird nest and finally woke up from this blissful meal.Aska requires advance reservations by purchasing tickets through Tock, so plan ahead and purchase these tickets. Unlike the casual vibe of Kinfolk Studio that is flowing with artists and local Brooklynite hipsters during daytime, the dining space at Aska 2.0 has seemed to matured as well, with minimalistic Scandinavian vibe with an air of tranquility and serenity that I found a lot to like, especially for a dinner date with my girlfriend. I didn't see any cocktail menus, but there are a lot of carefully sourced wine and beer selections (make sure to start your meal with a glass of aquavit, and Aska has a bunch of house aquavit selections too). I'm glad that Aska has made this glorious comeback. Chef Berselius (who graciously agreed to take post-dinner photos with me and my girlfriend) really knows how to push the boundaries in his culinary vision that is inspired by nature of Scandinavia. I would love to come back soon!",Aska
321,"5 star service, 2 star food. I had seen and heard raving reviews of this place so I was excited to come here for dinner with a few of my girlfriends yesterday night. From the beginning, the service was impeccable. They were extremely understanding about moving our reservation a half hour later and were always there when when had a question or needed something. They even went to the cellar to get a bottle of white wine that my party wanted to drink unchilled.Unfortunately the food was not on par with the service. We started with the raw scallops which I found to be extremely fishy and flavorless. Next was the shrimp, which was flavorless and fishy as well. I found both to be unpleasant to eat. The crispy potatoes were the best dish of the night but.. how hard is it to mess up potatoes? We got a pasta dish as well which was fine but nothing to write home about. My biggest disappointment however was the frangipane tart. It was tough and the outer crust was burnt. You know that a dessert isn't good when 4 girls end up leaving some behind after a light dinner. The ambiance, service and wine was good but I doubt I would be back as I don't live in Brooklyn. My recommendation is to skip the food and stick to wine if you do go.","Probably a place just for a glass of wine or two, with a snack. We made a mistake of ordering food and it almost bankrupted me! Three tiny plates with the cheapest beer and 1 glass of the cheapest red wine left me with an empty stomach and $150 out of my pocket.",Razor clams small flavorless. My sister in law cooks them better. Raw scallops not good either.,"I tell no lies when I say this is my actual favorite restaurant. One time I had a pea dish here so good that it made me cry. Twice.The menu is rotating, but you can't go wrong with the staples: bread and butter, raw scallops, steak tartare.The servers here are the most knowledgeable and friendly wine-os I've ever encountered.Their weekend lunch coursed meal is the crown on the very obviously king that is this restaurant. I've been here about 15 times and each time the flavors remain delicious and consistent. Keep doing what you're doing, Four Horsemen, and I will forever be your longing admirer.","Went to The Four Horsemen for dinner on Saturday night. A lively wine bar with good wine, solid food, and excellent music.Quality: Decided to share some wine and small plates for dinner. As we waited for a seat we ordered a nice red off the last call area of the menu. The wine list is long, but we felt confident in something that clearly caught the interest of others. Once we sat we focused in on the appetizers and raw dishes. We started with the flavorful Chicken Liver Mousse. Served with light crackers, it was a solid dish. Next came the Warm House Bread, which was tremendous. I am usually skeptical of bread that does not come complimentary, but it was so good we got a second order. Last was the Beef Tartare, which I was not crazy about. The texture was strange with the addition of seeds and I also did not like the sesame seed crackers it came with. However, it seemed like a hit as it sat in front of nearly everyone at the bar.Quantity: We stuck with starters and raw dishes, which are understandably smaller, but they also have full plates.Value: $12 for the Chicken Liver Mousse. $7 for the Warm House Bread. $16 for the Beef Tartare. Wines start at around $40.Ambiance: The Four Horsemen is located in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg. The wine bar is a small and simple space. A few stools along the front window, a tiny square bar towards the center of the space, and then a collection of tables in the back. Throughout the space are additional pockets where guests waiting for a table can lean and put down their drinks. The music is great, which should not be too surprising considering James Murphy's involvement with the bar, but it will be played loud. This is not a wine bar for quiet conversation.Crowd: It is not a large space and it fills up quick. When we arrived we were told a twenty minute wait, which was pretty accurate. Be warned, as it is a wine bar, people tend to linger and the wait may be underestimated.Service: Appreciated that the staff took care of those waiting for a seat. We were offered drinks and food while still standing.Parking: Limited street parking throughout the area.","went for a friend's birthday. said friend frequents the place so they let him bring 2 bottles to start. made room for 12-person reservation.menu printed with friend's name and date so it felt really special.  accommodated last-minute dietary restrictions (gluten, fennel, hazelnuts) and made special prix fixe menu with other restrictions (pescatarian, shellfish allergy). waitresses accommodated and spread the word to other waitresses when I requested that they redistribute food to our end of the table instead of clearing and discarding food from other side. food too delicious to throw out! see pictured menu. everything DELICIOUS (except no review for crackers and wild nettle malfatti pasta, because gluten but others said it was also delectable)",The Four Horsemen
322,"I was visiting friends who lived a few blocks away, and several of us decided to get take-out from Momo Ramen.  It was pretty obvious just looking at their name what we'd want. Okay, that's not quite true, as I saw they had kimchi listed in the salads section, something that pleased me. I had some problems trying to order online off my phone, because the link I followed kept displaying ""Restaurant is closed"" at the bottom of my screen, for no obvious reason. But someone else (a local who orders from them often) had no problem and took the reins. The food was delivered very quickly for a Friday evening.I was probably less satisfied with part of my order than the others, but they all enjoyed everything, so it was indeed a solid 4-star overall. The kimchi was fine, but I would have been okay with it being even a little spicier. I had some problems with the pork and chive dumplings. About half of them fell apart as I attempted to pick them up with the accompanying plastic fork, and the meat was a bit dry. But that was as ""bad"" as it got, no real problems, and in general it was an enjoyable meal.I believe there is also a Yelp discount for a check-in here.","Rudest delivery service I've ever had. They didn't have something and instead of letting me know, canceled part of my order. I called them and when I tried to order something else he cut me off and hung up. I called back and they didn't answer. I couldn't cancel on my end so decided to keep it.About 20 mins later they called to tell me they had to cancel part of my order and asked if I still wanted it. When I said yes but I wanted to order something else, she said no and just hung up on me again!",Came here for lunch with the boyfriend while looking at apartments in Park Slope. My boyfriend got the momo ramen and I got the cold sesame noodle. The cold sesame noodle was pretty greasy and VERY salty at the bottom.,"Excellent Ramen. One of the best I've had in NYC. I came at a good time on a Wednesday night. Very few people were seated. The broth was almost like Chinese broth, but very rich. It's quite spicy, but still excellent. Before I knew it, I had finished the whole thing. All the ingredients were great.Service was great and price is average for ramen ~$18 including tax and tip.","Mo-Momos Mo-Ramens. I keep coming back for the noodle soups at this Park Slope spot as it has the taste, dependability and unique selection that warrants a following. My personal noodle soup of choice arguably leans less noodle and more dumplings. It's Tibetan Then-Thuk with chunks of carby noodles the perfect size to get a bite in every spoonful of the sweet and sour soup base. My friends' have gotten the tonkatsu and momo ramens before and they seem perfectly pleased to come here again time after time. No, it's not the spot that I'll pull someone out of Manhattan to try to even suggest for a visiting friend, but it IS the kind of place I'll come back to again and again with no complaints and sometimes that's all you need if a restaurant. I hope others in the neighborhood encounter Momo Ramen and give some atypical Tibetan flavors a go because it's certainly worth experiencing.","I loved this place. The soup dumplings were perfect! I also highly recommend the dan dan ramen. Great flavor and the noodles were really fresh.Laidback vibe, good food, great location near other bars for drinks after.

I bought tickets to the 2nd Annual Clambake. The food was AWFUL!!! I don't know how they made it past the 1st annual event.  The seafood in the bake had NOT 1 drop of seasoning. It came with 1 piece of calamari, 2 clams, 5 mussels, 2 shrimps, 2 crab claws(not the cluster), 1 small piece of corn and 2 half golf size potatoes. All the seafood was overly cooked & rubbery. There was no dipping sauce. It was dry &  bland. They small plate we received we couldn't even bare to eat it. They literally put everything in a pot of plain water & over boiled them. Yuck!","Ate here at 630 on a Thursday night - it was pretty close to the train, easy for my parents to find parking, interesting neighborhood with lots of graffiti art and other cute places to eat and shop.

The cucumber cocktail was super refreshing for a summer evening. Can't wait to come back here for brunch!","My boyfriend and I had been planning to come here for at least a year. It was near our apartment, looked inviting, and I'm a huge cider fan. When we finally visited back in late July the experience was such a positive one, we hated that we hadn't gone any sooner.We were lucky to have great weather so patio seating was a pleasant surprise. There was a live performer setting a  beautiful mood, and the cider options were unique and vast. We ordered a small nacho starter and a cider flight each. It was reasonably priced, and the waiter was well versed on the options. The ciders were amazing! Each had it's own unique flavor and the nachos were so great, we were sad to have made dinner plans! We closed out with a 3rd flight that we shared which featured a reordered pair of favorites and a couple of ciders we both hadn't tried in our first run.This place would be a solid 5, but the outdoor space welcomed dogs. I am a dog lover and owner, but the dogs were FRENZIED! The activity had them all barking and jumping and the spectacle and noise of it all just took away from the perfect ambience of the vibe and space itself. Strong 4.5, but it's such a GREAT establishment, I don't know that it needs the added bonus of being pet-friendly? ‍","huge space; they have an outdoor patio, a front room, back dining area and a private event room.  there's also an area that house 6 large barrels of cidre. food was good and price points were affordable. we didn't order the prix fixe because we thought a la carts had more interesting options. we ordered: 28 oz steak; rarekorean wingsjamon croquetas bahn mi burger; med rarecidre flight Steak: cooked perfectly. this is enough to share between two people if there are sides and you're both not starving. korean wings (3 drummettes, 3 wing pieces) the crust was thicker than any korean wings i've ever had. there was additional crunch on the outside, the wings were cooked well, but wasn't exactly what i expected. jamon croquetas (3 pieces): crunchy and creamy, but for some reason tasted a bit bland. bahn mi burger: rather small for the price and over cooked. instead of medium rare, i got a mix between medium and well done. flavor was good though. probably the least worthwhile item we ordered. cidre flight; we've been to san sebastián and i already know basque cidre is not my thing. the bone dry one tasted like seltzer, the limited edition one was sour and the half sour tasted like a diluted version of american cidre. the acoustics in the dining hall are not great; it gets super loud and it's full of very loud hipster types. server didn't seem to know which table ordered what so i saw plates go to every table until someone claimed their dishes. also didn't get utensils and had to ask a few times. however, the entire staff was super friendly, albeit a bit disorganized.",Brooklyn Cider House
324,"Greasy, overpriced and the chef of this spot is a Trump supporter and an asshole . Fuck this place!",Got food poisoning from the beef taco out back!! Literally knocked me out for a day a half. You'd think a $6 taco would taste good and not make you sick...how wrong I was...,"The food was amazing! Please have the chicken and pork belly tacos. (But as of winter, they no longer do pork belly) but I definitely advice you to try all of them. The bartender though... unprofessional, unhappy, and does not know recipes. I wish I could've given this place five stars but the bar experience was horrible. He did not not sweeten the margarita and did not put any when I asked him to add sweetener. (He refused) He rolled his eyes but obviously he does not know the ingredients for a margarita. He made it VERY salty and bitter. Although the drinks were bad, the food somehow made up for the experience. Compliments to the chef(s)","Tacos truck + bar. Love this combo. Sat nite, in the neighborhood and found this place on yelp so decide to check it out. And it was worth it. Taco truck is outside back of the bar with a nice seating area. They have good selection of tacos and their prices were great for the portion size. 1st order: fish, carnitas and duck.2nd order: Chorizo, pulled pork, fish and smoke beef. They have lots of sauces to add on as well. Fish taco, super crispy batter fish7 amazing tacos +chips and salsa was about 40.Will come back for happy hour.","Such a unique and fun eatery hiding in Clinton Hill -- a permanent food truck patio!Went with my sister on a Friday night and there was only a teeny corner of a bar counter to stand at. There are a good amount of picnic tables, but it's a really teeny space. One of the few bummers of this awesome place.I had two carnitas tacos and my sister had two chicken tacos ($4 each). Both were delicious, fresh, and dripping in sauce. Yuuum! Two was plenty for each of us and we couldn't even eat all of our chips and salsa! We passed on the drinks this time but they have a great selection (frozen margs!!!) that I will definitely check out next time. And there will definitely be a next time -- my new fave neighborhood tacos!","Love this place! So unassuming, but the food is great and the vibes are wonderful! It's a bar with a truck out back serving taco truck goodness. Drinks are strong and it's a chill vibe with good music. They've also got happy hour! Will be back, great neighborhood gem!",Chilo's
325,"5 stars for the doubles, 3 stars for the patties. So guess I average to a 4. Nice spot!","My friend told me about this place, so I decided to check it out. There is only standing room and the lines are somewhat disorganized. For that, I am subtracting one star. Aside from that, the food is delicious and to die for. It was just a bit confusing to me because I didn't know where the order or pick-up lines were.",Doubles with tamarind sauce and slight pepper only $1.50. There is a line but worth the wait! Next time I want to try the roti,Will always be a customer!!! Hands down the best currants rolls I've ever had. The wait was worth it  anything you get from this place is yum!!!,"This is the spot in Crown Heights on the weekends and even some week days but expect a healthy line any Saturday in the year. Totally worth the wait for some Trini and or Trini Chinese delights. If you are looking for doubles, fresh patties both the Jamaican and Trini style, roti, fresh bread, coconut rolls, or lo mein and wonton soup you can get it here fresh and hot. I usually come for the doubles which usually come stuffed with chickpeas and spices with tamarind and pepper on a fluffy skin. Lately, I've been trying more of the Chinese food-- items. One day I came in for the vegetable lo mein after a mean craving and got a huge pan of hot noodles and fresh crunchy vegetables. It was plenty of food and lasted for three meals. So good!The last time I went I ordered the wonton soup and again was pleasantly surprised to get a large container of fresh crunchy green Chinese broccoli and soft wonton noodles. The broth was light and it was perfect for the cold December day.It's family owned and run and the owner is really nice and you can see him usually behind the counter. The last time I was there he introduced me to the Trini version of a patty. It was smaller, light colored, flaky and the meat was spicy but flavorful. You could taste hints of cumin. Delicious and I'll be picking some up when I go in again, probably sometime this week! An institution in Crown Heights definitely worth the visit and the wait. Don't let the line intimidate you, it moves fast and bring cash!",I love this place.  The fried wontons are like crack & the lo mein is off the chain. I usually eat it fir days and still have some to chuck. Yummers,Trinidad Golden Place Restaurant
326,"Didn't actually get to eat here because we had one drink and waited over an hour...and the food never came. Heard so much great stuff and my boyfriend eats lunch here (on week days) all the time. Came here for brunch on Sunday and was met with very rude and awkward behavior from the blonde waitress with short hair. I tried to be positive, smiled and be polite..hoping you can kill that negativity with kindness. Nope. The other waitress was nicer albeit clueless. They seem really overwhelmed even though the place wasn't even at half capacity. After the one hour mark, I was tired and hangry. No one had bothered to ask us if we wanted another drink or let us know the food was coming, so I asked for the check. The rude waitress actually had the audacity to ask me if I wanted to take the food to go. I bluntly said no and was no longer smiling. Then she decided to explain that the kitchen is overwhelmed and that the food orders are backed up. I just cut her off and asked for the check again. I almost told her how I actually felt, which was: great, but that is not my problem. Why are you even telling me this? Your restaurant is half empty and you can't fulfill your orders? Why would I want my food to go? Is it even made? Where is it? And where would I eat it? Can't you see that I no longer want to spend my money or time here? Truly unacceptable how she tried to rationalize their mistakes (obnoxiously) instead of taking any ownership. Also, drinks are sugary and weak. I'm really hesitant to come back.",I was a fan. Not anymore. The brunch experience was ruined by having to listen to Taylor Swift playlist for 2 hours!! Complain was ignored... come on Bushwick!,"As a native Brooklynite I try hard to steer far away from pretentious Bushwick establishments. It makes my skin crawl. The concept of some Bland Boy(s) from a flyover state who moves to Brooklyn to become cool and hopes to never have to deal with Black or Brown folks- is the formula for the past ten years. Add the attempt at Carribean cuisine- key word- attempt and I know some great places, and Sally Roots lived up to all my expectations.Sally Roots is like trying to palm a wide flat ass.Staff that sucks- shoutout to the floor manager  that made my friends move from the table although they were buying drinks.Thanks to the inept waitress who dropped a bottle of 'sparkling wine' down but took another fifteen minutes to bring the glass.The kitchen obviously has a timing and firing issue.A close to an hour long wait for food.The waitress spent more time establishing rules and boundaries than actually taking an order.The bartenders ignore you.The floor manager is a jerk. Let's also address the elephant in a room- in the hospitality industry Black patrons are treated poorly because to provide service to Black people is below the hierarchy.Thank you Sally Roots for being a pompous establishment with subpar food, gross service all wrapped in a hipster bow.If you want good Caribbean food- you won't find it there. However, hipsters fear being patrons to Carribean establishments owned by Black folks- they may actually like the food.To the Sally Roots staff, I wish an eternity of subletting bed bug apartment and never catching your big break!Biggup!",This spot is a gem in bushwick.I went with a friend and we shared the chicken entree and Mac & cheese. Both were amazing. More than enough food to share and leave full and happy. We've also been for drinks on multiple occasions and the bartenders always make it a great time with AMAZING cocktails.,"This place is pretty solid, the staff are a little slow but if ur not in a rush and ur chilling this is a good spot. The jerk chicken is fairly good, the portions are great tho. 4 stars because they have a great non alcoholic drinks section which is rare for a lotta places Worth checking out if ur in the neighbourhood.","Gorgeous backyard, hearty food, and great service! There isn't much more you could ask for. Oh, the cocktails are great, too. Had brunch here as a party of 4. Came around 12:30 on a Saturday. They won't seat you without your entire party. We had a table in the backyard as it was a beautiful day. I had the pork belly and brussel sprout hash and it was delicious. I had a bite of the brisket and biscuits; that was phenomenal. So much umami. I love the pepper sauce they have on the table. Would go back!",Sally Roots
327,Brunch was incredible. Service was attentive and very polite. We had an omelette and the French toast and we will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.,"Our brunch was good but we wouldnt go back.Let's start with the positives: The food was good. I wasnt in the mood for brunch so I ordered the cioppino and my husband got the steak and eggs. The cioppino was very good, super flavorful and large. The steak was cooked well, a little plain but still well cooked. The food as a whole really wasnt our issue. Onto the things we werent so happy with: The coffee was HORRIBLE. They have Stumptown coffee (one of my FAVES) in little french presses. It was horrible. There wasnt enough coffee in the press and it was seriously GROSS. And for brunch one of the main things you want is good coffee. I was so disappointed. The service was pretty bad. There was one waiter for the whole (not overly large) restaurant and he obviously was trying, but it was just too much for him. We had to sit next to a table (for 6) of dirty dishes for our entire meal because he didnt clean the table. He was just running around all over the  place doing everything (and not well) so all the little details you love to see in a small neighborhood restaurant were just missing. If service isnt that important to you and you're looking for a decent meal in the area feel free to give it a shot.","We live just a four minute walk away and have passed this place hundreds of times. We have always wanted to try it, but it's always been empty so we were reluctant. The atmosphere is quite quaint and sea themed. Loved the cute cups on the tables. Price is right for the entrees. However, the glassware was dirty and table wasn't clean. Little hairs in the milk and grime on the French press. That's fine I guess..maybe it's part of the theme? Whatever. This wasn't the worst part of our experience. I got the crab Benedict. The eggs weren't runny like they should be and cooked through solid. The crab cakes were pretty good, not the best.  Our food was dry, under seasoned, and cold. Add some salt!  I didn't eat my side and let the waiter know that it was particularly cold. All he said was ""okay"" then walked away quickly and did not apologize or offer to fix it. Then he brought us the check. Very very rude. I wasn't looking for a discount, which I probably should have received, but more of an apology or offer to warm the potatoes. This is really bad customer service. Too bad that we live so close, but will never return. come here if you want cold, mediocre food and bad service.","The brunch is vey good. You'll never try another french toast like this. The benedctins are different to the traditional ones, but really good. And the Lobster Sandwich is amazing. Additionally the attention by Jim (owner), Andrés, and Anthony (chef) are very good and very gentle","Best out of the way seafood restaurant I've been to in Brooklyn. Nice wine selection, reasonably priced, attentive service and GREAT Cioppino. Can't say enough good things!","The ONLY reason why I'm giving 4 stars is due to not having specials available that they usually have for Sunday Brunch as well as drink specials. No bottomless mimosas/sangrias so it became a bit pricey. Other than that the steak that I've had other than being at a steak house was the BEST I've ever had! The white bread was thick & tasted as if it was homemade. The eggs which my family & I ordered all different ways were perfect, not too runny, not over cooked even the scrambled eggs were satisfying! Music was played very Low, it's good for couples or just with a friend or two. I'm saying that because even though it's spacious, it's very low key so having a big crowd as for us it was 8, it felt like we took up the place. Waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed but she made sure we had everything we needed, got every order right & was a super sweetheart.",Kevin's
328,Awful service and overpriced drinks. The short male bartender is incredibly rude and ignores patrons on purpose. Funny enough I went next door and heard a couple complaining about his service too. Will not be back.,"Not sure if we came in on an off day because it was not to the standard of other reviews.My girlfriend and I both got cocktails, mine was quite good - a bourbon based one, but hers was a tequila based drink that tasted like none of the ingredients that were described.The worst part of it was the Olives.. they charge $7 (not the $6 shown on their online menu) for ""marinated olives"" which are supposed to come marinated in Rosemary, Citrus Oil & Chili Flakes. What I got had no rosemary, oil or chili and was literally straight out of a cheap jar of olives one can buy at a supermarket. They even gave us a bowl to throw out the olive pits WHEN THERE WERE NONE INSIDE THE OLIVES!Left feeling totally ripped off.","AVOID this place I do NOT recommend this place at all  !!  the attitude of the owner or bar tender that was there last night , was just annoying and disgusting so the place is great OK but this person is just awful , difficult to get a glass of water after two glasses of wine  ?? I even offer to pay for a bottle !  ,also one of my friend needed to charge her phone it was no as well ! he made everything annoying and difficult, there are many other options where you will be well received not only for your money !","Randomly stumbled on this place looking for happy hour specials. Great spot. Owners are very thoughtful and professional. They made sure my friend and I were comfortable and not bothered by other bar patrons. I've never experienced that kind of thoughtfulness and it was very much appreciated.  They have open mic nights which is so fun to meet new creative people. Some of the acts were really good too, actually most of them were. The bar eats are good too, like the grilled cheese and fries which are as good as the other reviews say. I would recommend this spot to anyone in the area.","This bar is absolutely incredible. Let's start with the ambiance and decor...STUNNING. The bar is so beautiful and full of gorgeous details. I like it because you can dress up for a night out with your girlfriends or go casual and grab a quick drink. Plenty of space for small and large groups.Prices: totally killer! They have a great happy hour and their cocktail menu has completely reasonable prices.Drinks and food: AMAZING. The food is available until midnight and the fries are TO DIE FOR. Definitely try those and the grilled cheese.The cocktails are some of the best I have tried. They have cocktails curated in house as well as the classics.Staff: super friendly and great at giving suggestions.Overall, such a great gem in this neighborhood! 100 percent my favorite bar in the E. Williamsburg area!!","I live close by and this is the perfect neighborhood bar. Great happy hour specials, well-crafted and reasonably-priced cocktails, and solid bar snacks -- all in a space that never seems to feel crowded. (oh, and a nice pup sometimes hangs around on weekends -- what more can you ask for?)",The Topaz
329,"I tried a few items at The Quarter, each with a varying but never super positive degree of enjoyment:Oysters: several options ranging from $1.50 (Blue Points) and up on a Saturday night, which is definitely not a bad bargain. Exactly like you would expect oysters to be served.BBQ Lamb Tacos: thought these were just ok. The flavor was good but they were super soggy and messy to eat. Calamari: ouch. They were so incredibly chewy and the breading way too salty. Some of the least satisfying calamari I have ever had. The smoked paprika yoghurt on the side added nothing to the experience, but then again it was already doomed. Had high hopes for The Quarter but the food didn't deliver. Nice staff and pleasant garden, but highly doubt I'll return.","Came here for Sunday brunch. Ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and a smoky mezcal bloody Maria.  Having just arrived home to Brooklyn after a week in Utah, this combo warmed the soul and healed a palette dulled by ultra bland Zion food. Definitely will be back.","I used to love the wine bar in this space so I was excited to try a new restaurant. Our general chicken in steamed buns came in cold buns.  The mushroom toast was ok but needed salt.  The fish and chips was really disappointing. The fish was chewy. I'm not sure how you make that happen. Now I love fries as much as the next white Irish descendant and these were not edible. They were steak fries that were lukewarm. The service was spotty.  We had to ask for water, plates, check. Overall it was a disappointment.","My husband  and I quiet satisfied with our dining experience in The Quarter that we accidentally found on our way we back home from BAM (Brooklyn Academy of Music.  We were seated  at the back yard where the table surrounded with beautiful plants and  ivies on the wall with a retractable roof that can be useful for every seasons. I gues they only need more and better lighting to keep the beauty of the atmosphere   The menu wasn't that complicated and I guess everyone can find what they like for their taste. We have told about specials and tried fish cake served with a special mustard lemon sauce. It was very crispy outside and soft inside. Flavorful and fresh which is important when you eat seafood. Mussels and frites fairly filled full with good size of mussels. They used to serve it with pesto and thank to God they had it still. Manager was super kind and helpful as well as the rest of the staff. Great place , worthy for every penny.","I was so excited to try this restaurant but was not allowed in because I had my service dog with me, and the owner insisted I show ""ID"" for her. I explained to him that, by law, service dogs are not required to have identification - in fact, the only service dog identification cards available are from for-profit online businesses that are not in any way affiliated with a government agency. He kept insisting on seeing an ID, but when I asked him what license he actually wanted to see, he just said he was busy, ""didn't have time for this"" and went back inside. So unfortunately we had to leave... but fortunately Mullanes was right nearby and happy to have us! :)","This place takes reservations on opentable. You have to walk downstairs from the street to go inside so it's a bit in the basement of the building. They have a large outdoor area in the back that seems to be great for reserving for an event. I came here on a very hot day and the AC wasn't strong enough. For brunch I ordered eggs and fried oysters. I usually don't see this on the menu so it was refreshing to have this option. The eggs and toast were all very mediocre. I think the toast was literally white sliced bread. The fried oysters were very good and they gave you a good portion of it, not just one or two. It's near the C train in Fort Greene and in a convenient location. The waitress was very nice.",The Quarter Brooklyn
330,"Unfortunately, I will never again eat here. The service we received last night was atrocious. We arrived as a walk-in (no reservation) before the dinner rush, there were three of us, and were immediately seated at a table. As soon as we sat, the hostess came back over to us and explained that the couple who had just walked in were a table of four, she asked us to move to the communal table. Generally, I would be put off by this, but we were happy to accommodate, though it was kind of tactless.However, when we sat at the communal table, over the next 15 min we were ignored by everyone in the restaurant. The couple who was given our original table received water, they made a wine selection, received bread AND their wine... AND ordered and received an appetizer before anyone even acknowledged our presence (and I want to note the second half of their party didn't arrive for another 20 minutes). I was literally making note of all of this after I became more and more upset. During this period, they were setting the communal table for a big group. While we were sitting and waiting, a server dropped bottles of water for the expected group at the table (none of which had shown up at this point) my husband stood up and grabbed a bottle of water that was set out on the table, this because in the 15 min wait, none had bothered to bring us water. When the waiter noticed my husband doing this, he glared annoyingly at us and aggressively replaced the bottle of water. I was absolutely shocked. We were about to walk out when a server finally came over at about 18 min of waiting, and took our drink orders. It was at this time the large group started to arrive. The restaurant immediately became so crowded that the servers had to inch their way behind me to work and they were constantly hitting my arms and back. We received our drinks as my husband tried to tell the server that we were ready to order, they had rushed off again, and waited for another 7 min... before they came back around. Still no bread, and the bottle of water we had acquired on our own was long gone.At this point we were so upset, we decided to leave. My husband talked to the waiter about all this, and asked for the check... not one apology, nothing. Even the hostess ignored us and our obvious dissatisfaction with the way we were treated. Listen, their food may be good but the service is horrendous, there are so many gems in this neighborhood that treat their customers like family. It's a shame this place misses the boat. Final warning: avoid Rucola it's just not a cool place.",Third rate brunch and horrible service. Yes sure celebrities go here but for real the food is horrible. I'm a bad cook and i can even make a better brunch meal than the guys at rucola. The bacon here is like the microwaveable kind and the food is so bad and bland. I would never come back here ever again.,"Waited over 90mins and I'm not a fan of small restaurants since they just jam pack you in there. We ordered a few things to split between 3 peopleThe appetizers came out quickly, but the mains took a while.Beef Tartare - no flavors, it helped a little when we added saltMussels - deliciousMain: Casarecce - this was decent & Short Rib - this was ok, meat was tender","We live around the corner from here, but always seem to turn up right between lunch and dinner... as someone who works in the service industry, that is incredibly infuriating, but everyone here is kind, quick, and takes care of us.A million thanks to the afternoon bar and waitstaff who deals with our drunk asses.","Rucola is the definition of a perfect date spot. Charming, intimate, and perfectly placed on a quiet tree lined street in Brooklyn, whether you go with a small group of friends or a Hinge date you won't be disappointed. Although they don't take reservations for parties smaller than 5, we called ahead on a Friday night and were seated right away! Our group sat at the community table, which often can be hit or miss in terms of service, but our server did not disappoint bringing our courses quickly and with a smile. The cocktails are strong but delicious and pair well with their homemade focaccia bread. As far as starters go, the charcuterie board is great to split with a group for its size and variety. 5 stars aren't given easily, but Rucola's homemade casarecce pasta, perfectly seasoned scallops, and fresh panzanella salad sealed the deal.","This place is a hit. Forget that it's a Wednesday night at 7:30pm with heat and flood flash warning, this charming small candle lit place is packed.We learned the hard way that they only take reservations for parties of 5 or more BUT...we also learned you can call over the phone to put smaller parties down on a waitlist.Luckily my friend and I were fortunate enough to grab 2 stools at the bar and had a very pleasant dining experience.The Northern Italian Menu is very attractive, reasonably priced and as we pondered what to get, everything around us being served looked impressive.On to the food...We started by sharing the Fried Calamari Appetizer ($13) which was a large portion and the actual calamari were ginormous. Serve with a nice bowl of delicious tomato sauce to soak it all up.For entrees we both got the homemade pasta:Garganelli: Cherry tomatoes, roasted peppers, summer squash ($18)Casarecce: English peas, parmigiano, housemade bacon, eggs ($19)Taking our leftovers to go there was no way we had any room left for dessert but maybe next time :)",Rucola
331,"Open late, which is how we ended up there. Obviously a tourist place, the decor is confusing, the food is gross, they were cleaning the floors so we smelled bleach and the server was wearing plastic gloves. I don't know where those hands were before touching my plate. Skip it.","As a ""regular"" at Sea, I can state that the staff, and food are top notch.  I have been coming to this restaurant for over 15 years.  The staff may change a bit, but the quality of the dishes remains consistent.  My Waitress tonight was Chili. She was attentive, and sensed when we needed assistance,  and when we just needed to be left alone.  Pam, a constant figure at this location, never fails to greet people when they arrive.  Even the new General Manager goes out of his way to make you feel welcome.Like I said, the staff may fluctuate,  like the neighborhood, but Sea Restaurant remains consitent in terms of quality for your money.",The place was nice. We got seated after a few minutes but what really sucked was that the Service wasn't great but the food was good.,"One of Williamsburg's favorites. Sea screams ""Good Vibes Only"" from the amazing ambience, sleek modern decor, great music selections, low lighting, great food/drinks, and the dope staff.  From the moment you walk into the door you realize that Sea gives you a Tao like vibe but at a fraction of the price (can't beat that). The food is reasonably priced especially considering the location. I was expecting pricing to be much higher but I definitely won't complain, in fact that's one of the major Pros. Normally theres a long wait here but the stars must've aligned since we were seated almost immediately on a Friday night.I have yet to find something on the menu that I haven't liked. My dad ordered the Na na fish, judging by how clean his plate was when we left I'm sure he loved it. The pineapple fried rice could've been better. But the calamari, and the wings were absolutely scrumptious.There's really only one semi con: The music can be a bit too loud if you're look to have a conversation. But honestly you can manage. All and all the vibe, the food, and the pricing makes this a must if you're just visiting or if you call NYC home!","Very modern Thai place with a lively atmosphere. The music was a bit too loud for my taste as we had to talk loudly to hear each other and it's a bit too dark, the lights are very dim. Food was good if you like a lot of sauce but it wasn't anything spectacular. Dessert however is a different story - the best lava cake you'll ever have and delicious brownie rolls. There were also many creative items! I wouldn't go back for food but the place has a nice atmosphere if you want to grab drinks.","Food quality has gone down over the years and the prices have gone up. Our server was nice but it took her a while. I think they got too popular and it's not the same as it was a few years ago. I will still return occasionally for the ambiance. Our meal was just okay. We got martini shrimp, a sushi roll, cashew nut chicken, and grilled chicken. I wish it tasted like it did a few years ago! Makes me sad",Sea
332,"Came out of here with foodborne illness and spent most of the next day in the bathroom. Regardless of the food's quality or good things I might have had to say otherwise, if your food is unclean to the extent it's making people sick, it's a public health hazard and an instant one star from me.","Came here for my birthday on a Saturday afternoon. We sat in the cozy area in the back, which was great for a group of friends mostly having drinks and not food. The good: The drinks are incredible. The whole menu is so creative and has such a diverse range of bases and flavor profiles to choose from. We had a group of 12 having several drinks, so among all of us we tried basically every cocktail on the menu. The Chiller Instinct was a popular choice among the group (bourbon, sherry, passion fruit and vanilla liqueurs, cinnamon, lemon oil). My personal favorite was the Date Night -- the salted butter washed rye made it a dessert-like cocktail without being too thick or syrupy.We didn't get dinner, but we ordered the guac and the chicharron and both were tasty complements to our cocktails.The bad: Our server was frequently MIA and seemed irritated with us the entire afternoon. We were a sizable group but were only given one menu to share among us, and we frequently struggled to get the server's attention. The restaurant is not that big and there were several servers working, so I don't think being busy was the issue.Also, a note to management: the pew benches in the back need to be sanded or re-finished. I was wearing a skirt so my legs were touching the wood seat and I got some small splinters in the backs of my legs.",The service is 5 stars.  The food is 3. I ordered Arepas and Civiche. The drinks are filled with ice. I ordered two shots of rum so I didnt feel like I was wasting money. Great environment.  Next time I know what to order.,"5 stars for cocktailsFood is probably overpriced with very small portions, was still hungry after paying $50/pp...Service was pretty slow but friendlyOtherwise cool atmosphere.Recommend reserving spot on waitlist on yelp so you can walk in when there's a seat for you","We have came to Leyenda before. We got the idea from visiting Clover Club their sister lounge/restaurant across the street. The cocktails and food are delicious there and we wanted a simpler experience.  Leyenda is a Mexican inspired tapas/cocktail bar. Our first experience we came early got a seat at high top table and it was somewhat pleasant. The food and cocktails were okay and was willing to try it again and here we are. We entered the establishment and no one was there to greet us. It was little later then last time but We did see some empty tables and was happy about that. There wasn't many people standing around so we thought we would be lucky.  A host came rushing over when we were going over to a table and asked if we would like to sit. We said yes and he said 45 mins. It was weird because there was just so many empty tables plus we heard they have a outdoor area.  We put our name down and saw seats at the bar and sat.  We figured if we can sit at the bar and eat why sit at a table. We ordered drinks and food and there was three tables that were empty for a good 30 mins. Really upsetting we couldn't have been accommodated. We order a some mixed drinks from the menu a Tia Mia and a bourbon type drink. Both were okay. They were fruity and thoughtfully prepared by our bartender.We ordered for dinner: shrimp arepas, ropa veijas, pernil with mofongo, and enchiladas with mole negro.  The arepas we ordered we never received.  We got something else in its place. It tasted okay. It was warm not hot. The ropa veija was tasty it was over plantains. We enjoyed this dish. The mofongo was tasty and pernil was good. We had ordered this the last time and it was our least fav dish. This time we really enjoyed it.The chicken enchiladas was cold! Like ice cold! And flavorless. I wouldn't get this.. It's crazy how delicious Clover Clubs food and cocktails are and how mediocre Leyenda food and cocktails are. Unfortunately, I would say this is prob our last visit here. The only thing going is the vibe. It's really a shame..Parking is somewhat easy(352)","We came here for drinks but i have to say that I would definitely come back for the food. The drinks are really good. Me and my boyfriend had three drinks each , there were all good and balanced. We ordered one appetizer just to try something , we ended up ordering three plates. We had the panuchos , the al pastor tacos and the poblano relleno. The poblano was my favorite !! If you can't take spicy don't even. It's spicy. Everything was delicious. We weren't even that hungry lol now I want to go back and try some other things. The place is cosy , the music goes with the place and the ambience invites you to stay. Great location too.",Leyenda
333,"Would've given 5 stars for food and ambience. (seriously, it was delish!). However, the service was lacking. Our server, (name starts with a J) was unfortunately inattentive. I arrived about 10 minutes before my boyfriend got to the restaurant, but waited a total of 20-25 minutes before we were asked what we wanted to drink. By that time, we were ready to order. I asked about the portions (yes-  tapas portions are small) and he said back abruptly, ""it's tapas style,"" So, we continued to order more and more things and he then goes, ""are you that hungry?"". Well, maybe if you were more specific in your answer, we could've clarified that in the beginning! Didn't see him again for several minutes, as the bartender brought us our drinks, and the food runner brought us our food.He maybe stopped by 1-2 times towards the end to ask how everything was. We also saw the server on his phone several times near the POS/bar area while we were waiting for him to come over. For people who have worked in the service industry for many years - it's not cool!","Great Monday night special - any bottle of wine over $42 is half off! We went with the L'inconscient 2015 Priorat which was very solid for $25. The ambiance was comfy/trendy but the lack of A/C was brutal (they had A/C; it was just weak). As for the food, nothing really life changing, some good dishes but they all lacked explosion and creativity that I seek when I dine out. At the end, I wondered if I could have made the whole meal myself. However, for the price points, and some quality dishes, I would return to try other things on the menu.Lamb Skewers - (definitely order) 4.5/5Eggplant - (likely order) 4.25/5Octopus - (likely order) 4.25/5Patatas Bravas -- 3.75/5Shrimp special - 2/5 was so boring. Just a bunch of shrimp in a hot pot. Cauliflower - 0/5 the one that I was most looking forward to eat. It was dry and awful. Once we used the oil from the octopus dish, oil from the shrimp dish, and the couscous from the lamb dish and mixed it all together, it was very nice.","I read the reviews and expected an awesome meal. We must have had bad luck because our meal experience was not great.- Staff insisted we order the big group menu despite being only 6 people - The group menu food was mostly terrible, especially the cabbage and the seafood paella, that nobody ate- Cocktails were good- Brussels sprouts overcooked - Tuna and beef dishes weren't great I love Spanish food and was hoping to love this place, but didn't.","MuihhBueno!I was invited by the board saying happy hour 4 to 7pm, even on Saturday,,Drinks are $5.Several choices for tapas, from 3 to 7 bucks.Good price, nice ambience, good service.It's a Yes.","Great BOGO gin and tonic deal all night on Thursday! Service was great and the ambiance was good.Giving it three stars because the food was just ok. We may have had high expectations because of all the other reviews here, but a lot of the dishes lacked flavor. We had the tomato bread, meatball, octopus, brussel sprouts and patatas bravas. Our favorite was the meatball. Overall just wish the food had more of a kick to it.","El Born is a nice restaurant with a menu that is pretty reminiscent of Somewhere in Spain.We walked in around 9:30 on Friday without a reservation and were seated right away in the back. The backyard area is perfect for a date or spending quality time with someone you actually want to hear talking as there is no music only lights,( you can faintly hear the music from the inside through the door used to carry out the food) candles and greenery. It feels like being in a backyard and so incredibly intimate. There's a stillness to it all, the location, the lack of sounds, almost like New Yorkers slowing down and taking a pause which is rare.Coliflor gratinada (The cauliflower) had a strong scent that filled the table as soon as it was brought out. The sauce was delicious and creamy. The Carxofes confitades amb idiazable (artichokes) were interesting and my partner really enjoyed the Cru de tonvina (tuna)Our sangria pitcher yielded about 5 glasses. The pistachio cake is delicious but could go without the mango as it drowns out the taste of pistachios. There was also quite a bit of mint..too much.All and all great place would come again.",El Born
334,We had their chicken and pork sandwiches and they were both good but not amazing (we came here because of the raving reviews so expectations were high).  One advice is not to order their spring roll because it is just not what it should be (not much flavor and too noodle-y).,"I'm a big bahn mi fatty, so I took two metro stops to go to this total hole in the wall.I tried two sandwiches: classic cuts and pork. Both spicy.Bread was soft on the inside and lightly crispy on the outside. Good.Picked veggies were mostly just carrots a spring of cilantro, and a cucumber sprear. Vinegar taste was sweeter than I'm used to. Okay.All the meat was shoved in the crack of the bread, so I would take a bite on the meat side, then the veggie side. Baahh.In my pork sandwich, the meat was way way way over cooked in the microwave. The moisture had been sucked completely out of the meat. Nooooo.More gripes:- Low on mayo- Low on sauce (no Maggi sauce or anything else to enhance flavors)- Low on pate (this should be a crime)Sorry, Nam Nam. Not even comparable to other spots. Go to Xe May on 8th Street. Much better.","I stopped here to get my banh mi fixed and was satisfied with my medium spicy pork sandwich.  The bread was soft the way I liked because I hate the toasted crunchy bread The flavors hit the spot like I expected in this hole in the wall spot.  The prices were very reasonable considering the area. The location is very tiny and more of a take out spot. If you're not familiar with this area, it can be tricky finding the restaurant because it kind of blends in with the other residential buildings on the block.  Overall, this is another spot I would visit again for my banh mi fixed.",Great bahn mi.I ordered the cold cut bahn mi.The bread was soft on the inside but just crusty enough on the outside.Inside the sandwich were a ton of pickled carrots which were super fresh and delicious.The Mayo and meats hit the palate with lots of savoriness. This was a really excellent sandwich.,"You can totally miss this place is you're not looking for it. No awning, barely a store sign. Maybe a total of 6 seats inside, 2 small tables and 2 bar seats. They are cash only. I got the cold cut sandwich, this costs a bit over $7. The sandwich does come with a lot of pickled carrots, which I personally enjoy. A lot of places in the city has started not only cutting back on their portion of meat in the sandwich, but pickled vegetables as well, I guess I appreciate that this place does give a lot of pickled carrots, I do agree the portion of meat can be more. It was still a solid and very decent Vietnamese sandwich. The bread was toasted, but not toasted to the point where the bread would scrape all the skin off the top of my mouth, which has been the case from some places. I'm happy I got to try this place, and will come back to try their vermicelli salads and drinks the next time around.",Nam Nam is a pretty unassuming small restaurant on the side of the street but damn these banh mis are so delicious. I came here after a suggestion from my friend while we were wondering around looking for a place to chow down after work. We arrived around 7 PM on a Thursday night and there was only a couple of people in the restaurant. There are only a few tables and a long bench for customers to sit at. The space is pretty cramped and messy but it is a very self service kind of restaurant. I ordered a pork sandwich with the friendly cashier up front and our food was brought out in less than 10 minutes. The first thing that hit me about the food was the freshness of the bread and afterwards the beautiful pairing of the pork and pickled veggies/cilantro and spread. This has probably got to be one of my favorite banh mis in the city - and I cannot wait to go there again!,Nam Nam
335,"We ordered this on a whim one evening, but I haven't had a better sandwich in this neighborhood. The tomato soup is incredible as well.","Food is good for sure, but service is pretty rough. Delivery was wrong and all phone numbers go straight to voicemail. Tried over and over to reach out but can't get a refund. Hopefully someone sees because we can't reach them otherwise ‍","I really wanted to love this place so badly, it was the only option for me on Uber Eats that involved customization with your Mac and Cheese. I placed my order and was excited for it to arrive and waited to take my bite and felt disappointment. The pancetta bread they gave me on the side which I paid extra for was soggy and burnt. The mac and cheese was not cheesy and lacked flavor completely. The only thing that was good with my order was the chocolate fudge cake though.","Gonna make this short: eat the Cuban sandwich. But since Yelp doesn't let me post something so short I'm just going to write until it's long enough. Eat the Cuban sandwich, it's really good. Like really good. That was enough. Eat the Cuban sandwich, you won't regret it.","Their Grass-fed Burger Melt is seriously one of best burgers I've ever had! If you love a burger as much as I do, I will also suggest you upgrade it with bacon and egg, too!Additionally, I will also suggest that you order a a side of tater-tots to go with your burger! Just do it.What's glorious about this combo:- the burger almost feels like a sandwich and is cut in half, so you can easily eat half the burger and half the tots, and have a whole meal for later.- this plus a beer puts any hangover in it's place.What else i love is that every single person who works here is great! Super attentive, kind, and on-top of whatever you need. Additionally, they've got WiFi and play fun music, so you will often find me working from here, as well.The ONLY bummers- When you leave the Wheelhouse, you smell like the Wheelhouse. I personally keep a set of clothes in my just to go here, cuz there's not much you can do about that.- It can get a little hot here in the summer. To solve this, I wear a stripper shirt (ie: sleeves/sides cut off) and sit at the bar with the big fan behind me.",Grilled cheese with tomato soup.Sixpoint Sweet Action on tap.Awesome bartenders and warm wooden vibe.That is all. I love this spot.,The Wheelhouse
336,Best roti in all or NYCAuthentic flavor but never as tasty as my sister's rotiThey really have to learn to move faster when the line is getting long...people have to go to work. The bag system is working.    Using post it notes is a waste. Still tastiest roti- curry and actual rotiPrices cheap considering popularity.,"Was visiting Brooklyn and craving doubles (as it's so hard to find in the DC area). Wanted to give this place a try but to be honest, I didn't really care for the taste of the food nor the service and I don't see myself coming back here. The prices were reasonable ($1.50). Speaking of prices, there's none listed. Just a menu list...I literally just wanted doubles! I ordered a few mild and the rest spicy (they weren't even spicy by the way).  When I got inside the shop, I couldn't tell where the line was really.  Apparently there is a separate line to order versus paying but then they don't give you a receipt nor a ticket number. They just yell out your order. I waited over 20 minutes for just doubles...not impressed :(",Nasty restaurant throws their nasty stinky dirty used grease and scraps in the corner basket that endangers the poor Garbage men who pick up the slippery basket on a daily basis.,"Reason enough to stick around in Bedstuy. Truly the only place I've been a regular. The lines move, don't be turned off. Try a couple doubles if you're new and try everything else once you're back. It's a treat, if a little dangerous, how much you can get here for so little. Ali's is the reason I discovered the thrill of making spicy tamarind chutney from scratch. I'll never get their recipe down, but happy to enough to have honed some form of that perfect kick of flavor.  Be sure to say yes when they offer it with your doubles and aloo pies. And peek behind the counter for other treats and drinks. I sometimes grab a jar of crunchy channa. The people there work nonstop and the girl I usually see behind the counter always greets warmly despite the bustle - I should learn her name but usually I just duck out of the way to keep that line flowing.","First, Ali's Trinidad Roti Shop is cash only, so make sure you have at least ten dollars in your pocket.  Second, they are soooo good! They reminded me of college, I had a chicken roti and a bottle of water that hit me up for $8.00, and it was well worth it.  One roti filled me up and sent me on my way satisfied.  There was a line when I arrived, but they do an excellent job of getting people in and out.  There are about three tables and chairs, so I would suggest you will most likely have to eat somewhere else.","I was craving Caribbean food for my birthday, so we hopped on yelp and found this place. It was a chilly rainy evening, but there was still a line when we got there. Fortunately, it moved pretty quickly. There was a table or two, but the ambience was lacking, so like everyone else we took the food to go. The prices were great. More importantly, the food was delicious, especially the chicken curry and the pumpkin. Thanks Ali's for an awesome birthday experience. Hope to be back soon to try the doubles.",Ali's Trinidad Roti Shop
337,"Really in shock over this delivery I received. I spent $24 on this portion size?! I'm sorry, but pasta is the cheapest thing to make. It's unacceptable. The tase was good, but definitely not $24 worth. Save your money and order from somewhere else.",So came here on our last night in Brooklyn and we were staying close by. We don't usually have amazing Italian restaurants back at home so wasn't expecting much. When the food arrived I had my first spoonful of pasta and I kid you not I fell in love with this place and I wish I could come here every night for a fresh plate of pasta no matter the price!!,This review is for delivery only:I ordered the pasta bolognese. For $18 plus $2fee plus tip totaling over $25 I expected a meal. What I got was a snack. Pasta bolognese is probably one of the cheapest meals a restaurant can serve but the portion was so small I had to run out to my local pizza joint for a couple of slices. I am never ordering from here again. The second star is because it did arrive very quick.,"One of the best pastas I've had!!!Went here on a date and we had a really fun night dining at this location. The hostess was very friendly and welcomed us as soon as we arrived. We were seated at the bar as our table was not ready (we got there 15 mins earlier than our reservation) which gave us a chance to go through their extensive amaro collection and cocktail list. We ended up ordering the ""A place beyond the Alpine"" and ""Orange Ferrari"" (both were very good) by which time our table was ready. For appetizer we ordered the Calamari (delicious!!) and for the main course we got Agnolotti ( Seriously by far the best pasta I've had and which I'll be dreaming about for days to come) and Gemelli Verde (fantastic!). And finally for desert we got the strawberry Panna cotta. The service was good, the food arrived fast and everything was just excellent. This place is a real gem. Also I believe they have Jazz performances on Sundays (which sadly we didn't know about when we made our reservation on a Saturday). We will definitely come","One of the best pastas I've had!!!Went here on a date and we had a really fun night dining at this location.

Everything from the ambiance to the decor to the pasta... it's a win. But, I hate that happy hour is only at the bar! And the prices are pretty steep so this place is mainly a special occasion kind of place for me.The pasta is always delicious, and the Reginette is by far my favorite out of the ones I've tried. The pork shoulder is so tender and they put a *lot* of it in there, so it's very filling. The Garganelli (bolognese) is really good as well and, if you want to try something a little more unique, their squid ink pasta is a solid, really tasty choice.The food is definitely incredible and the drinks are solid as well, it's just the prices that keep this place at bay for me.",Ammazzacaffè
338,"James is pretty awesome too. Dunno how it is that I got into dirty martinis, but if you are in need of one, he da man!","We went to Brookvin for our anniversary because We LOVE it there. However this night proved to be the exception, the place was practically empty so I believe it was the bartender's choice of music playing. I am okay with listening to most music, but this night it really killed the mood. We drank our bottle of wine and left.The music was filled with plenty of sex, drugs, and swearing... maybe if I were at a club... but for a wine bar so tasteless and way too loud. Such a disappointment, after all, it was our anniversary.",,"The wine selection at Brook*Vin is varied and accessible. The tapas plates are carefully prepared and delicious. But what really makes me come back to Brook*Vin is the service. First, you will notice (if you return multiple times) that the turnover is low- the management and owners must treat their employees well. Second, you will notice that those who serve you are attentive, knowledgeable, and personable- especially Rachel (or Rachael?) the bartender. I've never had a bad experience there. I love just down the block and feel lucky that they chose South Slope.","I have to start the post by saying that I absolutely adore this place.The food is wonderful, the service is absolutely amazing, plus their wine list is off the hook.The only reason I have an issue with Brookvin is how often they don't turn the ac on, if the temperature outside is above 75 then it would be a smart business move to keep their customers happy and comfortable.Instead of having a few glasses of wine and a bunch of appetizers, we had one glass each and one small charcuterie dish and went to a different bar.  It was 85 degrees outside and they had open air ventilation.Until they use their ac when it's over 75 degrees outside, I will probably go else where.We also saw 2 different sets of customers come in and leave after feeling the heat inside.With how many refrigerators and draft machines they had on, it probably 10 degrees hotter inside.","Brookvin excels at its primary goals--they have a great and varied wine selection and excellent cheese plates. If you like wine and cheese (and if not, I mean...why???) it's a great location for both--with a lovely outdoor seating area in the backyard where you can indulge in a delightful setting at your leisure, to boot. A couple of their other small plate options are impressive as well--they have a stunningly excellent mac 'n cheese, a very tasty chicken pot pie, and a varying seasonal menu of crostini plates that are generally good.  These small plates are, well... particularly small though.  Don't plan to share, or stock up accordingly!I'd stick mostly to that cheese--and especially wine--though.  Cocktails I've tried have been mediocre at best--honey-thyme whiskey sour was overly tart and disappointing, and even a standard old fashioned wasn't quite up to snuff.  Draft beer options are quite limited and uninspired.  They have a great happy hour deal until 7pm Tu-Fri and until 5pm Sat-Sun on house wines, draft beer as well as mac and cheese and a selected crostini.  Perfect for the wine and small plates they excel at.",Brookvin
339,"This is hands down the worst meal I have had in New York. The Finch is a neighborhood restaurant in Clinton Hill, with very few other options nearby. This is probably the only reason why it's still in business. It's ridiculously pricey and portions are so small that food gets lost in the plate.5 pieces of toasted bread costed 10$. Yes, you are reading correctly: that bread that every single restaurant on Earth offerts complementary, here costs 10$.We then got roasted chicken. Came in two small pieces, completely raw and gummy. We obviously sent it back and when the waiter brought back the plate he said that the chicken was ""sous vide"". Mind that the menu said ""roasted chicken"". ROASTED.the other plate we got was the pappardelle: literally three sad strips of tasteless pasta.Total: 110$ for one glass of wine, bread and two ""entrees"".Never again.",The front part of the restaurant is where you want to be seated - unfortunately we ended up at the other dinning room which disturbingly smelled like a living room that had no windows opened for years until the air-con was turned on. The food was ok - interesting dishes but I'm challenged when I have to chew sand with my mushrooms. The dishes lacked the finesse I had expected.,"Had dinner here for Valentine's Day. It was pretty unappetizing and, considering the bill at the end, not super pleased with this experience. Most of the food was luke warm - never warm or hot. The wine was super super funky, I can usually appreciate one or two different types of funk, but all 5 wines were strange. The food felt very one-note and overly technical; they missed the important parts - taste and texture. Service was consistently nice and friendly. I am sad to say I walked out feeling nauseous and disappointed.","Spotted this one star restaurant within walking distance from my new apartment - what are the chances.Dined on 9/22/19. The place was cozy, relaxing, with an open kitchen, not yet dominated by millenials (thank god, but jk).Food:Bread, butter, raw honey, radishes - never had the bread-butter-radish combo with raw honey before. The honey was funky in a good way, but the proportion of this starter was laughable - piles of radishes with only five tiny slices of unimpressive bread. We ended up using the radish slices to scoop up the honey and butter (we did not want to waste food; plus, it was $10). The radish was crispy, earthy, with nice watery texture, but our hands got sticky, concluding that we never had so many radishes in one setting and felt like rabbits. Lettuce with avocado squash - note that those delicious slices of avocado squash were buried in the bottom of a pile of lettuce, but if you dig them out and blend with lettuce (and even more radish!) and buttermilk dressing, this salad was divine, creamy, but still made you feel...somewhat healthy. Chicken with corn, tomato & chanterelles - a umami bomb. The chicken was charred outside, tender and juicy inside. My bf bet that the meat was sous vide first and then roasted/charred. I did not enter the bet. Tomatoes were extremely juicy, but salt seemed to have overpowered the lovely flavor of chanterelles. Generally delicious, even tho my fav mushroom was not treated properly.Trout with early fall squash and nuts was arguably more mild and pleasant - seem to resemble a golden harvest of the fall (after having too many radishes, my peasant-roots surfaced). The trout was tender, rather unsalted, but the crunchiness of seeds and nuts added nice texture and complexity to the fish. Saffron panna cotta - not my fav. The raspberries were not fresh, and the saffron flavor tasted more like unfiltered tap water, with faint smell of chlorine, strangely. Drinks: Bourbon based cocktail - strong and delicious, very curious with a lingering taste of pine nuts. Slovenian red wine - never had red wine from Slovenia before, very velvety, smoked peppercorn taste, interesting.$10 Tokaji - who needs dessert if you can get this golden liquid for $10? This one did not have the complexity as those with higher puttonyos, but still tasted like honey/honeysuckle/white flowers. Sweet but never overwhelming.","This is a wonderful restaurant with a view of the beautiful open kitchen where you can watch the chefs hard at work. The servers are friendly and helpful with any questions you have about the menu. I wasn't entirely impressed with their wine selection but liked that the menu wasn't large - just a few appetizers, entrees and desserts. We started off with the bread and radishes. I would never imagine that pair together but it worked very well, especially with the paired honey. A simple dish that's inventive. We got the heirloom tomatoes with cherries and bread - another fire combination. It's a very clean dish and since it's peak summer, there is no reason to skip over heirloom tomatoes. For our mains, we had the einkorn and squid ink pasta. The pasta's made at the restaurant and was rich in flavor while the einkorn, which I've never had before, was the most unique dish of the night. It was prepared with mushrooms and some green sauce - it had a touch of tanginess and the mushrooms gave it depth. Don't skip over the dessert at The Finch. We got an almond tart but every dessert looked divine. I'll try the strawberry shortcake next visit.","Not wowed. Would give 3.5 stars if it is an option.We started dinner with cocktails. When we took the first sip, we though - humm...nothing really is special about the drinks. Maybe the food will be better? Starters:The kale salad with pistachio was good. Chicken liver mousse was ok. The added fruity flavor kinda overtook the whole dish. Entree:The duck was good. The skin was crispy and the meat was cooked perfectly. I didn't get a chance to try the tile fish but my friend said it's good. DO NOT get the squid ink fazzoletti. The portion was so small - like a kids meal- and the flavor was just ok. I even tasted a rock or crab shell in my dish. Dessert: Yuzu tart was refreshing. But that's about it.We were all scratching our heads trying to understand how can this restaurant be Michelin 1 star restaurant.  Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes? Guess I won't know because I'm not planning to try again",The Finch
340,"Three of four dishes were over salted. Ill conceived dishes, such as scallops and foie and split peas? Unfortunately their cooking can't live up to their aspirations as the dishes come out poorly executed. It's as if the chef watched top chef and figured ""I could do that"". No. No you can't.","The overall experience was just ok. I did enjoy the food, but nothing wowed me. It was also really loud which made it hard to carry on a conversation. That could've just been because the place is a little small and there were two big groups.",Very bad experience. Such a slow service . Waited for 1 hour for apps to come and basically got full on bread basket so by the time food arrived no one at the table was hungry anymore. So I guess the place was good for a very expensive take out. Don't recommend for lunch or dinner if you want so anything else that night since you ll be waiting most of the time Maybe they should have just refunded all the food for uNo we did not talk the manager about that,"Delicious food.Highly recommend the cauliflower, octopus carpaccio, and the ribs.They were all amazing. Very flavorful and very fresh ingredients.I will be back!","I came here for the first time for brunch with a group of friends. I think it must have just been a slow day because the place was fairly empty. We had a reservation and when we arrived our table was right in front. We were seated right away but weren't attended to for some time, until I asked the waiter to come to the table. I ordered a Bloody Mary and had French onion soup and hot sausage. My Bloody Mary was somewhat warm and watery but the flavor and spiciness was good. The French onion soup was really great, and did not disappoint! It was slightly on the salty side but I enjoyed it nonetheless. For the table we got the roasted cauliflower and apple fritters. The fritters were very delicious, certainly enough to split amongst a group. The cauliflower did not really wow me all that much.My friends got the French toast and hanger steak which they both seemed very pleased with. The French toast had a lovely array of fresh fruit on top and the kitchen cooked the hanger steak to perfection.Overall, after having to call the waiter over a handful of times for various reasons,  I didn't think the service warranted a standard 20% tip added to the bill.",This is a little gem in the neighborhood of Fort Greene! We really liked the place and the service. The food was really good. Pressed orange and grapefruit juices were delicious as well as the Norwegian eggs Benedict and the bison burger chosen by my husband! We will go back ;),Gentleman Farmer - Fort Greene
341,"I'm too grumpy to think of highly processed kids' breakfast cereal as nostalgic or high kitsch or whatever. I'm also at fault for not realizing it was going to be actual Fritos in the frito migas --- but no, ugh gross. I don't want my eggs piled on top of Fritos.  My companion enjoyed the patty melt but the honey glazed deep fried home fries that came with it tasted more like dessert than brunch to me.  The sticky bin looked really good  but everything else was a bit much so no room to try it.The bloody Mary was okay.","I do not delight in writing an unkind review, however, this place compels. I could start and finish with the $19 meatloaf sandwich that consists of a sliver of meatloaf on white bread with one tomato and a few strands of iceberg lettuce doused with something like thousand island dressing - that comes with no side (see photo). You actually would get more sustenance and nearly identical flavor from a Big Mac. When I asked the server if I could get it without the bread, I received a curt ""no"" in response. Ok, I get it, that's your policy, no problem. Though had the sandwich come without the bread, there would have been barely a half hockey puck's worth of meat and 25 cents worth of cheap produce on my plate. My dining companion got the chicken, also light on meat and heavy on condiment slather, offered at a similar price to the meatloaf. For a glass of wine to accompany your underperforming diner food, you'll be hard pressed to find one below $15. If you know the joke about the two old ladies dining at a Catskill resort, one of them says ""Boy, the food at this place is really terrible."" The other one says, ""Yeah, I know; and such small portions."" Just add another line about it being grossly overpriced and you've got this place nailed.","For all the fanfare this restaurant has received in the press, I found the food to be overpriced and unremarkable. For such a limited menu, there is a preponderance of fried food. That may not seem like such a bad thing for those who love fried ingredients, and perhaps even a misplaced criticism for a diner. However, for those who are seeking something less gluttonously unhealthy, Meme's Diner is not ideal. I decided to indulge in something I will probably never make on my own--meatloaf ($18). The two slices of meatloaf came with a side, and I ordered the cucumber salad. This actually turned out to be spicy and drenched in chili oil. My friend ordered the BBQ meatballs ($10) and the cucumber salad ($7) separately and also found them uninspired. Both inclined to overeat than leave anything on the plate, we did not finish our meals. The best thing about this restaurant was the service. The wait staff was attentive, knowledgeable, and patient in explaining and recommending menu items.","Best brunch I have had in years. The food was impeccable, the drinks were inventive and delicious, and the service was attentive but casual. We started with the savory babka which was a perfect savory pastry option to tide over our hunger before the main dishes were ready. I highly recommend splitting dishes here in order to try as many things as possible.I split the meatloaf sandwich and was plenty full. It is and open-faced sandwich, meaning there wasn't a piece of bread on top. I would definitely order this again.For dessert we tried both the cake and the pie. The cake was topped with a creme anglaise and was absolutely decadent. To me the pie paled in comparison but it would be hard for anything to beat this cake. If you can't decide between a cocktail or coffee, try the ICC which is a cocktail with espresso in it- best of both worlds.Overall I definitely recommend Meme's Diner for brunch. Be prepared to wait for a table- but I promise it will be worth it.",This little place is super cozy.  I came with my boyfriend for breakfast.  We ordered the breakfast sandwich and the everything bagel babka.  Both were delicious and tasty.The place is a bit cramped and on a busy weekend things could be worse. They seated us right next to the bathroom which was not cool.  Fortunately the service was great and the food was served quickly.  We also got a free slice of cake at the end which makes it a nice touch. The food quality is great.  We really enjoyed our breakfast.  Hope to come back again!,"This is my go-to spot if I need to dependably impress and satisfy a friend! I've been for brunch more often than anything, and it's always great. Don't sleep on whatever the special pastry is - the za'taar and the everything bagel babkas I've had are amazing and a great ""breakfast appetizer"" to split. For brunch, I've tried the egg over yogurt but now always get the breakfast platter with soft scramble. Those fried honey drizzled potatoes.... OMG! My friend had the egg sandwich and said it was the best she's ever had. I've only been once for dinner but got the famed chicken cutlet with a side of spring pea and ricotta salad. YUM. The cutlet is perfect: simple, juicy, crispy. Just as a cutlet should be. The salad was so refreshing. My friend got the buffalo chicken salad, which is hearty for a salad, but I was happy with my choice (not a buffalo sauce fan). My one minor complaint: once after brunch (where we had already ordered three mains and two pastries), my friend asked for another bowl of the cereal they give as a free table appetizer (because, how often do you get to eat lucky charms?!) and the waiter said no. I'd understand if we were at risk for not ordering any food.... but really?! We just spent a ton of money and we couldn't get a second tiny cup of cereal? We were perplexed and embarrassed. Anyways, the food here is solid. The vibe is great (I recommend sitting at the bar if possible, and avoiding the table by the bathroom which can be a little loud and uncomfortable with people leaving the bathroom door open after exiting).",MeMe's Diner
342,"This is my place to go for Omakase when my wallet is tight.  $100 and you get 16 pcs of very good quality sushi served by the sushi chef. He does spend time on details.  Aside from the lack of tasteful decor, this is a no frill omakase restaurant. I normally would never go to a non Japanese owned sushi restaurant but this would be an exception. I will need to go back and try their kitchen entree in the future.","came for the omakase and was excited to try out a new place but left with a disappointed stomach and lighter wallet. sushi was disappointingly just ok - nothing special, no creative pairings of flavor or interesting presentation. i was looking forward to having a japanese go-to spot in the neighborhood but i'll need to keep looking because sushi lin is a ""one and done"" unless you want average sushi.","Honestly, I would give one of my infinity stones for this sushi place.Next time if I destroy universe again, I am making sure this place survives","Sushi Lin is as good as it gets for an overall authentic, fresh, creative, and delicious sushi experience. It holds its own to some of the greatest places in the city, but at a $100 price tag for incredibly creative and delicious Omakase, it falls significantly above some of its rivals in value. We made a reservation to sit at the Omakase counter and glad we did as the restaurant fills up. The waiter was attentive and asked us if we had any desires or likewise anything we didn't like. I wanted everything but my date was able to request they avoid certain foods which was very refreshing.Some of the highlights were the Yuzu Hamachi, all 3 types of Uni, fatty Yellowfin Tuna from Spain, salmon with roast tomato, and toro handroll.Will definitely returning to do this again soon.","We've been here several times. Twice for omakase and twice for regular dinner. Omakase We had the full omakase. Fish was fresh and size of each piece of sushi was great. Not too big and not too small. Temperature was of fish was good. Rice was pretty decent for what I believe is not japanese manned chef. The pace was on the fast side. I would have liked for the pace to be a bit slower. I felt rushed. Esp when you're there chit chatting and having sake you don't necessarily want to be powering thru this. It ain't a race ya get me?! There were several premium cuts of fish that I liked. A la Carte We've also come with friends and ordered off the a la carte menu. We had some cooked stuff which was good albeit on the skimpy side. Sushi and rolls were fine. Service A bit hit or miss. On several occasions, we tried to flag down the staff and they just weren't looking up,  chatting with other staff or not making eye contact. This happened everytime we were there and we weren't the i by ones to notice it. Our friends pointed it out as well. This is one of the better omakases in the area but they do face stuff competition from Taro down the block. I would def return but would hope that it doesn't take such an effort to get the attention of the staff.","Cuisine: 8Service: 9Decor: 7Value: 10Overall: 9One of the most enjoyable sushi experiences in NYC because you get so much quality sushi for such a wonderful price. If it wasn't all the way in Brooklyn, I would be there all the time. Regardless, after several visits, this place deserves to be in my sushi rotation.If you are a sushi connoisseur in NYC, then you'll notice some similarities in a few items like the New Zealand King Salmon with Seared Tomato (Sushi of Gari) or the White Sesame Tofu with Brown Sugar Sauce (15 East) from old Japanese staples around town. That's because the young chef owners of the restaurant, Ryan Lin and Lenny Lin, has worked all over NYC.On this night, Lenny was our chef, and there was six of us sitting at the sushi bar. Four of us ordered the full omakase that I have listed below.$100 OMAKASE - 3/26/2019 (*add onto meal)Appetizers:   Tai (Japanese Snapper) - lemon    KumomOyster - ponzu   Baigai (Whelk) - konbu & dashi   Ankimo (Monk Fish Liver) - ponzu & cucumbersSushi:   Madai (Sea Bream) - fried ginger   Kanpachi (Amber Jack) - jalapeño salsa   Kinmedai (Golden Eye) - opa leaf & konbu   Namadako (Raw Octopus) - yuzu jelly    Hotate (Scallop) - yuzu skin   Kamasu (Barracuda) - torched, soy sauce   Botan Ebi (Sweet Shrimp) - tamale sauce   Masuno Suke (King Salmon) - truffle slices   Chutoro (Medium Fatty Bluefin Tuna) - caviar   Otoro (Fatty Bluefin Tuna) - truffle spreadMiscellaneous:   Namadako Suction Cups w/ IkuraSoup:   Clam BrothSushi:   Miyazaki A5 Wagyu (Beef) - uni & caviar   Uni (Santa Barbara Sea Urchin)* - soy sauce   Ikura (Salmon Roe)* - radish   Aji (Horse Mackerel Belly)* - soy & chives   Saba (Mackerel)* - torched, chive   Hamachi (Yellowtail)* - soy sauce   Engawa (Fluke Fin)* - salmon eggs, chivesIt's not perfect, the rice temperature was inconsistent at times and needs a bit more work compared to the best available in NYC. However, everything else is near top notch quality, and for a very reasonable price.I hate the fact that it takes me about an hour from my home to Sushi Lin for dinner. However, I will find every reason to eat there because I simply love this place.",Sushi Lin
343,Still great food but was recently treated very poorly by the server at the counter despite being a frequent customer. Will not be back!,"So of course i had to scroll thru all the photos 1st just to have something to compare. Now, the reason why i gave 3 stars is because i wish there was more hummus and falafel in my sandwich. From picture scouting i believe i got hijacked on the falafel. It was tasty but didnt make me go crazy. My suggestion: try for yourself u may feel diff. I wasnt crazy about it and there was soooo much red cabbage and white sauce that it over powered the sandwich. My 1st shot i ripped a piece off to see inside.","This place was good at getting the job done. Decent taste, portions at a reasonable price. Other than that, nothing spectacular. I'd venture out to Mamouns for a tastier falafel pita option.There is a bathroom here though! Keys are located at the counter where you pick up your order and when you're done, there's plenty of seating to return to in this spacious restaurant!","I lived near Paterson, NJ for quite sometime If you know anything about that place, there is a plethora of authentic delicious middle eastern food.While in Brooklyn, I found this Tunisian restaurant and wondered if there will be anything different here than other middle eastern or Mediterranean restaurants.There is.First, the owner and workers are polite.They were very kind to us, genuinely.And on top of that, the food was delicious.The shalafel, salad and falafel with chicken was really really good. I would eat that every dayWe also had their recommended lamb sausage sandwich which they said was a local meal...superbDecor is nice, food is great","I should start by saying I think the employees/seller are nice and polite, the restaurant is pleasent and clean, and the prices are relatively fair. That all being said, the food is just not good and nothing here is fresh.My go to is Mediterranean food. i ate in hundreds of places over my 34 years, and the food here is among the worst I had.The Hummus is not made in house. Its taste and texture is of a grocery store boxed hummus (and not even a good one) with some spice over it.The tahini is diluted with water and not made in house.The french fries is frozen and then deep fried. The shawarma is not a shawarma by texture, seasoning or flavor - it's frozen as well. It is more like a blend souvlaki.The baklave was old (not made in house). When the owner couldn't cut it, she brought it to the kitchen to be warmed and cut. Its texture was old and pretty awaful.I'm not sure about the falafel as I'm convinced about the other items, but I believe it is frozen and deep fried, and not made in house as well. It doesn't taste good by any means.If you have a benchmark for Mediterranean food, you will not like the food here (I wouldn't be surprised if the 5 stars here are paid for or something has significantly changed).On a positive note, the AC was good and the coke can was fresh...","I've never tasted something quite like the roasted cauliflower with labneh at La Goulette. Named after a seaside suburb of Tunis, the city's lone remaining Tunisian restaurant had been on my list for quite some time, and this week I finally had the chance to actually check it out. Roasted cauliflower is usually hit or miss for me, but their tangy rendition was probably the best I've ever had. I also tried the babaganoush which was flavourful and fresh.Will definitely be back to try the falafel and other menu items!",La Goulette
344,Just walked out. Sat at an empty for ten minutes. No other customers at all. Absolutely no service at all. Walked in and asked if they were open they said yes and then did nothing at all. Unbelievably horrible service.,"What A disappointment. Have been coming here for years. The new management has taken over and BR isn't what it used to be. Portions are significantly smaller, server was unfriendly and quality of food declined. Will not be returning.","I've been here a few times but the last time I got the chicken and waffle and it was horrible... soggy, oily, and overpriced.","Blue Ribbon is a place that I visited during ""Dine-In Park Slope"" - Park Slope's version of their restaurant week which was held from August 20- August 30th.  Blue Ribbon is a beautifully well lit establishment that has a bar w/ chic seating arrangements. Blue Ribbon's ""Dine-In Park Slope"" dinner special consisted of three courses for $29.99 which is a pretty good deal. Because they ran out of the 1st Course initial salad that was being offered, Server Marissa let me know that they were going to substitute a different salad instead - Watermelon and Feta Cheese Salad. Well, it was one of the  best salalds that I have ever had....fresh greens, sweet ripe watermelon slices and feta cheese. Complimentary flavors, which were the sweetness of the fruit, taste ot the greens and the saltiness/tanginess of the cheese, made for a refreshing salad. I chose their signature Chicken Dinner for the 2nd Course. The Fried Chicken w/ Mashed Potatoes + Gravy was definitely delicious! Blue Ribbon's Fried Chicken is so incredibly well-seasoned!. Server / Bartender Fredy informed me that Blue Ribbon is well know for their chicken which is their specialty. So deliciously seasoned is the chicken that I ate every bite -lol. Creamy mashed potatoes w/ gravy and complimentary bread w/ butter made my meal complete. Yes, I was full yet looking forward to the 3rd Course at the same time...Mango Sorbet for dessert was the 3rd Course - it was nice and light. Thanking Marissa and Fredy for the lovely customer service along w/ the fantastic meal,  I left shortly thereafter and knew that I would return soon to try more dishes.  Fast Forward - I went back the other evening for dinner and enjoyed their Chicken Sandwich w/ Mashed Potatoes.  All in all, Blue Ribbon receives 4.5 Stars thus far which includes my overall experience during bouth of my visits. I will be back for some more delicious fried chicken!",Super awesome spot with excellent service. Went here for our first wedding anniversary and accidentally chose the fried chicken based on other reviews. Will compare all other fried chicken to this spot from now on. Sets the bar extremely high and most delicious food I've had in a while. Worth the price. Can dress up or dress down for attire here but totally worth checking out if you're searching or on the fence. Bonus: had PBR on tap. Haven't found that in years on tap. Keep it up Blue Ribbon!,"Sarah was our server and was very attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and friendly. The food was delicious. Happy hour menu was impressive- we loved the wings and ribs. The burrata and tomato salad was fantastic. Skip the shishito peppers. Thanks for a great dining experience!",Blue Ribbon Brasserie - Brooklyn
345,Good music and vibes. Variety of beers on tap and some good looking food optionssss. Would def come here on a date. Only negative was that their AC wasn't that strong. It was maybe like 70 degrees in the restaurant when I was there.,"I came back to try the burger. It is surprisingly good. Also this time, I didn't order a beer. That was weird. What is wrong with me?Use my Seated app referral code: JASON1080Can I say that? Will I get banned from Yelp?","#I came here because I've been using this dining app called Seated. I needed to get my rewards #bonus. I was sick and didn't feel like going out. But I needed my #bonus.Pretty good food. I used to live kinda close here, but never gave this place a shot for food. Thanks, Seated. Thanks for making me get off my butt, even though I was weak and tired. All for the #bonus. FML","It's only 5:30pm on a Friday and I am celebrating here. Well actually it's a good spot to meet up and enjoy a happy hour. Over looking the menu of draught beer, I decided to go for a usual German wheat beer. German makes the best beer and that 100% true. This place is not crowded yet with about 20 or so soul drinking their second drink for the night. After getting my drink at the bar, I can easily find a table all to my self. With about 10 to 15 booth tables and many more chair, I work on my reviews peacefully. Ambiance here is pretty chill. Just a bit close to the main traffic, you get to hear all the car and truck. Actually, I sit myself at a chair with a beautiful view of the sunset. Great spot to ease into the weekend.Beer $7, burger $14 and pleasant music priceless.","I ordered Yelp delivery for the first time from Sugarburg. The burger and fries were good and pretty standard. The mac and cheese is not as good as the pictures and is certainly not worth $15.  My biggest issue was the delivery and payment process. When you order, you pay immediately. That seems standard enough, but the restaurant can add charges to the credit card as they prepare it. So they charged me for a side again, when I already paid for it to place the order. I got an emailed receipt. Second, they didn't deliver one item on the order. It wasn't even on their receipt that came with the delivery. I had to call Yelp (Grubhub) and wait on the phone for them to give me a refund. So, for standard food and questionable service, I do not recommend delivery from this place.Update:After reading the sincere review from the restaurant  I wholeheartedly believe that many of my complaints were due to multiple variables outside of their control. While many consumers are looking for convenience, some restaurants are better experienced in person with fresh food in their controlled atmosphere. I can say that I would be willing to try the restaurant again in person.","As soon as we walked in we were greeted by Jessica. She made us feel so much at home. She even said we could sit on top of the bar, as a jest, but it was well received.  They have such a list of whiskeys, scotches, bourbons and ryes, it is extremely difficult to choose. We sat down towards the end of the front part of the bar. They just took good care of us. I started with a Manhattan and my friend had the High West Rendezvous rye. Both were well prepared and delicious. I went for the Brimstone bourbon which was the smokiest bourbon i ever had.  It almost tasted like charcoal.  I drank it like I would drink an Island Single malt, but much heavier. I forgot the other bourbon my friend had but way more smoother than what I was drinking. Jessica kept popping in and out while serving and greeting other customers. She is a doll!!",Sugarburg
346,"Faro:Tasting menu:Favorite:1.Scarpinocc (lobster, sauce Américaine)2.Turnip (caramelized onions, parmesan )3.Frascatelli (black pepper, pecorino, guanciale, egg)4.Sweet potato ice box pie (olive oil cake)Overall Faro is top-notch among all Italian restaurants in NYC!",The portion sizes are frankly insulting. $16 for three slices of a tomato? Seriously? $14 for one beet? Get out of town. There were only five raviolis in my main dish... and they were crispy. I'm not exaggerating. Our crab pasta was equally minuscule.There's a difference between al dente and undercooked. They should prolly figure that out. Very disappointed and ridiculously overpriced. Go to Otis and don't kid around.,"Came in for a quick rest stop and dined at the bar. Had the crab appetizer on the dinner menu. It was delicate, light, and well balanced in texture.","We had a nice Saturday night dinner at Faro. The restaurant is certainly deserving of their Michelin Star. After reading some negative reviews about the small portions, I made sure to ask our waiter for suggestions for our group as we had some eaters.  He did indicate some of the pastas that would be much smaller and made suggestions for larger portions that would be easier to share.We started with:- 2 portions of the whole wheat bread with cultured butter - yes, it's $6 each but a decent sized roll of bread with 4 pre-sliced portions - 2 pastas (these were probably my favorite and if I wasn't sharing, I'd consider just ordering one of these as my main as both were good-sized portions): Bucatini with Lamb Neck Sugo and Turnip Greens as well as the Chitarra with Chanterelle Mushrooms and Summer Truffle. For our mains, we ordered 3 dishes: I had the duck, my husband ordered the NY Strip special and our friend had the Halibut. We shared a nice bottle of Cab Franc that paired well with the mains and also with the the Bucatini. The duck was very nice, I asked to have it cooked medium and it turned out perfectly. I will say I felt the pastas were the star for me but tried some do the NY Strip and both were cooked perfectly. Was it a pricey meal? Yes. Did I leave feeling full? Absolutely. We did not have room for dessert. Nice ambiance, our waiter was helpful but not overbearing. We would definitely come back to try other dishes as the menu changes.","Food is great. But portions are really small. Also, the prices are insane. I don't know how this place can stay in business in such a young neighborhood. Pork tenderloin was cooked perfectly. Juicy and tender. It melted in your mouth. The squid ink pasta and lobster was great, but really small with very little lobster.I was hungry an hour after dinner. Probably won't go back. If you are a big guy, you will need to order two of everything just to be satisfied. If you are on a budget, this place is not for you .","Had dinner at Faro on Friday night. A delightful and understated Italian spot that deserves the hype it has received.Quality: Faro was a very nice dining experience. We decided to order a light red wine to go with our meal, and it worked perfectly. The first food item out was the Tuna, a crudo dish with radish, crouton, and an anchovy dressing. It was the only disappointment of the evening, with less than stellar fish. Next was the rich Duck Liver. A tiny bite, but one with wonderful flavor, especially with unexpected tart cherry verjus. For our mains we had the Bucatini and the Duck. I thought the Bucatini was incredible and wish I had ordered a second pasta. With perfectly cooked thick noodles, lamb neck sugo, and this tasty pesto it was simply excellent. The Duck was great as well. Two lovely pieces of tender meat, medium rare and served with tasty sauces.Quantity: As long as you opt for a pasta dish you will leave satisfied.Value: $16 for the Tuna. $16 for the Duck Liver. $24 for the Bucatini. $29 for the Duck.Ambiance: Faro is located in the Bushwick area of Brooklyn. An unbelievably simple restaurant, it makes everything about the food. When you enter they have a bar to the right and stacks of wood to the left. Simple wood tables fill in the dining room, and white bricks line the walls. In the back is the open kitchen, which invites all guests to peek as they anticipate their food. The tall ceilings lead to poor acoustics, but a distinct quietness allows conversation to continue anyway.Crowd: Reservations are recommended, but not necessarily required. We arrived quite early for our reservation and were seated without an issue.Service: Extremely professional and courteous staff. They did a tremendous job in pacing our meal and coordinating the wine.Parking: Street parking in the area.",Faro
347,"Very underwhelmed at this spot, which really bums me out because I was looking forward to it so much. Seated promptly when we arrived. It's very dark in there so just beware! Minimal interior decorating- looks very ""brooklyn""i found our apps (cacio e pepe and cauliflower) overly salty and nothing that special. The cacio e pepe fritters' flavors definitely work better as a pasta. As for our pastas, we ordered three (mafaldini, fettuccini, and the agnolotti) and I found all three uninteresting. maybe i was expecting too much from this place, but overall i'd say i was disappointed in the flavors although the pastas were all cooked pretty well. The mafaldini in particular tasted uninspired. Maybe it was an off day? I'm not sure, but I don't think I'll be making a trek out here any time soon.","I've come here twice and despite the hype, it is not a 5/5 place because it doesn't live up to it. Even though it's good I only give it a 3/5 because I'd expect a restaurant so nationally recognized to be, well...better. For a Best Chef nominated restaurant, I'd expect more. The Rigatoni was slightly too al dente. The gnocchi pasta lacked some flavor. I get what she was trying to do with the artichoke but it's honestly just kind of hard to eat and there isn't much artichoke. The special ice cream dessert - nothing impressive. Last time we got the olive oil cake and the chocolate torta and both were not impressive. The torta was not creamy/rich, more flaky like a chocolate cake. When it's so hard to get reservations, you'd expect a once in a lifetime kind of meal. Sorry to disappoint but that month long wait might not be worth it!","I've come here twice and despite the hype, it is not a 5/5 place because it doesn't live up to it.

We got the reservation exactly 30 days in advance through a hustle with the online reservation site. It's in a fun neighbourhood and the restaurant is a little out of place among some warehouses and apartment buildings. We got seated at the whole inside atmosphere is very lively and energetic. We picked 8 dishes for a party of 5 girls. It was more than enough!! The service was fast and friendly. My favorites were the clams and the ""pillow"" pasta bites! I also really really liked the secret off menu desert the ""Italian job"" - olive oil, vanilla ice cream and honey. Amazing. Would come back again in a heart beat. Would bring more of my friends.","I came here on a weekday evening and with reservations, I was seated right away. I got the reservations easily the night before as I had signed up for daily notifications for any cancellations on Resy.I thought the ambiance was minimalist. I mean for pictures, it does require flash. I think I would have preferred if the place was more well lit but I understand that it was an aesthetic choice. The service was great!For the food, I had the chicken liver crostini ($17). It was decadent, creamy, and flavorful-- it was absolutely everything I'd want it to be and more.We also tried the clams ($18), which were disappointing for me. The spiciness had a sort of sour taste to it which I did not particularly enjoy. Also, I would say the spiciness did not pair well with the clams and it tasted out of sync somehow.I also tried the Agnolotti pasta ($25). This is a must try for this restaurant and it did not disappoint. I loved the notes of cheese milk and honey. It was very rich, creamy, and filling.I also shared the Fettuccine with lamb ($24), which we thoroughly enjoyed. It juxtaposed well with the other pasta as they were both so different and unique. The lamb pieces were flavorful and larger than your average Bolognese pieces of meat, which I enjoyed. The sauce was slightly spicy which worked as it was not overpowering.For the dessert, I had the Italian Job ($11). The pairings of sea salt, honey, and Polifemo Sicilian olive oil were simply divine! I did see the similarity between Lilia and its sister restaurant, Misi. For the chicken liver crostini, it looked similar to the charred peppers with whipped ricotta crostini. *Although, these tasted unique from each other. The olive oil ice cream at Misi mimicked the Italian job at Lilia. Also, the butter and honey infused into the pasta held the same appeal. I am only mentioning this to say both are worth going to, if you are looking for that vibe! I loved my experiences at both of them.","Finally got to try this place and so worth the wait. Three of us got here around 5pm on a Thursday evening and waited for them to open. If you're not able to make a reservation, try to get there 20 minutes before they open and they'll probably be able to sit you without a reservation. If you don't do this, you will unlikely to be able to sit in the next 5 hours. It started to rain while we waited and someone from the restaurant cane out and brought umbrellas. Service throughout our meal was also excellent. Now onto the food...The focaccia bread IS A MUST. Our other appetizers were the cauliflower and the house made mozzarella. Both are also VERY good. For my main dish I had the sheep's milk cheese agnolotti which I was told is the cheesiest dish they have. And it was delicious. The other people I came with both got the mafaldini and I thought it was very tasty but a little dry (no cheese and no sauce). Seasoning was on point though. Would come back.",Lilia
348,"The worst restaurant I'd ever been too. Very poor customer service. The ramen that my friend ordered had a hair strand. They said that they will not charge us for this and offered my friend a small soup instead.Later when we got the bill, they still charged us for the dirty ramen with a hair strand.The owner was not apologetic and insisted that they are different.DO NOT EVER GO TO THIS DIRTY RESTAURANT. Lots of fruits flies inside the restaurant too.Beware!!! when you ask for a condiments like chili sauce, they will charge you a $1.00 for a tiny chili sauce.I WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE AGAIN.!!! THE WORST JAPANESE RAMEN RESTAURANT IN TOWN.!","This review is solely based on the veggie ramen. I have eaten veggie ramen at many restaurants throughout Brooklyn & Manhattan, and this was by far the worst I've had. The broth and the noodles were extremely salty. Would NOT recommend.  I ordered chili oil on the side to try to counter the saltiness but even that didn't work.My sister ordered the tonkotsu and enjoyed it though.",Drove out here expecting something magical cause I see a lot of raving reviews but I don't know I didn't get it.I think service places a huge part in how you will like a place we walked in stood for a couple of minutes maybe they need to put a bell or something so they are aware when people come in. So we just decided to sit by the curtains I see a girl eating she sees us. No acknowledgement if you can't help us please just ask someone who can...Since she isn't doing anything I just took a menu myself and made me feel so awkward and bad like did I really come here to serve myself..The duck bun was good and so was the pancake But the ramen was forgettable we got a spicy ramen and a shoyu. The broth of the spicy ramen was good. The shoyu tasted off and the pork has an abnormal sweetnessThis place is also cash only.Maybe we came in on an off time but I definitely wasn't super pleased.,"Great place for quality ramen and bao buns! I would recommend coming here with a date or small group.The setting is very intimate, all the walls are lined with wood, and cute decorations. The menu is super simple and straightforward so it's easy to just choose a ramen bowl, some bao buns, or what a few other apps. The duck ramen is very fatty and delicious and flavorful. Seafood ramen also was nice. Will definitely come back- the service was chill and welcoming","I love ramen, so  I try to visit them all. This place was one of them. This place is definitely not memorable, I enjoyed their chicken wings more than the duck ramen. Super tiny place with good service but not up to par.

349,"This is exactly the kind of place I keep lamenting that we don't have in Park Slope. The food was fantastic and the service was so friendly. I had a dinner date here with my 10-year-old who fell in love with the rice balls and the cod fritters.  I was head over heels for the chicken liver pate in the pickled eggs.  And the sausage and sauerkraut with cheese toast were perfect on an arctic night. Service was so friendly, the atmosphere was hip but not overwrought.  We loved it, loved the service and can't wait to return.","I found this place really overpriced for the quality of cuisine. Willing to try it again and order different dishes, but overall my boyfriend and I couldn't figure out what the hype was about!","$9 for a weak pour of wine- I think not. If I'm going to pay that price then I expect a generous amount per glass. Sorry to say, that's a dealbreaker for me.","Love hitting this place for Happy Hour on the way home. A great rotating draft and cocktail list. Last week we tried the $20 Monday Margarita and Chips deal. The chips were good, salsa very nice, and totally worth it. We stayed for dinner and really enjoyed that too. My husband got the Flat Iron Steak. Surprise- it comes with bone marrow! Why don't they advertise that!? We saw someone with it a few weeks back and that's the only reason he ordered it. And I got the Chicken and Spinach Sausage. Cheese grits and bacon jam, yes please.

Consistently great quality food with interesting/innovative twist to the menu. I love the shrimp burger, lamb burger and gnocchi. The service is always great - cheerful and attentive. It's a great neighborhood restaurant but also a place to bring guests who love fine food.","Amazing food, great service and delicious drinks ! Made a reservation here for 7:30 on a Friday night. My boyfriend ordered the lamb burger which he's still raving about. We started with the country toast with ricotta, perfect for sharing. I got the gnocchi and we also got an order of mussels. For drinks we had a carafe of the Tuscany rose and a flight of negroni's.Service was extremely attentive and seamless. Can't wait to come back again !!",Krupa Grocery
350,Brunch time:  My friend and I did Brunch celebrating our birthday. We both ordered from the Brunch menu.  I was not impressed with the food. Everyone seems miserable.  The atmosphere was boring. I will not be coming back.,"we order take out for the lobster brunch and connecticut roll.  The connecticut roll is ok, no source.  The lobster in the brunch is ridiculous small portion, 5-6 finger tip pieces, with egg and taco in a regular mexico style.  Come on, for $15?  It is definitely overprice.  I wouldnt even pay $10 for it.","The Bloody Mary is 10/10. This is a must have, folks. CP Pro tip: grab a bloody at the Lobster Joint and then walk down to smorgasburg for a nice afternoon.","I came here this past weekend after me and my boyfriend went on a sailboat ride along the East River (thanks AirBnb experiences)! A little fun factoid we heard along our boat ride is that a person can safely eat one fish a month from the East River. So we had our one fish and then left for an actual dinner (just kidding). But we did decided to make it an all around nautical night. My seafood-loving-heart can almost not handle the deliciousness of Lobster Joint. It's a very cool place, with plenty of tables and a covered backyard complete with a giant swordfish, projection screen and plenty of picnic tables. You order at the register inside and then grab your number and head to a table. I went for the crab cake sandwich. As delicious as it sounds. It was warm and fresh and was a perfect size so I was definitely full. It also came with a side so I went with the mac and cheese. It was good but not the best, I thought it was just the tiniest bit bland. Next time I'll go for the corn or fries. Next time I go for a boat ride in the neighborhood or simply am craving good seafood and a backyard, I'll be back. Definitely recommend!","We came here on a Friday before Labor Day weekend. The place was empty which was perfect because we had a stroller. We ordered the New England lobster roll, corn on the cob, lobster grilled cheese, a beer (some kind of ale, said the husband) and a margarita. Everything was delicious except for the corn and the margarita. There was so much lobster in my lobster roll (def more than Luke's lobster!) The corn didn't have corn taste and the margarita was just kind of plain. Should have gone for the Bloody Mary since there were signs that they won some sort of award... but it's hard for me to say no to tequila. We sat in the backyard and the inside was super well AC'd. We'll be coming back!","This place has amazing customer service and is managed very well in all aspects that I can think of. They're clean, both, inside the establishment and outside. Their staff is friendly, efficient and purposeful even on a really busy/chaotic day. The food is arguably as tasty as any other restaurant specializing in lobster/shellfish, if not the tastiest. Lastly, they're reasonably priced as well as conveniently located.Nothing makes me want to support a restaurant more than being treated with the Platinum Rule: Treat Your Customers As They Would Want To Be Treated. And, that comes from excellent management doing their due diligence and making the happiness of their top priority. Great work all around. Keep it up and you'll be seeing a lot more of me. Cheers.",Lobster Joint
351,I'll give 2 stars only bc my 1st visit wasn't this bad..We ordered one fish and shrimp quesadilla (each $17) and they gave us 4 small-med shrimp full off cheese i asked for light cheese (fish) and as you can see they did not listen...plus the fish was salty I will not be returning,"Doesn't serve chips & salsa, chips and salsa are all served separate ... over $10?! Backyard smelled like garageService was terrible & slow Burrito fell apart within seconds, barely and meat inside was filled with rice and beans.Fajita steak tacos were ok, the steak had a lot of fat on them.Very disappointed & will not be coming back.Come on BedStuy, we're in need of a good Mexican restaurant!!","So sad  I had to reak up with tepache. I've been a loyal csutomer since they first open. The customer service and the food has become hard to swallow. I keep ignoring the bad reviews because anyone is allowed a bad day people, chefs and servers. But after 4 horrible orders Im done! My bill was $28 for 2 plain quesadillas that arrived looking like someones left overs. When I called to ask what happened with the Guac I was informed the $12 plain quesadilla no longer comes with Guac, please update your menu! For the next customer. I've Included a photo of the very sad grande quesadilla....not really grande.","Good music, quickly sat and served drinks, burrito Asada was delicious and the meat was very tender. Large portion, was full but still ordered the flan. Flan was sweet and heavy. More condensed than I'm used to but otherwise great. Place is clean, design is cute, well taken care of. Would go or order again many times.","Stopped by for a delayed taco Tuesday dinner on a Wednesday. We sat outside in their lovely patio space. There's plenty of seating and the high fencing makes you feel like you're actually sitting on the back patio of a friend's home instead of a busy street corner. The outdoor setting was my favorite thing about Tepache.I ordered three tacos: stewed lamb, carnitas, and chicken guisado. The corn tortillas were among the best I've encountered. They were moist and didn't fall apart when I took a bite. The meat, however, left a lot to be desired. The flavor on all three was lacking strength. Aside from the unique taste of each meat, there really wasn't much to distinguish one from the other. I added their (very spicy but good) salsa to all of them just for some flavor.The menu is quite large and they seem to specialize in burritos, which are gigantic. They're a little pricey in my opinion, averaging about $16, with tacos being $3 each. Tepache also doesn't sell alcohol. All in all, I could be convinced to return to try a burrito since the additional ingredients could mean more flavor, and the outdoor seating is nice. But it wasn't enough to dethrone my favorite place for tacos.","I really loved this place. This was my go to taco spot, now i feel like i have to find another taco spot which sucks! The customer service was amazing! I was greeted when i walked in, tended to immediately. The place for was fairly empty for 430 in the afternoon. It wasn't busy, and they all seemed pretty lax which is good. I ordered and received my food rather quickly as well. No complaints there at all. So i get home to eat my tacos (which I've been craving forever and a day now -_-). I originally wanted to make the trip to Banhmigos. But decided against the 30 minute trip, and went with Tepache since i know how amazing their tacos are. I guess since i haven't been there In a while, the food has changed. It's not the same. For starters, i ordered 4 tacos. It came out to 14.35 or something around there. Pastor (no pineapple, just spicy pork), steak, carnitas, and grilled chicken taco. I live about 7 mins away, and when i got home, 3 out of 4 tacos were completely soaked from the mountain of lettuce they put on top of the crispy taco. I asked for pico on the side so that it wouldn't make the tacos soggy. I never would have thought that the amount of lettuce would be the reason that my tacos are now just a big huge mess In the aluminum container. That definitely made me take away 2 stars. Imagine eating tacos with a soggy shell? How!?! Idk. I had to basically eat just meat, because the shell was now wet at the bottom of the container covered in cheese , wet lettuce, and radishes. To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. I really really really loved this place, and i still do. But, this was definitely not okay. The food left a bad taste in my mouth. Not because it was nasty, but because i wasn't able to enjoy it in how it was supposed to be enjoyed. All in all, great customer service. Fast service. But all in all presentation was a solid 3. See photos below. I forgot to show the carnitas and pastor before i ate them because i was super hungry and annoyed about having to eat my tacos with a fork and spoon. Tacos with a fork and spoon! Never a good idea. So into my last grilled chicken taco that i saved on purpose because it's the only one that made it out safely from that horrible wet lettuce.",Tepache
352,"Nice and Spicy Jerk chicken .... it's cooked Fresh out The Fridge and Put on the grilled as watch you get cooked ,ill definitely recommended to come to eat, Real Jerk Chicken Jamaican Restaurant very convenient by mta transpiration:Subway:2,5-Train Church avenueBus:B44, B35","This is probably the only Caribbean restaurant in Brooklyn that I can swear by.  The food is always good. I recently became a vegetarian and I came here after a long day at the salon.  It took about 20 minutes for my number to call for them and then they dished out my food.  Overall, I deducted one star because of the wait.  There has to be a faster system.  Also, I asked for a small container to pour out sauce.  They charge extra for that.","First time retuning here to get a small jerk chicken dinner in over 6 years. I was highly disappointed. The quality went down. The rice was clumped and dry and the jerk chicken had no flavor. I even added the sauce they had in the squeeze bottle on top of the counter, before they closed up your meal. That didn't make the food taste better. Sorry to say, but they severely fell off. I should've know they went down when I passed by and there wasn't a line. All the best WI spots on a Sunday afternoon have lines.","The food is good! Not the best curry chicken that I've ever had, but it was pretty good. The portions were large, and it made for 2 meals. The plantain were made perfectly, I'd go back just for them!","I've literally been buying jerk chicken from this   spot for at least 18 years! As a Brooklyn girl with a strong connection to East Flatbush, I can say that outside of the Caribbean, the area  has THE best West Indian food! And THIS particular spot has the best jerk chicken. And it's always fresh off the grill, cooked right in front of you. They also have the usual rice and peas, ox tails, macaroni pie (baked mac and cheese), fish, vegetables, etc. I've had several other items on the menu and they're all good, but most times I'm satisfied with chicken.Be warned, the place is small and in the winter, it can get a little steamy inside. The process is to place your order with one person who gives you a number (on your receipt) and then wait til your number is called. At that point, they give you an opportunity to put any sauces on your food (self serve) before they close it up. Note that only cash us accepted.Again, after two decades, I'm still sold on their jerk chicken!","I must say I love almost all the food options on their menu. I go here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. For breakfast my go to is codfish and bakes or porridge. They are both delicious. For lunch or dinner, I go with the jerk chicken of course. The restaurant can get super crowded so be patient.",Exquisite Delight
353,"Stopped by for dinner on a Saturday, place was empty. Nevertheless we were told we could sit down but would have to be finished in time for a 730 pm reservation. Fine and really no need to even say that given it was only 530 pm (strike 1). They were out of the lamb (strike 2). The steak tacos were tender and flavorful and the best dish, skip the greasy, tasteless pork. Finally, we opted for churros for dessert and we were served zeppoles instead, with no dusting of powdered or cinnamon sugar, along with a runny chocolate dipping sauce (strike 3). A Mexican place that serves an Italian dessert seems confused about its identity.  All of this in tapas sized portions for entree sized prices. Servers were attentive and ambiance is trendy. This is a one and done place for me.","Very underwhelming--after reading good reviews it was surprising how mediocre this was.Of the dishes we had, the only one that was great was the coke lamb ribs. Meat falling right off the bone. Not stellar because the sauce was barely there, but the meat itself was just great.Other than that, the dishes were average or, in the case of the Brussels sprouts, barely edible. Carrot tamal, octopus, kohlrabi salad, mahi mahi tacos, mushrooms-- all fine, but clearly not worth the price or even less. Tacos were dry, tamal was lacking in flavor, kohlrabi had nothing going on, octopus had no seasoning, mushrooms were...like something I could do in my kitchen in 10 minutes. What is going on here? So disappointing.","The menu is schizophrenic at best. Not worth the hype or the cost. Yes, it's cute and it gets busy but the food doesn't have a real identity or flavor. By the name you would think the menu is Latin American but Latin American food has flavor and, sadly, the food they serve here does not. If you don't like your food to be seasoned and want to spend $40+ a person for ambience, then by all means have dinner here. For all my people of color, what I'm saying is that this place is for the wytes with wyte palates.","I am an expert in Mexican food, and generally something fails in Mexican restaurants in NY, I can tell you that in my visit to Alta Calidad I did not find any fault!  The guacamole, rice and beans were spectacular!  But the best of the night were my delicious Steak Tacos, the right tortillas and very well seasoned steak!  I highly recommend this place!Muchas felicitaciones a Alta Calidad!","I've been for both brunch and for dinner and the food was solid. For breakfast I had the steak and egg breakfast tacos. The crispy cheese on the tortillas is really good. Plus they have a deal where you get one entree and 1 hour of unlimited mimosas, margaritas, bloody Mary's or beer for $31. For dinner my boyfriend and I shared the octopus and pork belly dish, the steak tacos and the shrimp tacos. The breakfast steak tacos were better but the octopus dish was my favorite overall (sorry not pictured I ate it to quickly). The place is pretty small, but both times I went I was able to sit within a few minutes without a reservation. Also, there is outdoor seating when the weather is nice. Great neighborhood spot that I definitely recommend!","Open table res for brunch. Started with the guacamole and salsa which is served with round and flat tortilla tostadas - good flavor with a little kick!  Hubby and friend enjoyed their cocktails (el jardin and margarita), I got a mock tail. Papas bravas could use more sauce and were cut a little too thick to be crispy. Shrimp tempura tacos were delish along with the steak and egg tacos!  Hubby got huevos divorciados which he enjoyed.",Alta Calidad
354,"You can always count on a good meal at Westville X. I say ""X"" because, if you didn't already know, Westville is a small local chain with locations in Chelsea, FiDi, East Village, Hudson Square, Dumbo, and the West Village (duh).If you eat out a lot in New York City, you know it can be tough to get your veggies in. When we feel this way, we know a cure is to be found at Westville. Whether for brunch, lunch, or dinner, our favorite thing to order here is a plate or two, or three, of 4 market sides to split with the whole table. We've had just about every fresh veggie on that list, and the seasonal rotations are great too. I am not a die-hard vegetarian or vegan or anything like that, but these veggies are just _that_ good.When we are looking for something else on top of the veggies, you can't go wrong with their Mac & Cheese or Burgers, but seriously, get some market sides too.Only downside is that the prices, while not super high, are not super low either.","I would usually give Westville a 5 star rating for food and service, but today's experience is the exception.  My husband and I eat here at least once a week and for today we were seated outside. I did not know that they allowed pets outdoors.  There was a couple across from us who allowed their dog to sit on the table where they fed it.  This was not a seeing-eye dog.  I get it people love their pets, but for those who have allergies to them, they make me feel very uncomfortable.  I let one of the servers know but she did not tell them to not allow the dog on top of the table.  I finally let the 2nd server to ask them to keep their dog on the back side of them and she asked them to do so.  It's just unsanitary to allow pets on top of the dining table outdoors or not.  I hope that servers sanitize the table before the next diners are seated at the same table.Overall, they should put a sign that dogs/animals are allowed in outside seating area so customers are aware so to avoid eating outdoors.  I see more and more favoritism to animals than people --go figure.","BEWARE: they fry their French fries in the same oil they fry bacon and fish!!!!! I just spoke to them and the manager said that it was the case.     I ordered a vegan quinoa burger for pickup and they put French fries in same container and all over my vegan burger which has no indication on the menu about coming with fries. The fries taste nasty, and are non-vegan.    To top this off, they did not bother to offer me a refund or anything of this kind. They've lost a me as a customer, I used to go to Westville a lot, in the village mostly, but because of absolutely horrible customer service and misleading advertising I cannot make myself eat there again!","I like westville dumbo. There are lots of place to eat near dumbo, but not so many place good to go. Wedtville dumbo serves comfort american foods. Seating outside and drinking beer is my favorite.I visited last night with my friends. We ordered burger, nacho and fish and chips + two picher of beer! Burger was good enough and Nacho was really good. Chicken and cheddar cheese good match my beer. Staff were very kinds and frendly. We will be back!","Great place for some comfort food, especially after day-time barhopping in DUMBO. We visited Westville as a party of six and were able to get a table pretty fast (and without a reservation). I had the fish n chips and ordered a side of mac n cheese. Both dishes were absolutely amazing. The fish n chips were perfectly fried and not at all super greasy. Also, I do not believe anyone had anything negative to say about their food. Plus, Westville has a bunch of veggie options. All in all, a great dining experience was had by all. This is definitely a great place, with decent prices, to dine in DUMBO.","Rating: 3.5/5Westville's ample selection of vegetable laden dishes and farm to table motto make it a great choice for someone who's embracing a healthy, sustainable lifestyle. This location has a covered, air-conditioned patio in addition to an outdoor seating area. I decided to go all out with the vegetables since that's what Westville is known for. I had a market plate of roasted cauliflower with tahini, pesto mashed potatoes, and mixed mushrooms with leeks & herbs. It's a pretty impressive platter of veggies that definitely fulfilled daily fiber requirements. What was less impressive was the flavor of the vegetables. While they were very fresh, they needed a lot more seasoning. I found myself sprinkling more than Salt Bae would onto my mushrooms and cauliflower. The pesto mashed potatoes were definitely my favorite, although I would have liked the pesto flavor to be stronger. I added generous amounts of Tapatío hot sauce to give it a nice kick. The cauliflower tasted undercooked to me. It had the crunch of a carrot.Overall, Westville was a bit disappointing to me. I think it's a good option for a healthy meal, but not amazing.",Westville Dumbo
355,"Not bad, def not great. Annoying having to wait 20min. for a table when I had a reservation. Add that to a gnarly, earthy tasting rosè (ordered a red and waitress didn't even ask why the rosè went untouched), and saltier than i would prefer food..Sadly, won't be going back anytime soon.",2.5/5 Overpriced and extremely ordinary food. Little gem salad and the pasta were quite disappointing. Lemon ricotta pancakes were good. Will not go back.,"Unless you're exceptionally wealthy I can't recommend this place.You shouldn't leave a restaurant hungry.  This is one of the easiest and most important things for a restaurant to get right but after visiting Fausto on two separate occasions I've still been so hungry after eating both an appetizer and an entree that I then went around the corner afterwords and had a slice of pizza (I'm a 155lb, 5'11"" man with a fairly normal appetite).I've eaten fancy and expensive tweezer-ish meals.  I've had Michelin tasting menus in Europe.  I get it.  But this place is just a horrible value.If their pasta dishes had just three or four more adult-human-sized bites in them I'd gripe a bit but the food is so good that I'd still probably come back.  But for such an expensive meal to have such outrageously small portions is just silly.  Great food and service but absolutely astonishingly and outrageously bad value.","I've been going to Fausto for over a year now and it never disappoints. I rarely go to the same restaurant twice, but Fausto has major replay value for me. Everything is made with consistent quality, service is great, and the interior is beautifully and thoughtfully designed. It's my go to spot for hosting out of town guests, as well as dining alone late at night. The flavors are always bright, fresh, and interesting, and I love their seasonal additions. Things I've enjoyed are: farrotto, mushroom pasta (all their pastas are great tbh), little gem salad, market fish with fregola sarda, all their desserts, and their orange wine.",Good food!!!!! Strong and good serviceI've been trying to eat mess meat but they've been very accommodating. I ordered calamari as an appetizer then pasta as an a tree. Pretty food.,"Book ahead on Resy and don't complain. If you have to wait. Be sure to get an Aperativo and also the Orchiette. The wait staff and bar tenders are perfect, as is the food (if you love delusions, rustic Italian).",Fausto
356,"Alright, I'm writing this review because I walked into this place with my boyfriend blindly without checking Yelp beforehand and we didn't know what we were getting ourselves into. So here's what you should know:1. There's no physical, visual food menu. Instead, a (likely very bored) server comes around and asks if you ""want to talk food"" and then scribbles the menu items on the paper that covers the table. She verbally mentions a few of the ingredients in each dish, including the fact that they charge extra for tomato on a burger. The writing is illegible and it makes no sense why the restaurant doesn't just print out menus each day. They're not saving any trees (or anyone's time, either) with this table-paper-menu-writing idiocy.2. The service is a joke. Our waitress sounded super bored and bitchy the whole time--and listen, I've worked in service so I know how it can be sometimes, but I felt as if *I* would be doing *her* a disservice by asking her to repeat the menu. She also forgot to bring us a beer we ordered, during which time we saw her bringing drinks to other people's' tables, and by the time we asked for the check, she said: ""Did you ever get that beer or just chug it really fast?"" Uh, no, there's no beer on the table so clearly we didn't get it. After we saidno (politely and respectfully, without the attitude i'm showing here), we thought she'd at least offer one on the house, but nope. 3. There's no sign for the bathroom; it's tucked away near the kitchen area, beyond a swinging door, and the bathroom the first door of three. You might accidentally walk into a stairwell if you don't know exactly where the bathroom was ahead of time (our waitress just said it's ""over there""), and how any regular customer would know that is beyond me. Overall, this place was a total waste of our time and money. We were expecting some level of dumb bougie Williamsburg hipster bs considering where we were, but not quite like this. Luckily, you're smart and looked this place up on Yelp ahead of time unlike my boyfriend and I, so you should pat yourself on the back! And then don't go here.","Expensive for what you get, small menu, not a ton of vegetarian options. Didn't like that the waitress sits down and writes the menu on the table, it's incredibly inefficient",Terrible experience overpriced mediocre food. Went with boyfriend. As soon as we sat down the waitress told us about how much she hated writing down the menu on the table and how humiliating she thinks it is (we did not ask) ordered a cesar and the bass. The fish came ONE HOUR AFTER we ordered!!! The people next to us were complaining about their plate having too much paprika to the point they couldn't eat it. No one apologized.,"This is one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The restaurant is small, it's an old train car they've converted into the restaurant and it's super cute with no frills. We had a 630 reservstion on a Wednesday and the restaurant was about half full.We were recommended to try something called the ""orange wine"". It's like a white rose, it's made with the peels mixed in with the grapes and it was delicious. I highly recommend it.Diner has no menus. Your waiter comes over and explains that nights specials and writes everything down on the parchment paper on your table. Most appetizers range $16-20 and the entrees were around $25-35 with the burger which is always on the menu for $23.We split the broccoli tempura to start which was served with greens and feta ($17) and was so yummy. For mains I got the duck with ratatouille ($30) and my friend got the burger ($23). My duck was good but I'm just gonna say it, that burger was the best I've ever had. I extremely regret not getting it myself and I'll definitely be going back to get it","Fantastic food! Get the buttermilk chicken sandwich if it's available!Service and ambience are good, too. I don't recommend the appetizers (priced too high), but the entrees are great.","Good food. Menu changes daily but we had a buttermilk fried chicken sandwich that was wonderful. Sausage with mustard cream fraiche was fabulous. Everything was great except the toast. Airy, hokey bread had too many air holes but taste was great. Service was great. The waitress with the blonde dreadlocks was funny, attentive and got it right. Decor was authentic complete with old tiles and curved ceilings. Try it, really good",Diner
357,"this review is not about the food the place serves. but about how this well reviewed restaurant gives a rats ass about the community and the neighborhood. i see their garbage on the sidewalk as i walk by every night.. malodorous smells at its worst !!disgusting !the garbage bags ripped open with foul smelling food waste pouring on the sidewalk.. rats and raccoons attraction..and it all happens inches away from the outside seating section.Chez, you might have good food, but your relationship with the neighborhood is awful and you should be ashamed of it.step up Chez and clean up after yourself !","Came here for some pancakes at breakfast, and there was a 1.5 hour wait for 3 at noon. We were committed, so we walked around the neighborhood until they called us when the table was ready. The menu is a list of brunch foods with little to no descriptions, so we really had to rely on yelp photos to picture what we were getting. Everything around us coming out from the kitchen made us want more than just pancakes, so we ordered the Sausage and egg sandwich as well for the table. I could live and die by these pancakes, they were some of the best I've had - perfectly crispy and buttery, covered in maple syrup. The egg and sausage sandwich was good, but not the table favorite.","What a great way to lose weight and save money! Just eat here once and you won't want to eat anything for weeks! I got pancakes. Pancakes are supposed to be fluffy happy light clouds. These were not. These were heavy, thick bricks of oily sadness, saturated with syrup - i mean DROWNING in it. Gross. Didn't come with fruit or anything to cut through the grease and sugar grime. Basically it was a plate of obesity. Thanks guys. Also thank you for the room temp water on a hot summer day- really classy hipster bs. Much appreciated.The ""chips"" (guys, we're in NY- they're called fries) come with aioli - which tastes great but was suspiciously room temp af. This probably contributed to the earth spinning nausea that my friend and I endured once we left this special little death trap. (Guys, can't leave that stuff in room temp without it going bad).  Cherry on top was the 900 times we were asked if we were done eating despite clearly still eating fries and drinking our half full drinks- mimosa is pretty visible- you should be able to tell that the glass isn't empty so no we are not done. All that pressure to gtfo their hell den even though they had open tables. Don't go here.","Finally came back, this time for brunch. Reservations were super easy to make, even on the day of. Tried their famous pancakes which kind of reminded me of like a looser cornbread, with crispy exterior, and while it was good it wasn't something that I'd crave. What I did love though was the kedgeree, which is delicious and light and flavorful (also available at dinner). Quiche was fairly normal. Straciatella was also very good (in case you're wondering, it's not ice cream, it's a creamy delicious cheese dish). Rounded all the food out with a celery soda from their drinks menu which tastes just like celery and seltzer water (if that's your jam. turns out it's not mine).Also love the vibes - it's the perfect place to sit outside for a casual / low-key weekend brunch with friends.","Had an excellent meal here on a Friday evening. Was able to get seats at the bar despite no reservations.We got leeks as a starter that was an amazing surprise. I've had plenty of leeks before sliced up and stir fried as a Chinese dish, but the preparation here was completely different, with the leek cut into short chunks of the same height, then drizzled in a sauce / oil and topped with hazelnuts. The sauce was what really brought the whole dish together as the leeks were nice and tender and then slippery from the sauce. It was really good.Then for the main we got a chicken dish. It was a generous piece of flattened chicken, very tender if a seemingly simple dish and the sauce once again clinched the dish.All in all impressed with all the dishes and want to come back to try the kedgeree (and I suppose the famous brunch pancakes).","Finally went to the acclaimed restaurant that we had heard so much  about. Ordered the famous pancakes and wow what a sham!They were heavy discs soaked in maple syrup...so sugary and sweet like eating a super syrupy cake for breakfast. Unhealthy AND unappetizing.Wasted $15 bucks. If that's what ppl want for brunch, so be it...and the restaurant can continue making this kind of crap and laughing all the way to the bank. Hard to comprehend the hype and success of this place.I for one will go elsewhere for pancakes, etc.",Chez Ma Tante

Will definitely come back on my next trip.","I ordered a shrimp burrito for pickup. There were maybe 4 shrimps in there and the rice and beans inside were tasteless. I also ordered no cheese but guacamole instead which cost extra. Unfortunately, I don't think any were actually in there which made the burrito dry. I've tried this place a couple times before and the tacos and bowl were good so I'm hoping this was just a bad day.",Hooray for taco Tuesday!!!I love a good hole in the wall taco joint. This place is small but constantly busy. I came here this evening with my friend and saw so many deliveries and pickups going out the door. Al pastor taco:Perfect slices of meat and well marinated. Tinga de pollo taco:Chicken was moist and well seasoned. Carne Asada torta:Didn't get to capture it a picture but the flavors were packing! Maybe just a tad bit overcooked for me but really no complaints. For these 3 items our bill only came out to $15. Can't beat that price for dinner for 2. I would definitely come back for their burrito or enchiladas.,Bruh. Super good. That's all....I had the shrimp taco (camarones) & the vegan/potato one. It was pretty good. The green salsa has a perfect amount of lime in it and the guacamole was bomb. Two filled me up. Fresh water available too.,"This place was quite good for some take out Mexican! It tasted like a more authentic version of Chipotle, with way more options. You get to build your own creation which is fun and the prices are very reasonable. You can decide between a taco, burrito, quesadilla, burrito bowl, etc. and fill it with whatever protein and add-ons you like. I got the chicken tinga (spicy chipotle chicken) which really hit the spot. The burrito bowl comes with rice, beans, and pico de Gallo, and I added guacamole for $2.50. The whole thing came out to about $11, well worth the money! I will definitely be returning soon.",Bushwick Taco Company
359,"Nothing special, they were cheap with the portions, bread was plain with no seasoning as I would expect from a Greek restaurant, very skimpy with the lemons, waiter was unfriendly. They were even skimpy with the napkins. Food was okay. I think there was about 10 pieces of fried calamari on the plate. You can tell they are actively trying to cut costs. Overall unimpressed all around.","If I can give a negative star, I would. Staff was rude as they mocked our orders to how much we wanted to get.  Also the bus woman gave us attitude when we asked for an extra utensil because we wanted to share our food.  How we eat our food is nor of your business, not like we're making a mess or causing problems.  "" what?! you want to SHARE the food?"" Oh, and yes I know you guys were mocking and talking about us when you walked away and standing In the corner, smirking and making eye contact to other staff at our way.   Never in my life have I experienced such attitude among service staff.   I had read other people's comments on the rudeness but thought I'll get a different experience, guess not.  Btw, the food was not great.  Only salad was good. Not coming back.",Amazing food. Not sure why others are complaining about the service. Found the service very personable and quick.,"Really nice place on a rainy Tues night. Got there kind of late (9:15 - kitchen closes at 10) but they were very friendly and took good care of us. 2 of us split a fried calamari, an Athena salad, and a shrimp pasta w/ ouzo, along with a bottle of Greek red. All quite good (calamari and Garides Ouzu were excellent).$99+ tip.",Love this place! They take reservations on Opentable and seems very kid friendly. It is a big open space and even has a second floor. It seems like you can easily reserve space for an event here. I got the moussaka and it was delicious. It was like a lasagna but heartier. We came on a very hot day and they had the AC blasting and it was great. We stayed for a very long lunch and no one rushed us to leave. The service was great! Prices were fair and moderate. My friend got a salad with lamb and it looked really good. I tried a piece of her lamb and it was amazing. I would definitely get that next time. I want to try more of their desserts next time I come. I would definitely recommend this place!,My wife and I went there for dinner Sept 28th 2019. Everything we orders was very good and I would have given them a higher rating but I ordered a dish with filet mignon in a stew over linguini what I got was beef short rib meat. Don't get me wrong it was good  but short rib and filet mignon are two different textures.,Faros Restaurant
360,"There's no need for me to make up a story like that, i been to a few places were the service wasn't good and thats ok not every place is good. But you can't lie just bc you want to defend the place you work for, He was drunk and drugged and even the waitress was scared of him,  he is the worst person you can have behind the bar, He  even said it himself that's the reason why he doesn't work Saturday nights ""(because he gets drunk and aggressive) and thats exactly what happened that night and i should of let the cops handle it. Me and my boyfriend eat out every  day i only go on yelp to comment about my local favorite spots but the bar you work for is just something else never seen anything like it. You should of just apologize, because  no matter how much you want to deny It happen, if you really did checked the cameras and spoke to the people that was there that night you'll know im not making up a story, like honestly there's  no need for it. You clearly just defending the guy you work for so its ok keep doing your job, and good luck ....","The mos Horrendous experience of my life,  this place has potential but the customer service is horrible,  the owner has drinking and drug problems and was working the night me and my boyfriend made the mistake and decided to try it out,  at first he was nice but we did noticed how drunk he was we ordered food and drinks and they were o k , we did wait a long time for the food but it was alright i guess, 45 mins later the owner was spilling drinks making comments about putting drugs in people's drinks and just turned into this horrible rude person, long story short he got to the point were something happened in his twisted head and started yelling to the top of his lungs GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY BAR repeatedly over and over and even tried to fight my boyfriend we paid our tab and even while we were walking away he was cursing at us and was saying he was gonna get a baseball bat or something like that to hit us so i had to call the cops but at the end my bf handle the situation by calming him down and talking to him like a normal person and other clients too, and there were saying how hes always like that, the most humiliating night of my life for no reason we did nothing wrong. So i advise you Not to go to this place ever .  HORRIBLE","Quite underwhelming food and frustratingly terrible service. If you're considering going here, take a second and look at the photos in detail. Every photo seems to be posted by the same person.","Best homey-vibe, soul-driven, southern comfort you can find! A stone's throw to North and South Williamsburg, right off of the Lorimer L. The influence of authentic southern bbq is carried throughout the rustic decor, alternative music, and hearty food and drinks that leave you wanting more, despite not leaving room for dessert. My date and I sat on their back patio covered by wooden trellises and custom benches, lit by hanging string lights, on a Saturday night. It wasn't too busy since the weather wasn't favorable, but the server didn't mind serving us outside; a nice surprise. I ordered their Mezcal Negroni, which was mixed to perfection and moderately priced. We shared their gobstopping, gooey and well-portioned mac n cheese, which was served in a cast iron skillet preserving the everlasting simmering cheese. I opted for the pulled-pork sandwich which was drenched in flavor and served with a heaping of handout crispy fries; thick-cut just as they should be. My only negative criticism for the food was the sesame bread bun which seemed too soft for the indulgent sandwich - I think a firm grill press could help. Nevertheless, it did not disappoint.All in all, the server was a perfect balance of Brooklyn-hipster and professional, the food delivered across the board, the decor is gracious and surprisingly not kitsch, and the prices are on the money- spent $36 total with tip. This one is high on my list for Williamsburg favorites.","Came to Northern bell due to the fact my regular ""go to"" bbq place had a private party.  First of a""lol, it's not a true BBQ restaurant as the menu is quite varied and even has Mexican food .....Anyhow , they have a great outdoor area , plenty of craft beers , and a varied menu. I must say , the BBQ items are rather limited , so this is affectsmy score ( only one bbq sauce which was homemade but very good ... but just one ) Started with the Mac and cheese with bacon which was good and then moved on to the burger which was very good and fries which was ok . My friend had the brisket with  with beans and the fixings.All in all , a good place but not if you want true BBQ . Service was adequate","Went here on a random weekday with my BF. It's a typical bar looking place. Nice place to go with some friends or a weekly date night or to watch a sports game. They had a taco deal that we did not partake in (we simply were not in the mood for tacos)We ordered the wings, ribs, mac and cheese and fries. Wings came with a dry rub paired with a banana maple sauce and homemade ranch. Banana sauce was unique and super sweet. The homemade ranch had a strong mustard taste, no my cup of tea.The wings were dry and I wouldve preferred they come wet. But honestly nothing spectacular with the flavor of the wings. The ribs were a dry rub as well and didn't stick out, they were okay. There was homemade BBQ and hot sauce on the tables. The BBQ sauce had a a strong mustard taste just like the ranch, again not my cup of tea. But it made the ribs a bit more pleasurable. The mac and cheese, I didn't like at all and that's just preference on my part. The fries were actually the best part of the meal. They were hot, crisp and salted nicelyOur waitress was the sweetest (wish I remembered her name) unfortunately she was on her own with a bunch of patrons that night BUT she did a great job nonetheless. Her and the fries are the only reason why I'm giving this plain tasting establishment 3 stars tbh the food was just really lacking. Not worth the money.",Northern Bell
361,"Just all right. Quality of food is inconsistent. The main reason to go here is proximity to the park and the lack of decent options on this stretch of Flatbush. I've never played pool or other games in the front room, because it doesn't seem very relaxed. The layout is all weird. Like, why is that stuff in the front room where everyone walks through? Anyway, the overall vibe and concept of this place is good; it just seems like everyone needs to put more effort into what they're doing, or start charging less.","I like a lot of things about this bar. It's gigantic [for Brooklyn]. The staff is pretty awesome. There's a pool table. TVs for the sports-watching. Solid selection of alcoholic beverages. A nice menu with varied options. It seems as though it's good for groups, as well as dates.Unfortunately, the wings are not great (and they were the only thing I ordered besides a beer). I went with the pineapple BBQ option (as opposed to Buffalo), and as soon as they arrived I knew I'd made a mistake. It's a very sizable portion for $10, but the skin was soggy, and the thick sauce just dumped on top. Cooking wings is all about crisping up the skin, otherwise you're left with flabby, unappetizing fat. I'm ashamed to say I couldn't even finish the order.So check Bluebird out, but maybe avoid the wings.","This place is surprisingly huge. It's a weird block, so there's a bar/restaurant area as well as a loungey area. And there's a downstairs, where someone was having a private party the night I went.They also have a pool table. It's $1.50 for 4 games, which is ridiculously cheap. There's also foosball.Cocktails are fine. They have a wide variety of things, including DIY San Pellegrino cocktail (if that's not a sign of gentrification, then I don't know what is).I had one of their winter cocktails - a hot toddy variant which was okay, but not great. My second (and last) drink was the Divine Intervention. It was my last drink because it was S-T-R-O-N-G. Our waitress even warned me, but hey, who can turn down a cocktail with Scotch, vermouth and chocolate bitters?All in all, great bar to hang out. Saw a few people on dates, so I guess it's good for that too.","This is my go to place for a quiet spot to play pool while enjoying a drink. But that's not what we're here for. The food is fancy comfort and I say that deliberately. I seem to consistently go with the Fancy Grilled Cheese with bacon. It has Irish Cheddar and comes with McIntosh Apples and a tomato relish. Not something you want to eat on a full stomach as it is pretty heavy. I also really like the drinks, although this fad, I've stuck to the margaritas during happy hour. The Guava margarita is TO DIE for. The house margarita is actually really good too. I wasn't a huge fan of the mango, but it wasn't bad either, hence my 4.5. Now back to the pool, it's pay to play: I think it's 50 or 75 cents per game, which really isn't that bad. Also, I really just love the laid back atmosphere here. The restaurant proper has a fireplace going, and is toasty. You can't go wrong here on a simple night out with friends, or just by yourself like I tend to do. As always, happy eating and drinking-- Marie-Madeleine.","Came here last night. UGH. I hate awkward and offensive situations like what I encountered. An old friend who's a local/regular brought me in for a couple drinks. I was excited to be out and in a really good mood ready to get my drink on. As soon as we entered the bar section in the back my friend was greeted by the runner/bar back. I later learned his name was Sekou. (YES, I'm naming names.) Short stocky LOUD black dude. He sees my friend has his hair slicked back and kinda jokingly is like ""Oooo look at your hair blah blah slicked back"" and aggressively reaches to touch it??? Like why?? My friend jerks his head back understandably in a ""don't mess up my hair bro what are you doing"" way and then this little man loudly says ""WHAT ARE YOU A BLACK GIRL??? I CANT TOUCH YOUR HAIR???"" Haven't even had a seat at this establishment and already the nonsense. Do I even have to articulate why that comments was inappropriate, stupid, ignorant and offensive???No man OR woman, white OR black would want your grubby barback hands in their fresh clean slicked back hair. Just don't come here. Major weird vibes, crappy food and inconsistent drink quality.","I have been to Bluebird mant times. The food is a bit inconsistent, but can be very good. The atmoshpere is always nice, and the drinks good and reasonable priced. Last time we I was there, there we saw two rats on the back patio. The most troubling part was the lack of surprise or apology from the staff. The manager should have come over. They should have comped our mean or at least pay for a round of drinks. Nothing. Just a shrug of the shoulders as they walked away...",Bluebird
362,"I had the absolute worst restaurant experience of my life last night at Piccoli Trattoria. My roommate and I made a reservation for a party of 2. We showed up for our reservation and were put in the corner of a shared table, squished between the wall and a mother and her child. My roommate asked the waitress if we could move tables and she said no because there was a wait. We were literally looking at open seats that weren't crammed between a wall and child. I told the waitress (who was quite rude) that we needed to move seats. We did. We ordered 2 cokes, the calamari, and 2 orders of the mushroom fettuccini. Another waiter brought us our cokes. My roommate took a few sips of hers before I noticed a bright green blob at the bottom of the cup. I used the straw to bring it up to the top of the drink and it was USED HARDENED GUM THAT HAD A FOOTPRINT MARK ON IT. My roommate was on the verge of tears, as was I. We showed the waiter and he said he would get her a new coke. We said we were disgusted and that this was not okay. He came back with the new coke and said he was the one who poured the original one and swore that it wasn't in there and that someone must have walked by and put it in and even insinuated that we may have done it ourselves. I've never been more humiliated and disgusted in my life. We did not plant that in our own drink and it was buried in the cup under all the ice. The waiter said he would comp us the cokes. We were mind boggled. In my opinion, anything with chewed up, used, hardened gun that had been stepped on and put in a drink deserves a fully comped meal or something close to that. My roommate and I decided to stick the meal out because we were in a rush to go to a show and didn't have anywhere else to go eat dinner. Our calamari came and it was inedible. I think rubber would have been more tender. We both were chewing it for 10 minutes before being able to swallow without almost throwing up. We ate 2 bites and couldn't eat any more. Normally I'd take leftover food and give it to a homeless person but it was so bad that it would be offensive giving that dish to a homeless person. After a long wait, our fettuccini came. It wasn't bad until about halfway through I noticed the top part of a straw wrapper in it. I thought maybe my straw wrapper blew into it but both my roommates and mine were still on the table so that couldn't be it. We didn't even bring this to the attention of the waiter because it was clear he thought we were doing this on purpose and went out of his way to make us feel uncomfortable. Our check came and only the 2 cokes were comped. I've never not tipped in my life, no matter how bad the service, but this warranted it. I've never been more disgusted in my entire life over something in food and I've never been somewhere with such bad service. Their receipts literally say ""Love us on Yelp"" which was even more appalling. I woke up today with food poisoning and a genuine hope that no one ever experiences anything like that ever again.","Left a harsh but truthful review on here last summer after the restaurant lost my Seamless order and then gave me attitude when I called to ask about it.  This sort of mistake or miscommunication happens from time to time, but the way the restaurant handled it really rubbed me the wrong way.  Zero apology, hostile attitude.  It stuck with me.  I rarely use yelp but checked it today and happened to notice that the manager (Andres) decided to reply to my review and posted my cell number with his reply!  Not exactly professional.I do remember the food being good when I was here several years ago, but obviously I won't ever go back to this place.  A restaurant is only as good as its management.  This guy apparently thinks it's ok to post customers' personal information online and accuse them of lying when he's unhappy with a bad review.  Yikes!","Honestly I never write reviews but the experience I had with this place was appalling.  The food never arrived so I can't review it, but I did get a whole lot of BS and attitude!  I placed an order for delivery on seamless, waited an hour, food never showed.  Called the restaurant to check in, very rude guy picks up the phone with an attitude and says the delivery guy came to my apartment and waited for 15 minutes (a straight up lie-- I was sitting 2 feet away from the intercom and it didn't make a peep) and that the guy doesn't feel like coming to deliver the food tonight.  No apology, no offer to make things right.  Just excuses and shitty attitude.  It was like I had greatly inconvenienced him by trying to get the meal I had paid for.  Really strange.  And it's too bad because I used to come here a few years ago when it first opened and the food was pretty good, but the service makes it just not worth the price.  There are hundreds of other Italian restaurants in Brooklyn.  I definitely won't be visiting or ordering from this one again.","Truly one of my favorite spots in all of NYC. Stumbled upon this cute corner location after moving to the neighborhood and have been totally obsessed since. Staff is great, quick and responsive to what you want and ask for. What to order: any of the specials, mela salad, Gorgonzola/bruschetta, black spaghetti, nonna ravioli and always a must - the almond flour chocolate cake *drooling*","Guys,this is incredible! Last time we've been at Piccoli Trattoria, we ordered calamari and we were simply impressed oh how delicious it was. This time,we ordered squid ink risotto and this was impressive! Exquisite and delicious meal and looks like nothing we've ever tried before. Place itself is lovely, very cozy. Stuffs are friendly and they also have very good Italian beers. Definitely coming again!","Probably my wife and my favorite pasta spot in Brooklyn.  The bolognese is absolutely out of this work, as is the eggplant dish (name escapes me) my only small critique would be in the timing of the service. It's very slow- but not bad! And there is a huge difference. All the staff is great, it sometimes just takes them a little while to get back to your table. For instance I had to get up and find someone to ask for the check after the desert course. My recommendation, go on a Friday night, order a bottle of wine, sit back and relax. Even pretend you're in Italy- won't be hard.",Piccoli Trattoria
363,"I just...cannot get into this place. Have been here for lunch and dinners, since they opened, years now. I have never been impressed. Nothing has improved. The service is often dizzy, and occasionally even snarky. They have trouble seating people in a timely, efficient manner. You'll walk into an empty restaurant and they will have no idea what to do with you.The food: look, I just don't know. Sonic Youth is a band that everyone likes. Daydream Nation is a classic. Unlike My Bloody Valentine, or Jesus & Mary Chain, I can't pick the melody out from the noise, it's just a taste thing. It's a taste thing here too -- I cannot pick the melody out from the noise.I find the pizza greasy and bready and scalding. Their ""famous"" burger (if they deign to have it!) is another bundle of grease, and it's just...nothing special. The fries are nothing special. It is nearly 30 bucks. You are paying marked up prices for middling diner food. I don't get it.Detroit Pizza: still not clear on what this is. Years later, still not clear. It is just deep dish pizza, yes? But...like...named after a raw, blown apart, troubled city.That's the only thing that makes sense to me here.","This pizza is 10. This is the kind of pizza hot girls prance around snapping selfies of themselves on Instagram. It's the sexiest slice of deep dish you'll ever devour. Pies run around $20-$25 and feed 2. It's impossible to come here and order just one thing. We split Le Big Matt, which was really good. I've probably frequented Emmy Squared 20 times and I've only ordered the burger once. Their pizza is just so out of this world that I can't justify ordering the burger. Their white pies are the epitome of food Porn.","Very good pizza, but too salty in my opinion.  If you want a deep dish pizza go to Emmy's.","While I don't think the pizza lived up to the hype of being one of the best in New York (don't get me wrong, the pizza here is good just not one of the best in this pizza crazy city), the burger most certainly did.We split the burger and ordered the Big Ang pizza and the Roni Supreme.  I'm normally a minimalist when it comes to burgers, but all of the toppings on it complemented each other very well, the burger was cooked perfectly, and the toasted pretzel bun put it over the top.  I actually did not mind spending $25 for this burger.  It also came with a generous portion of waffle fries that were seasoned well and what must have been house made ketchup.  The ketchup itself was very delicious and had a little kick to it which made me come back for more.As for the pizzas, I guess Detroit style is like smaller Sicilian.  The Roni Supreme was solid and the pepperoni was high quality (not like the processed junk at most pizza places).  There was spicy chili sauce in the middle of each slice that gave it a little kick (but not too spicy so that it overpowered it).  This was my favorite pizza.  My only suggestion would be that they spread the chili pepper sauce a little more evenly.The Big Ang pizza looked great on the menu, however, I found it to be lacking a lot with the meatballs and it had too many banana peppers.  Additionally, I thought it had a vodka sauce but I couldn't really taste it on mine.  Despite all of this, still a decent pizza.Overall, I will definitely come back for the burger.  It's sublime.  The pizza is good, and I will try different pies here in the future, but I wouldn't make a special far trip here just for pizza (unless you're getting the burger too).",I love this place! I have been a number of times with great success. They have so many varieties of pizza there is truly something for everyone (except maybe gluten free).One note: drinks take FOREVER as they have one bartender for the bar and the whole restaurant. They could really work on this.UPDATE: THEY HAVE GLUTEN FREE OPTIONS FOR PIZZA!,"Two visits- one bad, one good.The first time, we ordered the colony and the emmy. The colony was mediocre and you couldn't taste any honey. I really didn't like the emmy because it was covered with way too many banana peppers and the taste overpowered everything else. I returned to try the le big matt burger but ended up trying the colony again from my friend. It was much better than last time though the pickled jalapenos were too hot. The burger isn't the best I've had but it is very good.",Emmy Squared - Brooklyn
364,"Worst restaurant ever. I've ordered from them numerous times and they always F something up. Last time I ordered the rice bowl with veggies, and they forgot rice.Another time they gave me someone else's order, and I called them they came back with mine. But clearly didn't remake it because the soup was ice cold.","I've ordered take out here several times. It's usually tasty, but a bit heavy on the sauce.   The order comes reasonably fast too.This last time I got real sick from it. I had the bulgogi beef and it lead to the worst diarrhea I've ever had. Two trips to the bathroom tonight and I feel another coming on. I know there's always a risk with take out, but this  time is exceptionally bad.","Give it one star because the food came in a nice container.  Our food was delivered, my pork dish was extremely cold and fatty, could not eat.  Was too annoyed to call and complain, took the loss.  My husband ordered a beef dish said it wasn't that great, later that night ended up with diarrhea.  Very bad experience.",Solid place for lunch and banchan.

I had the spicy beef bowl and my son had the bulgogi beef bowl, with an order of shrimp. My spicy bowl was very flavorful, but could have done with a few more veggies. Son finished his ( good sign).

Our experience started with pissing on the street outside since they dont have bathroom. More disappointment when the owner refused to let us wash hands in the sink which was right behind him. I wonder if he understand hygiene.. When I tried to explain him that we couldn't eat with piss hands, I got yelled at infront of customers and most importantly my family and kid. I tried to calm down the situation but he was a total nut case.Food: No one was able to enjoy their famous chops with dirty hands. Burger was raw from inside! They didn't even bother to ask how we wanted it cooked.","BK Jani was a total stumble. I was killing time while waiting on my now go-to barber (after many bad haircuts in Bushwick ) Jani and me exchanged some convo about how everyone claims to have the best burger or best pizza etc but in my eyes most of them use that lango to lure you in. Jani was super confident about his product. I for one have tried many burgers around NYC and I only thought highly of one place but have been trying out many places to see if I can add another favorite to the list, for years! Look man don't look any further - this has now become my new favorite spot - trumping the old one. I told Jani - it was like my favorite one was missing a formula I didn't even think was needed and Jani just happend to have the potion! F'ing juicy, flavorful and will catch you off guard. This burger isn't for the faint of heart lol - it's ingredients plus the way they cook is what won me over. As a Latino I love me some flavor and they got the punch! I won't stir you wrong - definitely go check them out and order your burger spicy and medium rare - don't be a punk! LolP.S. there's one thing about confidence in product I learned that day between my new Barber and this place and that is that great every day products are not always easy to find. Especially when you're looking for precision! I agree the burgers are pricey, others have said that burger ""looks so plain"". Man listen I done ate burgers that look pretty but have the ugliest soul . As far as the price - not overpriced - the quality is there and people will keep on coming because of that alone, regardless of the price!","I'm a returning customer. No problem with the food at all, delicious as always. BUT this time, ""the bald headed guy"" in the counter who took orders (instead of the lady, whom we found regularly on our previous trips) had such a negative attitude that I just felt like canceling and just leave right at that moment. It was as if he just didn't like us or the way we look or the fact that we had kids with us. I had this trip planned with my kids (not toddlers or babies) and didn't wanted to ruin the rest of their day. I kept my cool while ordering amid his constant interruptions making us feel as if we had no idea of what we are ordering and that also with his head shrugging and eye rolling blatantly. We almost felt as if he was enjoying demeaning us. After I finished paying, I asked him if he knew where the nearest mosque was as it was nearing Asr time and I hadn't prayed Zuhr. He said ""no idea"" in a raised voice even before I finished asking him the full question, attracting attention from the other guests sitting in the nearest table. It's not only the food, it's the service as well that creates the whole impression and the entire experience. May be he was having a real bad day but I wasn't ""paying"" to get a share of that. Very disappointed.","What an absolutely perfect beef burger. Hands down the best in the US by far. And if you understand Urdu, you'll love the comments on the walls. Burger mast hay Bhai!",BK JANI

The restaurant only takes cask which kept my options limited since I only had $5. I got a pork tostado. I was honestly left disappointed, there was nothing special about the sandwich. Everything just tasted like it was out in the bread not as if each item complimented each other. The best part was the restaurant had affordable pricing. I don't see myself going back, maybe to try one other item but I'm not rushing back over.","Wow, this has to be the worst Mexican food I've ever had in my life.

So embarrassing.",My boyfriend and I live in Bed-Stuy pretty close to this place and have been here often out of convenience. It is by far the worst coffee place in the area. The coffee is watered down and the staff is rude. There are much better coffee places just a short walk away.,"I cannot believe I hadn't written a review for this place yet since I used to go here daily.Even now that I live a little further away, Stonefruit is my go-to. And I want to recommend you go there, but I'm afraid you'll make it even busier! Not only does this place have good drinks, great food, and a cute interior, it's also a PLANT SHOP! You win me over if you have nice plants, so I guess that's why I don't mind when the weekend line is out the door.The staff are really kind- TJ is my favorite new guy. They have a TON of vegetarian and vegan options that are all fresh and unique. The avocado toast (with the egg) is my go-to but the monk bowl is also bomb.It's a good vibe and they do have quite the breadth of knowledge about their plants and art-y pots.Thanks Stonefruit","Super cute interior with the plants in the back room, but the lattes were just okay. I ordered the lavender vanilla latte and while I could taste a little bit of the lavender it felt more like a last minute addition and less like a harmonious complement to the espresso.The milk was a bit too foamy (felt more like a cappuccino than a latte), and there was no latte art if that's something you look for. The service was excellent and they had samples of the gf brownie at the counter (pretty good!)Overall, love the ambience but the latte itself was nothing special","I would have given this place a 5 star.First of all, the atmosphere is great. And they had a monk bowl that was life-changing - a gift from the vegan Gods. Literally the best bowl in Brooklyn and also the best bowl I've ever consumed in my life.  For whatever reason they decided to remove the bowl from the menu and then added a new bowl with literally just rice and beans and some diced tomatoes and then added it to the menu calling it ""the monk"" bowl. So you understand: They changed the entire bowl but kept it the same name?  How in God's name is that ethical? What if I was allergic to the new ingredients? Imagine going to store and consistently buying a ""house special cappucino"" but then all of a sudden... they change how they define the term and now it's a matcha latte. Well, wtf.  A new menu item deserves a new bowl. Also even if keeping the old name was okay, the new cuban dish makes no sense with the title ""Monk Bowl"" as it's not a European/Rome dish at all and quite frankly has nothing to do with Monks at all.",Stonefruit Espresso + Kitchen
368,"Looks like nothing special. It's all about the food isn't it? Absolutely. If I wasn't so full I'd eat again. Nice staff too.Update 3/17: Part of the wishbone were chopped up and in the mofongo. I asked the waitress if this was normal (I'm a culinary tourist and don't pretend to know everything). She said no, and I added I wasn't asking for a break on the bill. She did check with the kitchen but I didn't hear back. I had liked this place so much a week ago but I can't recommend it. This time the same dish I had a week ago was nasty.",dining here was not a good experience for me an my family. First waitress was rude right from the start. We ask for water she totally ignored us. Another waitress took al order she was much nicer. Food was ok but the service was really bad. Some thing I never seen before my avocado salad had Romain lettuce an iceberg lettuce weird.  Salmon was very salty. Chicken dry.  $60 not worth it.   First waitress was just rude I should have left but decided to stay big mistake.....,I ate here one day and it was really good the next time I went I'm not sure if it was the beans or what but I got really really sick. Didn't go in to work the next day thanks gran Castillo.,"El Gran Castillo never disappoints. It will always remain my number one go to for Spanish food. With reasonable and fair pricing, excellent service and quality preparation, you can never go wrong! I have been coming to this restaurant for years, even before they moved to it's current location and everything has remained consistent. If you are ever in Brooklyn or even in the mood to travel from the outer boroughs..you won't be sorry that you made the trip.Thank you to the staff for always making a visit here a pleasant experience!!!!","How many El Gran Castillo De Jagua's are there in Brooklyn???  I pledge eternal allegiance to the Parkside/Flatbush location, but was stoked to see this additional outpost!This spot was definitely bigger and had more tables, BUT seemed to be serving the same Castillo magic (even if it did lack the castle/knight/mace/battle axe decor we've come to love and expect at the Flatbush location)!  The ONLY reason we ended up back at the Parkside location for dinner was the whole rotisserie chicken for $8, which we couldn't find on the menu here.","This is a no frills neighborhood spot. A few friends and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night. We were seated immediately at a round table in the center of the restaurant. The atmosphere was friendly and lively. For my drink, I had the sour sop shake. Sour sop is a type of tropical fruit and I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I ended up loving the shake! Pure white in color, the taste was reminiscent of citrus yogurt, with hints of pineapple. It was satisfyingly thick, extremely creamy, ice cold and very refreshing, somewhat sweet but not overpoweringly so. Absolutely delicious! I decided to order steak with onion and peppers. This was decent, but the steak was not what I was expecting. It was broiled or baked steak, thin and a tad on the dry side. There was a little bit of seasoning, but there could have been more. The entree came with salad and a choice of sides. I liked that entrees automatically came with salad, which consisted of lettuce, tomato and cucumber. The vegetables were nice and fresh. I went with the plantains, however I was served with the sweet plantains. I had meant to request the tostones - savory, crisp plantains. Our waitress was very accommodating and understanding. She came back with the tostones and garlic oil sauce. The tostones were so tasty - thick, crunchy, flavorful and the garlic oil made it even better! The plantains were also good - Perfect chewy, moist consistency and slightly caramelized, giving it an additional level of yumminess.Our waitress was great and made sure we were taken care of. Everything came out in a timely manner. Prices are reasonable, portion sizes are generous and menu is extensive. I would come back for the soursop shake alone! There are definitely other menu offerings that I would like to try.",El Gran Castillo De Jagua
369,"Just ordered the beef pho. The portions were generous, the beef was tender, and the noodles were cooked well. But the broth tasted odd, not fresh. I've even plenty of pho and the broth usually makes it or breaks it for me. I'm sure their other dishes are tasty and will have to give them a try in the future.","This place is a joke. Caller at 4p and was told they were closed till 5pm for lunch, called at 5:05pm and asked for delivery and I was told they don't deliver and I would have to use and app :o/ also told we would not be able to order till 5:30pm. Hungry can't wait, going else where. Thanks for wasting my time :o/","Waited 20 minutes to be seated on a table that was empty since we got there. Then we waited 40 minutes for a cold appetizer. Then we waited another 45 minutes for our main dish, but since it didn't arrive we left a bill to pay for the appetizer and left. Food seems that is good but service sucks.","The food is so so good! Shakin beef is out of this world. I love also that their veggies are not an afterthought, but shine in their own ways.If the weather is nice, the backyard is a good place to spend your time.","Went here with friends for lunch. The food overall is good. I've had many a papaya salad and this one was average as I couldn't really taste the papaya very well - ingredients lacked flavor. Lemongrass tofu on top not as crispy on outside and soft on inside as I've had elsewhere.The vermicelli bowls were much better. My friend and I both had curry ones - the curry was fragrant, floral, and spicy - highly recommend. My partner had excellent pork imperial rolls on top of his vermicelli - they were crispy, salty yet slightly sweet. Vietnamese iced coffee was phenomenal and fun. Service is kind.","Went here for lunch while visiting Brooklyn and was not disappointed! We got the papaya salad to split based on a yelp recommendation and that was a great decision. The salad was light, fresh, and a little spicy if you added the jalapeños on the side. We each got Bahn mi, I got the lemongrass tofu and he got the bahn mi cari (curry). His was more flavorful while mine was lighter. Both tasted amazing, with freshness and crunch from pickled vegetables and avocado on mine. The tofu was pressed and cooked very well so no texture issues. The sandwich was giant so we were able to take some to go as well! We also tried Vietnamese coffee there (great) and Beerlao dark lager (really great). The server was extremely friendly, he brightened our day and also gave us more information about Beerlao in general so we could find it later.",Falansai
370,"I came 20 minutes after opening time, the gate was half opened but door closed. After waiting 10min, a employee entered, I asked if they were open and he responded rudely ""don't you see the closed gate?""I asked about the opening time, he said today was special and wouldn't open until 2 or 4 pm. There was no sign about it.","Okay food and terrible customer service. I was excited when a friend informed me about this establishment. I'm 9 months pregnant, was hungry, and tired. Our first inquiry before ordering was if there was a bathroom and we were informed there was.  After ordering the 1/4 chicken with collard greens and garlic potatoes (x2) the young lady who took our order was asked to inform us that the bathroom was only for employees. As mentioned earlier, I was extremely hungry and chose to eat the food we had ordered albeit having a full bladder was extremely painful in my condition. The worst part was the food...definitely not worth the pain I endured.  I rather patronize Boston Market as their food is tastier, cheaper, and they provide access to the restroom.  I will ensure to inform my church, colleagues, and friends in our neighborhood not to support this establishment.",Great food in an area that really needs it. Service is a bit slow but overall the flavor of the chicken alone overshadows it,"Phenomenal.  Everything is delicious.  Our delivery orders always arrive quickly.  I'm especially fond of the okra, stringbeans, chickpeas, and collards.","Meh.Everyone thinks they can do chicken, but not everyone can. This place can't. Rubbery chicken, really off seasonings that don't really stick to or flavor the meat? All of the seasoning just kinda - slides off leaving bland chicken behind. Their sides are also pretty forgettable.And $17 for a (mediocre) half chicken is laughable.","The food was so tasty. I ordered online and walked over to pick it up. Preordering was a bit of a waste as they assembled my meal when I arrived. I went with the quarter chicken option with lula bird rice and collard greens. The chicken is the star of this show. The cornbread was unique and tasty. The rice was solid. I would definitely pass on the greens next time. Those were pretty disappointing but Lula Bird offers lots of options for sides so you can certainly select an alternative. I also got the spicy sauce which accompanied the chicken very well. The staff was pretty nice as well.  There isn't much of a dine-in option available, so keep in mind that this is best left for those evenings when you want to eat someone else's cooking in your home.",Lula Bird
371,"This is some of the worst Ethiopian food I've ever had. The gored gored were these big chunks of beef chuck, which were grey and far too tough to chew. They were sitting in a barely spiced bath of clarified butter. If you're going to use beef chuck, you have to cook it until it's tender. You can't cook it the way you cook sirloin or some other cut. I'm honestly surprised at how bad this was. The rest of the food was similarly flavorless. Just very basic vegetable dishes without any spices or aromatics or, well, flavor.Go elsewhere.","I am not sure what happened to Ghenet -- but no Meat Combo choices are available anymore, and the single serving meat offerings are small and overpriced, and I'm not sure why strips of chicken fajitas with green and red peppers (not an Ethiopian dish) are pretending to be Doro Tibs and are on the menu. This is simply not the way Ethiopian food should be prepared.It seems like there has been a change in ownership. Yeworkwoha Ephrem seems to have moved to New Jersey and I am not sure who is at the helm in Brooklyn. Maybe a Mexican cook who thinks fajitas are OK as Ethiopian food. And that is sad.","I became extremely sick after eating here so consider yourself warned. The bathrooms were GROSS which is usually indicative of filth elsewhere such as the kitchen. We only ordered vegetarian options, no meat. So it wasn't undercooked meat. Insult to injury (literally) the waitresses were OBNOXIOUS, rude and insulting. They ignored our table  - no after refills, no asking if we wanted another glass of wine, while they sat at the bar. I would have forgiven that if I didn't get so sick.",Our favorite Ethiopian restaurant in the Tri-State area. We've been going here for close to 10 years. Amazing food and service. Love the space. Nice and SPICY! The only bad thing is that don't have gluten-free injera ... but that doesn't merit knocking off a star.Don't forget the Honey Wine ;),I lived in Eastern Ethiopia for over a year and this place is the closest I can get to authentic food without actually flying back to Hadar to eat. Lamb tibbs are SO GOOD. Their shiro is top notch. And the fact I can get St. George made me tear up the first time I went. Go eat there. You won't regret it.,"My dinner experience here was quite mixed. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the service we received from our waitress. I found about half the items on our platter to be quite delicious, and the other half were all lacking in either flavor or texture. When we arrived, every table was full, and there was a party ahead of us waiting for a table. The hostess told us, ""Give me a few minutes,"" but she never seemed to act on that. After about twenty minutes, one party left, and the folks in front of us were seated. It was only then that the woman who eventually waited on us came over to us directly, and then she proceeded to lead us to a back room we didn't know about, which was completely empty. I don't understand why they couldn't do that sooner, or why the hostess didn't instruct someone else to seat us there. As the evening went on, other parties were seated here.I think it would be an improvement to the menu to indicate what comes with some of the dishes. We spent a lot of time debating how many vegetable sides we would need to add to provide enough food for our group, only to have our waitress tell us that for our tibs plate, you could also select 8 of the 10 vegetable sides to accompany it. Among our dishes, I found the yebeg tibs to be quite tasty and well prepared. Ghenet also featured two vegetable sides I have not yet seen anywhere else, engoudaye tibs (mushrooms) and yedubba watt (butternut squash). These were delicious. The cabbage and green beans were fairly standard. The collards were unbelievably bland. All of the other lentil and bean dishes were essentially soupy, as if they had been overcooked, pureed, or stretched in content to fill the pot. You couldn't scoop them, it was more like dipping your injera into them. The injera was also very light in color, a light beige, and somewhat rubbery. Perhaps they use a somewhat different recipe, or more wheat instead of teff. I noticed that several of the more recent reviews reference things changing, and not for the better, in their reviews. This was my first time dining at Ghenet, so I have no prior visits of which to compare it. But I can make comparisons to meals at other Ethiopian restaurants I've had in NYC. Based on my experience here, I'd dine at Ghenet again, but I'd only give it preference if I were already in that part of Brooklyn.",Ghenet Brooklyn
372,"The food is a actually very good, although I would say the brunch menu is not very impressive. I'd def go back again for dinner and try a few other things on the menu. The service was just ok. It was a bit slow a times but our server made up for it with the continuous pour of mimosa.","I honestly think they can't cater to a large group. The food took forever to reach the table and when it did only half the group got their food, finished eating while the others mine included didn't come. The only possible conclusion that came to mind was that they had to actually go fishing in the back for salmon. The manager never came to our table to apologize for the wait, there was no complementary shots or beverage and nothing shaved off on the bill. I wouldn't come back to this establishment... my food came at 11 when we got there for 8pm.","I went here for Sunday brunch and boy, it was the biggest disappointment one could ever experience. For starters, the food was inedible at best. I ordered the ""Traditional Breakfast"" which was supposed to be ackee & sailfish, callaloo, and green bananas. The ackee and saltfish looked like a mush or something pounded into a paste. No self-respecting Jamaican can eat that and be okay with the mockery they made of our national dish. The callaloo clearly wasn't fresh; it seems like they tried to cut corners by serving canned callaloo, which is a shame, because fresh callaloo is readily available in Brooklyn. Additionally, they were out of green bananas so they offered plantains as a replacement. To my chagrin, the plantains was also a hot mess. How can someone eff up plantains? I understand that not everyone knows how to prepare ackee & saltfish or callaloo, but plantains, that's the most idiot-proof thing to do. The plantains they served were sliced thickly and looked like they were then dipped in oil for a few seconds. They were soft and inedible. When I thought that things couldn't get any worse, after viewing my check, I noticed that they illegally added on a fee called ""non-cash"" fee. People, if you see that on your check, do not pay it. It is illegal!! Take this from someone who worked for the City of New York at one point, and is familiar with consumer protection policies etc. I informed the waiter that this was a shady business practice and that I will not be paying said fee. Furthermore, how can you charge a ""non-cash""fee without knowing how the customer is going to pay? To the owner of this establishment, you have a very far way to go. This restaurant has the potential to do good, to make a name for itself, but without the ability to perform basic tasks like preparing an edible meal for your patrons, I don't envision long-term success. Tacking on illegal charges to one's bill is a BIG no no. It's a shame that you try to support a local (maybe minority-owned) business and this is how they want to rip you off. This restaurant deserves to be shut down because ""uno nut ready yet!""","The overall atmosphere of this restaurant is great, very modern and clean. We decided to sit outside because it was such a beautiful day. There were a few leaves that fell onto our meal but hey, a little extra fiber never hurt anyone. We ordered an appetizer of Mac and cheese and it was great, nice cheesy crust on top. I ordered the brown chicken stew and it was fall of the bone good. I didn't even need a knife to get the meat off. The chicken was very tender and I loved the flavor of the sauce. It was perfectly complementary to the rice. I even finished all the veggies since it was drenched in the sauce and that never happens! My friend ordered a jerk chicken roti and that was great as well. The mango chutney had a sweet and spicy flare to it and it worked very well in the roti. The avocado was a nice, modern twist to the traditional jerk chicken. I also love that fact that it was wrapped in roti, it made it a much less messy experience than usual. The waiter was very attentive and often checked in on us often during our meal. I was a little surprised by how long our food took to come out but I can't complain anymore after trying the food, well worth!","Came here for a late night bite on our way home after an alumni happy hour on a Friday. We got to sit outside since the weather was nice, which was great because the music was very loud indoors.My boyfriend got the island burger and I got the corn & pumpkin soup as well as the fish tacos.The burger was a little dry (we suspect they use 85/15 ground beef), which was fine for my boyfriend but would be harder for me to eat. He enjoyed the flavors in the burger, especially because he has been craving pineapple on a burger for years now. But all in all, was it the best burger he's had in Brooklyn? No. Would it do in a pinch? Yes.As for the corn and pumpkin soup - this was probably the best dish we ordered. It was flavorful without being too rich and heavy. My one big complaint was that the corn was cut up in slices still on the cob which made eating the corn really difficult. Would've been better if they just cut the kernals into the soup directly. Also, small thing, but the soup could've used a fresh squeeze of lime (which I was able to do because the fish tacos came with a lime wedge).The fish tacos were just fine. (They are cod by the way.) The fish was overcooked and dry. The flavors were good but it was just kind of a dry taco and didn't really wow me. Would be worth it to get during happy hour though, at a lower price.We want to come back and try more of the food for sure so I'm sure I'll have an update!","I stumbled upon Imani during a random stroll through the neighborhood and instantly bookmarked it as a place to try in the future. I was impressed by the energy of the patrons seated outside, the restaurant's large footprint, and curious to see what was inside and on the menu.I was NOT disappointed. I mean the place was gorgeous - the bar, spiral staircase, huge pieces of art depicting black women, the shelves of liqueurs, and the outdoor balcony. Have you fallen in love yet? Now it did take a bit of time before our server walked over to our table. Based on my observation, there was only one for the entire level including outdoor balcony seating. It's date night and the ambiance at Imani was just right. I was already envisioning a girls' night out at the bar or milestone birthday celebration. The appetizers were an eye-catching, mouth-watering preview of the main course. We ate with our eyes (at least my husband did) when he ordered three appetizers to share. The Caribbean chips and salsa (avocado, cilantro, tomatoes, mango, papaya, pineapple and plantain chips) for $9; curry chicken bowl (grilled chickpea roti) for $12, and the jerk chicken tacos (shredded lettuce, mango pineapple chutney, lime) for $11. Perfecto!Now, we were ready for the grand finale. Hubby had the oxtail stew (butter beans, cipollini onion, baby carrots, rice & peas) for $27. I was debating between the island burger (caramelized onions, pineapple, cheese, lettuce, cassava fries, jerk mayo) for $16 and the beyond meat burger (plant-based burger, vegan cheddar cheese, vegan garlic mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, red onions, and sweet potato fries. Now I will be straightforward and admit that the latter was only an option because I did not want chicken and waffles but wanted those irresistible sweet potato fries. After I sought the server's recommendation, who happened to be transitioning into the vegan lifestyle, I was sold (with one adjustment). I swapped the vegan garlic mayo for the jerk mayo but later wished that I had also kept the vegan cheese off too. We did have an Imani's rum punch (wray & nephew, lime juice & seasonal fruits) to accompany our meal, but I preferred something sweeter.I was floored by the combination of flavors from my vegan burger that were dancing on my palate. YES! *screams* I had no regrets and THOROUGHLY enjoyed my sandwich. My husband could not believe how I just devoured my meal.lol.",Imani Caribbean Kitchen & Bar
373,Delicious with a really cool lunch special. Of course the app portion was small but that's to be expected right?They charge way too much for a mocktail. There's no alcohol in it so why is it $7? UGH! I can't resist a lychee anything. It's my Achilles heel. The downside is that I went there a week ago and totally forgot about the experience or the food. That's not good.,"Very hip spot and the food was exceptional! Both me and my date enjoyed our plates. We will be favoriting this place for a must go again if we are craving Thai food. Very reasonably priced. Someone mentioned that this place didn't serve alcohol, but they did have a drinks menu.","I'm not even lying everything I ordered was good...............,.............................................................................  They won't let me post to short","""I like Thai food. It isn't my 1st choice when linking up with friends, but I like it.""~~ That's what I use to say before I had the food here.... OMG, I LOVE THAI FOOD! Well at least theirs...lol.So after walking by some many times and actually wanting something besides Cuban, I decided to give this place a try. I figured Thai is Thai...I was oh sooo wrong. I think this places uses crack or something of that nature b/c seriously this is some of the best Thai I have ever had. Now for me I'm pretty simple with my order and may be the wrong person to ask, but if your want curry puffs and Thai fried rice I'm your girl. Curry puffs have just the right amount of curry and chicken..so good. The rice is just sooooo good. I've had some bland needs all the sauces rice before... this rice needs NOTHING. This place has become my 2nd go to when ordering take out. Maybe I'll get something with a noodle to expand my Thai taste buds.","Tried to go to one of the more trendy restaurants on Vanderbilt and were turned away, so Nourish was our backup choice. We were a decent sized group and wanted to sit in the yard, so they took our number and our table was actually ready pretty quickly (about 20 minutes).The place is really nice and modern, and the yard is the real star. Nothing like spicy food in a backyard. The portion sizes were pretty ridiculous as well. I got the spicy half chicken with papaya salad and almost couldn't finish. But I powered through because I'm a champion!We had the soft shell crab and spring rolls to start, and they were all delicious as well.Overall a great addition to Vanderbilt!","The best pad Thai My lady and I have had in New York. Recommend starting with the spring rolls or steamed dumplings. If you like it HOT, then order hot but if you don't like it HOT, best stick to mild or medium. My baby turned me on to their Thai ice tea and I've had a different on the world every since. Order one and try not to slug it down.",Nourish
374,"The lobster rolls are pretty yummy and I did have a decent amount of lobster in my serving. I do prefer a Connecticut style roll, and they don't offer it. I like that the lunch combo comes with your choice of a drink including the Luke's lemonades and teas, though I personally wasn't a fan of the one I chose :( (blueberry lemonade). There's also a nice patio out back which I preferred even though it was a tad hot outside; inside is overwhelmingly fishy smelling.","Wow. Didn't even get sweet nothings whispered into my ear after the insane price I paid for a 'jumbo' shrimp roll. I'm afraid to know what the regular one looks like! If you've got deep pockets, go right on in. But unfortunately my experience left me hungry for more, and not from this place. Womp womp.","Luke's serves a very solid lobster roll.  My only gripe was that they only had one half lobster tail left when we got there.  I could have eaten at least 2 and my poor dining companion was SOL.  The Pinot Noir (in a can) was a bit warm, not sure where those cans are stored.  And the chips are not house made.  Yet still, I'd go back for that lobster roll.  Delish!","This place is pretty good. - Staff is friendly - Wasn't crowded when I went & didn't have to wait long for my order - Food was definitely good & different from the usual neighborhood eats - EXPENSIVE ($17 for crab roll, chips & water - I lived in New Orleans for a year & the food here is definitely better but the quantity is smaller) I'd definitely recommend giving it a try - they have a combo meal where you try all 3 sea rolls (lobster, shrimp & crab)","Still the best lobster rolls in NYC, guys. It'd been a minute since I paid this place a visit, so we stopped by for dinner the other night. Still the same quality as always- huge, delicious rolls with just the right amount of butter, seasoning and mayo to hold everything together. And probably about 5 lobsters of meat to a roll! They have two sizes for rolls now, regular and jumbo. I was super hungry so I got a jumbo, but I think on an average day the regular would have more than done it. Glad this spot has stuck around, and glad to see them doing well after all these years!","My mom was visiting my fiancée and I, and wanted lobster while in town. This and Red Hook seemed to be the main contenders- this won out for the night because it was Monday, (Red Hook was closed) and I didn't have a car. The rolls are an interesting combo of Connecticut and Maine styles- more buttery dressing than mayo based typical of Maine style, but the lobster is cold, not hot like a Connecticut style roll.  It was really good either way- large chunks of meat that were dressed enough but not overpowered. I had the slaw- neither mayo nor vinegar based (kinda both) which was interesting, but also good. I finished with the blueberry pie. I'd definitely recommend that as well- lots of blueberries and tasty pastry, perfect to finish off the meal with. Will I be back for more? Absolutely. I'm really glad we came.",Luke's Lobster Park Slope
375,"A little strange from the outside but beautiful Art Deco through and through inside. Came in for a few drinks to check it out, already looking at the movie calendar to plan the next trip. Second try ( this time saw Mad Max ) equally as nice. Two cautions ...1. Bench style seating in the theater is a little high for short people ....feet can't touch the floor if I sit back, probably couldn't sit comfortably for a double feature2. Only 2 draft choices available in the theater.","Crappiest service if you can even call it one? If it's a busy night, one can imagine that when you have people seat at the bar least you can do is hand them a menu and manage expectation on wait time or acknowledge their presence. Unfriendly, I'll-mannered staff. Thank you, next.","Came here because Roberta's had an hour wait, so why not have a couple of drinks.Great concept in designing dinner, drinks, and a movie all in one place.We came during off peak hours, so service was very attentive and friendly. Not to mention, the place was basically empty given how large it is.","My friend stumbled upon this location as we were looking for places to go to since things were not opened or closed early due to remembering the events of September 11.It was cool that the bar had it's own intimate theater and we were able to snag the last two tickets to the showing of ""The Farewell"", which could be purchased online as well.Inside the theaterit looked like it fit about 30+ people that had to be paired up when sitting since there are little tables to use for your food and drinks you order for the movie. The screen was big and the wall in front of us prevented me from seeing the bottom of the screen since I sit a bit short heheThe servers were really nice and quick in getting in our orders and getting them to us. I got some popcorn and a drink since I'm a sucker for popcorn with movies, buy they had other appetizers and food items too. The film and we alright to me, but definitely wouldn't mind coming back here to try out their other food selections and maybe even try to go their for one of their quiz nights during a future visit to NY.","Out of all the non-multiplex chains that I've been to in the City--Film Forum, Cinepolis Chelsea, Nitehawk Cinema--Syndicated offers the most bang for your buck. Here, wait staff don't seem as experienced as those at Nitehawk, seats aren't the luxury recliners you'll find at Cinepolis (they're first-come-first-served), and film offerings aren't as offbeat and niche, in an independent film festival kind of way, as those at Film Forum or Metrograph. But I challenge you to match their price of $8.25 per showing of any film, which is as good a deal you'll find in the City, much less anywhere else. They don't seem to operate on a big enough budget to screen the next summer blockbuster, but you can catch the films making rounds during award or festival season. They also do trivia nights, reruns of blockbusters from summers past, and career retrospectives.Contrary to other reviewers, I think the food is more or less decent--typical bar food fare; nothing to rave about. Cocktails are a gamble depending on which day you visit, but you can't go wrong with beer. And they have excellent happy hour deals (5-7pm), which does apply to the beer and shot combos. Be sure to arrive at least 30 minutes if you want first-rate seats (third row from the exits offers the best view). And there isn't a reason not to be early, especially if you're catching a film during happy hour--you can kick back with a drink in hand and enjoy the pre-show reel.","If you love movies and you love to eat/drink you'll probably have a decent time at Syndicated. That criteria's plenty broad so I'm guessing the chances you'll find something to like about this place is pretty high lol. Syndicated is a restaurant-bar-theater with a focus on all things film. Even the cocktails are named after iconic movie titles and quotes. I was tempted by the Drag Me to Hell, but I settled on the Fizzy Lifting Drink, purely because of my love for Wonka. Wasn't bad, and I appreciated the copious amount of waffle fries I received with my food order. The menu items can stray on the pricey side but it's Williamsburg, so...What I enjoyed most about my visit was undoubtedly the trivia. I went during Disney night and it was packed, with thirty-plus teams filling the venue. I get the allure, given it was one of the most creative trivia competitions I've been a part of. There was one round based around one-second music clips (more fun than it sounds) and even a round challenging you to come up with pun-based movie titles. Great stuff, I'll keep an eye out for future trivia nights.",Syndicated Bar Theater Kitchen
376,"Place was overpriced for the food but I guess that's the par in this area. At the time we went, there was only one person working there so she had to handle the register and the drinks. She said she had never made drinks before so it wasn't exactly the best tasting drink. All in all, it was an ok experience but I probably won't seek this place out for tacos.","Overpriced, not that delicious and they only had one server having to do everything so it made service very slow (not her fault). I've noticed several places really relying on the whole vegan and gluten free thing to charge higher prices for ingredients that are cheap to buy. That would be one thing if at least they used those ingredients in a good way and made delicious creations out of them, but it was not the case for this place.I tried the tuna nori taco and the beef short rib taco. Neither was impressive. The tuna nori didn't really work well as a taco. The beef short rib taco was meh. Not much sauce and not very flavorful. At the end we ended up going to a restaurant after this restaurant because we were left hungry and unsatisfied. I would recommend for them to have more than one person to do everything, its too overwhelming for one person to be taking orders, bringing the food and making drinks and then for the drink machines to be breaking down on top of that.",I was not impressed with this place.  I have had some good Mexican in my life and this does not make the cut.  I ordered loaded nachos just to later find out as I ate it that it was made with cashew queso. Never again!!  The best thing about this place was the $5 frozen margaritas. Won't ever be coming back here again.,"I ended up meeting some friends here on a Friday after work came in & went straight to ordering some food & drinks. Drinks I went with the margarita since it was $5 special all day .. good margarita nice taste & decent amount of alcohol. Food I had the Truffle Shrooms taco this was interesting? Taste wise ok for me I wasn't completely sold taste wise.. I also had the Impossible taco , this was great good flavor & taste. Also had an order of the Nachos w guacamole very good as well small enough for one but good to share as well. Another vegan friendly place that surprised me. Small location , funky fun decor , service was good u order first then they bring the food to your table not bad. Decent  music playing nice laid back atmosphere we enjoyed our time here.","my second time eating here. good food, vegan options. service is ehhh.i stood at the pick up counter waiting for my food without being acknowledged for a good 5 minutes. kind of disappointing. i dont mind waiting but at least let me know hat you need a few minutes to hand me the bag on the counter with my food.",Underwhelmed! Loved all the vegan options available here so ordered a mushroom taco and the impossible meat taco. They were pricy- the impossible meat one was $6 for a TINY taco when I expected so much more. What's worse is that there was BARELY ANYTHING IN IT! I got it in a corn tortilla instead of the hard shell that it comes with but I did not expect it to be empty! The mushroom one was okay- lacked flavor. Got sticky rice and beans on the side for a whopping $5 for just plain rice- where were the beans?!I went during lunch and was wondering why it was so empty considering it's so cute and aesthetic inside. Now I know why- it's completely overpriced for what you get (or don't get in my case.) Maybe I'll come back for happy hour if my co workers really want to but it's really a shame that I can't get the tacos- can't justify $5-6 for an empty taco.,Taco Dumbo
377,"Mediocre at best. Got the king Pai chicken,Dan Dan vegetarian,eggplant and oyster mushrooms. The only thing that was good was the king Pao chicken. The Dan dan was over cooked and had tofu pieces instead of crumbled tofu like it should have been to replace the crumbled pork. The eggplant lacked flavor and was very oily. I had high expectations but was sadly disappointed and won't be returning. Bird of a feather is wayyy better than this and so is M Shanghai",I wonder if you can call this place Chinese restaurant. Nothing is better than cheap to go chinese. I liked the atmosphere but the food wise... id rather go to panda express,We tried this place for delivery via Caviar and ordered 2 noodle dishes and a vegetable dish for dinner. Food tasted good until my boyfriend spat out a piece of plastic from the vegetable dish. Photo attached. Will not order again.,"I love that this place is so close to home. My friend and I came here on a Wednesday evening around 6pm and it was mostly empty (though, it filled up towards the time we left). Fantastic service, reasonably priced, and delicious flavors. We ordered the eggplant, green beans, and duck wrap. Everything was top notch. The eggplant is warm and perfectly cooked and not too spicy, the string beans could be a little crisper, but nothing to complain about. Most of all, I loved the duck wrap with plum sauce and pancake. The pancake is the right thickness (hard to achieve) and the flavors perfectly complement each other. Though, the taste of duck was very mild - which is okay since prefer vegetables anyways. My expectations weren't too high considering the neighborhood isn't known for Chinese food. Was pleasantly surprised and I think it s a really great find in the neighborhood. I will definitely be coming back to try other items on the menu.","Very well priced and the best food I have had by far in NY.  We have gone back twice and ordered different things with the same result of being satisfied! The Cold sesame noodles, crispy garlic chicken and angry pig were great! Don't fill up on dumplings as there are so many good choices, even though their dumplings are great.Will come back for a third time to try something else!","Giving this 3 stars because there are some problems. In theory, the menu looks great for eating. However, it didn't turn out to be the case.a) soup dumplings: good inside broth, didn't taste fatty, but skin is not delicate like it should be.b) watercress: wow--what the heck? Why is completely doused in the saltiest fish sauce ever? When I write doused, I mean DOUSED, like it wasn't properly mixed or even tasted. I could understand mixing the sauce, marinade, dressing with some fish sauce, but it's clear the chef did not taste it. I liked the greens, but this is beyond salty. Like, ""Hello! DRINK THIS bottle of entire fish sauce!""-salty. I used some vinegar from the table and the free sweet/acidic/spicy cabbage to eat the rest, but that wasn't enough to fix it. Really I should have just rinsed it in my cup of water.c) maitake: again, WAY too salty. Rest of it was fine, I appreciate the textures.d) dan dan noodles: I've tried this take out and delivery. Noodles were mushy, but sauce was nice. When I write mushy, it is MUSHY. I haven't tried it inside the restaurant. Let me say: the time it took to get from the restaurant to my house wasn't that long to believe that it would still cook while commuting or walking. It just was completely overcooked. Next time maybe I can get the noodles separate and use my own noodles since the sauce is good.e) Mushu: I liked the amount of food you get, but it was so watery--the sauce. Like, how are you supposed to put sopping wet food in the pancake? Major fail for me. f) beef with Chinese Broccoli: beef and greens were cooked nicely, but the sauce wasn't exactly there for me. You definitely get an entire pot's worth of greens--should be shared. The dough noodles were fun to eat, but would be nicer with sharper points--if you want to talk about mouth feel for this particular kind of food (the flour noodle-needles), then pointy to thick is a better shape.h) shrimp toast: not bad, I'm not going to complain too much. I can't quite remember if the shrimp was super soft and juicy--the way shrimp should be, so I can't comment much anymore. And a tip for those who don't know what shrimp should be like: cooking frozen-pre-cooked shrimp is the worst (texture will be terrible--you just lost the flavor--that kind of thing is more suited for ""cocktail"" shrimp). Not saying this place did it, so I don't suspect anything bad like that. Seems like it was probably freshly peeled that day, but again, hard to remember since I didn't eat the toast this year.If the is Chinese, then it's reallllly strange with these problems. Please TASTE the food--do another test run. I've eaten here at least 2xs various years inside the restaurant, then tried it 2xs take out and delivery. Plese tell me that the LES one is better or that I should try other items--which I'm willing to do. And YES I KNOW MY CHINESE FOOD. I've been eating it since I was a baby because I am Chinese and my family is Chinese and I'm pretty positive about what's good. I really do know what's good. I'm not commenting about what is authentic or not, I'm just saying, it was salty AF, too thick, too watery, too mushy. I've never had it that bad...really anywhere. Normally l enjoy going to these kind of new establishments, but this Brooklyn one just had too many issues that aren't good. It's 3 stars for me. Good stars for freshness and quantity. If someone is giving this 5 stars, seriously, the person has zero taste buds. Maybe go to Hakkasan to really taste a difference, or check out simple regular restaurants because I've never had salty AF, mushy or water Chinese food. It's supposed to be perfectly balanced in the savory dept. The free cabbage can use a touch more vinegar. You get a good quantity of food and this place is very popular. I'm sure the drinks are fine, but again cannot comment on that since I haven't had their cocktails. My main concern was the food. Oh, it is loud in there, so expect to raise your voice. And yeah, I had a dinner companion who I'm sure won't dismiss my review.",Kings Co Imperial
378,Consistently consistent. Keep it up!! I've now tried - Chicken and French toast Chopped cheese (regular and vegan) Veggie Lasagna Buffalo chicken Jerk shrimp Vegan beef and broccoli Vegan sausage and peppers And their cookies!!,"Cuts and slices be knowing. A regular old pizza shop that delivers quick service located in the cut of the block. One would not know that it was there if one weren't paying attention. Thankfully, I was able to stop here to pick up two large pies on the eve of Christmas at the last minute. Definitely got the hookup and definitely will be back. Thanks Cuts and Slices!",First time it was ok.  I'll go back probably for the BBQ chicken pizza!! We tried a lot of different ones,"Best pizzeria in Brooklyn I e been here twice both time got a different order and both was delicious this spot is so convenient. They're very fast with the order no long waiting small space but they get it done. Quickly! Told a lot of friends and family members. They all agreed with me. They go all the time, and thank me each time. Customer service is superb. They greet you as you enter. I'm huge on customer service. They win me over alone with that part. And the food good. What more can you ask for?!?! Lol","Greatly exceeded my expectations! Pizza-excellent! Service-excellent! Wait time-excellent! We drove to Cuts & Slices from Queens to check out the pizza that looked so delish in the pics on IG.  Glad we made the trip and ordered a whole pie in quarters of different types.Pizza: French Toast and Chicken Slice was delish. I wondered how the syrup on pizza would taste but was just the right amount of sweetness that didn't overpower the rest of the ingredients. My 7 year old ran off with some of the French Toast! Lasagna Slices were prefect. So flavorful that you could forget that you are eating pizza. (My runner up fave)Jerk Chicken slices, loved the spicy kick and the fresh peppers. (My fave)Shrimp and Lobster slices, juicy and a great mix of flavors. The pesto sauce tied it all together. (My aunt's fave)BBQ Chicken slices, I didn't try this one (I was too full) but my daughter said it was amazing and she'd def go back for more. (Daughter's fave)Service:Matt was super friendly, professional and helpful. He convinced us to try to the whole pie in quarters and made suggestions for which types to try. He was very accurate with the quoted wait time and we were out of there in about 15 min.Very pleased with my experience and now that I've posted pics people have made plans for us to go back next week. Only con is that you can't eat inside, unless you want to stand at the counter. We couldn't wait to get home so we tried each type in the car. #teamgreedy","A nice quaint place. Everything is to-go. They have variety of slices or pies to choose from. And once you've selected your right slice, you can go over to the pizalfie' booth to capture the perfect angle for the gram'Grabbed a couple regular slices which were good, tad bit salty but the flavors were there. I would go back and try the specialty slices.",Cuts & Slices
379,"Yelp suggested this place for ""All-you-can-eat sushi."" So, I called for info. Suddenly, in a super nasty voice the Owner/Host said, ""Did you call earlier? Are you trying to prank me? Cause we make high quality sushi NOT CONVEYOR BELT SUSHI!! OK!!!?"" And HUNG UP in my face in the middle of me asking my second question. So I called back and she just went off screaming and accusing ME of being nasty and unprofessional...I guess judging people for wanting ""all you can eat sushi"" and not ""high quality sushi"" is being professional...and NOT condescending, bitchy and NASTY?",It's good food but way too expensive for literally nothing. Tbh the example of all things wrong with Bushwick,"I love their sushi but last time we were seated at the right bar and the speakers were so loud, with awful music. It was cold and atmosphere was just off.Went back today and had vegetarian curry ramen and it was absolutely disgusting. Shame on you","This is personally my favorite sushi restaurant.  I should stress that my meal typical includes a spicy tuna hand roll, heritage pork betty and a party bomb.   The ""bomb"" sushi that they have there is not your conventional/traditional sushi but I love it.  I specifically love the Pink Bomb, McLow Bomb, Spicy McBomb and Spicy Una Bomb.  Occasionally I venture into various other single pieces of sushi when they have something interesting.  The vibe is a bit more ""hipster"" with communal/bench seating.  If you are looking for a white tablecloth fine dining atmosphere, look elsewhere. Price is above average but what I consider to be very reasonable for the quality of food.",Good spot for well prepared sushi in east Williamsburg it's right across from Syndicated so this could be part 1 of a dinner/movie combo.  Pro Tip:  They somehow manage to make communal seating intimate but get there early if you want a seat at either end of the benches.,"Momo Sushi Shack has been on my to eat list for quite a while, so I got their bomb set of four options for lunch the other day. The price is slightly above average as the restaurant markets itself as high quality, but the fish and sushi quality itself was just okay. The tuna and salmon sushi were presented seasoned and chopped up on top of a small ball of rice, which is cute I guess. If you're looking for superb quality sushi in the neighborhood and are willing to shell out a bit more, try Ume.",Momo Sushi Shack
380,It was my second time visiting Shake Shack and I've heard so many good reviews about their burgers from my husband that I had some expectations. I took a regular single burger and hotdog and can say that compared to other fast food chains their quality is way higher. Meet really tastes meet and veggies are good. The only thing I didn't like was a sweet bun and no ketchup inside.,Typical Shake Shack with ample seating and close to shops and stores. The two stars is because of their very disgusting restrooms.,"Don't eat from ShakeShack! My burgers were served raw!After attending a play at City Center, my partner's family wanted to have dinner at ShakeShake. So, we proceeded to the location on Flatbush Avenue. Our orders were taken rather quickly. However, the receipt of our orders was a different story. I ordered two DBL ShackBurgers w/ cheese and two orders of fries along with a chocolate shake which totaled $31.74.As we all know, the cost of ShakeShake food is astronomical! This is why I don't gravitate to this establishment. Well, after the extensive wait, I finally received my order. To my dismay, there was some type of mixup and I received the wrong flavor shake. Usually, I'm a very easy going person, but due the the extensive 20 min wait-- I was very irate. Once again, I had to wait for the correct flavor shake. The hands of time passed me by for an additional 10 minutes. All while I had my partner's family waiting and waiting. At this point, we were famished. Upon returning home, we dug in....Only to realize my two DBL cheese burgers were cooked very rare. This is unacceptable. First the unnecessary wait, then service of raw food. Their goods don't meet the hype. Cook your own food. Don't eat from ShakeShake!!! They serve raw beef!","The original shake shack! My first shake shack years ago before we had it where I live Miami, FL it became my favorite burger joint and still is 10 years later.Great service and delicious burgers and fries!","A delicious burger chain restaurant right by the hotel that we were staying at in Brooklyn.  We had gotten back from the rooftop bar (at 1 Hotel) and was about to venture over to Smith street, but the rain/storm stopped us.  I decided on their Smoke Shake and it was so good! I definitely understand the positive reviews of this place. They know how to make their burgers right!  Also got a side of fries to share and it was a perfect burger combo haha.  Overall, this experience with this place made me slightly upset because we don't have one of these in RVA (whomp whomp).  It's okay....until next time Shake Shack --we will meet again.","PURCHASED: Shack Burger (see photo, dear god... immaculate)  TOTAL: $6.00PROS:+ Delicious burger: immaculate burger. Look at the photo and tell me that doesn't look like you could eat that for breakfast, lunch and dinner daily. It is almost--dare I say--greater than In-And-Out Burger? (I am from California). CONS:- Long line: On the day I went in early Summer 2019, I waited in a long line. I would expect it from a location in Manhattan, as I have reviewed this before. However, it was mildly upsetting again here. The last I had to wait for approximately 20 minutes. IMPRESSION:Note, this is my update review of Shake Shack. Nothing has changed since my previous review which I mentioned the only downside was the line. Intending on going to this location thinking there was going to be no line, I was met with a line that almost went out the door. The burger was super delicious, just wished it lasted as long as the wait in line.",Shake Shack
381,"I wish I could rate this place but my wife and I walked out in 5 minutes.  This place is a DIVE!!!!! And not in a good way!!!Okay, we walked in at 6:30 on a Saturday evening. There were 2 bartenders, and the place was reasonable crowded.  Did not see a hostess/host, waiter/ waitress to seat us, so we just sat down, no big deal. We sat at a little bar stool, and did not see any servers.  I walked up to the bar, and looked into the kitchen, and saw wrap on the counter just sitting there with lettuce and tomatoes.  The cook was walking around the bar, and looked like he wasn't focused on food. The 2 bartenders were busy, but were too cool for school, and were focused on serving. I looked back at my wife sitting at the table, and what looked like a homeless women was sitting in my seat with a doll talking to my wife. She asked my wife if she like her baby!  I went back to my wife and said let's go, and the women said to me, ""I am talking to her!"" I don't know who owns this place but they should read this... 1. Absent Service on a busy Saturday night 2. A disgusting looking kitchen, and a cook who definitely was not interested in what he was doing 3. Homeless/ mentally ill people allowed to walk around the bar, and harass customers.  I don't think this is good for business in my opinion. I went to this place because the ratings were really good.   I'm sure the people who rated this place were sincere.  What the hell happened?  Maybe the owner of this place doesn't give a f**k anymore, and wants to let it go.",After watching WWE in Barclays center we wanna to seat somewhere and found this place which was open late night..

Boyfriend enjoyed his burger I might have stolen a bite. Great food, nice bartender and server. Would come back here!","I feel conflicted about the review because it really depends on what you're looking for. Came here for a quick, casual dinner - burgers and beer. And for that, this place delivers. They have a $15 burger + draft beer deal that is hard to beat. But...the burger's not great quality. The fries were solid, but honestly I think the burger was so greasy my stomach revolted.The good: beer selection is fine, and the bartenders are really cool. Will probably come back for late night drinks, but skip the burger next time.","Like this spot a lot for a relaxing hang in my neighborhood. In the winter there's a fire in the back and the backyard is delightful in the summer. Really good beer and shot combos; beer and burger combo; beer and hot dog combo... you get the picture.

382,Disgusting. Found a nail in my food!Wish I would have snapped a picture before I threw it out. Garbage.,I asked that the taco toppings come on the side and was told that would consist of a separate dish and additional charges.  I will never recommend a restaurant that has items listed with a dish and do not offer as a side...... Not only that a true Mexican taco is meat onions and cilantro...... This place have a list of items they put on a taco....Thank you for responding. The only reason you responded is because it is LIVE AND ON THE WEB.

What an embarrassment.","After the best meal I've had in the area I am plotting how to convince my wallet that I can in fact afford to come here every night for dinner. I'm a stickler when it comes to guacamole and Paloma's wowed me with the freshest, most flavor balanced guacamole I've had in a long time. The ingredients were obviously fresh, ripe, and it was made to order. The steak fajita my partner got was sizzling and delicious (sorry babe, I ate your leftovers last night ‍) and my enchiladas were so good I had no leftovers I don't give 5 stars often, perhaps not ever on here, but they earned it!","Excellent Mexican food very reasonably priced.Killer guacamole and the fried avocado slices with the chipotle dipping sauce is a textural masterpiece!Our server was friendly and everything was prepared and delivered on time.I'm not a big fan of cilantro and they made accommodations for me when preparing the food.My daughters had the sangria which I thought was a little on the sweet side, but they liked it.I will be back!","Just read the last review and everything was completely false! The food here is always amazing! The staff is always friendly and never disappoints with their quality of service. Have been coming to this place since it opened and can I just say it's the best of the best.Let's begin with some of the food: Appetizers My top 4 are the Nachos (steak and the shrimp are a must!), corn in the cob (man the sauce is to die for you can literally scoop it up with some of the nachos and it's amazing alone) avocado fries ( these are breaded to perfection and a small bite of heaven paired with the sauce on the side it's one of my favorites) and my last to top off the top appetizer list the quesadilla (steak is my preference but I have heard that the chicken is great as well)For Mains: My staple is the chimichanga de carnitas ( think of a burrito but to the next level!!) it's a beautifully deep fried piece of heaven with carnitas, cheese, rice and beans. Quite an amazing meal that will leave you filled and satisfied.The Fajitas (a must is to have the steak and shrimp together) it's a little more for the two meats but WORTH EVERY PENNY PAID! The flavors are amazing and pair well with the traditional sides of tortillas rice beans and guacamole and sour cream!My other fave is the Steak!!! Man o man this dish right here is everything!! The steak is a perfect cut and cooked to your liking with the side of potatoes and a perfect sauce to pair everything together is the best!For those who are seeking to wet their whistle don't forget the Sangria (hands down the best) or a Michelada which they pair with your beer of choice!Overall a great place and as a client for more then 2 years it's been a great experience looking forward to see what Paloma's will put out next!!!",Paloma's
383,"I'm not sure how I feel about this place, but I do know it's not more than 2 stars. I dropped by for some breakfast on Friday. Well, for one, the employees behind the counter weren't very friendly at all and when I asked how the ordering system works they just muttered some words under their breath.Ok, so I ordered two iced coffees, a tuna sandwich, and a peanut butter and apple sandwich. The first mistake was the employee bringing me two hot coffees, so they had to throw those out and make two new ones. Alright, we get our coffees and sit down. The coffee is alright, I've had better. After a few minutes the guy calls out tuna sandwich so I go and get my order. While I'm at the counter he says the other sandwich will be a few more minutes. That means I either have to wait to eat my sandwich or eat without my friend. Both aren't right.When I did get to eat my tuna sandwich it was practically horrific. The baguette was so hard I thought I was going to break my teeth. I gave it a couple of attempts before I gave up. Now to the final issue. We were served everything on glass plates. Usually when I'm served on paper or plastic I clean up the table and put the rubbish in the bin but here it's glass so I wasn't aware I had to clean it up. We start walking out when one of the employees super rudely tells us to clean up our table. I was rather apologetic because I was totally unaware and that system is messed up. As I was putting the glasses and plates in the bin they told us to dump it in, the sight that met my eye was so disgusting I am writing this place off for good. Or at least until they change their system and employees.",Just checked into Outpost cafe to receive disgusting service the two sweaty hipster Baristas were talkin drinking and eating and never greeted me so I just walked out.

It just left a horrible taste in my mouth. I also ordered the rabbit juice which is carrot and ginger. I've had that before as well. I do not know what's going on today or if it's the staff but the juice is even water down.

I have frequented this location many times. It always is a positive experience, except for tonight. The White male bartender who claimed to be a manager needs to be changed.

He went out of his way to address all of their questions and was attentive to them for 15 minutes as we sat in shock watching the obvious. Why were two different couples given such disparate treatment? I am not certain since I am not in his head. I did mention it to him. And his excuse was they asked about Vegan options? The substance of their question was immaterial. What matters is that we had questions to and were not given the opportunity to ask anything since he was more concerned with them vs. us. We came in first. We should have been assisted first. This business used to be Black owned. It's current ownership is unknown. Regardless, this particular manager is unprofessional. He needs to be removed considering he became combative when questioned. He should have apologized and made up for the perceived slight. Otherwise, this place is nice historically.","Been here a few times. Food is good, but service is slow-ish. Have run out of bloody marys a few times for brunch so go earlier.","Amazing food and drinks. The design of the restaurant is very creative and perfect for groups. The beef burger happens to one of my favorites ! Staff is very friendly, highly recommend their brunch food as well !","Came here awhile ago for a friend's birthday dinner. She has very high standards when it comes to food and it's almost as if she tried every place in Brooklyn already so I had a hard time picking out a place for her, but Hill Cafe was the winner. We found parking a block away and the neighborhood was pretty charming. They had string lights right outside the restaurant, so it was perfect for a photo op. It was nice and cozy inside, and the table by the window just made it more homey. There weren't a lot of customers when we went so maybe the reservation wasn't even necessary but I guess it's better to play it safe. And safe I played for food - I ordered the burger cause I'm not a huge fan of French lol. The burger was alright, nothing to write home about.","This is my second time coming here! It's charming , cozy and the food is very good! The beer is cold, the bar tender is cool and laid back . The wings and burgers are my go to,  but when i come back for dinner, i will def go for the steak. I'm curious about the brunch menu so i'll check that out also! Till next time! @foodienotreally",Hill Cafe
386,"Placed a dinner order for a couple of entrees and naan breads. I received a naan with mold on it (in the picture) and contacted the restaurant. Instead of offering to replace it or refund me for it, the restaurant refused to acknowledge that the bread had mold on it. If you choose to eat here, just be aware of the quality of food that you will be served.","This is my go to Indian restaurant on Seamless specifically. Delivery has always been faster than estimated, and the food is always very good. I tend to order the chicken tikka masala (medium spicy), with the garlic naan. Their lunch specials are about $10 dollars and includes a curry, rice, and naan.","The amount of salt in my lamb curry rendered it inedible.  SO SALTY!!!  Rice was like plain Chinese-food style rice, not basmati and with no flavor (other than maybe MORE SALT).  Pakoras were soggy.  The naan was okay and the tamarind sauce very good, but that doesn't warrant the $23 I spent.  What a waste of money.","I came here after doing some laundry with my Queen. It was a long and arduous day of shopping for her new apartment, we were absolutely famished (she was getting haaannggrry, fellas amiriiiitttteee?!?). After folding all the laundry, I saw the look of the devil arise in her eyes. I grabbed some holy water and headed straight to Ghandi for some salvation. We got there at 9:00pm, and there was another couple leaving. Little did we know that they were closing soon, but being the attentive servers that they were, they let us sit and enjoy as long as we wished. Its a small place, but the flavor is HUGE! They started us off with water, and free cumin seed flatbread with 3 dipping sauces. Delicious starter. We then ordered some Samosa Chaat which was reaaaaalllyyyy gooooodd. For those that don't know, its a Vegetable samosa with various toppings. To die for. Onto the entree. She ordered some Roganjosh with Chicken and I ordered some Mughal Curry with lamb. She usually picks the best order, but safe to say, I was victorious this time around. It was a sweet and sour spicy gravy akin to the texture of chicken tikka masala. I wanted to diiiiivvveeee iiiinnnn and swim in it, it was that good. The entrees come with rice and they have a really cute presentation when bringing out the orders (her words not mine). Halfway thru, we ordered some garlic naan to dip into the sauces. It came out swiftly, but was the freshest naan I've ever had. You could taste the warmth of the oven and could see and smell large fresh cloves of garlic. It only added to the the amazing experience. The meal was fairly priced as well!!!All in all, the staff was lovely, they were extremely friendly and attentive, and wished us a wonderful night, despite us staying later than closing time. My only regret is not trying the rest of the menu, but, we will for sure come back to try some more (If the Queen lets us that is). Thank you so much to Ghandi's staff, the food is great and we will make sure to come back again and again!","I stopped by this place for lunch and I'm glad I did. I've found that the area doesn't have a lot of great food and the ones that do are quite expensive. This place was reasonably priced for a sit down restaurant and the portions are quite large (I saved some for dinner). I got the chicken tiki marsala and an order of special naan with coconut. All of it was good but I particularly enjoyed the naan. While I wouldn't call it cheap,I ended up getting 2 meals out of it so that's pretty good. The food was good quality and I loved the naan. I will return. I also heard that they have a lunch menu which I will be sure to try sometime.","This is a hole in the wall indian restaurant. It's very tiny and I did not see a bathroom (someone correct me if im wrong) BUT it's the bomb.I order Chicken Tikka at every indian restaurant I go to (yes, I'm basic) and it was one of the best. So full of flavor, color and nice and spicy. The staff was very attentive but I also was the only one in there because they just opened. The naan was pillowy yet crunchy. Dipped that naan right into the tikka and it was perfection. I saw signs that you can bring your own bottles of wine and beer, which I might have to do soon! I also saw a sign about lunch specials for delivery, so I may do that in the future since they are pretty close to me. All in all, you won't be dissapointed.",Gandhi Fine Indian Cuisine
387,Shrimp green curry with only 3 pieces and the curry sauce is very water down. Disappointed after reading all the old reviews. The Pai Thai only comes in noodle and little pieces of chicken.,"I ordered Shrimp Pad Thai and it was horrible. Only thing edible was the shrimp. The sprouts and scallions were unidentifiable. It smelled bad, like stunk up my whole house. They must do the food they deliver different because it looked nothing like the other pictures","I'm not sure what this place is or what it wants to be. While the gyoza would indicate Japanese food to me...its a Thai restaurant and not just that...a bar, outdoor spot, and bakery. It suffers from an identity crisis. It is beautiful space though and they have great service. One thing to note is the Tom Yum soup is unbearable and scorching hot.Just don't order it without letting them know you don't want it spicy.","This place is great: on par with the Thai restaurants in Hell's Kitchen. The atmosphere is great, there's a garden to relax in during the day, and the noodle dishes are delicious. If you want a cafe, the coffee is also legit: the espresso machine is what you'd typically find in a dedicated cafe, and the pulls are quite good. This has become my go-to restaurant when a friend wants to grab a bite nearby. My favorite dish here is the Pad See Ew: the aroma from the noodles makes you want to immediately dive in, and the taste backs up that initial impression.","This place is interesting. It seems to be largely a coffee shop and I came here for lunch. I think it would be incredible in the summer to come here for a glass of wine and sit outdoors, they have a lovely space and it looks like they do it up well. I will say that the prices are slightly higher for the food, given the average price for thai food, and while its not your typical street thai, its not all that upscale either to warrant the pricing. We tried the pad thai with king shrimp (its the only one that uses traditional thai noodles, the drunken noodles is made with the same skinny noodles which didnt seem authentic) and we had the pineapple fried rice- tasty, but a little overdone and a lot of turmeric. The pad thai was really good though, right mix of flavors, comes together well, really well prepared. I also came here for breakfast another time and I will say that while they try to keep the flavors as authentic as possible the amount that you get for the price you pay is not adequate. Which I find very unusual for a Thai restaurant. I would say that for a better Thai experience I would go to other restaurants I would come here maybe for drinks and apps in the evening or do I enjoy the outdoors space that they have during the summer. I will say that the pastries and the tea and coffee are good and I would be another good reason to come here - think of this one is a café than a restaurant really.I do recommend the desserts and the coffee/ tea here and perhaps the wine - will try and come back and do the wine on a summer evening. Overall, cute place, but maybe still trying to figure itself out. definitely check out the bathrooms! Great job on the interior of the restaurant as well it's super cute!","Very cute place but the pad Thai was gross. Too much sauce and super spicy. It used to be a good spot but I don't know what changed... the back is cute but the front Also, they serve the coffee in water glasses... good luck drinking that when it's hot. AND they gave me shrimp instead of the chicken I ordered ‍ W ‍ T ‍ F",A Gusto Thai Bistro
388,"On Friday my wife and I went here for dinner my wife ordered the Fillet Mignon and Shrimp combination with fried rice, I had the chicken and fried rice.I had to place an order because we were the only people at that Hibachi table otherwise we would have split my wife's order as we always get a lot of food As it is a good restaurant we went along with getting the 2 orders and bringing the leftover home.","The food and specials they have are good. However, i went there twice and they include 15 percent for tips in your check. Twice i paid that 15 percent because its already included and i didn't leave extra tip because i believe 15 percent is good enough.  Twice waiters gave me dirty looks and made me feel uncomfortable and guilty.  Don't feel like i want to go back","One of the worse hibachi restaurants in Brooklyn. Go to arirang in bay ridge. I only give them the star for their week day specials which is worthy of a star but otherwise the place is so sad. Aside from rude service, hibachi chefs aren't very interactive like I'm used to. I mean who goes to hibachi just to watch someone cook your food and leave. Be ware, they do not modify anything to your liking or allergies.  You don't like it how they do it then order something else that doesn't require modifications, That was their managers advise.","My wife and I just sat down to dinner, we are getting the Hibachi steak and salmon which we will share, also we are getting the side of the veggie fried rice and fried noodles.We were very lucky to get a table as soon as we got here.It's a little later now, we had a wonderful meal.Now we are next door at Masal getting Turkish Tea and dessert.","My wife and I have just arrived at the restaurant, we have to wait for about 15 minutes or so to get a seat at the Hibachi table which is alright.We plan to get the Filet Minion steak and Shrimp combination with fried rice and the noodles side dishes.As we've been here a few times over the years we have always had a wonderful meal.","My husband, his family, and I came here to celebrate my mother-in-law's dinner on Saturday and the dinner was... well, just fine, albeit a little below my expectations for the price. After all, if you pay hibachi prices, you expect to get an outstanding meal... and sadly, that wasn't quite what I received.For our meals, we all ordered a hibachi steak meal with some kind of side (lobster for me) and I ended up not-quite-impressed by my meal. Granted, they ended up cooking my food in the kitchen instead of on the actual hibachi grill because I have a shrimp allergy and didn't want my food contaminated. But my steak came out rather over-done and salty, my lobster was over-chewy and tasteless, and the one thing I really ended up enjoying was the fried rice on the side. My family seemed to enjoy their hibachi meals (all cooked on the grill) far better than I did, however.The hibachi chef was very fun and lively and, since he knew Cantonese, could banter with my in-laws. Watching him was fun and he made the meal a treat. But alas, for me, that just wasn't enough to overcome the disappointing food made in the kitchen...So if you come here, make sure you get your food cooked on the grill! I guess that's the slightly-disappointing moral to my story...",MOMO Hibachi Steak House & Bar
389,Got some of the OG dumps with edamame and also some of the Japanese fried chicken.It's pretty good. The dumps aren't like how momma makes em in which case it'd be 6 stars but this scratches an itch.,"I ordered my food 67min ago and it's still not here...Not sure what to say about the food as I no longer have an appetite... tasteless‍Actually, it got here now...worst ramen I've had in a very long time.",Serving size is rather small for what you pay. And the quality of the dumpling is not very good. The pork ones I had were oozing with this pinkish slime which I assume to be the residual meat juices that have coagulated under the heat. Edible? Yes. Appealing? No. I suspect dumplings are not freshly made and are pre-frozen.,this is the best dumpling place I have EVER been to! Don't listen to the negative reviews on this place because they are on crack! The dumpling were juicy and had me begging for more. The mango bubble tea was ... A+. I would recommend this place to everyone.Chefs kiss!,The staff here are so friendly and provide such quick service! It's a great place to grab a variety of dumplings that you wouldn't normally find in typical dumpling spots.,"Came here based on the solid reviews. We had dumplings as well as two ramen orders.  I can honestly say this was the worst ramen i've had in all of NY. Type B and D, tonkotsu. Broth was completely off, tasteless, watery and just not right. Dumplings were ok. I have no idea the basis of the positive reviews but would not recommend this place to anyone interested in the ramen.",Ozi Dumplings
390,"I've been there three times. The food was always good and the service was very attentive. I would give 5 stars. However, recently I tried calling to make a reservation for a big group and they NEVER answered the phone or just HUNG UP. I called for more than 10 times I swear at different times on different days. It was very upsetting and I gave up at the end.","Came here on Sunday night, it was packed. We waited for awhile and got seats downstairs.. not very convenient for people with strollers.we ordered two items from the menu, which we can pick what kind of fish or meat and what flavor and veggies to go with it. It's a huge hot rectangle platter with mixed food inside. We got one fish with tomato sauce and one frog legs with garlic flavor. They said those are the only non spicy ones. But when we received it was still spicy , just mild spicy though. If you have kids that can't handle spicy -don't come here. It was spicy even for adults.Also my throat starts hurting right after eating... it's very heavy with flavoring and too much spices. Had to drink herbal tea right after when I got home and still my throat was hurting and dry. We also got the fried rice and that was heavy with flavor too, very salty. Overall - it was ok (not worth it)  over priced , $52 for one platter , and the too much heavy flavors probably wouldn't come back. Unless - I want a sore throat.. prob too much spice and MSG!haha p.s. even the complementary appetizer was spicy!! :/",Stay away.  All dishes basically taste the same due to the spices used.   Price was not cheap and the food was nothin unique.   Just another place selling the decor and not the food quality.,My favorite place in 8th. I would have it everyday if I could! Our familys and friends #1 hang out place. My mom doesn't eat anything spicy but for this place she could have eaten the whole fish by herself! We usually order the pickle mustard fish with little spicy and pickle pepper frog leg. Staffs are super sweet and kids friendly . Very loud and open environment.,"Came here to try their grilled fish. They ran out of buffalo fish so we had to get the sea bass. It was $50 for the fish alone without any accoutrements. We got the golden combination which included enoki, kelp knots, potato slices, and lotus slices. The sea bass was suppose to be about 2 lbs ended up being just enough for 2 people. We would have been hungry without the accoutrements we got. It's a shame they ran out of buffalo fish because that's usually 4lbs. We also ended up getting grilled chicken wings which had a nice flavor but could have been cooked a bit longer. The center was slightly more pink than I like and the skin not rendered quite enough.The service was quite good and staff was very attentive and helpful. The decor was interesting in that there is a huge screen of Chinese karaoke videos playing. The beers here are crazy cheap at only $3 for a Sapporo. This seems like a fun place I would come back to.It's a bit expensive for what it is, but I think had we gotten the buffalo fish it would have been better value. Total for us with 20% tip came out to just over $80.","Would rate this place 3.5 but rounding down to 3. I had mixed feelings about this place. Did I really want to commute all the way to Brooklyn for this place? No. Was it worth it? No. If you do not eat fish, frog or seafood, then this is not the place for you. There's no beef/chicken/pork as the main entree. Only seafood here. Pick your seafood, then your sauce and other add-ins like veggies. I had the sea bass with garlic sauce and some veggies, as well as the peppercorn frog. The food comes out on giant trays and it is sizzling. Sea bass completely missed the mark for me. Lacked flavor but salty and quite difficult to eat. The frog was the hero of the night. There was actually a good proportion of frog - not just wood ears and hidden veggies. Frog was super tender and flavorful. Also, I tried two apps - the tripe and the cucumber. Tripe was fine but the cucumber was more pickled than I preferred.",Hot Space
391,"If I die they can bury me here! Takeaway restaurant with more than enough seating to dine-in.  Score! My oxtail (something- I forgot the name), score! Cleanliness. Score! Pleasant staff? Score! Them funky (exotic to me) beers, score! I love!The End.","Went on a Saturday afternoon; the place had a few other customers but not busy. Place was sort of grimy -  table was sticky. Food is okay, but doesn't stack up the the location in Manhattan.  Won't visit this location again.","I really respect the humble origins of this place but spending $10 on spicy hand-ripped noodles just doesn't sit well with me, on top of $9 for 6 spinach dumplings which amounts to $1.50 per dumpling- it's ridiculous especially considering you can't request modifications for your order. The flavors from the spicy sauces are great (albeit overpowering) but not enough to justify the price point. Kind of disappointed.","The food was amazing!! Ate N2 beef noodles Had lamb and spinach dumplings, great ! Wife had ox tail soup , really good!! This place is a little hole in the wall , take out place with some stools inside. First walked up looked a little weird , glad we didn't walk away. Didn't give them five star because location is a bit run down. Good for a quick lunch , don't don't don't expect something fancy , you'll be disappointed. Put some food in your mouth and you'll forget about the looks of the restaurant.","These hand-pulled spicy noodles are to die for. I looove carbs and these thick, chewy noodles are perfect. The more ""bite"" the better. I got the Oxtail Hand-Ripped Noodles with the mild spicy level. The lamb dumplings were just okay to me, but I'm not really a fan of lamb in the first place. The cold chrysanthemum tea was super refreshing, especially at the end of the meal! I really like how they have not spicy, mild spicy, spicy, and extra spicy options. My friends all have different spicy tolerance levels, so these options allowed everyone to enjoy the food. I can't wait to come back and try the noodle soups!","I go here a lot for the N2 and it's become one of my favorite take out places in Brooklyn. It doesn't deliver via any app but i have no problem walking a mile or so there because there isn't really any food like it around here.Try the dumplings, both the spinach and the lamb are stellar. One recommendation: maybe take it easy on the cumin? Noodles are usually great but sometimes y'all go a little too hard on the spices.",Xi'an Famous Foods
392,"Used to be sooo good years ago , not sure what happened but ordered the chicken Twice (delivered) it was close to black !! Absolutely burnt and taste ...well there was none! Was my last time eating here and ordering delivering !","So I have to say that I am very unhappy. I went to this restaurant about 2 weeks ago, and the food was just okay. I liked the neighborhood-like atmosphere and the owner or manager (not aure of he was the owner or not) was very friendly. I had sangria and the tres leche cake was very good. However, I was not happy to learn at the end of my night that there was a drink menu, that I was never offered, so I could have had other options besides sangria or wine. As I mentioned, the food was just okay, but I liked that it was small and seemed like a family business, so I was willing to go back. I decided to give them another chance and returned today, on my birthday, only to be totally disappointed! First, there was no bartender, so my only option from the bar was sangria...again. Then I wanted buffalo wings, and they had no buffalo sauce to make the wings. How do you have no buffalo sauce with a supermarket right next door? And strike 3, the worst of all, they had no tres leche cake! On my birthday!!! I left totally disappointed and I am not sure I am willing to try them again, after this.","I was debating between 3 or 4 stars for this restaurant but unfortunately I had to go with the 3 stars. We ordered two different ceviches. Everything was fresh and good, but the wait time was insane. We waited almost an hour for the food to be brought out. The service wasn't good either. The white sangria was good - not too sweet and was tasty. I also thought it was very over priced for what they offered. Overall, very ""okay"" experience with decent food and bad service.","DEE. LICIOUS! Writing this review as I sit here because I just couldn't wait to rave about it. We randomly found this place yelping around for a dinner place near kings plaza. We walked in on a Saturday around 930pm and were seated automatically. We started with the guacamole and tostones. This was a decent sized portion for the 2 of us to share. The tostones were hot on arrival and you could tell they were fresh. The guacamole was ok. We thought it could use more salt but were big salt eaters. For the main course we shared the lamb ribs and mashed potatoes. SO GOOD. The lamb was cooked medium, as we asked, and tasted perfect. Plenty of flavor balanced by the creamy mashed potatoes. For dessert, we had the passionfruit tres leches. Great texture, moist, and just the right amount of sweetness. The biggest reason for the 4 stars is the sangria. It was pretty strong on the red wine and we didnt feel it was balanced. We'll def return for that lamb and to try the other flavors the tres leches comes in.","I am Peruvian so I was so excited that there was a Peruvian restaurant within a mile of where we are staying on our visit to NY (there aren't many in my hometown). The atmosphere was nice. Unfortunately, I was severely disappointed in the food. We ordered Lomo Saltado and Tallarin Verde (steak). The lomo was just ok while the Tallarin Verde lacked flavor. We had to ask for salt and pepper to make it edible. My husband said the platanos maduros were good. Service was slow and not very attentive. The wait staff seemed to switch up on us without notice. But both servers were pleasant. Sadly I can't recommend this place if you are looking for great Peruvian food.","Came here on a Friday night to a pretty packed house but was seated immediately. The gentleman who seated us asked us if we knew what we wanted already as there was a big party there and he wanted to get our food order in quickly so we wouldn't have to wait too long. I ordered fairly quickly and wished I had more time to decide but I appreciated how he was looking out for us! We did wait a good amount of time before our food came out, but we were constantly checked on by multiple wait staff to make sure we were okay and to apologize for the wait. The food was well worth the wait. Our appetizer came rather quickly. We got the guacamole with tostones (delicious) but I was sad to hear they didn't have any papa a la huancaina left as it is my absolute favorite Peruvian food. To be fair, we arrived at the restaurant around 10 pm on a Friday. For our main entrees, we had the sea bass, salmon, and tallarines verdes w chicken. All were absolutely delicious, especially the spinach that came with the sea bass. But the star of the meal was our dessert, the tres leches w passion fruit. So delightful!! Not too sweet and we finished it in 2 mins! Although I wish the wait time was shorter for our food, I will definitely come back here as the food is well worth the wait and the staff is very attentive and kind!",Lima Mill Basin
393,Not pleasant experience. Took to long to get order. Bad service. Disgusting and rude waiter. These guys charge you extra for everything.,This is the very good place to eat service are wonderful.upu should visit with your family and feel TURKISH food.,Very bad experience. Service is horrible. They charge for every single thing. I asked to have my chicken well done and they brought it out well under cooked. Cant even take simple instructions. Maybe if the waiter wrote down the order then orders would come out right. Will not return to this place.,"I always passed by this place, but this time around I came in with my friend cause she highly recommended it. And now I feel bad that I didn't come here early. This place has a very relaxing vibe, there is no dress code. They have seats outside as well as inside. We've been seated right away, the place was not busy at that time but as it gets later it became pretty packed outside, cause the weather was nice, the had a bunch of tables inside open. Most likely on weekends, you should make reservations, ppl celebrate birthdays here a lot. The food was delicio. The baked potato was out if this world. All that staffing elevate the taste on a different level, with perfectly balanced flavors. We shared it in between, cause portion-wise it is huge. I also tried salmon, which was moist and delicious. Turkish coffee is always strong and rich. For the dessert, we tried creme brulee, delicious!! Definitely coming back to try something else from their menu","Always consistent taste and quality.If you don't want to take a risk,go to Opera!It is also super clean.Manager came to my table and gave me a tour in the kitchen.Clean and organized kitchen.","Whether your looking for omelet and toast at any given time of the day or whether you want to skip straight to the main courses, this place has it all.

394,The food is really not authentic Greek . Four guests and not one was satisfied. Very bland ! But the prices are insane ! Not worth anything . I had two appetizers and it was $60 . I eat in some very high end places ...this was a total rip off .,"Recommended by a friend as said its the best Greek in Brooklyn. We went for lunch with a long out of the way drive from 92nd Street.  We decided on some traditional sides and some casual lunch platters.   -Grilled octopus was good with just enough of olive oil drizzle and charness.  -Greek sausage was actually lamb basic. I found it a bit gamey which I don't mine.  Was lean and flavorful.   We decided on two platters: the lamb gyro and the chicken souvlaki.   Each comes a choice of french fries,  rice, or lemon potatoes.  The lamb gyro is really good as its not greasy via the chicken souvlaki was a bit dry and bland.   The fries and the rice were on point but the lemon potatoes were a bit of a disappointment.   Was bland and the worst I have had. We saw other customers ordering the seafood.   Their prawns were huge.   We would definitely go back for their more dinner items.  Their lunch and dinner menu is the same but I would go back for more of their specialize dishes.","Delivery took over an hour. The salad was so disappointing, bland and overpriced ($14 for a small without chicken). The chicken souvlaki was bland as well. Never ordering from here again","Best Greek food around! Service was great and food was delicious. Party of 4 ordered octopus, zucchini chips and spicy cheese dip for starters. Entrees were metaxa filet mignon, chicken souvlaki w/ salad, lamb platter and lamb gyro. Wow  Everything was beyond yummy and I already plan to come back for dinner next week!","I have high expectations for Greek restaurants because I am Greek and I frequently eat Greek food in Greece. The moussaka was not cooked the way it should be traditionally, there was not enough egg plant, just a lot of meat and bechamel sauce. The fish that was baked was very tasty, I recommend getting the fish. The saganaki ( fried cheese)  was amazing and really great quality cheese.","Mediterranean cuisine in my opinion is always on the pricier side but Meze in particular is a bit more expensive. My family and I decided to come here for an early Morher's Day celebration since we've always driven by but never been.  The service was fantastic whether it was attentiveness from our waitress or just other waiters checking in and helping to clean up. You can tell the staff works as a team. The food was essentially good for the most part.  We started with a combination platter of Tzatizki, hummus and garlic dip.  I found all the dips to be full of flavor and the pita very soft. They offered us a second helping of pitas too since our party was large and finished quick with leftover dip to savor. I ordered the filet lemon sole stuffed with crab which I thought was pretty good except it felt very heavy. I could have shared it with someone and still have been very full, so I packed my other half to go. Out of all the dishes I think the New Zealand lamb chops were the most delicious. So moist, tender and not too salty. Fun fact: I don't even eat lamb and I enjoyed my one lamb from someone else's dish. Overall the experience was good but I wouldn't come back on a normal day due to high prices.",Meze
395,The only thing truly eaten was your time. Extraordinary SLOW food service.Lamb ribs at 9$ each. Dry and overly salty with no other nuanced flavor. 4$ each oysters small and underwhelming.6$ fries portion very small. Everything was over salted... I needed to drink a pond to flush out all the salt.Left starving.,Very disappointed with the new menu and chef change--$45 dollar rib eye which turned out to be three slices of meat and a burnt end.,The place looks nice for drinks. but It's really hard to enjoy over salted beef tartare with almost no meat in it... just disappointing...,"Honestly amazing. Lived 500 feet away for the last year and this is the first time I've been here. Every dish was perfect - charcuterie, Great lamb ribs, burger, perfect fries, lite posset dessert. Who knew.","KenScale: 7.75/10When we check out new restaurants, my wife Jun and I rarely order the same dish twice, mostly because we want to try as many different dishes as possible before coming up with my KenScale (and for Jun her own score). On a recent early Sunday dinner, though, Jun did the unthinkable. After making a quick work of one of the two glazed lamb ribs served at Cherry Point in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, she proceeded to order another set. The ribs were priced at $18 per two, with $9 per additional piece. I asked her if she was thinking of sharing the third one with me; she quickly shook her head and said she wants one full rib all by herself. Knowing that my wife loves good ribs in general, I didn't object and ordered another rib for myself. Based on the ribs, alone, is Cherry Point a great restaurant? Definitely, but then a single dish doesn't necessarily reflect the quality of the restaurant. In a way, the experience at Cherry Point was a bit of a mixed bag.Let's talk about the ribs again for a second. You don't often see rib dishes made of lamb, presumably because of the difficulty with controlling the texture of this gamey meat. The kitchen behind Cherry Point more or less perfected the art of lamb cooking, and the glazed outside really did a wonderful magic, giving a beautiful contrast between the crust and the meat inside. The seasoning was also superbly balanced with yogurt and shallot without overpowering the texture of the lamb. No wonder Jun, astonished, quickly remarked that the lamb ribs at Cherry Point were some of the very best she had had in her lifetime. Cherry Point, with its British leaning menu, serves many dishes around meat. In addition to the lamb ribs, the beef tartare and bottarga on a toast was also solid with nice balance in flavor. The other meat dish we ordered, however, turned out to be quite a disappointment. I understand Jun, always partial to duck meat (especially the breast), sets a pretty high standard when it comes to the poultry, but she was very puzzled after taking the first bite of the duck breast that came with bruleed pear and celeriac. The meat's texture was simply off although its color looked enticing. It wasn't clear what the kitchen exactly did, but either the meat seemed to be of poor quality or the right temperature wasn't applied. In any event, Jun declared the duck breast at Cherry Point one of the three worst she had had in her lifetime. The underwhelming duck breast certainly wasn't helped by the side dish of grilled asparagus with capers and basil which could've worked very well with the duck meat with its crunchy feel.Getting a reservation at Cherry Point online wasn't too challenging and the dining room was around half full in the course of our meal. We both really liked the casual neighborhood vibe of the restaurant which seems to be filled mostly with local Brooklynites; if the consistency of the food was there, I could have even considered Cherry Point in the gem category. There is full bar with some potent cocktail offerings that will help complement the food. In retrospect, as we were taking a walk from the restaurant to Williamsburg afterwards, I kept wondering if our dining experience would have completely changed had we ordered something other than the duck breast. If the duck were only half as decent, Cherry Point would have been comfortably within the solid 8.0 or more category in KenScale. It's a bit sad that we jumped from one of the best ribs my wife had ever had to one of the worst duck breast dishes she had ever had. I would certainly love to come back just for the ribs, though.",I went here with some girls for a post-bachelorette brunch and was happy that we were able to get a reservation for 11am on a Sunday for 5 ppl just 1 day in advance. The cold brew was la Colombe which is always a treat. I had to run to my flight just a half an hour into the meal but I was able to order everything to go upfront and they accommodated quickly -- with even some time for me to eat at the table. The breakfast sandwich itself was delicious!,Cherry Point
396,This place is very nice inside!! Margaritas are about 12-14$ and they serve it in a small glass but they were refreshing and strong. They don't have any happy hour and I only tried appetizers.They aren't super generous with their servings. The prices on avacados have gone up so the guacamole is 15$I probably won't come back because this is more of a fancier upscale Mexican restaurant but it was a great experience,Food and service was good but $22+ for an entree that comes with a single drumstick and a single thigh...? No bueno,Really tasty grilled fish tacos served with pickled julienned cabbage and carrots and their four sauces.,"Came here with a friend at 10pm (we were super hangry by that time), thankfully it wasn't super packed that we sat down right away. Loved their ambiance, it was pretty dark inside and loved their decoration... super cute! We started off ordering margaritas and they were SO good, and pretty strong ;) It has a very spicy salty rim, which I think made the margarita. To start off we ordered the Elote and guacamole. The elote was delicious, a little spicy for me but my friend didn't think so. It had such a great taste and the perfect ratio of chilli powder and cotija cheese. Their guacamole was also very tasty. We cleaned the whole bowl. We both had tacos: carne asada & el pastor. AMAZING. One thing, they only came with one soft shell taco... should be two. The meat had such a great taste, hands down fantastic. We then ordered the tres leche for dessert. If you happen to go, I highly suggest you order. Thank me later. Overall, great experience, our waitress was very friendly and super attentive. Definitely a place I would come back too!","This place was a lot of fun, and had delicious food that was just the right size. Whether you want to split some small plates with friends or dive in for a plate of your own tacos, seems you can't go wrong here. I was glad that my friend in Brooklyn recommended we eat here on the one night that I was in town. The bar staff at Mesa Coyoacan were friendly and helpful. Quite a good little spot, and very convenient to the L for the ride back to Manhattan.","I tried this place for brunch. Mexican brunch is probably my favorite type of brunch but this was just so so. My partner loved his huevos rancheros and my huevos a la Mexicana, but I wasn't such a fan. Also it seemed that everyone else who ordered around us got sauces and chips with their meal but we didn't.I guess they don't do it if you order off the brunch menu, which seems odd since there are no specials or deals and you're paying the same price. But what I ordered just might not have been to my liking, so it's subjective. I will come back when it's not brunch and try some things and report back.",Mesa Coyoacan
397,"Service at the bar in the mid-afternoon was exceptionally slow, both in initially serving the drink and the very long wait to place a food order. At the time of the visit, it was not crowded or busy at all. The boneless chicken breast did in fact have a bone. Pointed it out to the waitress, and her response was 'That's not supposed to be there'. Thinking I already knew that. No apology, offer to credit a portion of the meal cost, or visit from the manager. Two stars because the meal was tasty. Otherwise this would have been a one star visit.","Not a bad place to kill time in the middle of the day. Every where else is gonna be crowded with lawyers, judges, criminals and the innocent. I was able to get a seat at the bar easily, drink a $5 Angry Orchard and eat $4 of nachos that came with three different sauces when I thought I'd have to choose one.The decor is worth checking out too.","Really not a good place to spend you dinner. Food is okay at best and costs nearly $20 a plate. The guacamole which tasted fine was $14 and the chips with salsa is not free like most Mexican restaurants. I've come here twice and I've been so disappointed with my meals, service, lack of on-tap beer (or my friends case, no limes for the corona) then followed by a hefty bill. None of the happy hour options are available at waited tables either so don't fall for that trick. This place is only around because the lack of other Mexican restaurant and its proximity to subway,  white collar workers, and lack of better Mexican food options.",Great Sangria!! Had the white one. And three tacos. One shrimp. One chicken. And the last one spicy ground beef!! All were delicious and filling. Only complaint was the temperature of the shrimp tacos. In my opinion they weren't as hot as I would've liked them.  Bartender was on point with the drinks! Liked him and his service was great! The hostess was also very accommodating! Helped us get a table quickly although she wasn't able to sit us outside because they were not able to change the tables which was disappointing but not deal breaking!! Place is set up nice. Great decor all around the spot. Great ambiance. Will definitely return!!,"This place is located right next to the Marriott Brooklyn Bridge which makes it convenient if you are staying there. Reservations are not needed but call and get one if you can as they can get busy.I had one dinner here last week, and it was good. We had the Short Rib Tacos. They were excellent. A server made fresh guacamole at my table, and it was really good. My daughter had a bean and cheese quesadilla. We decided on the chicken enchiladas and the wet burritos. Both were delicious, although my chicken had a few dry pieces amongst the rest, and all came with yellow rice, refried beans etc, as you generally get in Mexican restaurants.There is a basement bar as well if it is a little too crowded upstairs that had a good vibe.","Great atmosphere, it is very pretty and has exciting vibes. But, the food! Ack!Chips and salsa: 1 star. Chips are flavorless and almost stale. They have a nice seasoning on them, but I think it is just to hide the low quality chips. The salsas are forgettable.Pollo al Carbon: 2 stars. Chicken was cooked okay - between tender and tough (no sign of juice), but the flavor was bland. People say that everything ""tastes like chicken"", but not this chicken! It really almost has no taste. The included beans with cotija were pretty good, 2-3 stars. Had some flavor, but probably just because of the cheese. The fried plantains were pretty good though!It's too bad, because the place is really nice. Probably best to just get margaritas and chat, rather than get any food.",Rocco's Tacos & Tequila Bar
398,"Came here for brunch around 2pm. Unfriendly hostess, staff were not attentive and slow table service. We were all disappointed after a 25 minute wait for our food. The biggest disappoint were the pancakes! When the pancakes arrived, it smelled so wonderful and we were so excited. The aroma fooled us though, our tastebuds were met with dry and tasteless bites. The 3 of us only finished 1 of the 3 cakes. We did enjoy the cheeseburger, although we felt the burger needed some more texture + flavor. Anyhoo, the scrambled eggs were creamy and dreamy. Camperdown Elm looked so promising.. perhaps will try dinner in the future.","It pains me greatly to downgrade them since I was probably the first few to give them a 5 star review.The fried chicken was recommended to us by our server for our 5 year old daughter. The chicken was spicy so my daughter couldn't eat it and just ended up eating the 4 fried muffins we ordered. Sorry, but what 5 year old eats spicy food? The one dish (trout with crispy rice) I was looking forward to eating again was no longer on the menu but somehow that dish was still being shown on their website. Fine, I get it, menus change so I asked was there something similar to that dish? They recommended the only fish dish on their menu. Ordered it and it was blah. So not comparable, not even close. Ordered the uni appetizer and they actually forgot it. When we were done with our meal and ask them to cancel that item, she told us they were plating it now. That really irks me. Please don't make me eat something if you forgot to place the order or if the cook forgot to make it and then pretend it's ready once my meal is over. It's an appetizer, not a dessert. The surprising twist was my husband's dish. He ordered the pork and actually liked it quite a bit. Overall, the fried muffins were still good and the waitress comped our 2 drinks (at happy hour prices) for the appetizer snafu. If the muffins were bad and the service was shitty, this would have been downgraded to a 1 star review.","I was so disappointed with this meal, I am shocked by the reviews.  I only went to this restaurant because everyone spoke so highly of this place.We started with the oysters and the spanish mackerel pate.  I eat oysters whenever I go out so I am not new to oysters.  These were gross.  They just tasted off, I could stomach them, my husband couldn't.The pate was okay, interesting, no reason to go back.  Next was the octopus and the wagu tartare.  The octopus was good, small serving (although I know this is a ""small plates"" place, this was small).  There could have been a little better flavor.  The tartare had decent flavor but needed more.  I would have liked a toasted crostini or something to go with it.  Yes, there was a crunch on top.  It wasn't enough.Then we had the pork chop.  This was just bad.  It was so fatty that three of the slices were inedible.  It was small (and we were told this was one of the larger plates).I might give it a 2.5 star, the waittress was night.  Go somewhere.  This place is not it.","Amazing meal; Cosy set up; Service was great; Owner or Manager was very conversational while opening and serving us our bottle of wine... Went into the details of the wine, vineyard, etc. Food - We started with the gem lettuce and it was fresh, light, and the combination of almonds and green goddess dressing was a good way to start the meal; ordered the burger for main and it was cooked to perfection; the smashed roasted potatoes were the star; simple but done perfectly. Would go again.","The food: 4/5. A hodgepodge of globally inspired dishes , which is popular these days. Some things we tried were excellent (no matter what you do, get the burger!) and other were just ok. They definitely need a better dessert menu as well as a wine list by the glass. Fried muffin - 4Mackerel pate - 2Hamachi -5 Japanese friend chicken - 4Waguy - 4Burger - 5Chocolate cake - 2 The service: 4/5. We were a table of 4 and closed down the restaurant, but their servers were very patient with us. Some things we ordered didn't justify the price I thought. Overall: 4/5. A good option in the area.","Quaint little spot in park slope. Came here on a Thursday for date night and was greeted by a friendly waitress. Cozy interior design this is an awesome place for a quiet night. They have a good cocktail and drink menu. My wife tried the fallkill drink and I had a glass of red wine. Great drinks. We noticed from other reviews about the muffins so we tried them as well. Tasty and light the muffins were a great appetizer. I had the Covina and she had the squash dish. Both dishes were very enjoyable. Overall the setting and mood was quiet and romantic, just what we were looking for. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable (I believe the manager poured us my wine and explained a little about the winery). Unfortunately, we did mis happy hour $1 oysters... so we'll be back to try that :)",Camperdown Elm
399,"I used to love coming here but the new food system is ridiculous.  There is a website that you order from, the link is on the chalkboard and you enter the code and then use Apple Pay to purchase.  When I was there I was in the middle of ordering when the site suddenly said they were closed.  They weren't.  I asked the kitchen they said they were open but you have to use site.  2 other people came up with the same issue right then.  We were told the internet must be down and they will work on it while the kitchen staff sat there doing nothing waiting for orders.Really lame","I'm giving this place one star because you have to give some amount of stars. I waited 26 minutes for a simple cheese quesadilla. There's a super douchie security guy who has no life that asks you to move (and TOUCHES YOU WITHOUT ASKING) for no reason other than to maintain employment. Oh, and the quesadilla sucked.","This is a great place if you're looking for a lot of seaworthy east river aesthetic and a lack of common sense. The bar is perfect for a wait, they were very careful with the single bar placement on the only part of the establishment that is floating in the water. The staffs inability to fix the bathrooms which I could have easily fixed myself (I am a plumber) caused a massive, looping line that was not quite conducive to the crowds inability to navigate even a turnstile. There was a quality performance where they moved two canoes through a crowd that could not have possibly been used for anything else other than to enhance the essence of inconvenience.",It's an outdoor seating area and an extended barge that has a separate bar and music. You have to order your food online and when it's done you pick it up from a sealed up kitchen with an open serving window. Seating is a bit tight and ppl leave their trash and spill stuff on the tables but there's a guy who cleans it up. View is beautiful and food/drinks is great which makes up for everything else. Security is there to keep out riff raff and porto potties for the bathroom so if you're a germaphobe just a heads up.,"It's a beautiful GORGEOUS place. The water and set up is amazing. It is a visually pleasant place to visit. But the staff is not friendly at all. You order your food on an app or website. Then you pick it up, the folks that cook the food are almost robotic. They scream your number and that's it. No good day, how are you. And believe me I get it. I worked in customer service all my life, but each interaction is a new interaction. You may be doing the same thing all day. But there are people that actually care about chatting with you and how YOUR day is. As selfish as I know customers can be. So I understand that, but I personally I expect a certain level of communication when I'm visiting a restaurant or bar. So yes it's beautiful, but it killed the mood of my little birthday celebration we were having.","I went here on a sat night.  The good: beautiful views of the water and city, I enjoyed socializing with friends while enjoying the water, sunset, and the moon. The bad: the food was overpriced, I ordered a lobster roll that cost me about 20 bucks with tip and it came to me with half a bun, as if they ran out and were rationing. You had to order your food online and pick up your own food, waiters didn't bring it to you. What's the tip for?!??Super crowded, I guess bc it was Saturday night.Not a diverse crowd, had a frat vibe.And porta potty bathrooms.Will look for a better spot on the waterfront",The Brooklyn Barge
400,"This coffee shop features breads stuffed with various things and some of the nicest folks in the neighborhood. Who doesn't like sweet and savory stuffed breads. A quick Wikipedia search schooled me that these Kolache are of Czech and Slavic origin and that the meat filled ones emerged by Czech expats in Texas. So there you go. Beyond that you have a rather low key and basic coffee shop. There is space to sit up front in the back and in the garden. I have often scheduled meetings here and have always been able to find a seat. I think you can tell a lot about a cafe by the staff and the state of their bathrooms. The staff are just sweethearts. Always very nice which is likely a good reflection of the owners/managers. They are a bit understaffed at times though. I have coming during the day to find the place staffed by one person who had disappeared into the kitchen somewhere leaving the front counter area empty. The bathroom while plain is also revealing. The mirror in there has been vandalized with childish graffiti etchings. It either makes me feel the neighborhood doesn't respect itself or doesn't respect the business for some reason. Considering how nice the staff seems, I am guessing it is the former. I also get the sense they are not so flush with cash that they can afford to replace the mirror. So go buy some Kolache and get that mirror replaced!",I am a fan of the coffee and the pasties. I really do enjoy the space in the back with the tables and places to sit and enjoy the mornig or a table to go do some work. My only compain is that the music is terrible. I mean the worst. I rather them not play music at all. There is better country music than what they play. I ordered noise cancelling headphones just because I like to be here but damn that horrible whack ass corny music. Please get a new station!!!!,"I've been meaning to try this place and finally got to when baby A's play place was nearby. We picked up a few to go and I really wish I got another of the cream cheese one, which was the one the cashier recommended to me when I asked which savory one to go with. I ate it super quickly then moved on to A's peanut butter and jelly that he didn't like but I loved because the texture of the bread is so soft and yummy. I'd stop by to pick up some more if I were in the area. We didn't love the matcha macadamia latte because it was a bit too strong for us and we had to add our own sugar but that's just us.","Love this place and love the staff! Delicious variety of kolaches, both sweet and savory! I think our favorite hands-down was the blueberry sweet cheese, super delicious and it's like sex in your mouth! Seriously, no joke!!? I enjoyed the peanut butter and jam as well! The lemon curd is delicious! This morning I had the sausage jalapeño & cheese-pretty good! Yum yum! Coffee is good as well! The staff is absolutely fantastic and super helpful and very very lovely! I would recommend this place hands-down! If you're driving it's hard to find parking around there but otherwise this place totally rocks!!!!","Why are kolaches/klobasneks not a bigger thing in NYC? I'm sorry, but forget the bagel sandwich--this is the perfect breakfast/brunch food.  This is especially a must-visit for Texpats who are missing their regular sausage and cheese fix (the sausage is appropriately spicy and lovely).  Their ham and cheese is really solid - nice thick slice of country ham - and the rotating array of sweet kolaches is of course always delicious.  I would put their kolaches up against any central Texan bakery.  They have a really cute little patio, too, for when the weather is nice.  Yall should all immediately put this on your weekend list and go get addicted. And then make it a craze so more kolache shops will open up in NYC. ;)",Their lavender honey latte is delicious! It has some light notes of lavender without it being over powering. The barista was super nice and accommodating when I asked for decaf. My husband and I both loved their 'morning' latte with oat milk. I seriously thought that I had to have this every morning. We had looked to buy a Kolache but there was only one left when we got there at around 3pm. We were told that the kitchen is undergoing renovations which is probably why they were short. The one kolache we got was coconut and it was scrumptious,Brooklyn Kolache
401,I've been waiting to try this place for some time.The food at IKEA is better.I am continuing to write more because yelp requires me to and said my review is too short. If this doesn't cover it then I'll also add paid $90 to sweat inside a small room.,"I went here tonight for a birthday party and was blown away by the Boeuf Bourguignon, the scalloped potatoes and green beans. The chocolate desert I had was indescribable, so I won't try. I applaud the whole place. I can't wait to go back.","everyone get the F*CK OUT! it's MY neighborhood restaurant!!i cannot say enough good things about le fond's food that hasn't already been said. literally the only negative is that there needs to be more food on my plate because i hoover the food in under 4 minutes and my husband looks at me and regrets ever thinking he could take me out for a nice, romantic meal where we linger, chat, and share bites of our food. no, sorry you aren't getting sh*t off my plate when we're at le fond.. you can get the f*ck out, too.love le fond.","One of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn. Lovey ambience, thoughtfully prepared food from a small menu which changes regularly, and perfect non-invasive service. 10/10 recommend","My cousin recently got married but her bridal shower was hosted at Le Fond. It took months of planning but we actually decided quite early because of the accommodations and privacy we were able to secure for the event. The owners were helpful in our planning process and were able to tailor some of their menu items according to guests with specific allergens - I'd recommend notifying and planning ahead for these cases. They were kind enough to allow us to decorate the interior with a simple backdrop for photography purposes (hung with command hooks for easy removal). We were also able to decorate the tables with our own DIY succulents. The menu consisted of a variety of brunch items including but not limited to Egg Sandwiches, Fresh Fruit Salad, Nutella French Toast, Buttermilk Fried Chicken (resembled tenders) with Polenta, a Deconstructed Salad - requested ahead of the event, and Fresh Fruit Tarts. All with the exception of the fruit tarts were buffet style - Le Fond was really great in terms of making sure the trays were full. Our experience with Le Fond was nothing short of perfect.","Amazing quiet intimate neighborhood spot! Ordered the agnolotti- which was cooked to perfection, heirloom tomato sourdough salad w/ ricotta- not too rich for a panzanella, the burger- with gruyere which was fantastic and brussels sprouts w/ curry which were also delicious (I'm a sucker for brussel sprouts)! Great service and would definitely recommend for those looking for a date spot in Greenpoint. Pro tip- they only have a half bar so only beer + wine but try the Rosé negroni- tastes like a negroni but a lot easier to drink and it's on happy hour for only $8.",Le Fond
402,"3 stars for the chive cakes. Everything else was not memorable or flavorful. The place is understaffed.

The Pad Thai tasted good but there was a piece of the plastic scrubber in our dish. When I mentioned it to the worker she said it was the end of a bean sprout... okay.

403,Welp! I don't know if it was because we were the last customers but.... disappointed it how we left. It was our anniversary and all I wanted was fish and chips. My husband ordered a fish sandwich. The fries were crispy and hot but the fish was a soggy mushy tasteless mess. The best part of the meal was the appetizer(general tso cauliflower) and the desert (churros/ice cream). The drinks weren't good either. It just felt like a complete waste of our anniversary dinner and a waste of money. $105 dollars later we are home trying to find something appetizing to eat. The service was great but we can't eat that.,"First of all, we waited for a host to seat us for about 10 minutes. Nobody greeted us or paid attention to the fact that we walked in. I had to ask the bartender to seat us. He did. Second of all, we waited another 10-15 minutes to at least GET WATER!!! Well... nobody greeted us at the table either. I asked for the manager and bartender came and brought us water AT LAST. What is this? Is this for real??? I have meant to try this place for a while and this is the kind of service I get? Disgusting.",I came in for nice fish and chips but was quiet disappointing honestly. It was not crunch at all and was very wet :( cole slaw was okay nothing special. Malt vinegar was pretty bland. Sorry but maybe i had too much expectation looking at the place. I would try different stuff later,"Wonderful.Had the shrimp tacos, the reel deal and a couple ofcocktails. Food was super fresh and cooked perfectly- service was friendly and attentive. Room was well decorated.","So, what's the verdict?  I really dig the concept!  But why? (Three Stars?).  What do I like?  Well, this restaurant offers an assortment of fresh and tasty seafood at an accessible price point; the restaurant is spacious and modern; and the service is warm and attentive.But, the service was ""too attentive.""  The meal was rushed.  Our entrees were served before we could finish our appetizer and we were in and out the door in under an hour.  Our meal was mixed.  The appetizer was disappointing.  We ordered the Maryland Crab Dip - which had plenty of cheese, but not a lot of crab (there were no chunks of crab).  It tasted like cheese purée with crab flavoring.  For $22, I expect crab and more than a handful of tortilla chips.  The chips are only good for half the amount of dip served, and we required a tortilla refill.  Our entrees were solid - Fish & Chips and The Reel Deal (make your own meal!).  The fish was tasty, well prepared, well seasoned, and well portioned.I think this place has potential - certain menu items required better execution and the pacing was just off.  Also, turn down the volume on the music.  It's not a club!  It was difficult to converse without raising my voice.","Clam chowder runny, had one clam in it. Said something, manager came and offered another one which took long to arrive. The second one was way thicker but way too oniony. They don't quite have it.

It's extremely well priced (my suspicion is their rent is very low because of the block they're on). The menu is set up in a way that makes it very easy for vegans, vegetarians or pescatarians to eat - though there are a bunch of meat options too.","It's been our favorite place, especially for bibimbap since 2015! But today's visit left us feeling disappointed to say the least... first - it took like 20 minutes for waiter to give us water and drinks.. and restaurant was empty. Also they changed the menu and bibimbap we got was lacking flavor, and when I asked where is the fried garlic, which we ordered as an additional topping, waiter told me - it's inside. Haven't found it though... still got charged for it. Missing the old Dotory :( kimchi and anchovies were amazing. The rest - disappointing","This is my favorite spot it williamsburg. Its so cute and cozy, perfect for a casual date. I love the servers, they are always kind and helpful.My go-to order is the kimchi, the bok choy, the japche noodles, and  sometimes  the vegan boa buns.This place is great for vegans and meat eaters.","This is my number one lunch special place in Williamsburg. Amazing lunch bowl for only $11, I come here at least once a week. Cozy place and very nice servers.","Pretty cutesy spot in Brooklyn, didn't expect it to be so cutesy but hey I really liked the vibe. I ordered their Kimchi fried rice and dukbokki, and was pleasantly surprised by both. They both tasted better than most of the same dishes I get at other places. The kimchi fried rice had a lot of savory flavor in it when sometimes the dish can come off as sort of bland at other places. The salad really complimented the dish as well. The dukbokki also was very spicy but to the point where it was delicious and not overbearing. I also loved the texture of it as it wasn't too soft or too hard, as some places can make it too much work to chew. It took a really long time for us to get the food though, which was disappointing, but the waiter did say that they were working on a big order, so it's understandable.",Dotory
405,"Most of the staffs were friendly, but one staff was calling me to get into the restaurant by moving his index finger in a hook shape back and forth, just right in front of me. There are no crowded people, not a situation that he had to use that gesture. Also, it's not the airport, he was not in charge of governmental authorities, but in charge of keep door opening for us, who was standing right in front of him, to get in. So I feel very bad when he used that gesture. I know that gesture is common but also know that this is not regards as polite. He also complained while cleaning up other customer's table right after they had left. Put cutlery and dishes into a basket wildly, which made big noise while we were eating. He better not to work for that place.","4.5 stars***Decor: This place is so cute. Reminds me of a little greenhouse/ dining in a backyard garden.

Food is delish overall and prices are decent.Service: Nothing notable about service. Nice host and servers and no complaints.","We came in for brunch for a table for two, and was told that we'd have a table ready in 20 minutes. Came back 20 minutes later, and there were 3 two tops visibly available, but they told us to come back in 10 minutes. We came back in 15 minutes to give them time, and they not only told us to wait ten more minutes, but they sat a party of four who put their name on the list after we did. Not only is this severely disrespectful of their customers' time, but it's also a totally inefficient and terrible way to run a restaurant. I'm never going back here again, no brunch is worth being jerked around like this.","A little gem in Williamsburg! The interior of this place is so unique, there's a tree growing in the middle of the restaurant. My boyfriend and I ordered the Okinawan Taco Rice and Tsukune Don (chicken meatballs) as our entree and we loved it. The taco rice was minced pork with rice and salad; it was very flavorful and nicely paired with rice and salad to balance it out. The tsukune don was chicken meatballs with rice, seaweed and sesame seed, surprisingly not too heavy and everything went well together. Highly recommend the matcha cappuccino, one of the best matcha drink I've had and I'm a big matcha fan. The portion of matcha and milk was perfect; a lot of places don't put enough matcha powder but this place knew the right portion; my boyfriend loved it too. The place is a little small so not a good spot for group hangouts but lovely for a date. I came around 11:30am and was seated right away but it did get busy after!","Absolutely love this quaint little spot in the heart of Williamsburg. Their food is rich and flavorful and very reasonably priced. I also enjoy their seasonal specials on drinks and food items. I've had their sandwiches before but this time, I really enjoyed their vegetable Japanese curry and French toast croissants.","Up too early due to jet lag, I wandered around the burg with the vague mission of getting coffee and a light breakfast. Poked my head into this place and wonder of wonders, it was really a small wonder. Food was excellent and the gardenlike setting was such a nice, relaxing oasis in what's becoming little Manhattan.",House of Small Wonder
406,"I got a slice of the double chocolate pie with a cup of milk and the pie was honestly really good. The only reason I'm giving four stars is because it was really smoky inside, enough that I really didn't want to eat inside, and the two people working behind the counter weren't particularly friendly- came across as a bit snobby.",The apple pie is delicious! My husband briefly lost his appetite when the server handled the pie without gloves but he survived. Doubt he'll eat there again but I will. No shame in my game.,"We came to this place looking for ice cream which they definitely DO NOT SERVE. the pies were horrible and to tell you the truth it's not worth $4. My mom will be bringing her homemade baked pie and selling it in front of your store and have your patrons excited to come over here. Also I'm not for sure if this is a self serve parlor, but we self serve in my house. I'm not for sure how long this place had been open but hey need to really take some courses in baking, customer service and making sure the patrons are satisfied. I will be returning not will anyone else hat asks me for a place in the vicinity who has a sweet tooth. Horrible and full of laziness","This place just makes me happy. The pie is excellent, I had a pear slice and a cherry almond and they were both delicious. The pie is also weirdly filling where it can replace breakfast for me (ok not nutritionally :) but filling wise). I also was ready to get my vanilla latte but the lovely woman behind the counter suggested caramel syrup which she made yesterday in house. I tried it and it blows away all the bottled syrups. Regarding vibes, it is very chill, happy, and seems like a great place to work or have a dmc.","My immediate response to this place was excitement because it's charming and cozy. There are plants and artsy people every where you look. Very Williamsburg for being in a very non-williamsburg location.But then...I ordered two pies. One pecan pie and one pear almond pie. Now if a place has pie in their name, im expecting top of the line pies. They were not. They were cold, they both needed a lot more time in the oven because it was extremely underbaked. I don't know if their more savory pies are better but their sweet pies didn't do it for me. I'd be willing to try them again but I was not a fan.However, the iced cappacino I had was very good.","My first time here and the savory pie I had was incredible. The place itself is charming- looks small from the outside but they have plenty of seating inside and even a small outdoor area with benches. I started with an iced latte since it was a hot day - $4 and it was good, no complaints. For food, I was debating between a red pepper/mushroom frittata and the tomato basil cheddar pie, and I'm so glad I went with the latter!! It was perfectly balanced with the cheese, crispy top, flaky crust. I thought he tomato might be overwhelming but it isn't- I loved it! It was piping hot but I couldn't stop eating it lol. At $4 for the slice, it's pretty great! They have a variety of pastries available as well. Would definitely be back here to try more of their pies, especially the sweet ones!",Pels Pie Co.
407,"If you haven't had there hummus and chicken you are missing out on some of the best Middle Eastern food in Brooklyn. I only order take out from them, not sure if the restaurant is nice, but their deliveries are usually very fast.","After placing a delivery order and providing payment information, I waited approximately 30 minutes before I received a phone call to say that my address was not within delivery distance. While I understand that this is not uncommon for restaurants to have a delivery radius - we are less than 1.5 miles from Mazzat. It is unprofessional to take payment information over the phone and not provide a service in return. Will not recommend.","This was a disgrace to Middle Eastern food - the food of my heritage. The pita bread, anything but fresh, I could buy in a bag at any American grocery store. The ""falafel"" did not resemble anything like what real falafel tastes like. The hommous and baba, ugh, also could have been from a grocery store. This is coming from somebody that has traveled extensively in Turkey, Israel, and Jordan with a grandma from Turkey. Please go elsewhere if you want authentic Middle Eastern style food. This caters to Brooklyn yuppy people it seems that haven't been exposed to real Middle Eastern cuisine so they don't know the difference and will pay $16 for a plate of food from jar/package...ignorance is bliss. Left feeling indigestion. Go to Bay Ridge, Astoria, or up the street to Atlantic Ave and skip this!",This place has amazing authentic food! The owner Gamal is very nice and proud of his restaurant! I will definitely be back. The meat is delicious with great hummus & dips to go with it!Thank you for your hospitality Gamal!,"We had a nice quiet dinner on a Sunday night. Seemed like they were low staffed but customer service was still amazing. Food was delicious!! Did not have room for dessert, but will definitely try it on the next visit.",The grilled chicken breast with hummus is so good. We order to our studio from this place several times a week. They are fast too.,Mazzat
408,Chunky pork tacos are bomb.  Smoothies are trash.  Burritos are good.,Checked the reviews hence why i went... The food was HORRIBLE! Maybe it was once in a million luck for me but the beef had absolutely no flavor and the texture of the taco as a whole was undesirable.Will try again maybe it was off today.,I moved neighborhoods and seriously miss this place! Very quick delivery. Always amazingly delicious.,"Was a little skeptical at first because the restaurant looked closed and empty, but could not be more satisfied with my experience. The food was amazing, with plenty of options and friendly staff. Definitely will be making this place a regular go-to!","Updated Review: this place used to be amazing. It's really gone downhill. Delivery times are often 30 minutes to an hour later than what they tell you it will be. When the food arrives, it's cold and soggy. Original review: When this place is good, it's truly amazing. Quality can be a bit hit or miss though. We order take from here regularly have had to throw out the salsa a few times because it was not good and tasted like it was fermented. If they could keep the quality level consistent, this would be a 5-star place no questions asked!","When this place is good, it's truly amazing. Quality can be a bit hit or miss though.

After 2 hours of waiting Seamless let's us know that they ""were too busy to make the pizza, and are cancelling the order"" only after Daddy Greens told us ""5-10 more minutes, it's on the way"" on 3 separate occasions.Never got the pizza. Idk if it's good or not, but trying to do delivery from here seems to be a waste of time. Wish I had read the other reviews before ordering.","Great place. Great pizza. Solid cheese, solid crust and great sauce.The pie that was delivered to me was not what I ordered. Upon my call, they arranged for a new pizza to be delivered immediately. Both pies were great, but perhaps more importantly, customer service was something I have not experienced in a while. Eat here.","Just ordered four different slices to try. I was a little skeptical at first of the sesame seeds but, to my delight it made the slice all the more better and a great distinction from any of the other NY pizza spots. The chicken on the buffalo chicken tasted great and wasn't too dry. Although I don't really eat bacon like that, I tried the chicken bacon ranch which tasted good too. The bacon gave me a sweet kind of taste which, with the blend of the rest of the slice made the taste! As for the margherita and plain slice, they were pretty standard but I promise you all still worth the try. Thanks for the Sunday slice Daddy Greens, we'll be back and bring friends!Oh and might I add, the slices are healthy sized!","Daddy Green's has easily become my favorite pizza spot in Bedstuy! The staff is friendly, welcoming and very quick which helps since I'm usually stopping in on my lunch break. The ambiance is great! They play dope music and have rotating art from community artists decorating their walls which I really enjoy!I recommend their buffalo chicken slice , super Mario slice (mushroom) and of course you can't go wrong with their classic cheese or pepperoni slices. If you're not in the mood for pizza (not sure why you're at a pizzeria) but their chicken Penne Allá Vodka and Chicken sandwich are delicious! Pair whatever you order with their delicious homemade iced tea, I get it every time I stop in. Daddy Green's is an awesome spot I highly recommend! Bonus points for being named after the pizzeria in the legendary Bruce Lee film ""The last Dragon"" check them out!",Daddy Greens
410,"I have heard good things about this place. Maybe it's just me but I didn't really enjoy the food as much as I thought I would. Service was 5/5. The food however was very salty. There were no other flavor besides salt. We got the zarape de pato, tacos and carne asada con hongos. The Zarape de pato had a nice sauce to it but I wasn't a big fan of how it was served. I thought it would be more of a taco as well. The steak again was salty. We couldn't even finish it. The only thing was the tacos.Overall I don't think I will personally come back.","The food here is just OK. Fancy doesn't mean better nor does it mean authentic when it relates to food, especially Mexican food. Everything was overpriced and I think the food is more smoke and mirrors than quality. I prefer Casa Azul up the block which for me was much more authentic, tasty and reasonably priced for the neighborhood.","I had a reservation which was confirmed at 5:30pm. We showed up 9 minutes late- NINE minutes- and the hostess had the nerve to tell us our reservation was canceled. That is entirely unacceptable, especially for a confirmed reservation. The food is not worth this kind of pathetic customer service. We ended up just a few blocks away at the new Casa Azul, which was terrific Oaxacan cuisine. Skip this pretentious restaurant and go there instead.","This is one of a few of my ""go to"" spots. It has never failed me. The manager and staff always treat me as ""family"". The drinks are on point, the guacamole is made to order and the best I've ever had, the specials are outstanding and the deserts are incredible. Atmosphere is great, alive but not too loud. Chill, but light enough that I can appreciate the presentation of my entree. Good for a date with the wife, dinner with the kids, drinking with friends. I recommend and will be back!","This place is solid every time I go. The guacamole is made to order so it's always fresh and as hot or mild as you like. Food has always been fresh and delicious. Specials are interesting and innovative. Frozen ""Rosalita"" margarita is outstanding, Sangria great if you want to take it a bit easy. Deserts are over the top! My wife and I can only get one to share because we're full. Place is clean with a great atmosphere for a date or family. Service is attentive without being over bearing. I try to get there at least monthly and recommend it to my friends.","Oh my lord - the food is sitting in me in a rock!  We have guacamole which was all right - but bland then we each ordered separate entrees. I got the $11 pork tacos and he got the skirt steak in mushrooms sauce.  Both entrees tasted boring, bland and uneventful.  For dessert- three leche cake which takes like an old shoe - the cake tasted like it had been sitting for a while as well as the whipped cream on top.  The cocktails were not grewt - just boozed up with tequila.  If I have to connect this food experience to another past food event - I'd pick my old hang out in undergrad - mexican joint with stale chips and boring entrees like burritos and enchiladas filled with dried chicken and other overly cooked meats ...No clue why people come here except if you are missing your tastebuds... Azul will get their liquor license in 6 weeks! Thank god!!",Fonda Park Slope
411,"The food wasn't good at all! My friends & I came here on a Saturday around 8pm & already they DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING. There's a stereotype associated with Caribbean restaurants always not having anything, & this one was no different. How do you close at 2am & by 8 all you have is curry chicken, rice & peas, spinach, pumpkin & stew chicken?!?!!? Are you kidding me. The female at the front was rude (as they are normally stereotyped as being once again) my friends & I are ordering & she's having a full blown conversation with a guy that walked in & she couldn't do two things at once, because all of us had to repeat what we wanted. THEY DIDN'T HAVE NO BAKE OR TINGS & THATS THE NAME OF THE PLACE!!!!!!!!","This place has gone down hill. My man ordered 2 oxtail meals and when he called me to ask me what sides I wanted I asked what did they have. He took a picture of the side menu inside and I called him and told him what I wanted. They were out of everything. It was only 3:00pm.  What took the cake was while I was on the phone with him the rude lady that was talking to my man was very nasty. I told him that I wanted dumplings, which was listed on the side menu. She very nastily said that ""dumpling is not a side"" but it is clearly on the menu. I truly don't know how people can run a business and be so rude. I am never coming here again unless they get their sh** together.","Prices are reasonable... always enough food, even at night and the customer service is good so far. Just parking is the worst. The block is narrow and cars are always parked or double parked.","I love bake and things! Been coming here for years, it is my go to spot once I hit Brooklyn! I would gladly give it 5 star if the ladies were a little more personable and the process of ordering the food a little bit easier. Also, no prices posted for any meals except the $5 special.","Just went back to get a big ass roti and it was just as good as my first visit. Michael provided such great customer service. Despite how small it is, you get such a yummy variety of food. Must go!","Wow. $12 bucks for oxtail? How can you beat that? The owners were so nice. All the veggies were super fresh tasting, from the okra to the mixed veg. They also do a lot of specials. Definitely stop by for authentic Caribbean food with wonderful hospitality. I can definitely see myself as a regular here. Doubles are a morning/afternoon thing so make sure if you're craving those to go early. It's also nice that they take credit card! Highly recommend!",Bake & Things
412,"Ordered the sweet and sour chicken combo. Delicious  Also ordered the fried pork wontons, not in love with those but still decent.","Typical hole in the wall Chinese spot in the neighborhood; no tables and a plexiglass separating you and the cashier. Has a variety of options on the menu ranging from the obvious Chinese basics to chicken nuggets. A wall of pictures of some of their most popular items can be seen as you enter. They make homemade dumplings which you can get either fried or steamed. This place is quick (usually 10-15mins food is ready) cheap and cash only. They give you A LOT for your money. If you're like me and don't want to cook sometimes or run out of food in your fridge, check out this spot. Too bad they don't offer delivery.",I called to place my order and ask for the price. Apparently prices change every 15 minutes so always walk with extra just in case  the food is decent though,"Simply put this is the best in Bed Stuy and in my opinion the best outside of Chinatown. The food provides a bang for your buck and is so tasty and flavorful. I HIGHLY recommend calling ahead, especially on weekends when it gets super busy. Must tries are the honey fried chicken wings and the steamed dumplings.",The food is so fresh! I came here to have some Chinese food that wasn't heavy on grease. The chicken and broccoli dish was so tasty. You could tell everything was fresh. I am definitely coming back.,"I love this place! They have fair prices and the food they serve is excellent. I ordered Tso tofu and soup, it was delicious. The portions are enough for two people so don't order too many dishes. The décor of this place is simple but very clean. Service was great. Definitely give this place a try!!",Lucky House Kitchen
413,"I got the Salmon Avocado Toast with orange juice. The staff was very friendly, but the food isn't that great. Toast was difficult to cut off and had no flavoring into it -- a bit dry, and eggs weren't cooked particularly well. But smoked salmon was ok, avocado slices were fresh. Would give 5 stars for service, but -2 for food.","This is literally one of the worst restaurants I've had dinner at in NYC. The waitress was rude but I'll blame it more on her being overwhelmed. It's Memorial Day weekend on Monday and we live in the area and didn't wanna cook. We read the amazing reviews and decided to come here we got wine, apps and our entree. The apps were 5/10, wine 4/10, main course 1/10. Literally one of the worst restaurants I've attended in NYC. The waitress was a rude but I kinda blame more of the management. One waitress for the whole restaurant?!? The fish tasted like it turned and the pasta was over cooked like mashed potatoes","Crushingly mediocre. I have no idea why this restaurant is so highly rated; everything was bland and very forgettable, the waiter seemed to forget about us even though we were one of only three parties there, and the playlist was a distractingly awful late 90s/early 2000s top 20 mix. The food is not bad - as in, not gross, but no more - but not at all better than what an average home cook could produce. If you can't cook at all, don't know any better and have money to waste, give it a try!","I love this spot. I live down the block and I constantly find myself craving their truffle butternut squash pasta. The food is fresh, you can tell the pasta is handmade, and everyone who works there is Italian which is always a good sign at an Italian restaurant. The vibe is cozy, perfect for a date night, quiet brunch or quick bite after work during the week. Cash only, so make sure to have some on hand, or you can use the ATM outside the restaurant. I love all of their pasta dishes and their eggs benedict for brunch is great.","I'm not gonna lie, I came here after a fun day of consuming several Aperol Spritz's. This restaurant was recommended to us by a bartender at a spot nearby to Testo. I'd never heard of it but I figured it must be good!For an appetizer we got calamari. They really give you a lot! It was delicious. For dinner our table ordered an assortment of pasta dishes. I believe I had the gnocchi special. Everyone loved their pasta and it was gone within minutes. It wasn't super busy and was very cute and authentic on the inside. They even gave us some complimentary Limoncello at the end of our meal! Not sure if I would come out of my way to eat here again but it was excellent and I'll be back if I'm out and about in the area again.","mmmm, so. good. stopped in for a sunday dinner recently. was staying in williamsburg for the weekend, and this place came highly recommended. a little hole in the wall with fantastic italian options. i started with the caprese di bufala, which was delicious. a standard, but well done. topped with some kind of pesto vinaigrette which was divine. for my main meal i went with one of the dinner specials. squid ink tagliatelle in a butter sauce with shrimp and scallops. i ate every last bite! would def recommend here. cash only, FYI--but ATM is outside.",Testo
414,Really slow service. Rude staff. Dirty bar surfaces which I had to clean myself.. it's two bartenders taking shots with customers. Overall way too relaxed and unprofessional for my taste. This also explains why it was practically empty on a Friday afternoon,"2nd visit and definitely a disappointment. Didn't have enough chairs for all the tables, and not enough menu's to go around.  Food service was extremely slow so we decided to cut our losses, get the check for the drinks and appetizers and and go somewhere else.  I wish we had a better experience.","Never would spend my money here. I just walked in to have lunch with 3 friends and was greeted by an(not to be racist but just to describe) A women who never stated her name but she  was a women of Asian decent. We sat at our table the waiter came and something seemed a bit off with her.  She came a first time and I was about to order and said give me a second and ran away.I was looking at pictures of drinks on their yelp page I showed her a picture like ""which drink is this?"" She said ""what?"" I said ""this is on your yelp page I was trying to figure out what drink this was on the Menu"" I first asked about there drinks which she had no knowledge about. She ran to the bar to speak to another employee then came back and said she needed ID, I then handed her my New York State ID she stared at my ID for 3 minutes seeming to try to do mental math, she then told me I was under 21. Lol my birthday is on the iD 02/02/1994? I verbally told her my birthday, she then told me  ""your ID says your under 21, there's no date of birth"" she then gave back the of which fell on the table. We ended up walking out because I felt insulted and uncomfortable so this is no a place I recommend.","The interior design, music and ambiance were %100 on point! I brought my grandmother here for her 83rd b-day and she was thoroughly impressed but those three things!The food needs a little more love and flavor. The collard greens were not fully cooked as a traditional collard green should be. They were closer to the raw texture vs. comforting and easily chewable. The pork flavors inside were negligible, visible and visually deceiving. This was a table wide taste point. The other flavors for other dishes also came across as half-hearted. I ordered the shrimp and grits expecting a circus of flavors, smells and sensations as I ate but it didn't hit the basic mark.I feel this spot may be known for their night life over their food BUT THIS PLACE HAS THE HUGEST POTENTIAL TO BE AMAZING AT BOTH! the concept and menu were amazing but the flavors need more attention. I'll certainly be back for more atmosphere though! That atmosphere was a vibe even for a Saturday 5:00pm reservation. Also not too loud and it was nice that we could chose anywhere to sit the space and layout are huge and thoughtful!","Sweet Science is delightful! How did I not know of this place!Come here if you wanna dine surrounded by awesome local art (many pieces for sale). Come here for a staff that is patient, accomodating and very happy to serve. Come here to sit by the bar and read a book if you wanna pretend to be unimpressed by this amazing laid back spot.  Come here to enjoy their many delicious cocktails and FOOD! Whatever else you do in Williamsburg, PLEASE, make sure and COME HERE.

415,"Shawarma was ok, although very soggy in sauce. I was told that the pita bread was freshly made in the premises, but it looked and tasted like commercially available pita. I asked for some hot sauce, since the sandwich wasn't spicy enough.I was ultimately charged extra for the hot sauce, which was refrigerator cold. Service was dismal.Never again!","It was okay. Disappointed that one Reese's cup sized ""Birds Nest"" a whooping $4.00. The takeout had everything mushed together and the moisture of the cabbage and salad part flooded the whole platter. I'm pretty upset because I was sooo looking forward to new cuisine.",How bad service can kill a restaurant and a long awaited reunion 101: Lessons taken by Kulushkat. The food was strictly average and honestly by the time it came we were so done. We easily waited 45+ mins for anything to show up. The table behind us got seated and had their dinner served in between our wait!! After enquiring twice did they bring out two out of the three dishes we ordered. We waited five more minutes for the third one to arrive - only to find a side missing. Tried to catch the server's eye and eventually gave up. Walked over to ask for the side and was given a side eye before being handed the dish! Even getting plain tap water was an arduous task for these guys. Never coming back!,"Omg, William is amazing! We come here very often and I would say he is the sweetest server Kulushkat ever had! Good luck in the future. Food is more delicious with William at Kulushkat!",Good chicken shawarma sandwich. We stopped in for a late night bite. They make their shawarma sandwich with cabbage salad and hummus. The sandwich was ready quickly.,"Excellent place to get delicious Middle Eastern food. My friend ordered the hummus with vegetables and falafel which he enjoy very much. The pita bread with chicken shawarma was delicious, and the seasoned fries had a wonderful spice level, which the tahini sauce nicely complimented. The service is very friendly and fast, only the issues with the door not closing properly by itself can be annoying in the cold weather when eating in.",Kulushkat
416,"It is okay here for lunch, service is okay and food is better.Small place loud people there.","Staff was nice, I liked the spinach dumplings and the sesame rice balls (sweet), but the other dishes weren't really good and had a weird taste like dishwasher liquid or something. I felt like dishes were a hit or miss.","No, no, and no. Bland, overpriced dishes. Head over to sunset park for real dim sum and skip this sad excuse for yum cha. We had a lot of the usual dishes I get at dim sum. The har gow, the cheong fun with beef stew, the turnip cakes, and the chasiu bao. All of these were under seasoned and way too small. We also got an order of the mapo tofu, my cousin's favorite, and it was so disappointing. We hate wasting food, but the leftover mapo was decidedly left behind. It had a weird flavor, that was really unpronounced because EVERYTHING lacked flavor. I don't think I'll eat NY Chinese food outside of Sunset park ever again.","My family and I were craving dim sum, but we didn't want to go the same restaurants on 8th ave, so after a quick yelp search, we stumbled upon this place and I'm so glad we did! I didn't have high expectations since this place didn't look like your typical dim sum restaurant, but I was definitely impressed.It's a bit pricier than what you'd pay for on 8th ave, but they make up for it in quality. We started off with a pitcher of iced jasmine tea with chrysanthemum and we ordered your standard dim sum dishes, like lo mai gai (lotus sticky rice), steamed chicken feet in garlic sauce, sticky beef short ribs, steamed garlic spare ribs, and golden mantou (fried mantou with condensed milk). But we also ordered some things you typically don't see on a dim sum menu, like red oil Szechuan dumplings (we went with a chicken filling), and, my favorite, the lava lovin chicken.First off the tea is amazing, so fragrant and refreshing. The floral notes of the jasmine and chrysanthemum were so sweet, you almost forget there was no sugar. All the standard dishes were great, they taste similar to other restaurants except the quality of the meats and vegetables were better, aka no tough, stringy pieces of meats or sad vegetables. The Szechuan dumplings were surprisingly not spicy or greasy, despite all the chili oil. The dumpling skin was nice and chewy and the filling was very juicy and tender, it almost tasted like a soup dumpling. If there's anything you must get here, it's the lava lovin chicken, I'm sad I didn't get a picture of it T___T. It's a chilled chicken dish smothered in some kind of sweet, savory sauce and chili oil on top of seasoned bean sprouts and cucumbers. The chicken was so unbelievably tender and moist and the bean sprouts and cucumbers were so refreshing and crunchy. Now the service could a little more work, we had also ordered some spring rolls and 2 noodle dishes and we even checked them off on the paper that was at each table, but we never got them. We sat there for a while watching the table next to us get their food while we kept waiting. It wasn't until we asked about our other food that we were told the chef wasn't making anything else. Apparently we weren't the only table that experienced this and the excuse we all received was the chef probably didn't see it, which was a first for me. The waitress also kept assuming the other table and my family wanted to order more food, luckily we were already full, so it all worked out, but I'm not sure how they missed 3 orders","This place was one of the highlights of my trip to Brooklyn. We stumbled upon it while looking for a post-wedding party meal, and this just hit all the right notes. It is one of those places that you know will be good as soon as you walk in: the smells, the menu, the food other people are eating. And strike gold we did.We ordered a mass amount of food for four people. The pork soup dumplings were so delicious that we devoured 4 orders and the scallion pancakes were the best I have ever had. Our table was stacked high with bamboo trays, and we walked away paying $25 apiece.Food was delicious, price was extremely reasonable, service was prompt. Highly recommend!","If you like dim sum, this place is solid. They have all of the classics and some dishes that aren't traditionally Cantonese but still delicious (like wontons in chili oil 红油抄手).We ordered a lot of dishes, and the top four voted by the group were: 1. Steamed pork dumplings (蒸饺): perfectly shaped and steamed - full of juicy pork and scallion flavor2. Tofu skin rolls stuffed with pork (腐皮卷): you must try these - they are tofu skins soaked in a juicy sauce wrapped around pork. This is not ""tofu"" in the sense Americans are familiar with it - it is a thin almost pancake-like style of soy bean curd.3. Shumai (烧卖): Classic dim sum dish - pork, mushroom, and shrimp filling wrapped in a dumpling-like wrapper except they are round and open at the top. Each one was was juicy and had a nice piece of shrimp in it.4. Turnip cake (萝卜糕): My personal favorite. It's a savory turnip cake that is soft in textureWasn't crowded when we arrived around 1pm on a Saturday, but then started to get busy around 2:30. Service is efficient and friendly. Bathroom is clean.",Dim Sum Bar
417,"I'm giving three stars for their staff. They were really sweet. The pizza... wasn't a fan. It was just lacking... in taste, in presentation, in texture of crust, just wasn't impressed. I believe that the Margherita pizza is a classic and though simple, is a good solid pizza. But this tasted like they pulled some plum tomatoes out the can and slapped some mozzarella on it and called it a day. So I was disappointed to say the least. Won't be back.","Food was good - but do not recommend for a large party. It took almost an hour to get our drinks, 2 hours to get food (at this point 2 people didn't get their food at all & they had to reorder because their order was lost). Six drinks never came & we had to repeatedly ask for more water (2-3 times each time we needed water). The problem was they were woefully understaffed - only 1 bartender and 1 waitress for the entire restaurant on Saturday Brunch. Waitress spent a weird amount of time typing things to the computer instead of helping the bartender, serving, or checking on the table.","Walked all the way here from Prospect Park because of the great Yelp reviews. Not only am I not a fan but had stomach pain from what I ate there. I ordered the kale salad called Ogliastro and Coppa pizza. There was something off about the pizza, besides the fact that it's half the size of a $17   pie that you get elsewhere in the City. Kale salad did not taste fresh. I should have known.Not sure if this was a single incident but not coming back here. Don't recommend.",Awesome pizza. Thin crispy/chewy crust. Wood fired and top quality toppings.We got artichoke something or other and maybe a prosciutto one? Doesn't matter what. They know what they're doing.Great backyard and beautiful interior.,"Some of the best pizza I've ever had, AND they have a gluten-free crust that they make in-house that is really great!! Love the back patio in the summertime, too. Wish I'd known about this neighborhood spot earlier.","Since we discovered this place (probably about two months ago) we have been probably a dozen times. There is no better brick oven pizza in all of Brooklyn- and we've been to them all (including Lucali). Do yourself a favor, and order the Carbonara, and a bottle of the house red. Great happy hour if you're sitting at the bar, and great staff all around no matter where you sit.",Ogliastro
418,"First time in the latest timeout market, lots of selections, must try:1. NY Salmon @ Avocado2. Basil Pasta @ Felice","The Time Out Market in DUMBO has excellent atmosphere. However, the restaurants here are ALL dreadfully  over-priced and not at all satisfying. This was very disappointing as I was so pleased when I learned that a food court would open in this architecturally wonderful site!  My experience with the Center Cut Deli was instructive.I entered Time Out Market with a great craving for Pastrami and decided, quite indulgently and much against my usual better judgement to pay the $19.95. I asked for Rye bread with Caraway seeds, the dolt working there had no idea what caraway seeds were- a very bad sign. I settled on plain rye. He brought me a blend of mediocre rye swirled with pumpernickel. I like my coleslaw on the side. They put some cole slaw upon my sandwich without asking me. This was dumb! The quarter slice pickle was quite skimpy and pathetic- just one! The portion of okay Pastrami, was certainlynot what a deli might describe as overstuffed. This  pastrami sandwich was most definitely NOT worth the price. There was no mustard in sight to be found-- fortunately mustard was available- obtaining some, resembled the process of making a special order. The most irritating aspect of Center Cut: the impossibility of using  cash. This appears to be the policy of other similarly overpriced restaurants at Time Out Market. Such places should be boycotted by all thoughtful citizens. The aforementioned dolt who served me this most disappointing sandwich carefully watched me as I decided NOT to include a tip. After all, no waiter service had been provided. I was done being a chump. Tip percentage options were too high as well. Had I been suckered into it clicking the tip option as I used my credit card, the total cost of this measly pastrami sandwich would have been $25.00. Still, the character that served me had the gall to say, while hovering over me: NO TIP? I didn't bother to answer him. I will not return to this ridiculously over-priced rip-off joint and am unlikely to patronize other Time Out Market restaurants as well. While Center Cut is attractive in its appearance, it is most definitely NOT the sort of place any savvy New Yorker would or should ever care to patronize. Only clueless tourists will help it to survive. This place does not deserve to survive.","I give this place 2 stars for the rooftop view however everything else was underwhelming. Comparing this to the Timeout market in Lisbon it didn't even feel like a food hall. Firstly the downstairs is cramped and dimly lit. Secondly while the food choices are pretty good, the prices are outrageous. The prices are not in line with a food hall. At those prices you may as well goto a proper restaurant and not have to carry around your own food in a plastic tray (which you paid $17+ for 2 tacos or $14 for mac cheese) . I think it's cool to check out once but don't go there for the food.","I got the hummus from Little Alda and it was AMAZING! We got the special, which was carrot hummus with labaneh, sage, brown butter, and sea salt. It was so flavorful and had warm, fresh pita with it. The employees were also so sweet and very genuine. Would definitely eat here again.","The location of this place is scenic. You have Jane's carousel and the entire Manhattan skyline right outside. The developers and architects did a nice job making the place beautiful with the rustic decor, especially compared to what this building used to look like! It's Dumbo, so you really can't screw that up!A group of us came to check this place out on a Friday night around 6pm. It wasn't too crowded and there were plenty of seats. We tried a variety of places, including Clinton St. Bakery for coffee, Bessou for the crispy rice and fried chicken, Mr. Taka for ramen, Pat LaFrieda for a Philly cheesesteak, David Burke for their salad and their pork shank redemption mac and cheese, and ice cream at Ice & Vice. We also had drinks at their bar upstairs.Positives: The food was good and the portions were large enough to share. It is nice to have a bunch of well-known NYC restos in one place and the team members who work to keep the place clean did a great job making sure the tables were clear and the place spotless.Negatives: It was expensive! Yes, its Dumbo and yes, it's NYC, but for a food hall, it's pricey! Is it more expensive than Little Mercado, Industry City, or Dekalb's? Yes, depending on what you get. It's also not very close to the subways, so there's a bit of a walk that you need to account for. Would I come back? Yes, but maybe when we have out of town visitors. I think the park in the front and the selection of food make this place a perfect spot to bring visitors young and old. But would I come here for date night? Probably not.","Dumbo's newest, gorgeous little tourist trap, it's a great idea with lovely interiors. The good ends there. The restaurants are interesting and diverse, but not all of them are the best in their respective cuisines even though they are priced as such... The prices and portions are insanely imbalanced, and I doubt many of the thousands of professionals in Dumbo can sustain making this a go-to lunch spot the way it's structured. Some examples-$16 for a Breakfast Sandwich$23 for a burger and fries$16 for a joke of a dollop of hummus with 5 pieces of cauliflower on topEven the nicest restaurants in Dumbo are more reasonably priced than this- and that's where I anticipate the people who drive day to day Dumbo food business will continue to take their wallets and appetites. This place is worth stopping in for a look, as the foods are all on display, but if you want to brave the crowded lines and congested walkways for an overpriced bite of something, godspeed.",Time Out Market New York
419,"Very cute restaurant, the food was a huge let down.Pancakes were over cooked and burned, really terrible. Shakshuka, ravioli and farmers breakfast were all completely unremarkable.The second star is only for decor, maybe the drinks are good but I would avoid the food. Also the bathroom fan is broken and smells terrible.","I experienced some of the worst service at this restaurant that I've ever had in New York. Came here during summer for a pleasant brunch with friends, and I picked this place because of the garden in the back. We got seats in the back, and it was very pretty, but the waitress didn't acknowledge us much, and served other tables without coming over to check on us. We had to flag her down several times and ask her for water several times, which she forgot. Finally, another waitress came and brought us water. Food here for brunch was mediocre, with prices being on average around $15 - $20. I had a salmon tartare that was okay, but nothing remarkable. The best thing about this place is the outdoor courtyard in summer. Wouldn't recommend for people wanting a meal here.",To have a nice backyard Is definitely not enough! Went to Milk and Roses after work for early dinner with a friend. Place was really nice... but the food wasn't even okay. My Red Chicken wasn't cooked well.,Beautiful restaurant. The type of place you can stay and chill for hours enjoying cocktails and food. We took our kids which I DO NOT recommend but we had no choice. Walk through the front past the very cool library wall then pass the small quaint bar to the very romantic garden. Great vibe. We split a egg dish up for the two kids and I had the linguini Genovese. So tasty. With short ribs onions and reggiano. Delicious. Great low key spot will be back without the kids.,"Called to make a brunch reservation for the next day, and the lady on the phone said ""WHAT?"" before I could finish my sentence. When I repeated myself, she said, ""Uh, we have a WEDDING here tomorrow"" in a tone that suggested I was privy to Milk and Roses' private event schedule and should have known better than to ask. Then she hung up on me. Hopefully she's not a reflection of the entire restaurant (I ate there once a while back and really enjoyed it) but our phone convo turned me off from ever trying them out again.","This place is such a little gem. Definitely worth the trek to Greenpoint. The decor is beautiful, as is the romantic little greenhouse and garden in the back. The waiters were very sweet too. My friend and I came here for brunch, and we were stoked to learn about their pre-fixe deal, which includes an entree and unlimited mimosas for only $24!! Needless to say, we both got pretty shwastey. I had the mushroom and egg scramble, which came in pretty small portions but was nevertheless on point. I can't wait to come back here to try their lunch and dinner menus! I could see this place being extremely cute at night, especially the garden in the back. Only negative: cash only :(",Milk And Roses
420,"Stopped in for a bite as we are visiting the area and wanted something close by. We weren't disappointed. Great portions, excellent quality! Staff are very nice. Only downside is no liquor, but they said we could bring our own. Homemade meat and coleslaw!!Will be visiting again.","Welp today is the last time I will order from George's. They got my order wrong so I called Delivery.com to get a partial refund and when Delivery.com contacted the restaurant, the clerk basically called me a liar and refused to issue a refund so I will be escalating the issue and will ensure that I receive a partial refund FROM THE MERCHANT. This is not the first ti they have gotten my order wrong but I never followed up before. Lol it is silly because I order delivery often so to lose a customer over $5 is petty. In addition they charged me twice!! Not I have to dispute.","Welp today is the last time I will order from George's.

Food is consistently good with good portions at decent prices. The waiters are pleasant and attentive. We usually go on weekends at ~4pm and are seated upon arriving. There is a wait during prime breakfast/brunch hours until about 2-3pm. Would def recommend.-philly cheesesteak: good size, will satisfy a very good appetite. A little ""meaty tasting"" for me but my boyfriend highly enjoys it.-grilled chicken sandwich: my go-to with added cheese. Chicken is lean and they include a good amount.-gyro: meat is well flavored and juicy. Includes a nice salad which freshens the dish when added inside the pita.-chocolate chip pancakes: love how the chocolate is melted in the pancake.-side fries: have been consistently fresh and not soggy. Not a huge fry person but I like their fries.-side beef sausage: 3 pieces, decent taste. A little meaty for me but my bf really enjoys it.","Pleasantly surprised. Good food, generous portion for the price and good service. Def recommend and will be returning.","Pleasantly surprised. Good food, generous portion for the price and good service.

421,"It is located very close to me so it's no surprise that I end up coming here quite frequently for hot pot. Their selection is what you'd expect from a hot pot buffet, with the exception of the large clams. The service is decent, and the restaurant is very reasonably priced. I do like that they offer some add-on's that are not on the buffet menu, gives us some options for items that similar restaurants do not offer.","We were there when it was about to closed in midnight But service was surprisingly five starsThe food was below expectation and I went there for the ChongQing hotpot, but it wasn't available because we ordered one BBQ  and a hotpot...Besides service, everything else is below average","Friend wanted to try this place so three of us went here on a cold night to give it a go. Friendly staff and space is nicely decorated inside. They have a pretty decent selection for a good price of $22.99pp. I love that they also have individual pots for everyone. Benches along the wall were a bit low and far from the table but that's fine, we can work with it. The soup bases were a bit bland, ok we can utilize the sauces. What gave this place a one star rating is the fact that a cockroach (not a tiny one) had crawled across the table after the food came. The staff saw it when we all gasped in shocked, but only acted surprised versus the shock employees should be experiencing when a roach crawls across diner's tables and up the wall. Not one person came over to apologize or address it. Everyone practically avoided eye contact with us.We decided we weren't going to dine there and wanted to at least let the staff know instead of getting up to leave. Tried to ignore him and say that ""it's ok, not a big deal"" and that they can change our table. We decided to leave anyone and one person meekly apologized to us on our way out. That is not hospitality. That is not a great dining experience. I'm not expecting five star quality but you would think it's common for any restaurant to know how to quickly address situations. We were disappointed on so many levels and none of us plan to go back.","I came here with my parents on Labor Day for dinner, and we were so satisfied! We didn't have a reservation, but only had to wait about 15-20 minutes before we were seated. Right from the get-go, our server was SO kind and accommodating. I don't know his name, but he was wearing black glasses. He gave us recommendations since we aren't too familiar with hot pot, and put up with my super indecisive parents who were taking forever to decide on soup bases. He was also incredibly attentive - whenever we emptied a plate it was cleared immediately, and when we didn't know to skim the oil off the top of our soups, he took the time to show us. We appreciated that this place allows you to have individual hot pots in front of you, since my parents and I all have different preferences. All of the ingredients were tasty and fresh, especially the beef slices! They are also very generous with ingredient portions. When we asked for more spinach, our server literally brought us what looked like a flower pot full of spinach leaves. Overall, I highly recommend this place for hot pot newbies like us. It's a great deal, the servers are incredibly nice, and the food is good!","I come here often because it was by where I used to work and it's convenient for both my former coworkers and I when we want to meet up.It's those typical AYCE hotpot place and free meal on birthday. Because it's those typical ayce, service plays a major role (at least for me). Sadly, I feel their service is up and down. Sometime I would have a nice service and sometimes I would have bad. Service is not as constant as 99 or laojie, where their staffs is make you feel welcome and where they chit chat/joke with you. Aside from that,I feel like the portion of food that they bring out got smaller and smaller each time I went. Last time I went with 3 other friends and we don't know who should eat first because the portion is so small. Normally we just order 3 rounds and we are good to go (with generous amount). I understand that people over order often but still...at least a good portion when we order the first round. We order over 5 rounds because the portion is that small for four people and we lost count of how many times we asked for fatty beef. I normally sit downstair at the basement and it's too dark for me because I think the darker the place is, the harder to see if the food is dirty or not. Upstairs have nice lighting but can't seat big group. Feel like 100fun in a way downstair, just don't really like it. Not my cup of tea.A good thing about this place is....we often get good fresh/sweets crabs.","Had an amazing time here tonight. We had a party of 7 and was immediately seated within 2 minutes. The decor is very modern and clean. Waiters were very attentive and we ordered 3 rounds of food. Food were served within minutes! Seafood and meat are also very fresh. Even though there was a long wait by the door we didn't feel rushed at all. We even had our cake served at the restaurant. When they served the cake, they also dimmed the lights, blasted music for the birthday girl. That was so extra! Oh and their broths are very good as well. We also got to try their famous spicy crawfish with corn. It's sooo good! Price isn't too crazy. AYCE for only $23. Toddlers eat for free and same applies if it's your birthday.",Lan Ting Hotpot
422,"Meh, average Brooklyn hipster place. So so food. They have a million items on the food menu, but they're out of 99 percent of them by 9:00 pm? Drinks average... I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this place...",The backyard is lovely. The food is solid. Reminds you of seafood shacks.  I've been here a few times and my only negative is the staff who seem to be very unhappy.  The guy taking orders was clearly over all of us. I was there last weekend and my cocktail had a hair in it. I brought it back to get another and the bartender put the drink on the bar and when a guy at the bar asked what it was she said he could have it.  Giving someone a returned drink with a hair still in it doesn't seem like a good idea.,"""Bull**##^""If you want a place with a bad drinksAnd attitude, please come here.  I can't imagine a More stupid and pretentious place.  People with their head go their ass and trying to serve you drinks.  What a joke, when I was a Bartender I actually provided customer service.Please come and hang with the most pretentious obnoxious trust finders you ever met.Yes, I totally recommend this place","The Sea Witch is less of a ""hole in the wall"" but rather a ""cove in the wall."" I first discovered this place half a year ago as I was exploring the south slope region and I was immediately caught by the front of this place. It gave off a really strong ""moody"" feel... and that is my favorite type of feel for a bar!Inside the Sea Witch it's dark, and filled with maritime paraphernalia. Past the area were you can order food your immediate attention will focus on the large aquarium that aligns the wall of the full bar. Honestly it makes you feel like your in a Herman Melville story, if that makes any sense.The music they play here fits the mood perfectly. It's hard to describe but it's like an eclectic indie mix of stuff. It's never too energetic and it's great for drinking. I have a feeling these are staff picks because I have noticed a couple of times that the bartender here gets into the songs mood.As advertised from the front the bar does have 20 beers on tap. It's quite an interesting selection and you will find some unique beers on the menu like an ""old ale"" that has a distinct wine taste to it. For the less outlandish selection you can find city favorites like Six Point here as well. Besides beer the cocktails are also appealing. During the winter I had a mulled wine here which I was disappointed to find out was only a seasonal drink. Turns out a lot of their drinks rotate!As said before you can also order food near the front entrance. It's mostly a selection of seafood/grill options like popcorn shrimp, fish tacos and burgers. I was also shocked to see Spiedie Chicken on the menu. I have not seen that sandwich served since my college days in Binghamton NY but it is a welcome one. If you open a tab at the bar you can order from their service window and it will be added. The Sea Witch is a wonderful bar with a great atmosphere, nice staff and quality drinks. I haven't been to their back yet but I would love to try it out and see their fish!","Three words: fish tank drinking. This may be my favorite bar in south slope. This place has four perks that bump it into 5 star range:- The magical fish tank - outdoor seating with some cover - top notch beer list- Kitchen that's open late with high end bar foodThe music is a diverse mix of hip hop and rap, the bar tender is attentive, the crowd is hipster but not over bearing. There were two clean bathrooms and the tables were spread throughout the narrow space well. These small details are hard to find so when a bar does all of them well, I notice. The burger and fries were cooked simply and perfectly, and cost $13 total. And the beer was the rare craft kind but never more than $9.  In Brooklyn, that's a great deal.  If you come here, you won't want to leave.","If you're in the area and you haven't been here, you're missing out on some of the best food and drinks this area has to offer. Obviously they go hard on the seafood- fish tacos, fried oysters (by themselves or as a sandwich), clam strips and more. And AMAZING hand cut, fried to order fries. (We got one order for the 3 of us, ended up getting a second.) The staff is also very knowledgeable but not stuck up about it. And they make some killer frozen margaritas and an awesome daiquiri. The backyard is smoking permitted, so if that's your thing it's there for you. Chill vibes, great food, great drinks. What more could you want?!",Sea Witch
423,"**UPDATE**The owner called me today to explain the situation, and I completely understand now what happened. Given the conversation took place through a third party (Seamless), they had incorrectly informed the restaurant that there was a problem with receiving the wrong salad rather than an issue with the chicken, to which they responded, ""the order is fine, because the right salad went out.""  The owner offered a refund and explained had Seamless told them the real issue, they would have fixed it quickly. Which is a lot more in line with their high standards of food I've experienced in the past. Thanks again for taking the time to fix this silly miscommunication  ----------------------------------------------I ordered the chicken souvlaki platter alongside the Greek salad for pick-up through Seamless. I arrived 20 minutes later to pick up my order and went home. When I arrived home and opened up the package, the salad was great. However, the chicken was undercooked (pink in most parts), rubbery and barely warm. I got in touch with the restaurant through Seamless to tell them about the issue. After a few minutes I was informed that the restaurant has denied refund or to replace the chicken platter because, and I quote, ""for us, the order was fine.""I'm not even sure what that means. As the customer, I'm informing you the chicken is raw. I'm even willing to take a picture to send to you, but apparently that's not enough given that the ""order was fine.""The undercooked food is one thing, but to refuse the opportunity to amicably fix this is a whole different issue. Completely unprofessional and quite sad that a place of business would rather blame the customer than try and fix the situation.","Let me start with the positive. Came in for brunch on a beautiful spring day. The space is great for that because it has indoor and outdoor seating. The server was super nice and professional. He did the best he could under the circumstances. 2 stars for these positive notes.We ordered 2 brunch entrees with brunch drinks. Simple enough. So we thought....The drinks take a while to make and when the server returned; he stated they did not have the brunch cocktail on the menu. ok....we ordered a different drink in substitution of the one they did not have on the menu. time passes. more time passes. However, we are doing ""ok"" because here we are with cocktails on a beautiful day. right? :/  but more time passes. and then some more.....And now we are getting a hungry. Finally the food arrives...and man--- it pains me to say this...but this was not good.My partner frittatta/omelette was really over cooked and the salad on the side looked like something a kid could do. And I ordered their version of a BLT and it looked thrown together with the same sad salad on the side. Then I see no bacon in the BLT. Huh? Also the menu states the sandwiches come with fries and not salad. I am confused. The server apologizes and takes my sandwich back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, I start eating my partner's overcooked frittata because so much time has passed and we are starving. He looks at it and we are so hungry, we get pass the poor presentation of the food. The server returns and the kitchen does not have bacon. Huh? What? No one knew this as we sat here for all this time? He asked if we wanted anything else. I mean......soooo much time has passed now. Now this is just ridiculous--couldn't make this up if I tried. I order the meatballs and side of fries.  My food finally comes out...and this dish is underwhelming. The meatballs looked they were reheated in a microwave and the fries were the leftovers from the fryer. At this point, we drink our cocktails and we are so sad. We live in the area and wanted to try this place out. But this was a bad brunch and bad food. At this price point, I would recommend other Mediterranean restaurants in the area and another one in SoHo. Our server was aware of the everything and may have been a bit embarrassed. He was sweet. Unfortunately though, this place is a no-go. well..at least for brunch.","I honestly feel robbed. I should have listened to my gut instinct which told me to turn around as soon as I approached the door. Went here with my boyfriend for his birthday and we were both so disappointed. My entree came out a full 15-20 minutes before his meal which made for an awkward choice. I opted to be polite and wait for his to arrive which meant I would be eating a cold, overpriced meal. To make it worse, the waitress never came over to apologize for the delay and let us know that it would be out soon. Instead, she completely avoided our table and took a longer path through the dining room to approach the tables that were beside us. Things do happen, I get it, but please don't make matters worse by blatantly ignoring your table when there is clearly a delay or issue. Aside from that, the food was overpriced and not good at all. I feel like I wasted money and calorie allotment. Definitely won't be returning.","Wow. And I mean WOW. This place seriously is the closest to actual Greek food in the USA that I've ever tasted. Some friends and I recently ate at Ela and we were infatuated with the quality and service of this restaurant. We all ordered some sort of chicken dish with Ela fries. The chicken was sooo tender and sooo well seasoned, seriously brought my taste buds right back to Greece. We also ordered a bottle of Santorini wine and it was delicious. Cannot wait to return! Excellent place!","I used to be a fan of this restaurant when it first opened.  I think they have recently made a lot of changes.  I am grossed out by their Greek Salad price.  $18?!?!?!  That's double the price what I pay in Greece, having just come back from a visit recently.  It is $6 more than what you can order from Cafe Mogador which is just around the corner and has FANTASTIC Mediterranean food.  Go there instead of Ela.In addition to the outrageous price, they have also implemented a processing fee if you were to pay with credit card.  I have not heard of any restaurants doing that.  Overall, I am not a fan of Ela and will not be going back there again.","Ela Taverna makes authentic homestyle Greek food.The portions are huge and extremely filling. I can see this becoming a go to spot in the winter months. I was only able to eat half of my dessert which never happens but I was just so full.We ordered zucchini croquettes, Vegetarian moussaka, halloumi, baklava and another dessert which was a chocolate cookie, almond situation.Everything was good, nothing amazing and nothing bad just good.There was a group celebrating a birthday - they turned off all the lights in the back room when they brought out the candle in the dessert which was really nice. At first I thought that the power had gone out but realized what was happening after hearing singing/chanting.There is a fee if you pay by credit card so it might be easier to pay by cash. There are ATMs in the area including and on the same street as the restaurant. All and all 3.5 Stars, will definitely go again or at the very least order for delivery.",Ela Taverna

It felt the exact same way inside as it did on the outside. Everyone still had their coats on. There was not one bit of heat pumping in there and it was ridiculous! That alone is unacceptable. I don't care how good the food is when its that cold. Secondly we were eating our food and a fly fell into our blue cheese, got stuck and died! Its 39 degrees outside why is there a fly flying around?! I immediately felt sick at this point. Not to mention I really wanted that blue cheese.Lastly the food was mediocre. The wings were pretty good but nothing that I would be running back for. The fries we ordered were cold as soon as they hit the table which made no sense at all.Overall I cant say that this was a pleasant experience. I have had this place bookmarked for a very long time and it did not meet up to my expectations at all!!!","Tiny place with terrific wings!  When I lived in Brooklyn, I remembered ordering a bunch of wings from here for a Super Bowl party and while visiting Park Slope recently, I stopped in and the wings were as good as I remembered.  Great sauce, very meaty and a perfect amount of spice (I got the medium).Service was nice.  The day we were there they were only taking cash.  It is tiny so if you come at prime time, you might have to wait for a table.  But if you like wings, this place is great.","It was my first time at that place. My significant other was telling m that place has the best buffalo chicken wings. The restaurant was so full and services was nice. We ordered onion rings and Buffalo chicken and both of them are so tasty.They asked us how we would like to have our wings mild, medium or hot.Even we ordered mild it was hot enough but it was so delicious.At that time, they were just accepting a cash. I think that shouldn't be an optional. All in all it was a great experience. Can wait to try another round.","Mainly come here for the wings but the burgers are pretty wild too. The hot buffalo wings aren't that hot, but you have to get the extra hot ones and those guys hold some heat! Perfect amount of spice for a wing, and it lingers for few mins. They are perfect size, but could be a bit more crispy. Fries are pretty standard and nothing special. But they come with chipotle mayo, and good amount of fries. The staff is always friendly, and it's a great environment. :)",Bonnie's Grill
425,"This is a tough review. We went once before and fell in love with the drinks and the shrimp appetizer! The rest was good- but this we left wanting more. The second time we went was a terrible. The food was salty... maybe a bad day? Could happen. But then we found an item in the lobster ravioli that looked and felt like a 1 inch piece of plastic. The restaurant manager came over to say it's not but rather part of the lobster. Either way...not edible and could have caused a big inconvenience to saw the least. But what made it worse, was the inability to take responsibility and blame it on their providers since they do not make the ravioli in the restaurant. Regardless of who makes it, if it's served in the restaurant they should take some responsibility. The did remove the ravioli from the bill. The waitress then realized she forgot to include one drink so then revised the bill and we left. Sadly we are not returning. All this aside, the food wasn't the greatest.",Female server didn't have any clue about argentinian food when we asked questions about the menu. She was also very rude. She gave us the check and remained next to us to stare at the ticket to see how much we were tipping.,"Went for my birthday. The waitress thinks she's slick and automatically brought a bottle of Perrier to the table when my friend requested water to start. I wasn't there so I wasn't able to call her on her bullshit. You don't bring someone something you're charging on their bill without informing them. That's dishonesty and unscrupulous regardless of the price. 6$ for a bottle of gross seltzer water that wasn't requested. It's a straight forward menu with lazy food presentation. My meal was good but the lack of AC in the restaurant, the slow service when we were only two tables in the entire place at first, and the waitress thinking she's slick is a guarantee to never ever return.","Holy meat coma, Batman(!!!), this place is a carnivore's paradise.  Located in the beautiful tree lined streets of Cobble Hill, Libertador Steakhouse specializes in all things meat.  Yeah, yeah, yeah... this concept is by no means high-end.  It showcases more modest cuts of meat at a commensurate price point, with a healthy dose of neighborhood hospitality and an approachable wine menu.This restaurant cozy and romantic.  As an added bonus, patrons can comfortably dine al fresco!Our Saturday night feast featured two kinds of Empanadas (Ham & Cheese and Beef Saltena Style) and the Mixed Grill for Two.The Empanadas had an excellent taste and texture.  The outsides were soft and doughy (without being underdone) and the fillings were delicious and well-seasoned.The Mixed Grill for Two (with a side of fries) is more or less everything on the menu (including the kitchen sink).  There were some highlights and lowlights to this monumental meat dish.  Unfortunately, the Sausage was dry and tasteless.  I was really looking forward to it, actually!  On the plus side, the Prime Skirt and New York Strip steaks were perfectly seasoned and cooked to medium-rare.  The Spare Ribs were a bit too fatty, but otherwise good.  And the Chicken (while good), is something we could have done without.  Oh, and that chimichurri sauce is fantastic!Next time around, we'll take a more direct route to achieve our meat coma nirvana.  I highly recommend this cute neighborhood restaurant!","We've been here twice. It's not a high end steakhouse (nor does it try to be),and I think it's very good for the price point. We've really liked the provolone/tomato appetizer. The menu is pretty large although the past two times I've gotten the grilled chicken and my husband ordered steak.It does get quite busy and almost has a diner-like feel on weekend nights. The second time we ate here, we went earlier in the evening and it was a much calmer experience than the first time we went here.","Quite a nice surprise. Found this Argentinian steakhouse in Brooklyn. We ordered the prime rib and shared, it was cooked as requested, savory and very tasty. To my surprise they have Tinto de Verano in their menu which for a hot day like today was perfect to drink. Service is excellent, presentation of dishes/plates was very nice, well performed. Their fried potatoes are obviously cut and fried at the restaurant. Their wine list is also very good and goes along well with their menu. They have quite a few wines from Argentina that are stars! I highly recommend it! .",Libertador Steakhouse - Brooklyn
426,"5/5 for the vibes - bright and cute decor (think white benches and green plants everywhere) and lots of tables and booths, so good for dates or small groups. 4/5 for the food - the veggie spring rolls are KILLER (must get), but the pomelo shrimp salad was disappointing (tiny shrimps and tiny portion). Don't expect an authentic beef pho when ordering - the soup itself is very tasty, but just not the pho flavor you'd expect. A good bowl of noodles but I'm not sure it's worth the $15. Would probably try something else on the menu if I came back","Too much hype but decent for what it is (a beautifully-dressed corp de ballet). I tried the grilled fish which was delicious but the sauce was very salty (probably cause of the fish sc). The rice that came with this dish was just overlooked and sad...over cooked and no flavor whatsoever. This would normally be a minor issue but it's a hideous crime coming from an Asian restaurant (yes, I'm exaggerating but don't you agree?) Also tried the pho and I considered it average...","First time here and not sure if it's worth coming back. Wait was long but food wasn't as good as we expected. We've been to Vietnam and Hanoi, and it did not meet our expectations. We had the Vietnamese pizza and please don't get that. It's nothing special and does not taste good at all. For soup, we got the beef pho hanoi and bun bo hue. The portions are really small for what you're paying for and flavors are just not there. Madame Vo is still my favorite.",The place it's self is a delight.   Straight up cute and fresh approach an interior.  The staff are absolutely the most welcoming i have met in a long time. The food - well if you are looking for traditional Vietnamese then no you are in the wrong place and should probably run.    That being said the menu is kind of cool and innovative with some old favorites mixed with new. Everyone raves on about the pizza but I wasn't digging it.  The scotch egg was again different but so small it barely touched the sides. Last but not least the pho was ok but seemed to lack depth in the broth.  I like the place and will give in another go but I'm not sure it's hitting the spot.  Def a 3.5 *,"Had dinner here last week - 4 of us.It was one of the best dining experiences I have had in NYC over the past 30 years. We have eaten Vietnamese food many times, but this was in a league of its own. Everything we ordered was exquisite! From the appetisers (shrimp rolls, Vietnamese pizza, and pig tails), to the entrees that we shared ( crispy fried rice noodles, dry BoBo chicken, rice paper salad and done phos).I have no hesitation recommending DiAnDi. One of the best modern Vietnamese  restaurants in town!","Rich broth of the Hanoi Style Beef Pho!***Locals  Many locals flock to this pho place. Many from Manhattan come here too! Right in Greenpoint, surrounded by many cute and dainty restaurants, bars and shops.***Travelers It's a little out of reach but very accessible by train from Manhattan. You get a nice waterfront and neighborhood here!***My Recommendation Get the Pho Thin Ha Noi. It is delicious. I gave it 4 stars because their pho could be inconsistent as the other beef pho wasn't that great. DEFINITELY get the Vietnamese pizza!IG: @foodisseur",Di An Di
427,"THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON TAKE OUT/DELIVERY ONLY on JULY 19, 2019I ordered the Chelsea platter and flan for $25. $27 total plus $2 tip. Since they didn't deliver before 1pm I preordered. It was suppose to deliver between 1-1:10PM. Once 1:20pm came I called the restaurant asking for an update and the guy on the line said his delivery person was out and will arrive soon as he had 4 other orders with him. Fine. 1:45pm still no food and now im pissed because I am at work and it isn't like I can take lunch anytime I want. So I call again and tell the same guy I still didn't receive any food and it is close to an hour of me waiting. He then saids oh thats weird because my delivery guy isn't back *no sh*t!!! So he than tells me he will call me back after he calls his delivery guy. 5 mins later the food comes. When I get my food he doesn't even acknowledge hes almost a whole hour late!!!! I gave him a $2 tip and really this situation deserved NO tip, but I hate not tipping so he got the measly $2. Food was cold and dry. They didn't even give me salsa on the side. How do you eat mexican food with no salsa/sauce?! Food was decent but definitely not good compared to if you were to eat it fresh in the restaurant obviously. The shrimp was mushy on the inside (overcooked & waited 2 hours to be eaten). Flan was gross dont even buy!!!! Not very happy with my experience for delivery and I am sure if I ate in the restaurant it would be different but that just pissed me off. I shouldn't pay $25 for a 1 hour late delivery and cold food. See pics below",The margaritas are good but the food is DRY. We were not served for 20 minutes but new residents to the neighborhood (you know what that's code for) that came in after us were served immediately.,"Been here before, love the food but hate when it's busy. Didn't like being seated after 3 groups and 1 individual that came after me and my lady very annoying. Cooks didn't listen this time when I said ""no cheese"", because last time they did. It must be a new cook (who knows). Anyway the waiter apologized for the wait and we enjoyed our dinner. I like eating there and will eat there again just don't know when because we're becoming busy and trying not to eat out too much. Well enjoy the food and the neighborhood.","I was shocked to see that Taqueria wasn't reviewed higher! I've been going there since they opened their doors (like the actual day) and it is my most favorite spot in the neighborhood. I've spent birthdays here, and I've also come here after a long day when I just needed some community and a burrito. Brenda (one of the owners) is the sweetest woman around. They truly care about their customers and the food is amazing. I grew up in California so I know good Mexican food. My favorite is the veggie fajitas (I'm vegetarian.) My husband who eats meat loves the Super Vato Loco burrito. All good though!",Hello Summer! Brooklyn welcomes you! Nothing says summer vibes then a taco and margarita lol. I had this place on my radar for a bit so when the girls and I were looking for a Sunday afternoon spot. I suggested this place. Glad i did. The food was great. The drinks were great. Our server seemed a bit off but others picked up his slack. All in all great experience. Food- i ordered  the steak quesadilla and a shrimp taco. Both were good. They gave us warm chips and salsa to start and it was yummy. Drinks- passion fruit margarita was good. Not too strong but not weak. Tip- parking sucks around here on a Sunday afternoon.,I wanted to create a Mexican dinner night for my love and I. I made turkey chili myself and corn bread. The other food I ordered from two local Mexican restaurants and I loved the food from both.,Taqueria El Patron Mexican Grill
428,Food was exceptional and the trimmings were fire. This place drops all their money on getting fire meat and ingredients not on super expensive knives and plates that run a business into the red. Filet minon was called in by phone and was ready to be served 5 mins after I walked in. The spinach sautéed was just buttery enough and a super nice complement along with the creamy mashed potato.,"Visited here once for my girlfriends bday. We both ordered the filet mignon. I told the waitress well done and she reacted as if I just offended here. She was very rude and insisted I get it medium rare. I had to tell her three times that I was sure about having it well done. She expressed her opinion about three times while we were there. Mind you, I spent $200 on this dinner but I had to have it the waitresses way? GtfohThe steak was okay, still I prefer peter Luger or destafanos steak.I will never come here again.","The food and atmosphere in this place is amazing, I used to say that this is my favorite restaurant. However, I became very upset as I ordered a take out and they decided to add a tip for themselves. I don'y usually leave a tip for take outs, but when I checked my card transactions I saw an extra charge that I did not agree on. Also, take outs from this place don't taste as good as the food while dining in.","Work Mom Janet comes to Amber Steak House for basically every important family function - birthdays, anniversaries, and reunions.Due to the nature of the place, she insisted we come here for a late birthday lunch for my fellow coworker and I that actually share the same birthday.  Steak for birthday lunch?! Yes PLEASE!Their menu is limited, but everything is ""fantastic"" as this is Janet's favorite adjective for this place.  I wanted to have something reasonable for lunch, and if I was gonna be bad, I was gonna include fries.  I opted for the steak sandwich with a side of fries and their famous steak sauce.  Insert the word ""fantastic"" here.French fries are usually more ""ehh"" then ""YUM"" with me, but these fries, you will NOT want to share!  They were perfectly fried and not greasy in the slightest.  The steak was on the softest hero bread, with moistness and tenderness of meaty joy.  A MUST HAVE.  When you first get the portion, my fat cells were like, ""You're gonna still be hungry, Jac; don't kid yourself"", but I couldn't of been more wrong.  This is the BEST portion to have for lunch, and in order to fully enjoy this to maximum capacity, getting any more than this would be an utter sin.I hope it's someone else's birthday really soon so we can celebrate the steak sandwich...err umm, I mean that person....YEAH.....","Since we can't give 1/2 stars, I rated a 4 star, even though I felt more deserving of 3-1/2. The service was excellent. I enjoyed our appetizers more than our meals. The calamari appetizer is a meal into itself. The sauces that accompany it have a kick to it. Very good overall. The foie gras was good. But the accompanied jam fruit was a nice touch. Good combination. The escargot also pretty large serving for an appetizer. If I had known, I'd probably would have just made that my meal. Very flavorful. My son enjoyed his filet mignon. My  husband thought his rib eye was a bit on the salty side. I  had the duck leg. I  enjoyed the baked apple BUT i was not a fan of the pickled beets it was stuffed with. The duck was OK. Our meal was enjoyable overall","Absolutely amazing meal!!I came to treat my boyfriend out and we both enjoyed our filets, his with the shrimp and scampi sauceFood: 5I personally liked the scampi sauce more with the filet, but he liked mine with the peppercorn sauceCreamed spinach: very rich, I expected more creamy but I think it tasted better like this because it was not as heavy and left room for other foods. Even though it was a side, it was a good portion to share. (We took the rest home and used it as dip for our chips!) it was not too salty, which is a problem I find in most steakhouses and their sides or steaksOur meat was cooked perfectly and was reeeaaaalllllyyyy tender!Gnocchi: very soft but also rich, delightfully filling and a good portion to share for 2Foie gras: must get!Service: 4.5Impeccable service! Professional and informative. Quick and friendly, although when I answered still water to ""still or sparkling"" they took it as some type of bottled water I've never had before and it tasted a bit weird personally??Ambiance: 5Quiet, plenty of space between tables so that you could have private conversations, as well as a full bar for any alcoholic needs haha Gorgeous interior.I hope to be back to try the other types of steak!",Amber Steak House
429,Reservation for 7.  sat at 207. Fine. Not given menus for 10 minutes. Ordered 90 mimosa and our meals at 220. But First round of drinks not served until 247!2 of my friends had to actually go to the bar and bring us our drinks. The worst service experience of my life. Then for our second drink we had take a carafe ourselves. Ceiling falling apart and no one being served The spot gets 2 stars only because the food was amazing.....once it showed up.otherwise it would be 0 stars. The service sucked because the establishment didn't have enough staff... but the issue was the lack of sympathy and being apologetic. They might have been short and lost a few ppl on the day but at least be apologetic. The hostess sucked.  The server sucked. My friends deserved more tip actually. Bar rescue needs to come to Brooklyn and save them....honestly.,"Came here for happy hour drinks with my sister.  I had the Rhum Sangria and she had an Angry Orchard. I enjoyed my drink because it was strong and flavorful. There was fresh strawberries and blueberries that added a nice touch. After about two drinks I was a little tipsy. We decided to order appetizers in addition to our drinks we ordered the oxtail empanadas, Thai coconut curry mussels, and the jerk wings. I loved the shell of the empanadas; it was flaky but soft when I got to the center with the filling. I did not like the beet sauce that came with it. It did nothing nothing for the dish and my opinion took away from the flavor of the empanadas The mussels were unexpectedly spicy! The curry overpowered the coconut; there was not a good balance of the advertised flavors. The portion is large and was a good item to share.The jerk wings were too fatty for me. This is not my first time visiting this establishment. I wanted to come here to see how things have changed but nothing has changed much since they opened a few years back.","A burnt chicken salad w/ no cheese, too much Caesar dressing, 4 no 6 (my bad) croutons and a mound of lettuce for $18. I left after I took the pic. Plus, the waitress was waitressy.",Yoooooooooo.  Decided to be romantic and take my girlfriend to brunch.  This spot is a gem.  The outdoor seating is really cute.  The food. O my the food I had the oxtail hash.  When it comes to oxtails I hold it to the standard of my Puerto Rican mom's oxtails. They met the standard. Will def be back.,"I had extremely high hopes for BK9 but let me tell you, my friend and I will randomly think of our dinner or hear mediocre jazz anywhere on the street and burst out in laughter, just remembering how rough our experience at BK9 was. We walked into BK9, she had just gotten off work, and we were both extremely hungry. The menu looked promising enough online but the atmosphere was confusing. The vibe is slightly upscale but casual, with a hostess, tablecloths, mood lighting, the whole thing. There were a lot of black folks eating here, which is a great sign. They had both hard copy menus and an ipad, which was interesting but slightly unnecessary.The one thing that will forever confuse me - they had a white jazz band playing. And it's not like they were incredible or even good, which would make it somewhat understandable. They were actually not good at all. Below average and loud. So loud that my friend and I had stopped talking to each other completely and resorted to looking up to occasionally frown or laugh. The jazz singer was screaming at points and it would have been comedy if we weren't paying for the experience. The aesthetic of this place lands solidly as old school Harlem-esque, geared towards 30+ professionals I'm assuming. The food was priced a bit higher than a standard soul food spot in Bed Stuy etc but not as flavorful, which was disappointing. My friend ordered jerk chicken and could barely finish it. I ordered 3 sides and all of them were a bit underwhelming. Our total came to about $70. Something needs to be fixed before I'll recommend this place or consider coming back.","Being Haitian, the haitian dishes on point! Went for a bday brunch and the waitresses was so sweet and always was willing to accommodate our requests. Live music, seating nice, decor lowkey and clean. Banana Rum Waffle brunch amazing! Lemon Drop drink bomb! Mimosas, bomb! Bellinis, Bomb! Like I didnt expect everything to be so good. We brought a bday cake for the party and were charged a $2 fee per person (so werid) Besides that the experience was amazing.  Cannot wait to go again! Conveniently 2 blocks from Altanic Terminal & Barclays so, easy to travel to. Luckily found parking a block away (rare luck lol)",BK9
430,Good beer selection. Good happy hour. Nice staff. But the food is nothing special. The fish and chips is a great portion size but not so amazing I'll go again. And The hot and spicy chicken sandwich is so boring and so messy. You can skip it.,"We live in the neighborhood and are semi-regulars here. A lot of their food is really tasty -- I highly recommend the baked eggs at brunch and the mashed potatoes and mac and cheese on the dinner menu. (The coffee is undrinkable) However, for a restaurant in neighborhood full of families they are pretty unwelcoming to kids. We were there for brunch on a Sunday and it was about 80% families. Our friends were late so we walked our 17 month old quietly around the restaurant to keep him occupied. He literally didn't make a peep and held one of our hands the whole time. Yet we were told we were banned from walking anywhere near the bar where about 2 people were sitting. I can't imagine we were disturbing anyone. The service was also incredibly slow (they didn't refill cups, the food took a long time to come and they generally acted indifferent).",I am visiting from out of town and this place and food was mediocre. When we arrived we stood there waiting to be seated. Then we were told to sit wherever. We probably waited another 10 minutes until we saw our waitress. She was not very engaging. She took our order and never brought me my drink. I had to ask a second time. Then when our food did come she disappeared and never even asked us if everything was okay or if we needed anything else. After we were done eating I had to ask for the check. She brought it but never came back again. I had to go find her to pay. Maybe she just didn't want to be there. I won't go back and I won't recommend this place. I'm sure there is much better somewhere in Park Slope.,"Sometimes you gotta go where everybody knows your naaame.I've got nothing but good things to say about our local watering hole. My friends and I are frequent visitors - be it for a quick drink, a group brunch (seriously incredible prices, large plates, and $5 booze-y beverages), or a surprise party. I'm still bummed they no longer use their outdoor space, but I can't blame them for their whining neighbors.Friendly staff, yummy food, solid beer selections, and stiff cocktails (try the Bramble). See you tonight, Prospect!","How do I say random last minute stop because nothing else was open lol well atleast this I what i thought. It's July 4th and my wife and I are trying to celebrate our 4th annual wedding anniversary here in Brooklyn. We had a day filled with family fun we even watched a amazing fireworks show from the rooftop of our hotel. Now that the kids are sleeping and we want some drinks we set out with our cousin Gregg who is born and raised in Park Slope BK on foot to find a bar with some food and drinks! After a few stops we find ourselves here at Prospect bar and grill!! Nice mellow joint with some classic hip hop music playing  Mos Def, Wu Tang , Outkast just to name a few.Nice place and it wasn't too packed just a right amount of folks to keep the vibe right.We order a few drinks and order some food. Gregg had some bbq wings Gianna had mac and cheese Vikki had half chicken with broccoli  and i ordered some garlic shrimp which was banging!!!!!! The food came out in a timely manner and all was good no complaints at all. I will definitely swing back through here next time I'm in BK","Popped in unexpectedly when I had time to kill and got some hunger pangs. Pleasantly suprised. The Bartender was busy but great. She really walks the line of hustling but still catering to customers needs. She pours a great Guinness too, which is way harder than it sounds! I had the burger on the brunch menu w/ sautéed mushrooms and onions...it was spectacular and flavorful. I just wish it came with fries instead of ""home fries"" , which were really just roasted & over seasoned potato wedges. Overall, I will be back and highly recommend this for a drink and upscale bar food.",Prospect Bar & Grill
431,Rude cashier.Food was okay.Place was crowded and I almost tripped.They gave me broken cookies and threw my sandwich on the table like they don't give a damn.Sad.,I ordered a P15 panini and at first it was amazing. As i got to the other half however I've realize theres a fishy taste. I decided to open up the panini and realize there is bits of raw fish. I am in my second trimester of pregnancy. This is not ok. I'm not sure if the baby will be affected it. I've ordered from here plenty of times and it never disappointed me until today.,"So I once visited this lovely location many moons ago, and longed for another day to have their splendid paninis, and my only complaint is that I was foolish enough to forget the name of such a dining spot. This food is to die for, and the quality of every ingredient was incredible, from portion sizes to even the customer service experience. Thank you guys so much, you rock, and as i told Christina, my fat self will have no shame treating myself to more paninis in the future. You're amazing!","One of my boyfriend's friend recommended this place & honestly, this is one of our new favorite places! Our first time there, he got a panini (P20) and I tried one of their crepes; it had prosciutto, mozzarella, arugula & balsamic glaze! Both came with a side of salad and our entire meal was flavorful, had plenty of filling and we did not feel bogged down after eating our meal. I also got mango/pineapple/banana while he got the acai antioxidant smoothie. Both were refreshing and perfectly sweet!We recently ordered delivery and it was just as wonderful! If you order from their website, they give you a discount off your first order! The delivery was prompt; less than 30 min and the food was still fresh and ready to eat. Both of our paninis still had that crunch on the outside and the flavor on the inside. I really recommend trying this place if you're ever in the area! It's simple, fresh and delicious!","I discovered this place in 2013 and I'm so glad I did! I always get p18 which is one of their most popular items, but I can never finish a whole panini and it doesn't taste good when I reheat it the next day! They have an alfresco area during the warmer days. So I actually filmed a little short for a school assignment in their outdoor seating area once, and they were so nice about it and accommodating! I'm really dying to try their crepes though.","Yum! Cute eatery with outdoor seating, tasty savory and sweet crepes among several other options. The wait staff is very pleasant and prompt. There are alcoholic, nonalcoholic, coffee and tea and several juice options. I'm definitely planning on returning to try some of the pastries and sweets. Totally recommend the crepes!",Panino Rustico
432,"Food is greasy, unhealthy, not fit for consumption by heart patients..... meaning it's stupid good. Tater tots, biscuits, and Mac... go for it!!!",First time at heavy woods with my roommate who's been here a few times before. Kaya was our server and it was her first day but she's so nice and dealt with our annoying questions.,Awful service!  Just to bring out two simpleMimosas it took sooooooo darn long.   The food was also not great.  Will never revisit this place.,"The food is really delicious, and the drink menu is very solid (I've gotten had nights of the beer-and-shot combos, and tried a bunch of their cocktails. Both are great.)There's tons of space -- I had a birthday party in the back room once! There's also a patio in the back which is great in the summer.The service is really hit or miss, but if you're patient with occasional slowness and mistakes it's worth it overall.","I tried to enjoy this place but I simply couldn't. I was meeting up with a friend and we decided to try Heavy Woods. We were both looking forward to some hearty, flavorful food and good atmosphere. Heavy Woods could have been the place that embraced community via decor and energy but it feels cold and a bit sterile inside, despite the very intentionally kitschy and ""modern resto inspired"" interior. You should know what I'm talking about, every other restaurant in Bushwick looks similar to Heavy Woods. Unbelievably boring. We sat, my friend ordered a drink and examined the menu, with reservation, while I drank water and tried to figure out what's up with this place. Well, first things - we sat for about an hour talking to see what the dinner crowd would be like. There were no black folks working here when we visited and no black or brown folks walked in. At this point, I'm concerned about the quality of the food and how authentic or seasoned it's going to be. The service was average, not bad but definitely not inviting enough for us to try and stay. We tried small appetizers but then went 2 mins down the street to a Mexican restaurant which was 10x better than expected (look this one up in the area, incredible!)","Heavy Woods has a packed menu of flavorful, hearty foods. Even the fries got me full. Overall the atmosphere is awesome. Music isn't too loud and they have arcade games and a pool table. There is an outside area but each time I've come it's been raining, so I haven't experienced it.A nice spot for brunch or a quick drink with friends!",Heavy Woods
433,Terrible racist service. Walked into this restaurant with the intention of only ordering an appetizer and a mango lassi. Was stared to by both rude waiter and manager. Was asked by both of them why I wasn't ordering an entree after I ordered two appetizers and the mango lassi. Pure idiots have no intention nor knowledge of how a business is run. Never again!!!,"UPDATE: I contacted Yelp/Grubhub to see what could be done about the bad experience since I ordered food, waited an hour and was delivered some thing other than an edible meal. (I figured the least the restaurant could do was to refund me and I'd just order food from a different place.)Yelp customer service took my complaint and called Bombay Grill to relay my feedback and ask for a refund. The restaurant then informed them that they'd only give me 20% off the total I had paid. Are you kidding me?! That's basically just the tip! Never in my life have I heard of a business that won't refund a paying customer for food they couldn't eat. The best practice would be to refund me the entire amount. You should at the very least have refunded the price of the entree and allowed the delivery person and person who packaged the to-go order to keep the tip. I am disgusted.That's the final straw for you, Bombay Grill. Not only have you failed to feed me, you've failed to make things right. You lose another star for your terrible customer service. Shame on you! It's now been 2 hours and 45 mins since I ordered from you, I'm STILL HUNGRY, and now you've insulted me as a customer. Your garbage food is now going into the garbage chute. (Those of you watching at home can all follow along in my photos!)ORIGINAL TWO STAR REVIEW: I regret to inform everyone that this is the worst chicken tikka masala I've ever had served to me. It's inedible.What follows is a journey through my stream-of-consciousness first-bite impressions of the Tikka Masala at Bombay Grill in Brooklyn:""Ketchup?! Oh NO! Why is this sweet? I specifically requested spicy... Why would it be sweet, regardless? This tastes like something familiar... something from my childhood... ketchup, yes, but more specific... Ugh... Gross...""I figured out what it was that the chicken tikka masala tastes like. It's basically a duplication of the sweet tomato sauce from Chef Boyardee ravioli. Never in my life have I had ""Indian"" food this bad. Utterly inedible- and that's really saying something, hungry as I was when this food arrived at 4:00PM. I had been working all day and had only had coffee and water - no breakfast. I'm not happy. I spent money on delivery- including tip- bc I'm trying to work from home rn and not be interrupted. An hour and $21 later, I'm still hungry and now I'm going to have to waste EVEN MORE of my time to find food I can actually eat. Until I tasted my entree, I was ready to give this place 4 stars just for fast, free delivery,  good chutney, passable samosas (even though putting corn in a samosa is a bit weird) and the fact that they gave me a little cup of rice pudding for dessert. Even though the naan is flavorless, dry and a bit undercooked, I was going to give you the benefit of the doubt and rank you at four stars. But there is no excuse for this pint of ketchup with chicken in it. Caveat emptor.","Came here on a whim because of the good reviews. Not sure how there are many 5 star reviews. The food we had was inedible. It was extremely bland and honestly just nasty. Even the naan was gross. Save yourself the time and money and avoid this place if you are looking for even decent Indian food. Could have just been an off night, but every dish we ordered was inedible.","I was craving really good Indian food one night and came here. I felt bad because I came here with a friend about 30 minutes right before they close. They happily served us and made sure we got our order just fine! They prepared the meals extremely quickly and their service was one of the best I have experienced here in Brooklyn.We ordered the Chicken Vindaloo, Dal Mahkni, Fish Stew Curry. All of them were amazing especially the Dal! It's interesting though because I have not had the same level of thickness and the flavor anywhere else, but I can tell you that it is still one of the best indian food i have had. The Nan was really good and the rice was great. I was really enjoying the food and the servers told us not to rush because they noticed us eating as quickly so that they can close up. But along with the tasty food, they were very thoughtful of their customers.Definitely recommend!","Do not get the biryani! It is not traditional, and more like mushed up rise without all the gorgeous herbs.ni love biryani and this was a huge let down. I don't plan on ordering delivery from here again.I got the eggplant bartha which was delicious.","Wonderful local spot with the best, most attentive service in the area. The prices are right and the portions are good. What else can you ask for? My go-to place in Bed-Stuy area. My chicken Tikka Masala plus Naan was delicious, great mango Lassi.",Bombay Grill
434,"How long should a customer stand at the counter before being acknowledged? I've been to the quaint corner cafe once. My 1st experience wasn't a great but I decided to give it another try.I came in, waited at the counter to order for 5 mins to no avail. No one said one word to me. No Good morning, someone will be right with you - nothing.Please, I can not stress this enough, PLEASE give your employees a lesson on customer service.","Average and decent for a quick pick of basic coffee. Wraps, avocado toast, muffins, not much else. It is all decent if you need a quick bite or sip but NOT a destination. Friendly, efficient service.","I past this cafe everyday on my way to work, but i'm always in a rush and never have enough time to visit. I ordered the bacon, egg and cheese for about $7.00, and a hot chocolate.Let's just say it was nothing to brag about !","Macdonough Cafe is an unassuming coffee shop in Ocean Hill. It has cafe roots because they have food and sandwiches, as well as coffee. I will say the portion for the cold brew is generous. They give a very good helping of the stuff, and because it's cold brew the caffeine content is a little bit more than a normal cup of hot coffee. Well done! This is a wonderful coffee shop. Internet works great. The shop is well-lit with lots and lots of natural lighting. Because of the orientation of the cafe, the sun isn't too intense. Staff is excellent and good-humored. These guys are hipsters, and they are laid back, just enthusiastic about doing the work without being too excited. It's a great staff. I think it's normal that the cafe isn't open at all hours, but people should know ahead of time this cafe isn't really open past 5pm during the week or weekends. 5 stars.",This cafe is perfect for a quiet breakfast while reading a good book. I always saw this place on my way to work and never had the chance to stop by. It was much roomier inside and quieter than expected. I had their apple muffin which was delicious. I will try to stay longer next time and invite a friend for a latte.,"The staff was very kind and patient, and my tea and muffin were really tasty. Will definitely be going back ^_^",Macdonough Café
435,"Made an online order for doubles a couple of months ago. Went to order again but a large amount this time because they were delicious and I was having a party. Unfortunately, they were closed to online orders. I sent my husband (who has never had nor seen a double) to the store to give me the exact order I had before. I added salmon and mango chutney. He gets to the store and asks for a double with salmon. Before he could finish, the rude cashier barks at him ""wE dOnT HaVe tHaT!"" He said okay sorry I've never been here before, what do you have? Again with an attitude she shrugs her shoulders, rolls her eyes and says ""I dOnT kNoW... rEgUlAr DoUbLeS""He walks out. What kind of customer service is this?! You better get these cashiers in check because you just lost lots of business because of her mouth and disgusting attitude. Smh sad.",Simply the most bang for your buck if you are searching for a quick bite of softened fried naan topped with chickpeas in a sweet green slurry with cumin and all sorts of earthy spices. I opted for a double with everything (meaning sauces and minced veggie topping) and it was fiery as hell. I dig it. And a saheen is a fried yellow much doughier than a double also topped with the chickpea slurry. If I had to be vegetarian I won't be too mad about this.,We ordered the beef and potatoes roti. I thought it was ok. The dough was soft and flaky.The interior of the dish is similar to a beef stew. I found the beef to be slightly tough. The ingredients could have been more adequately chopped and more attention could have been kept to the consistency of the sauce inside. The texture was slightly gritty.The dish relied heavily on spiciness and didn't exhibit particularly unique flavors or composition.,Yesssssssssss Word to ya mufffffhaWhat dis ting here talkin.....It too much.... I don pleasure up myselfFood is good good!!!!,Yesssssssssss Word to ya mufffffhaWhat dis ting here talkin.....It too much.... I don pleasure up myselfFood is good good!!!!,"OMG.  I'm rendered speechless.  I have eaten doubles in Ozone Park, Jamaica, and South Richmond Hill, and there is nothing like Brooklyn doubles, yo.  The doubles are sooo yummy.  The flatbread is perfectly soft and melts in your mouth.  You can taste the flavors of the mango chutney and tamarind sauce...tart and sweet, and it is just what Trinidad is all about.  It feels like home.  I love it.  I'm definitely coming back.  Sooo delicious were those doubles. I'm still dreaming of my heavenly meal. I can't stop thinking about them.  I had a craving for a month and my itch was totally scratched.    It's done so right here.  I'm not going anywhere else after this visit.  It would be a crime.   That was dinner by the way.  The staff seems more friendly that other places that sell doubles in my humble opinion, and I was super happy to try it here.  I have been waiting to come here my whole life.  I have to say the minute I arrived it was all about the customer...my experience was speedy and the ingredients were bounds of freshness.    I'm actually sad that I only ordered 3 doubles.  I should have purchased like 30 orders.  Okay who wants to go with me next time I'm going to Bed Stuy?  Any takers?  Hello?",A&A Bake and Double and Roti Shop
436,"Revisited again and was super disappointed with the quality of the food. I ordered the mallawash scramble and it was soo oily that I didn't even want to eat it..I literally just asked for it to be packed..on the other hand my partner ordered the chicken and waffles and I can't even believe they even call it ""chicken"" because there was barely any chicken..just fried dough and a hint of chicken lol...really sad that the quality dropped :/","Great food - when you actually get what you asked for, which is rare.  Of the last five times or so we've gotten takeout, we either got a completely different sandwich than we ordered or it was just missing key ingredients. Horribly inconsistent.  This is how you lose customers.",Ordered an hour ago and every 10 minutes our estimated time gets bumped another 10 minutes. We we're going to order Hunger Pang but didn't want to wait an hour. Batata had an estimate of 33 minutes. Now based on our estimate we're looking at a hour and 30 minutes. This really isn't good business practice. Tripling a wait time for delivery makes no sense.,"I've avoided writing a review for these folks out of sheer selfishness, I didn't want it to get busy and destroyed, as if I'm some kind of Anthony Bourdain. So, as I'm eating breakfast here I decided they need to be told how great they are.I came for the kombucha, I stayed for the food. Everything here is always fresh, the menu items are simple and because they're fresh, everything is always delicious. You can get a very healthy meal here that will taste amazing, you can eat delicious Keto based food, or you can load up on carbs. The place is versatile and the menu is great.It's also clean, local, responsible, extremely new age brooklyn(my opinion, I've been in this neighborhood since 1991)Enjoy, their first breakfast menu item is an easy go-to. I can have it every single morning for the rest of my life without complaining..",My partner and I occasionally make a trip to prospect park and stop by here to grab something to eat ! We love getting the egg Malawich sandwiches as well as the hummus eggplant toast.,"Loved everything about this restaurant. The food is legit and I am always so pleased to find a good sabich sandwich. The schnitzel is also delicious. The restaurant is super casual and kid friendly with board games and self seating, something I truly appreciate these days as I drag my offspring around town. Hope more such establishments pop up in the area.",Batata
437,"A 3 is average right?  It wasn't great, it wasn't terrible, it was fine.  That is how I would describe my meal at Chez Moi.I ordered the steak and frites and my partner order the skate.  What made each dish fine and not delicious?  Everything was one noted, I guess you could say.  The one note was salt and luckily it wasn't over salted but a second note of herbs or fat or something to make it more than a boring piece of steak would have really made this a 4+ star dining experience.  My partners dish was more or less a piece of fish and potatoes.  There was no magic on the plate.  No wonderful layers of acid and fat and fun dancing together, just fish and mashed potatoes.I think simple dishes run the risk of being uncared for because they don't take much concentration to prepare, unfortunately,  doing that, you end up with boring, uninspired food.","Reservations for four people were made for 9 o'clock.  After 40 minutes of waiting for service and repeatedly asking the hostess for a waiter, we got up and left.  As we exited, the hostess and all the ""staff"" just shook their heads with a mumbled ""sorry.""  Never ever had we had such a shameful experience in a New York restaurant.  I sincerely hope the owner of the establishment is reading this review.","Service is non existent. Hosts seem indifferent and their job stops at getting you seated. Clear that no manager or owner is present and it's sad that staff absolutely does not care whether or not you get serviced.  Service at a restaurant can make or break your dining experience and unfortunately this restaurant disappoints.  How difficult can it be to get a waiter take your order on a busy Saturday night? Sad to say we never got to find out. After over 30mins of waiting and asking several staff members for a waiter, I along with the group I was with had no choice but to leave the establishment with a few ""sorry's"" from the host being thrown our way. Shame as this place looked promising upon initial entry.","Our favorite spot when we're in Brooklyn. Great salad and risotto. Friendly staff, nice ambience. Definitely recommend.","I'm on the fence about this place between 3 and 4 stars.We shared a brunch at the bar with the chicken sandwich and fries.The fries were some of the cleanest and best I've ever had.  So good in fact, I had almost finished them by the time the ketchup arrived that I asked for 10 minutes ago. I like it when the order comes, already cut and split on separate plates when you tell them you're sharing.   The chicken sandwich was pretty darn good too, but the portion was just ok. (even if whole)I love the ambiance but wife isn't a fan of French wooden bar stools.  I say they cradle my butt nicely.  To each his/her own.It's those drink prices that kick the bill into high gear.  If you're having 2 drinks each, and sharing, you're still looking at $80+ tip.  In the world of sustainability, I don't find that sustainable.  If you're rolling in it...or bypass the booze, I'd recommend it in a minute.   Otherwise, keep strolling Atlantic avenue.","A lovely Bistro in the heart of Brooklyn heights with delish food and good Service. We shared several appetizers which were all yummy my favorite was Smoked Salmon with Creme Fraîche, Capers. The smoke salmon as this gal from Brooklyn would call lox was excellent cultivated perfectly with a nice soft oily texture. The oysters where my second favorite starter very creamy just awesome. My main dish Skate fish over purée lima Beans, with veggies. The fish tender flaky and the veggies medley was flavored perfectly.

438,"This Japan Village located in Industry City is like a mini Mitsuwa or a Sunrise market. There's a mini food court with Raman, Onigiri, Soba and other Japanese style food.The supermarket has good amount of Japanese varieties. Some items you would probably find cheaper in other Chinese/Asian Supermarket. Some times you would probably only find here, in other Authentic Japanese market or in Japan.For those meat lovers out there is also Wagyu Ribeye and Wagyu  NY strip sirloin for $130/lb. It's newly open market so there was so missing price tags on half of the items. Overall no parking but it's nearby Costco and Micro Center/ Sak Fifth Ave Off/ Bed Bath and Beyond Mall.","Been waiting a long time for this place to open...but I was somewhat disappointed. I guess I shouldn't have expected much on their first day of opening. The place is small compared to mitsuwa but then again this is located in prime real estate. A lot of the things at sunrise mart were sold out but it has a nice selection. Goods are a bit overpriced compared to Mitsuwa but it's convenient to get to and if you account for saving from tolls and gas. Food court has a nice selection with ramen, udon, takoyaki, onigri, matcha, okonomiyaki, bakery goods, etc. Sadly around 3 pm almost everything was sold out or they were backorder so much that they didn't take any orders. Mom and I waited about 30 minutes to order and another 30 minutes to get the ramen. The tonkutsu dx ramen broth was too oily and thick, the noodles and cha siu were delicious. We wanted to try something different and ordered the mt fuji which didn't come out as appetizing as their picture. The combination was weird like having a light tomato foam and parmesan cheese mixed with noodles which killed the broth. I would skip the ramen next time because it wasn't that great for the  flavor, price and value but I would come again to try the udon and okonomiyaki.","This is much smaller compared to Mitsuwa. If you are in the area then yes make a trip but if not I don't think it's worth it. They have a few food shops but they are always packed or food are sold out. I had the beef udon and my friend got the ebi tempura udon. The portion was really small. Not really worth it. The market is also very small. It's hard to check out what they have since it's so crowded. They do however have high grade quality meats. Both times I've been there, I got mostly junk food.","It is hard to grade Japan Village as a whole because it is a food court with a grocery store in it, and what appear to be separate businesses hawking different street foods, desserts, and more formal meals.  It love the grocery store. They sell a variety of produce, fresh seafood and meats, and authentic imports. I love the smaller packaging of the fresh items, because I seriously don't need a basketball sized cabbage, or a dozen carrots or a giant mass of economically-priced, poorly-cleaned shrimp. They solve these problems with small, fresh portions to customize what you need. Of the separate food stands, I love the sushi counter. The sushi is usually amazing, and the new Korean bentos give me the variety I need.  All the other food stands seem abandoned...either because the entrees are prohibitively expensive, or because they're all selling ramen for some reason.  I'd love more diverse coming options but I need gluten free food (soy sauce is allowed though not in everyone's case, just mine.)  So I will stick to the sushi counter.  Pricing average for Industry City but restrictive for a regular Sunset Park budget, so hopefully they will get combos or punch cards or a bigger set of cheaper rolls at a deal price compared to a la carte.  I would order more, more often if I could afford it!Gwen, the proprietor of the sushi counter, is a kind and friendly host. Thanks Gwen!","I wish there were more deals and more bargain sushi as the prices are limiting for me. Excellent meat and vegetables, frozen food, pantry items,toiletries, sweets and beverages - all Japanese. I can't eat any of their noodle dishes at the hot food counters since almost everything is wheat-based, so i stick to the sushi.","The first time I came here was on a weekend during lunchtime.. and it was a terrible idea. There was a lot of people and strollers everywhere. The seating area was really tight and cramp, not only was the walkway very small but also there's not much seating. My husband and I decided to get riceball and seafood okonomiyaki. The riceball was okay, nothing extraordinary but can definitely find cheaper elsewhere. The seafood okonomiyaki was okay too but we waited 40 minutes for it so wasn't really worth that wait. We went to sunrise mart that opened up, again super crowded with long lines so we passed.We came back on a weekday instead, definitely much better! No wait for food and there was seating. We had lunch at the ramen place. My husband tried the Mount Fuji and I got the classic tonkotsu deluxe, with deluxe you get an egg. The ramen wasn't bad but the portion was pretty small. Usually when I go out to eat ramen, I can't finish my food but I finished my bowl so quickly. It wasn't bad but I definitely had ramen with bigger portion for same price range.",Japan Village
439,"Don't understand the hype. My meal was just average. I had corn soup and lemon pasta. Lemon pasta was good - not great. And the corn soup tasted like corn water, which was not the best. Overall, I'd give it another chance but I certainly was notBlown away.",Just left here - I had an 8:00 reservation and wasn't seated til 8:50. Once seated it took another 20 minutes for a waiter to come over. The service was terrible. Food was average. No one gave a -ish. No one said anything about the wait. Will never go back.,"We ordered a chicken dish and a fish special + a beet salad. The staff was nice with a nice atmosphere. I just felt, what we ordered was kind of boring. The food and flavors were disappointing. Judging by other reviews, we probably ordered wrong. If I try this place again, I will order pasta/something more Italian.","Gathered 15 of my friends here for a garden seated birthday dinner! The staff is very accommodating and reserved the back garden area for our group. a great spot for special events, large and small parties. Highlights were We are family style and tried the black kale salads, tagliatelle bolognese, rigatoni ragu, cacio e Pepe, orecchiette, a squid pasta and mussels. Highlights were the tagliatelle and squid pasta! Cash only is my only gripe, especially for larger groups.","Overall:4.2/5Food: 5/5Service: 3/5We came here around 7:30pm on a Saturday night. Surprisingly we were able to get a table for 2 without any wait. The food was AWESOME. We got mezzi rigatoni ragu dinner, black linguini with calamari, roasted garlic bruschetta, and tiramisu. All of them taste amazing and we really enjoyed it. The only 2 things we wish they can improve is:1. No one told us this was cash only. Usually the waiter will tell us at the beginning but no one informed us. And we didn't notice any sign saying cash only at the entrance.(maybe there's one but it was not obvious)2. The wait time for food and service(especially checkout) was long. We understand that they might be busy during dinner hour. The waiter actually saw us while passing by, but she/he didn't come to our table until around 10 min after.","It was okay. We got a good table. Had to ask two or three times for little things... Light the candle, some pepper for the salad, stuff like that.Panzanella salad we had was mostly kale, very little soaked bread or tomatoes.Tagliatele was good pasta but it was supposed to have asparagus and peas... Almost no asparagus.Waiter was nice. Good wine list. Cash only? I tried checking in on yelp but the free glass house wine is only during happy hour.",Gersi

Lalalala,"This place is cute and has a piano so sometimes you will hear nice piano music BUT THEY DO NOT RECYCLE!!!!!!! It's so annoying that they don't care enough to recycle the hundreds of coffee cups they use a day.  Even if you're having your coffee to stay or just want a cup of water they usually just give you the same disposable cups and then only have a trash bin, no recycling.Especially for a fancy vegan place you would expect them to be more sustainable!! Please get your shit together in this aspect, thank you kindly.Also food is very mediocre, lacking in flavor generic vegan food, u can almost taste the apathy.","This place is amazing! The vibe inside is really great, there are a lot of plants and seating and it's a quiet place to read or get work done inside, contrary to the busy street it's located on. I got the sweet potato bowl and the price was really good especially since it's a large portion that really filled me up. The coffee was also excellent and I highly recommend.","I have been to Chez Alex multiple times over the past 2-3 years and have always left satisfied. The 'crazy eyes' is my favorite vegan sandwich, but I will note that they changed the cheese about a year ago and it is not as good as the original sandwich.The chai tea is a house recipe and tasty af. The lemonade options are great too. I've tried the broccoli quiche (yum) and the chocolate cake, which was also tasty. I will say that within the past year it's become more 'hipster' depending on who is working... meaning playing loud music to the point that you can't focus if you have your laptop. It's a cafe, not a party. The owners are amazing though, they are always nice and it's a joy to see them.",Cute little vegan hole in the wall. I stopped here just to pick up desserts for a house guest and what do you know they had a plentiful supply of vegan options. Very cute place with a steady stream of people from the neighborhood coming in to get a Sunday fix for dessert. Seems like it's a great coffee shop as well. I can't wait to try it out one day when I work from home.,Chez Alex
441,"Five stars for food and atmosphere but 3 or less for service. Sarah? Was our server (at least that's what it said on our receipt). She avoided any eye contact when she passed our table as we wanted to order after having plenty of time to review the menu, which is a thing I struggled to learn as a server (it's intimidating and annoying, i get it) but acknowledgement rules when it comes to table service.She didn't check in unless we flagged her down which i hate doing because it's usually unnecessary if the server is doing their job (again, coming from a fellow service lady).. she didn't say thank you or ANYTHING when she dropped the bill and we all thanked her. Not ""no problem"" , not ""thank you!"" Not a thing .We were struggling to figure out what we did to piss her off, we didn't modify anything, we were gracious and thankful, and emphasized how exciting it was to eat there being from border towns. After that, she totally hated us.Not sure what her deal was or if it was an off day but it was a bummer.","It's unfortunate for such a cute place to have such plain food. The Mezcal pineapple margarita unfortunately is sweet and doesn't taste like it was made with mezcal. Our waitress Jasmine was sweet enough to offer a margarita off the menu with Mezcal and grapefruit. I asked for it to be served up. The first one was delicious. Unfortunately  when I ordered a second one, it was served in a wine glass. (I'm sorry but for $16 I don't want a drink in a wrong glass because you run out of glasses). I sent it back. My fish tacos  were drenched in oil, quite awful actually. I think those had to be the worst tacos ever. My husband had a skirt steak which was just okay. Overall ambience is great. Unfortunately upon getting the bill we noticed the $10 per person charge for the live singer... Common Guadalupe Inn, I would love to tip the singer, but a forced charge on our bill without knowledge? ( I was told by the waitress there is a sign as you walk into the place... Well that makes it better...)",If you have Celiac disease or other dietary restrictions this place is amazing. My waitress Jasmine took all of my needs very seriously and had a conversation with the chef right in front of me. Unfortunately there is very little to eat that is AIP friendly - all the meat is marinated in gf soy or nightshades. But I found one salad on the menu I could eat and made it work.,"The hostess/manger women was exceptional! Especially as we ended up being nightmare customers. Was excited to finally go here and actually got my stuff together to make a reservation ahead of time. showed up and was ""reminded"" of the cover fee for eating in the main dining room. Opentable when received through google attached to a google calendar does not show this fee. I was caught off guard and am on a budget, she was understanding and seated us in the main room right next to the stage. Unfortunately it was incredibly loud for my tinnitus ears. Had to the go back and ask for a different table. They were accommodating and luckily had a high top table that was perfect. Food was really good- the cauliflower and asparagus were excellent, surprisingly great in a way you don't expect cauliflower and asparagus to be¿¡ Service was also great, didn't wait or want for anything.Will def not be going back. Thanks for a great night!","Came here on a Sunday night with a few friends for dinner and we loved it! This place is really cool, I believe every night they have some kind of live music or performance here, expect Sunday's. It was a bit empty when we went, but It was a Sunday night. The service was amazing, they answered our questions and were attentive. We started with the guacamole and chips. The chips were warm when they came out, which was a nice touch.My friends got the chicken and carnita tacos and I ended up with the enchilada with steak. Everything was fresh and delicious! The enchilada had a nice kick. My friends said the tacos were good and nicely seasoned.For dessert. We ended up getting the churros and flan. They were both delicious, not too sweet and they were just really good.All in all I would love to come back here with my friends again for a night with the live performances.",Holy moly! I was going to a concert at the Brooklyn Mirage and needed to eat. I ordered the carnitas tacos and guacamole to share. Both items were fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised. My friends ordered the chicken enmolada. I've never tried mole but after my first bite I wanted more! I was very impressed by the flavors and quality of the food. I will be running back very soon!,Guadalupe Inn
442,"Very disappointing.Ordered duck confit. There was not much duck.  Maybe few pieces of pulled pieces with burned potatoes and baked egg on top of it and it was overly salted.Also, wanted to order focaccia as a side. Waiter told us it was sold out and instead we got tiny round (maybe 1.5 inch diameter) flat pieces of muffin.  They charged $4.00 for it.  We just asked if that flat muffin was same price as focaccia? And waiter just took it off the bill with apparent upset attitude.  My partner ordered carbonara which was also overly salted.","The food here is delicious and the staff are hard working and very professional. The seating is a real problem - on rough hewn benches that are too high, we were literally bumped and jostled multiple times by diners coming in to the restaurant and waiting to be seated in the small space between the tables and the bar.  The room was also uncomfortably hot - either inadequate AC or AC not working well. At this price point ($31 entree) I'd expect a much more peaceful and comfortable experience.",Love the bar here. Always a great bartender. Rahsaan is charming and personable. But there's this crazy white fake plant they have on the bar that distracted me all night because I couldn't see beyond it. Food is delicious.  Try the pate.,"Finally got a chance to dine here. First attempt was too crowded and didn't want to wait around for an hour. Second attempt I made sure to make a reservation.We were seated in the back adjacent to the door (garden dining outside, )which wasn't the best option. It wasn't exactly 70 degrees out and with the traffic back and forth through the door we were forced to eat with our coats on. Our appetizers were quick and wanted to share with hubby, it was sooo delicious we ordered another. Prawn with toast. My pan seared salmon was good and my hubbies white lasagna he said was different but after he devoured it , he was still hungry Servings are small but I was stuffed I had to pass on desert. Prices are at a higher price point but food was worth it .Decor is warm and cozy . Server was excellent ! It's worth a shot ! I Had a great time !","4.5 stars, but rounding up because we dined here a few days after dining at the ever-hyped Lilia in Williamsburg (which was not so good). And this place restored my faith in great Italian food.There's something to be said about a warm and charming ""neighborhood"" restaurant that consistently overachieves on food. The menu seems to change pretty frequently so maybe I won't focus as much on the food. But picture this... a 10-year old girl in the restaurant gnawing on a pork bone, having devoured the same a few minutes earlier. So precious... and so good. It just warmed my heart.But back to the food, I'd say the chicken liver mousse is as good as it gets, the pasta dishes are above average for NYC (and that's saying something), the fish and pork entrees we had were stellar, and we had an olive oil cake that made my life complete.What can I say... I like this place.","Went for brunch on 8/31. Great atmosphere. We ate on the patio. Very cost place. We had the purgatory eggs with a side of potatoes and fried chicken. The food was very tasty but the portions are tiny. The fried chicken was probably the smallest chicken leg and thigh I've ever seen. It only comes with some coleslaw and was pretty disappointing. The eggs are also small but it's on the ""small section"" of the menu so at least I wasn't expecting a full entree. Overall good place but was pretty disappointed with portions and left still hungry.",Faun
443,If only it was possible to give negative stars I would. My Fiancé and I heard about this place through yelp but it was an utter disappointment. As we entered this establishment we were ignored and 2 asians walked in after us were seated immediately. When my Fiancé approached the seating hostess he was met with aggression and sarcasm. There was a minority family with reservations that informed us that they were sitting there for an hour. We watched as a group of similar sized who were not minorities seated before them. Thankfully one of the members of the family approached the seating hostess and they were able to be seated. When we were finally seated it was in an awkward spot by the bar and walkway where we received no attention. So we left and a couple who was seated after us also left about 5 minutes after us. All this to say if you are a minority this may not be the place for you!,"Even though the food might be excellent at a restaurant, if the service is terrible you might as well eat somewhere else. There are many restaurants in NYC. Samui's service is terrible, I mean TERRIBLE! No hostess, not enough servers. It seems they seat people according to their nationality. They take too long to sit you, and then after waiting more than expected they announce there is no more of what you ordered. It is definitely not worth the trouble.",The ambiance here is beautiful and very trendy. 5 stars because I'm not a fan of Thai food and the location is in a desolate area of Brooklyn especially at night. Everything else I give two thumbs up.,"So this is a quick little review for Samui. I heard about this place like most of the world at this point from the Netflix show Dating Around and they know that lol. In fact, they expect questions on it lol and be happy to tell you all about it. The ambiance is just as nice in person. It's big, it's colorful, light house music in the background all the makings of a cute date night spot. However, this space is described more of a venue space so don't expect large crowds. After a  suggestion from our awesome server Bryan we had the Twilight Martini (i think that's what it was) which had a gin base and PURPLE! It was so pretty and so delicious. We then shared a vegetable spring roll that came with a sweet sauce with a little spicy kick to it. I asked for more to go along with my entree which was the drunken noodles with shrimp and my friend had the pineapple cashew fried rice which they loved. All in all food, drinks and setting were 10s across the board! I will definitely be returning.","This is the hardest review I've ever written. So, SAMUI is my #1 Thai delivery spot on Caviar. Mostly because delivery is free, but also because it's better than the other options. And then I saw it on Dating Around. So, let's go, right? It's a cute spot with great food, what can go wrong?LITERALLY EVERYTHING. I had a reservation, but had to wait 35 minutes to be seated. I'd have left if I'd been in an area with other options, but it's mad desolate out there. We had to ask for silverware. And napkins, which they were out of. OUT OF NAPKINS!!! The waiter immediately spilled dumpling sauce all over our table. And then cleaned it up by placing cocktail napkins over it (okay, so they had some napkins, I guess). The beers were flat and they replaced them with a different beer, but then left the flat beers on the check. Service was nearly impossible to flag down.Oh, and they forgot my entree. IDK, at some point it became hilarious. But, you know, still bad. I'll just stick to ordering in. I've got napkins at home, so it's for the best.","This place is a hidden gem in my eyes! The ambiance,  impeccable customer service,  and delicious food & drinks made this experience very memorable. The owner of the restaurant is very much involved with assuring that everything at EACHT TABLE is running smoothly. Our appetizers included the tapas chips with salsa sauce (disregard the peanut sauce), crispy shrimp spring rolls with sweet chilli sauce upon request, and wings. The pineapple fried rice with chicken and cashews was very filling. And lastly, I had a couple of Passion Fruit sangrias that were pleasant.Looking forward to coming back here for dinner some time soon. In the meantime, I highly recommend it, definitely worth your time and money.",SAMUI
444,"Paid $50 for delivery food which included a delivery fee. Never got it. Restaurant blamed seamless but very young person on other end of phone at Clara's was not nice, helpful or knowledgeable- she told me basically sorry but nothing she could or would do even though I paid them for their food that I never received.",I was in and out for drinks but the spot seemed pretty laid back and chill! Crowd was decent and there was a major UFC fight on all tv's!,Horrible horrible customer service ! I ordered a VEGGIE burger  through Über eats and received a real burger !!!! I took a bite out of real meat. Being a vegetarian that's extremely not ok. I called the establishment and JESS  told me to make sure it's real meat!!!! When I insisted they passed me around from person to person and told me I need to contact Über eats for a refund... THEY HANDED OFF THE WRONG ORDER but I had to do the running around to get another order out or a refund.,"I don't know about the chicken sandwich, as the trend is to serve a fried chicken thigh opposed to chicken breast cutlet (thighs are way cheaper, but the price tag says ""chicken breast cutlet "")... Anyway, Clara's burgers are EVERYTHING, and so are the chicken wings.  I like the sauce options for the wings and the portions are good.  The burgers flavorful and fries are crispy and hot.  I've received food from Clara's via delivery and pickup and have no complaints--- I am always happy with the food.","This place was a recent favorite of mine that I'll unfortunately never be going to again. Why? Well it seems I committed the capital crime of (politely!) asking the mustached and fitted cap wearing bartender if one of my drinks could come with the food. He proceeded to berate me, while making a strange series of disapproving faces, saying ""that's a weird way to order"" in the most condescending tone possible and also added that ""I have a runner and they're separate from this."" Said bartender also proceeded to make ""get a load of this guy"" type motions to his coworker. All, totally unnecessary. It confused both me and the person I was with to the point where it made me think he misheard me and thought I said ""dude can your mom come with the food?"" or something of that ilk. The overreaction was seriously that ridiculous. I work in the service industry and there are a thousand different ways he could have handled this if he simply didn't want to do it and each would have been better than what he actually did. Still, I said something like ""ok man no problem, I'll come back when the food comes"" and proceeded to grab a table.Fast forward a few minutes - food is being delivered to other tables and guess who's the runner? Despite his saying the contrary! Why, yes! Tis' Mustachio the Incredible! Indeed, as it turns out, just like the last time I was there, the bartender WAS the runner. So how strange was my request, really? When he brings my food out, I politely ask ""hey, can I trouble you for that drink one more time?"" I tell him the drink, he asks me to remind him of the name on the tab. I comply, and actually follow him 10 feet to the bar (so he doesn't have to do the extra work of - gasp - walking back to me). He then takes 4-5 new orders from folks and proceeds to pretend to not see me (tall black dude in a mostly white hipster bar - kinda hard to miss - just saying). When he runs out of other people to serve and finally looks at me, I simply motioned ""nevermind man, it's ok, thanks"" because at that moment I decided this bar isn't getting another dollar from me. As mentioned, I work in the service industry, so I know what icing the customer looks like. And while I couldn't quite muster the strength to leave zero tip when closing, I did leave 7%, which is the worst I've ever left and I hope that made the point. Really and truly, average service would've gotten the guy 30% (my usual).I left at halftime and proceeded to enjoy the eats (and service) far better at Darling's. Something I believe I'll be doing a lot more of in the future.","The Nashville chicken sandwich is the kind of sandwich that you might remember for a lifetime. There is a man in the kitchen who has created and continues to execute this devious sandwich that will make you reconsider every other potato bunned meat holding creation before and after.

445,I like Shake Shack. It's just that the service of this restaurant is not so good. They missed the chick & bites in my order Updated cmoments due to improved service.,I like Shake Shack. It's just that the service of this restaurant is not so good. They missed the chick & bites in my order Updated rating due to improved service.,"Not sure why there's so much hype about Shake Shack. Not only is it expensive but there's nothing special about the items. The shroom burger was almost $9 and it was one big mushroom in squashed bread. The fries were okay, nothing special. The milkshakes come in a size small cup and taste like regular Breyers ice cream. I've been to other Shake Shack locations but this one definitely had the rudest cashiers. The line had customers and four of them were just standing around. Unbelievable.","Shake Shack, protruding from the non-existent corner of Fulton and Willoughby like the bow of a proud ship, with her name alight at night so that it reads ""Kesha"", often makes me want to be taken by the cold, dark sea after brushing my teeth with a bottle of Jack.Everything here but the fries is hit or miss, and when one thing hits, something else misses.  If you want to ensure that at least some aspect of your visit is positive, get fries.  The burgers are better at night when the kitchen isn't trying to suck a breath of air between orders, but the daytime staff behave in a more polite and professional manner.  The problem with going during the day is that it's insanely busy, even when quiet, and things aren't prepared with perhaps the ideal amount of care.  Today, for example, the three slices of tomato on my Shack Burger were vertically stacked on top of half a lettuce leaf fragment, as were the pickles I requested, and someone neglected to sauce it.  I also waited quite some time to get it; my girlfriend grabbed a 4 train from City Hall about the same moment I got on line, and joined me at my table as I was chewing the first bite.At night, the food is better and fresher - it would have to be - but the environment changes.  I almost had a fist fight a few days ago with an off-duty employee who cut me in line, where she loudly and repeatedly insisted that she didn't give a f*** about me because she worked there.  She then proceeded to snatch the phone out of my hand when she thought I was taking her picture, as some people on both sides of the counter egged her on.  When one quality goes up, another goes accordingly down in a different category.Regardless, it's Shake Shack, and it's right here in my backyard. That's a benefit not everyone can claim, so I will pay for and enjoy it occasionally on terms as flexible as their service.","I absolutely love shake shack! Whenever I'm visiting I have to make a trip. Everytime I go I always seem to get the best employees helping me. They are friendly and always want to make sure I'm happy. This location is no different. I actually think I got the best customer service from this Shake Shack than any other location. It was my first time trying their custard and shortly after I wanted to slap myself for not trying it sooner! I've been missing out!! The chocolate custard is a definite must.Every time I go, I get the same Burger. I get the Shack Stack and add bacon. Granted after everything my meal comes to about $22... But I ain't complaining cause all I'm thinking about is the goodness I'm inhaling. The line may seem long but don't worry it goes by pretty fast. They have a buzzer system so you can easily know when your food is ready.","This location is super convenient! I was leaving the Board of Elections and it's located a few doors down. There wasn't a line, thankfully, as this place is usually crazy. I ordered a single burger and with a chocolate. This place can be a little pricey, but you're paying for the name. The cashier was extremely gracious and smiled. Wait time was minimal.",Shake Shack
446,The worst restaurant ever. My food has been disgusting and ice cold the three times I have tried to order from this place on Caviar.  Avoid this restaurant at all costs as your food will arrive ice cold and all mixed in together.  Third time I have had to completely trash the food from this place and then place a new order somewhere else. Customer beware. 0 stars.,"Let me tell you what happened yesterday around 5 PM at Sweetwater. I was sitting on the patio and the resturant was almost completely empty. I had two friends with me and my dogs and we were eating and drinking when I became over heated and excused myself to go sit inside in the air conditioning. I sat a table near the bar and started to get worse and the room was spinning and I started sweating profusely. I was fighting to keep my eyes open and stay in a seated position. I waved for my friends when the door was opened to the patio becuase I felt at that point that I couldn't walk but they didn't notice me. The waitstaff of the restaurant were rude and I guess they didn't recognize me from the patio and kept trying to get my order and offer me a menu. How crazy is that?! At one point I politely asked for a cold wet towel one girl made a face and went over to a sink and got a paper towel that she ran under the tap. She brought it over and it was room temperature. I was very quiet and polite through the whole event though the staff acted like I was this huge inconvenience. The bartender acted angry the entire time and when she finally realised I wasn't going to order anything she asked if I was feeling OK. I told her that I thought I might be having a heatstroke and she made a face and walked to the other end of the bar. I guess they thought I was a drunk or something. I was having margaritas (watered down, very weak margaritas) on the patio earlier. But not enough to make me intoxicated and I was eating and drinking a lot of water at the same time. My friends finally saw me and came to help. I haven't felt right since then, even after drinking glass after glass of ice water. So I have just called and told a very young sounding supervisor what happened to me at her restaurant. She reacted in glib manner and seemed not to take me seriously. The entire event was very odd to say the least and I'm still not sure what to think about it. Was the waitstaff just young and inexperienced and unfamiliar with what being overheated looked like? I think its probably more to do with the waitstaff looking at customers as how they make money and not as people. I was very respectful and polite through the whole event and I have been going to Sweetwater for years and always tip well and have been a great customer. But I feel that Sweetwater is just trying to make a buck and if a customer is having trouble then that customer becomes an annoyance. My advice is go spend your money at someplace that looks at its customers as human.","Food is decent enough but the service has been consistently bad every time I come here.  Tonight I was sitting at the bar and I got my burger at the same time as my beer, even though I ordered the beer when I first sat down. How does that even happen when you're sitting at the bar, 5 feet from the taps? I gave it two tries. Done.","Great atmosphere. Great service. I Would totally recommend this cosy little restaurant.

447,"Be warned!  Their burgers are no ordinary burgers. Their fries are unreal.Shake Shack is worthy of repeat visits.  Their shakes come in an array of flavors more commonly seen in ice creams than shakes, not vanilla and chocolate flavors but also more complex varieties.","This is definitely the best Shake Shack I've had out of the several I've tried. They cook their burgers more medium rare than most - so try it if you're into that. Otherwise, the sides, etc, are standard. It does get fairly crowded for lunch, but service is still fast anyway. However, it will be extremely tough to find seating.",I usually love shake shack but I'm very disappointed in the meals I've bought lately. The last 3 times I've been here I've ordered the 10piece chicken bites. I've received only 8 pieces the last 3 times I've ordered the chicken. Not cool. And the restaurant has don'le nothing to compensate my meal.  Not cool.,"Great burger!Great fries.Even better shake!!Very busy when we where there, but still had our food in about 5 minutes.Best chain for burgers in my mind.","Hamburgers are tasty for sure, but they don't toast the buns so it's mushy and soft when you eat it.  That's a deal breaker for me.I recommend this place but I will probably look for other places instead next time.","I've been to many different Shake Shack locations, and this is the most horrible experience ever.  Came here on a Friday evening.  Trash and leftover food, all over the floor, around quite a few tables.  Used trays and leftover fries, and ketchup smears on the table.  Am I at a Mcdonalds?  Should I even be saying that?Even after moving the leftovers out of the way, I was afraid to sit down.  It just felt dirty.  After sitting for a while, a worker did come out eventually to sweep the floor, but didn't do that great a job.  And tables were not wiped down.On to the food.  Shake Shack has always been my favorite burger place.  After this experience, I'm taking that down a few notches.  The burger looked good, but the beef patty came over-cooked, onions were rather big triangular pieces, and I specifically asked for shack sauce on the burger.  In fact I asked the cashier, twice to make sure, but I never got it. Air quality:  It was pretty uncomfortably stuffy in the left side dining area.  The right side is a bit cooler.Bathrooms:  None for public use.     Final note:  This is a busy location so hopefully this is an isolated incident.",Shake Shack
448,"My go to place for comfort food. I get the 1/4 chicken, mashed potatoes and plantains. OMG those mashed potatoes are outta this world, they put KFC mashed potatoes to shame! My boyfriend likes the sausage or the ribs and corn.",The juiciest chicken I've had in Brooklyn! Portion sizes were very big!! Chicken was decently seasoned but how juicy it was made up for it. Tons and tons of sides! Will def be coming back,The chicken tastes good but lately they leave it raw.Today's rice was also hard. They should cook it more.,"I *love* the quarter chicken here!I get the quarter chicken with corn and mashed potatoes. Their mashed potatoes are the BEST. There's usually a line out the door, and they sometimes run out because it's so good!If I could eat here every day, I would. It's so delicious and affordable.","Food: 3/5Decent Peruvian chicken. The chicken is packed with flavor and has the perfect amount of spices. The food is good but not the best I've had. I like how this place offers a lot of sides. Recently I got a quarter chicken with rice and vegetables and I noticed a strong hint of butter on my vegetables. I'm sure other people love it but not for me.Their green sauce is definitely a plus but again, not the best I've had.Service: 4/5Everyone there is friendly. There's an Asian lady there who is very accommodating and gives me extra green sauce.Ambiance: 2/5This place can use some renovation. Good for a quick bite or takeout.",Chicken was nicely seasoned and tender. My veggies weren't too soft. . green sauce was a lil too spicy for my preference but was not overpowering. Green sauce was enjoyable. The guy cutting chicken was a little weird with the staring but the lady that checked us out was very pleasant. So I would recommend.,Inca Chicken
449,"This is the second time at this restaurant and we were shocked at the lack of service. The waitress was never around and appeared almost annoyed with having to serve us. We had to ask other waiters to get more drinks. After we finished our entrees the busboys cleared the table and we sat there for more than 30min waiting to see if the waitress would offer dessert or to check if we wanted anything else. We were there to celebrate our 7yr anniversary and felt so disappointed. After we couldn't wait any longer, my husband just asked for the check and we left. Additionally, the food was not so good as before. We ordered exactly the same items from 1yr ago and it was just blah. Sushi was the only good thing Very different service from the last time we celebrated our anniversary there. Was hoping this would be an annual visit. Id return only for drinks at the bar.","TOURIST TRAP. The bathrooms are absolutely disgusting, the service is slow and dismissive. We got a patio spot with zero view by the entrance. When we told the waiter we're only doing drinks at 3.30pm, we was rude saying there is a long line for tables. I ordered sparkling rose but received a glass of white. Avoid at all cost.",Came here for brunch on a Saturday and best to have a reservation. Even with a reservation if you want to sit outside there will be a wait of anywhere 20 to 45 mins. We set inside since we were seatee right away. The brunch is on the pricier at $29 per person but you get 4 appertizers to share. The ricotta and bean spread is a big portion. The Goat cheese croquet and bacon wrap dates were to die for. Only thing that wasn't so good was the salad which looked a little pitiful in its presentation and the lettuce was wilted. For entrees we had the burger and their speciality crispy duck confit waffles. The burger was especially good. The meat had good flavor. The crispy duck was very good but slightly overcooked and the waffle it came with was perfectly cooked. If visiting for the day at Brooklyn Bridge park this is a nice first stop.,Good things:Nice area. We were seated super fast and service was on point. Not so good things:The food was just OK. Thought it was expensive for the quality/quantity of the food. Small portions even the ones listed as 'large' but it's prime location. Still happy that we tried this place and will probably go back next time we visit NY.,"Probably one of the nicest outdoor patios with an amazing view of the Brooklyn Bridge.Eclectic menu - mostly seafood and sushi, but my friend and I shared the bone marrow appetizer, which was good with the exception that it didn't have a whole lot of bone marrow, but they made up for it by piling it high with beef cheek! Tasty! We also shared the bacon wrapped dates which were good. The duck fried rice was amazing and delicious. Drinks were so-so. I didn't like my strawberry cocktail, it was way too tart, I couldn't drink it. Service was friendly. We moved tables because the first table was wobbly and the waitress in that section was in a bad mood and not welcoming or friendly. Our new waiter at the new table was friendly and nice.","Went here for brunch on a beautiful LDW Sunday. This restaurant is tucked in a quaint area of Brooklyn between the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges, on walkway which brought me back to Europe. Although much of the view is obstructed by trees, the Sugarcane outdoor seating area provides a nice setting for a summer meal.We both had the signature brunch, which comes with a duo of dips (white bean and sweet ricotta), crunchy market salad, crispy artichokes and summer corn. The big winner of the starters was the ricotta dip, which was ever so creamy, yet light with the perfect dose of sweetness.The signature brunch also came with the choice of nine entrees, but I didn't have to look far down the list to find the duck & waffle. Although the duck egg was slightly overcooked and I would have preferred a bit more crisp on the duck leg, the dish had a fantastic balance of flavors and is worthy of a recommendation.My date, on the other hand, ordered the classic double burger. Despite the fact that she enjoyed it, I took a bite and was very disappointed. I know it's not exactly fair to judge a dish based on a single bite, but that bite reminded me of nothing more than a fast food burger. The takeaway here is not to order a burger at brunch.Overall, I was impressed with the value of the $29 signature brunch combined with the beautiful scenery. Although I hesitate to venture into Brooklyn for anything besides Luger's, I had an enjoyable experience at Sugarcane.",Sugarcane Raw Bar Grill
450,"Food was okay service wasn't that great. More attitude than great customer service. My waiter asked me if i wanted anything to drink. I said sure looked at the menu and she sighed. After that she place her hand on her hip and repeated do you want anything while taking the menu from me. I felt rushed. Didn't feel comfortable and when we got our food, she didn't come back until it was time to drop the check off. There are too many sushi places around to be giving bad customer service. I definitely won't be going back. If you do, i say try the Udon noodle and the crab n crab roll.","The staff...amazing.The food...the freshest.The pricing...fair for the quality of the sushi and for the size of the rolls.I've been coming here long enough that this review was long overdue.They always remember me each time, even if it's been a few months in between visits.Thank you!","The chirashi bowl was decent. It was pricey but had a variety of sashimi. They gave a lot of rice so the rice to fish ratio might have been a little off. Overall, a decent Japanese place, but nothing special.","TLDR: Downtown Brooklyn sushi restaurant. Priced very fairly, delicious sushi and rolls. I live in Queens and I trek out here because I think it's worth it. Taro is that neighborhood sushi restaurant that everyone wishes they had. Parking is difficult but if you can find a spot or take the trip over here - your tummy will be happy. Sushi Special for 2, that's all you need to know.I've been coming to Taro for a number of years and it is definitely at the top of my list for casual sushi. It's within walking distance to Barclays so if you're out here for an event, I highly recommend stopping by here. They do take reservations so it's a good idea to call ahead.This is my ""go to"" for casual sushi for at least 5 years. They have a Sushi Special for 2 which clocks in at $50 approximately. You each get about 10 pieces of nigiri sushi (all dressed in various ways) and two large rolls to share. You probably don't need anything extra if you get this, it is filling. Also - if you'd like less rice, they can accommodate that as well.The prices are more than reasonable for the quality of fish that you're getting here. The special comes with the Mountain Roll and a Shrimp Tempura Roll. The mountain is basically a yellowtail/avocado and a spicy tuna roll in one.Till this day, this is my favorite shrimp tempura roll anywhere. It's fried just right, served slightly warm and it nothing like the dry sogginess encountered usually.","I've been here twice and I wish I lived here - cause I'd come here every damn week. Neighborhood sushi restaurant up the block from Barclays. The fish here is fresh and the small plates are great too.On my last visit, my girlfriend and I shared the Sushi Deluxe for 2 which is $52 for a lot of food. We unnecessarily got two handrolls, a negitoro and california (real) crab. We also got two of the kumamoto oysters with ponzu. Had the ankimo or monk fish liver with ponzu previously, so good.Love this place every time. If you're in or live around here, you're lucky and take advantage!",My favorite roll is the fluke with ume paste and shiso. I wish they made more rolls with shiso. I should sit down here and order because I like the inside vibe too.A good place to order takeout from and their sushi regular dinner is a good deal. Friendly staff as well!,Taro Sushi
451,"I really did want to like this place..mostly because of all the hype and the 45 minutes of my life i spent waiting to eat but..We got:- tagliatelle bolognese 6/10: was a pretty average dish, definitely not worth the $23. Tasted like something i couldve made at home, although the pasta itself was quite good. But the sauce and flavors lay flat - gnocchi 5/10: the gnocchi was reaaaaaaaally soft, im not sure if they were going for that soft doughy texture but it just tasted severely undercooked to me. Service was noticeably bad (and i dont even notice service ever), it took forever to get anything - especially to order. Also, there was a table ready but they didn't seat us for at least another 10 minutes for some strange reason..? Also not really within their control but peeved me anyways was that there's only one bathroom for the whole establishment and it is literally in the middle of the restaurant. Practically begs for a traffic collision when you open the door. Overall, definitely not worth the hype or the wait. Maybe the hype is around the atmosphere...? I really dont get it. Save yourself some everything and go eat at any number of the restaurants nearby.","The customer service at this place is 10/10. We ordered the beef carpaccio, grilled squid and the grilled bread. The grilled bread paired in the grilled squid juices were to die for! The beef carpaccio was pretty good also just wish I had more of that white sauce that was topped on it. Okay so the potato gnocchi is DEL-CIOUS. I got the spaghetti with the clams which isn't in a red sauce but I wasn't really a fan of that dish. The desserts really stole the show. The tiramisu and the vanilla creme brûlée were to die for!",Hi.i just mooved  to the  neighborhood .I was told This place is good.

Was greeted by the hostess and sat quickly on a busy Saturday night.Warm ambiance and upbeat music/ atmosphere. The place is live- it does have a lot going on (loud environment, kitchen cooks in front) but thats what keeps it lively.The waitress was very friendly and made sure the dishes were out in a timely manner. Polenta was creamy and rich. The topping red peppers were not too sweet and onions complimented the sauce well. Very balanced and proportioned. Overall, I would give this a 8/10. The only downfall was the portion was small, but I think the restaurant was going for the 'small plates style'. The Bolognese was very flavorful and seasoned thorougly. Taste was very warm and noodles were light and delicious. Very meaty! Overall, i would give this dish a 8.6/ 10.Good pasta and vibes, great for a pleasant evening.","There are a lot of Frankies and its confusing. This one is the original and down the block is Franks which is split into two places. A wine bar with an app menu and a reservation only side. Then there is one in Manhattan. This one was okay. Average food and high prices. I liked the rustic atmoshpere and we sat by the window. Thier backyard is gorgeous and they have a courtyard too which looks like for weddings and other events. 17 dollars for eggplant marinara. Came with no pasta and was just eggplant in red sauce. It tasted good but not worth 17 dollars and not filling. My boyfried ordered the cavatelli with sausage. 22 dollars. The cavatelli was very good. Homemade and in a brown butter sage sauce. I'm lucky he let me eat half. The sausage I didn't care for. Too spicy for my tastes and the flavor itself I didnt like. Portions average size. Cocktails at 14 dollars I guess is pretty typical. The spritz was actually really good. My boyfriend's drink tasted like medicine to me though, I forgot what it was called, something with bird in the title. Overpriced average food, wouldn't come back but glad we tried it.","This is the place that does the Resy backyard chef collaborations I can only attest to place as a wedding venue and the food that was served for the wedding.The backyard space was amazing, tasteful, and intimate.The food for the wedding was 1.

On the drive over, I called in my order since it was close to closing time, to save everybody time.When the server asked me what kind of dressing and I asked the options, she, clearly annoyed that she would have to be HELPFUL, read the list without any pauses so I couldn't tell ""cilantro, lime"" or ""cilantro and lime"" etc. I asked her to repeat it which she did so with plenty of attitude. Then asked also with attitude ""are you going to be here in 5 minutes?"" How about a ""just so you know we're closing soon and you'll need to arrive before close."" Or telling me before I order? At that point I was just a few blocks away, but I also wasn't finished ordering. Since she clearly didn't want to help me and I didn't like dealing with her attitude over the phone, I figured I probably wouldn't want to interact with her in person either. I mean, God forbid I ask for something extra, like napkins for instance, at the end of a shift, maybe that would've sent her off the deep end.I was a server in New York City for over a decade. Customer service isn't hard. Clearly they don't need my business.","Didn't have a good experience here at all, it was my first and Last time here, the woman at the window was very rude and nonchalant. I did not like the chicken sandwich, the bread was hard and the taste of it was not good so i asked if i could get something else or my money back, she then said ""well i can't give you free food just because you don't like it"".  It's just a $13 sandwich, it wasn't about the money and it's not what she said it's how she said, Very nasty and exactly why i will Never go back.",Tastiest (and biggest) wang I've ever put in my mouth. Get the spicy sauce and an order of whole wangs.,"Unexpectedly found this spot while looking for parking to eat at a place across the street. So glad we went here jnstead. Winner, chicken dinner. Just a simple hole in the wall stand with the amazing food, cooked with wholesome ingredients. You order at the window and can either eat while standing at the tables in front or take it to go. Their 24 hour brine fried chicken was amazing. Huge portion too! So much flavor and super crispy chicken. Fries were delicious, with their homemade ketchup and aoli sauce. The korean fried chicken was crispy  with a nice spicy kick. Better than most korean gastropubs. Corn on the cob was a plus. Probably my new favorite chicken spot","This will be my second bad review ever written on yelp. Wangs chicken wings that I had were good! The unpleasant experience came when we ordered fried chicken. The order was prepared in a few minutes, I was even surprised by how fast it was. The first few bites were fine, but when I bitted deeper into the chicken breast and wing, I saw that fresh blood was coming out. Believe me, it was one of the most distasteful feelings that I have ever had. I should have said anything to the cashier but I didn't because they looked pretty busy and impatient. Hope this experience serves as a reminder for your future customers and how awful it was to eat fried chicken that are not fully cooked!","This will be my second bad review ever written on yelp.

453,"There are many things wrong with this place:1. Bartenders are barely paying attention to you and the counter is so sticky like in a college bar2. Once you get your overpriced cocktail you are constrained to a tiny area with even more sticky and dirty tables. The rest of the rooftop is only for guests with reservations. Which apparently you need to make a week in advance. However most of the tables where empty regardless.3. You are allowed to make a quick run through the wider rooftop area but if you stop to take a picture they approach you and start kicking you down to the reserved tiny area I mentioned in 2.4. Music is quite mediocre.5. And for all of that you need to line up for half an hour downstairs to get access to the rooftopBottom line, too inconvenient and unenjoyable for the price you pay. Will not go there again.","This is one of those rooftop bars where locals take out of town friends who got stuck with a bad hotel room view, or they take their special date who hasn't been yet.  The view is the million dollar prize here especially at sunset, and for that million dollar view, you can also have some expensive tasty drinks and small plates of food.  Don't hate the player- hate the insurance premium and taxes on rooftop bars with views.Even though the chicken empanadas look like they were made by tiny elves in a mini-me Santa workshop, they actually pack a full punch of flavor that didn't make me want any more food.  I looked over longingly at the plate of ribs- but didn't have the courage to ask to eat a stranger's plate of food.",Came here for girls night. No room to sit. Freezing and windy outside. The drinks weren't that good. Stood in line for no reason to try here. Came up for only about 20 mins got drinks and left and went back to queens for better bar and drinks.,"A group of 6 of us needed to find a place to celebrate the end of our rotation so we decided to check out Westlight. As soon as you walk in the lobby you are just hit by the grandeur of the space both in the lobby as well as the entrance of the bar. As we walked in there was two levels of outdoor seating. We decided to go to the top level which had an absolutely gorgeous view of the skyline which you can take in from the comfort of couches and bean bags. There were also a couple of foosball tables and cornhole set ups - all of which were free to play! Drinks themselves are pretty average. They didn't have any amaretto so I could not get my usual amaretto coke :( but was able to settle for a vodka cran. All in all, such a great place to hang out with a group and just chit chat. It was a little on the louder side but still a wonderful place to take in the surprising beauty of Williamsburg. This is definitely a rooftop I need to keep in my repertoire.","We were hanging in the area & decided to give this place a try , we came in & ended up getting a table outside. Once seated we ordered a bottle of Rosé , the rose was good nice light tasting. This place is pretty impressive because of the amazing views u get ... wow we were shocked to have such an enjoyable day just hanging out drinking, listening to music & enjoying the day & amazing views of Brooklyn & all the way into the city & beyond it seems. Service was good & prices were not bad since we had a group, we enjoyed our time.","Beautiful rooftop of the William Vale in Williamsburg - make a reservation just before sunset for the best views. My friend and I weren't able to be seated outside despite having a reservation, but it ended up being a blessing in disguise. We got a center table indoors which allowed us to take in the view but also have some more privacy and shelter from the wind outside :)Surprisingly, the food was better and service was friendlier than we expected. We ordered the tempura bass buns, crispy potato skins, chicken empanadas, duck tacos, and fries (yes, we were super hungry). I highly recommend all of them, as everything was flavorful and fresh. The crispy potato skins were incredible, especially with the caviar on top.Westlight also has an expansive and creative cocktails menu. The Lavender Lake and New Wave were delicious. All in all, a beautiful space to relax and take in the gorgeous NYC views.",Westlight
454,"Ordered sweet and sour chicken on a lunch special via delivery, which should have the sauce packed seperately so the battered chicken doesnt steam into a gooey soggy mess, which is what i got. When i called to have them resend one with the sauce on the side, the hostess refused and was incredibly rude, insisting that they always ruin the dish for lunch specials?? Won't order from here again after ten years as a customer. Get someone with better people skills to handle your business.",The best Chinese food I've had. I've been going to this place for just about my entire life. No where really even comes close anywhere around this area.,"Think they fired their chef or something? They've been pretty good for years but the last time we ordered takeout from them, it was mostly inedible. Felt quite ripped off","Not a huge fan of Chinese food but Hunan is always good. - Fast, Fast (take out or sitting down)- Food is always great. No complaints on that end - Staff is friendly - Inexpensive - Overall experience is 5/5- Can be fairly busy but not to the point of having to wait on a line- The outdoor seating in the summer is always amazing","Awesome Chinese food in an elegant and clean restaurant. A good marker of their service quality for me was that they had regulars coming in while we were there. Though we came in towards the end of their lunch service, our food was hot and fresh when it got to the table. The orange chicken even had bits of orange peel in the sauce which gave the leftovers great flavor upon reheating. We've tried a few other Chinese places in the neighborhood and this one will be our go-to in the future.","Hunan delight is definitely the best Chinese restaurant in park slope. Unfortunately there isn't much competition. There are definitely some dishes that are tasty including the buns, lo mein and chicken and broccoli however I often am left feeling like I ordered wrong when ordering other dishes. We have ordered probably close to 10 times and I find that some of the dishes don't have the best quality meat. I have never eaten at the restaurant but maybe that would improve the experience.",Hunan Delight
455,"This place is perfect, anyone who rates it less than 5 stars is a douche. Literally perfect.The only downside is that it's hard to get a table anytime between 6:30pm and 9pm :)","We went for a 10th anniversary dinner and were greatly disappointed. This was a very unfortunate experience. The waitstaff was friendly, however, the food was poor.  We ordered the ribeye, which was 38oz we told, and it was brought out bone and all with the side of skillet mashed potatoes.  I wish could write a better review, but the steak was badly over salted along with the mashed potatoes, which were also over-garlicky. We did have a lovely appetizer, but I can't remember what it was, so it mustn't have been great, but only pretty good. We got a 25% pity discount on the steak, although we did have to wait 45 minutes for it to cook.  Finally, we were told we had a 2.5 hour wait, but it ended up being about 25 minutes. However, we left for Brooklyn Winery to kill some time and received a text 35 after it was sent due to the poor reception in the area. They let us seat anyway, but they should really improve their wait time estimates.Oh well.  Probably won't go back. We'll be sure to put in the reservation at Peter Lugers instead if we're back in the area.",The hostess was very unfriendly and disrespectful . She asked me and my friend to wait for 2 hours while the group came behind us got the table within 10 mins. This had happened several times. This kind of attitude doesnt worth my time or my money,"Very good food!  Sam our server was attentive at all times. I've seen reviews about poor service but I can't say we experienced that. Seated at the kitchen counter so we watched all the prep action. Grilled clams. Great flavor but could have done without the grit.  Spinach gratin and grilled fennel were both outstanding. Butchers steak was delicious. And too much for one serving. Brined pork was nicely done, flavorful. Above average but not great. Could use more local beers on tap. Wine selection was good. Would recommend.","St. Anselm is a Brooklyn steakhouse disguised as a casual New American restaurant. You know the vibe-- open kitchen, exposed brick, low lighting. It feels like a cozy vestige of Williamsburg circa 2010, down to its weathered wooden bar and no-reservations policy.We came around 6 pm on a Friday night a few months back and were quoted an hour wait, which stretched a bit past that. There are several bars in the surrounding blocks to kill time at. We sat at the counter on the bar side, rather than the cooking side, so we missed out on the action, but it's also more temperate away from the grill.For starters, we had grilled clams in a pleasant broth as well as fabulous grilled artichokes, good down to the stem. Though this is putatively a steakhouse, you can really trust them with seafood and vegetables.The butcher's steak deserves the hype-- I paid under $30 for a sizeable, slightly irregularly shaped cut. What it lacks in aesthetics, it more than makes up in taste. Though I'm usually a filet mignon gal and prioritize tenderness above all else, I really enjoyed the drier, though still juicy, texture and the deep flavor they were able to get out of the thick char and generous seasoning. Definitely on the chewy side, but you'll enjoy letting it linger. My boyfriend had some other cut, maybe the sirloin, and though it was satisfying, we enjoyed the butcher's steak more (even though it was cheaper!).Good service. Pacing relatively quick-- probably in and out within an hour. Strong wine program, including good glass and the carafe options. They have the mandatory exploration into natural wines, though they draw on more established domestic producers like Scholium Project, Channing Daughters, and Donkey and Goat for their draught wine, instead of having the most obscure possible.Worth checking out for steak lovers looking for a change of scenery. Been meaning to make it back for a Brooklyn date night.","If you are lucky enough to get in... think 2 to 3 hour wait (don't be jealous that we got really lucky with the chef's table). This place is phenomenal and saturated in pure BUTTER. The salmon that I ordered made me believe that the world is a good place. It also made me believe that fairies actually exist. But one of the best things, out of all of the best things, was the pan fried mashed potatoes... WHAT! I beg your damn pardon. Who came up with this and can I have your food baby. It is worth the wait. Just go with the intention of drinking a bottle of wine somewhere else close by. Every possible surface that can be used to eat, should.",St. Anselm
456,"I dislike posting negative review's, but i feel obligated to post one of Runner & Stone. I dined there recently along with a friend, and was disappointed, to say the least. Runner & Stone is a tiny restaurant located in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn. I went in with high expectation's, after hearing good thing's from a dear friend. My dinner was less than spectacular. I started with a glass of Chianti, A tiny glass of insipid wine for $15. My guest ordered a Martini. Three sip's and the glass was empty, cost $19. We ordered Duck Prosciutto as our app, it was tough and tasteless .Entree's weren't any better. Squid ink Bucatini was overcooked, contained only a tiny bit of Crab and Lobster, and the dish was drowning in Butter. My Orecchiete was overcooked, and full  of Pork fat.  When I complained to the manager, Julio, he shrugged his shoulder's and replied ""I can't please everybody"". I guess I won't be returning.",The service was really beyond excellent and the bread was amazing but the food was just ok. I expected it to be much more. I had the beet salad and the steak and was a bit disappointed,The service at this place is always bad and they always act like they're making you a favor. Tried several times in different moments of the day. Always the same bad service. There are a few better choices some blocks away.,"This is my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood! Food is amazing!Staff is so helpful and kind!Drinks are delicious!Bakery...*already drooling*I love coming to this restaurant and highly recommend the steak, pork chop, gnoochi... Everything really!Don't forget to take a few croissants home for breakfast the next morning! *Drooling*","I came here for brunch during my lunch hour. The service here was really fast:  getting seated, ordering, and my food coming out happened in a 15-20 minute window. I ordered the french toast with a side of bacon. The french toast had an amazing marmalade on top of it. That marmalade with the very savory syrup was a perfect blend. I was tempted to order another french toast to go. The bacon was good and had a nice crunch to it. I expected to get a bigger portion of bacon for the price. The restaurant seems small but I didn't venture past the bar seating. All of the pastries displayed had a nice presentation and I will definitely be back to try them out or maybe just go for french toast.","Don't miss out on this phenomenal eatery. Julio was a perfect host. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty. Given extra little nibbles and spot on wine suggestions. Every plate was meticulously created and artistically plated. Delicious does not suffice to describe the food and my experience. Thank you so much!",Runner & Stone
457,Guess what I found in my meal? A piece of glass :) my teeth hurt so much now.                                                  Holy molly.,"Bad, bad.We used to eat there at least twice a week since years. Customer service is just as bad as the management, the food and the rest.We waited almost an hour to be served a reheat chicken kabab that was cut in half to cook again (most likely from a previous order that was canceled or from the day before.We didn't eat and asked for the check, They brought the check, charged us without any sorry for the food or apologies. It's clear the message was you didn't like the food, because it's old, cold, reheat.... It's not our problem.... When I asked to talk to the owner they tried to bring someone from the kitchen, who never accepted to see us, or apologize.This is the worst that happen to me since many years. I'm running a business next door, I tried to explain that this is not normal at all, then the waiter start telling me I'm here as a helper I'm not a waiter, I have an Master etc.... This is horrible.Not only you lost me as a customer, (for many years), but I'll make sure that every business in Park Slope will be aware of this non sens situation and will avoid your place.",Very unprofessional and stupid service!!!! If you do deliveries make sure that you deliver everything and not the selected items. Was ordering delivery for many months and today I found that they do specials but not deliver them ! What a stupid argument so why you do specials?! Just to say that you have specials??? If you want to lose customers this way I can wish you all the best,Food was great. Gyro meat cut too thin for my kids liking almost like a cold cut slice.Mix grill meats order was very good able to feed almost 4 people with this one platter. Veg and rice hit the spot.  Better then the Greek places around which barely give enough meats.,"I've never eaten there in person but I've ordered delivery from them several times and overall I've found them to be a pretty solid option! Delivery is almost always on time and they throw in a giant piece of free, fresh-baked bread which is great of them to do (a lot of restaurants offer complimentary bread but how many of them include it in delivery?). I always order the babaganoush, which is my favorite appetizer on the menu. Great smoky flavor and it goes well with the bread. I also like their chicken kebabs. Portion is a bit small considering the price but the chicken is juicy and well seasoned. I've tried some of their other meat dishes and I've found they can be a bit dry at times (especially the lamb) but I haven't been let down by the chicken kebabs yet. It comes with this delicious rice-- I don't know what kind of rice it is or what kind of seasoning they use but it's very flavorful.","Ordered delivery, once, and most likely will not be ordering again.  Let me share with you why... While delivery was on time and efficient, their was something cvery clever going on with how the food is served.  Let me explain...When ordering, there is an option for the customer to select small or large, okay fine.  This is where the trickery plays in...For a small portion which includes rice, the kabab protein and some salad...you get one small skewer of kabab split into two portions in the small option.  Yet, they charge you the same price as any other comparable business does, for a regular portion.  Translation: you get way less food for the same price you'd pay anyway.Icing on the ""cake"", they throw in a large piece of bread because ultimately, that's what's going to fill you up, bread.You've been notified.",Istanbul Park
458,"Chill, tranquil spot close to home so it makes that much better ....Great food and the steak and beef burger is a must try..No complaints whatsoever..","Very cool.I felt like I was taking a road trip.I watched basketball game there.Nice people, atmosphere.","I promised an update once I tried their brunch menu, which, I realize, is way overdue.  My ""french omelette"" was an alien consistency.  I requested no alterations or substitutes to my order.  That being said, the exterior of the omelette and the taste seemed very processed and altered.  Straight up, it suggested that it was out of a box.  As in, liquid egg substitute, not fresh eggs, at all.As you can recognize in my photo, the exterior of my omelette looks ultimately, very bizarre.  And it tasted peculiar to say the least.","Decided to stop at this cool, new spot while trying to find CATFISH yesterday with a friend. What drew us in was the airiness of the place because the windows were all open on the side of the restaurant and we were looking for somewhere with natural air. The aroma of the kitchen from the sidewalk also helped put a quick end to our search for the restaurant we intended to go to.My friend had the sampler platter which was quite filling for her (she couldn't finish it) and I had the black bean burger with a side salad. It was extremely delicious. The bun was nice and doughy. The burger came with cheddar cheese, avocado, lettuce, and tomato. The side salad was also really good. A light, sweet vinaigrette dressing sprinkled. Our waiter, Justin, was very attentive. I would highly recommend this place!","I can't believe it took us this long to find this local spot. I ordered the jalapina margarita and it wasn't overwhelmingly spicy and the hint of pineapple made it just right. I ordered the steak and eggs, and was surprised to find some extra pieces under the eggs! (See pic). I recommend ordering a side of truffle oil fries (see pic) those were delicious! My boyfriend ordered the burger and fries, which he says he liked. The service was good. Although there is a strong bar smell the place is really clean. We will definitely be back.","Came here for lunch , ordered the fried chicken (2) thighs  and Tatar tots , chicken was fried Crispy as I ordered it and the Tatar tots were amazing and the food came out temperature hot. That's a big thing for me. Bartender was great but a little quiet for me lol lol but he made some amazing margaritas on ice ... Only thing I would like is that the chicken has  more seasoning and different genres of music which plays in the background ... I recommend this place and will be back. Next time I want to try the lobster & beef burger... Besides that the ambiance is great. Thanks for a great experience . I'll be back soon .",99 Rogers
459,"Very disappointed at the new guys they hired. H was so stingy with the sides, plus he hands were so dirty. My wrap was like a 1/2 wrap. Price went up but portion is smaller? Make sure the mexican guy is the one adding your add-ons and sauce. They put like 3 drops of sauce on my wrap. When I asked for me he put 3 more drops. I think I'll go to cava from now on",This place is horrible because of the staff! The staff weren't professional at all and extremely sexist. They were sexually harassing some young female customers and hitting on them. They made them so uncomfortable and kept eaves dropping onto their conversations. They also were ogling the females and looking them up and down like they were pieces of meat. The two hispanic workers need to learn how to respect women and not see them as sexual objects to hit on. Also the food was very bland and extremely Americanized. It wasn't authentic at all. The salad was stale and like a fast food salad. I suggest all women to avoid this place because you will be  sexually harassed and hit on and made very uncomfortable. No women should have to go through this when they are just trying to eat and paid so much for!,"I went here today for lunch since I was in the area . Got the beef/lamb bowl with rice and hummus on the side .   First off, the halal carts gives you a lot more portion than here . The meat does taste better than what you'd get at a halal cart .  But it's not the true Doner style of thin slices of meat . I would say it's more shawarma style than anything else .  The hummus was okay, but not the best.",This is a first for sitting in restaurant while the lunch time rush poured in. I am impressed at how not once did any of this team lose a beat. People came in and left as fast as their cards swiped by their cashier. It seems like the manager or boss mans the fryer and grill with ease. He steps in where needed and didn't lose his speed when online pick ups came in and couldn't be found. But you're not reading this review for an observation based on quick and precise movements; you're here for the food. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the wrap found in downtown wrap known for smaller sizes and bigger prices. It was lightly seasoned the way that Mediterranean food should be. Happy camper over here. Keep up the good work.,"This is what I would call a gem hidden in plain sight! Not sure how I had absolutely no idea this place was here this whole time. The Beef and Lamb Doner bowl I had was great! (They did not use fake lamb!!) The meat was flavorful and tender, with a bit of a char on the edges, and the bulgur, sauces, garnishes, and fries were delicious. Just a heads up re expectations... this is a fast-casual spot near offices filled with less adventurous palates, so the food here will not make your mouth burst with dynamite levels of exotic flavors. This is more like a non-chain Mediterranean version of Chipotle with fair pricing for downtown Brooklyn. The portion is very filling! And in my opinion, it's better value than most options you can find in DeKalb Market.That being said, I did have a bit of trouble placing an order online for my team of for a work lunch. After I had meticulously entered seven people's worth of food with all the variations of toppings and sauces and was ready to pay, I received an error message saying the site did not accept orders currently. The online form also does not include an option to choose bulgur as the carb for your bowl. So after spending over an hour trying to use their online form, then grubhub, then calling them, I ended up walking over in person to provide them with a physical list of everyone's order. (It appears other customers have had more luck using Seamless... which I will try next time.) Hopefully they fix this soon so the options for ordering in are more clear ahead of time. Once I did show up in person, however, the staff was very nice and very willing to help! The delivery guy was also nice, and everyone's order was correct. Overall, the experience was good despite the technical glitch. I would definitely order from here again.","We got the chicken doner cone and it was pretty good! Lots of stuff that goes in it and the chicken was well seasoned. I wish they had other meat options like lamb but oh well.The cone is a bit smaller portion than the other things on their menu it seems, and the employee was nice enough to warn us before we finished ordering which i really appreciated!",Doner Kebab NYC
460,"The Italian gnocchi is to die for!!! It is not on the menu, you need to ask for it :) $25","The food here was decent, however the service was AWFUL. It started with us waiting 45 minutes after our reservation time to sit at our table. The atmosphere was generally loud and confusing. The waiter proceeded to come over, check the time on his phone, and tell us we all must pay attention because he refuses to repeat himself before he started rambling off the specials for the night. I could barely hear him, and knew I was not interested in the specials, so I looked down at my menu to see what I wanted to order. The waiter then told me now is not the time to look at my menu because he was speaking. He realized the pure shock on my face and that I could not understand how he could be so rude that he then tried to play it off as a joke. Midway through our time at the restaurant, the waiter came over and tried to have a conversation with us. Someone in the party asked what part of Italy he was from (as we were in an Italian restaurant and he seemed to have an Italian accent) and he told us that he's not from Italy but he's lied to girls and told them that he is. Majority of our party were women that he said this to. On top of this, when it was time to order dessert, he came over and checked the time on his phone yet again and said ok now it's time for dessert. After all this, it was time to pay the bill. We were a party of 9, and it was one's birthday, so it took some time figuring out how to split it as there were some of us who drank and some who didn't. The waiter came by shortly after giving us the bill and stood there while we were finishing up collecting cards and cash and was visibly annoyed at the amount of time it was taking for us to pay the bill. We wrote down what was to be charged on each card and told him, and he proceeded to put his own amount in. Because of this, he was shorted on his tip and then argued with three people in the party that he was shorted (one of them being the person who's birthday it was). He wanted to re-run all of the cards again. We said no because we did not want to be charged double. After this argument we just gave the difference in cash and left very frustrated. Safe to day we will not be returning to this restaurant.","We had reservations for 8:00 pm on a Friday night and we didn't get seated until 9:15 which was really frustrating. The food was great but the service was okay. Also, the music was uncomfortably loud at some point. I may need to come back and try this place out again not during their peak hour","Pasquale and Val are on top of their game.  We held our rehearsal dinner at Positano last night and everyone was was over the moon about the place.  We had 34 people so they gave us our own room which took the dinner and turned it into a party.  Everyone was up and mingling and not confined to their table. It really made the night a million times better.  I called them and let them know we were running late but on our way (Brooklyn traffic) so Val fired up the apps and had bread and water on the tables. Everyone was so happy to have hot food served to them soon as they arrived since it was a long day and they were all starving.   They even made sure I got some extra apps because I missed them while running around.  Everyone loved the food but people are still taking about the meatballs today!  They kept the drinks flowing non stop and they were strong and big!  The pasta course was cooked perfectly al dentè and delicious.  By the time dinner came people we almost full and I saw many people getting they food wrapped up which says a lot because my fiends never take food home but it was so good they couldn't leave it behind.  I ate all of mine!  Val was very organized, funny and attentive.  They really took an event that could have been just another dinner and turned it into a really special night.  Thanks again !  My only complaint is I live to far or I would be there all the time.  Hope to be back soon.We also felt it was very affordable.  We went with the $49 menu and open bar and we felt like we got  beyond our money's worth in every way.","These guys take care of you!If you like the feeling of individualized attention for a true meal, then this is place.   Had lunch here twice recently.Once on the weekend.  (No Lunch menu on weekends!)Once during the week.  (my steak sandwich is on the lunch menu!)Both times service was great.  Sometimes almost too great and a little jumbled with too many hands in the pot.   i.e. the guy that gets the bread and butter and lemon wedges is NOT your waiter...so if he fails to get something...it gets lost in the handoff.  That happened to me both times I visited, and witnessed it happening to others. On the weekends, the portions are family style and one entree is plenty to share. (see my pics of chicken parm)During the week, ample salads and reasonably priced sandwiches are tasty and freshly made.  Such a nice atmosphere, especially when the windows are open.You really get the feeling of being ""transported"" here, or like you are in Europe.   Well worth it for any day of the week.","The customer service here is out of this world!  It's honestly one of the main reasons I come here. Food is phenomenal, authentic Italian food and hospitality.  Everyone greets and acknowledges you from the waiter to the manager Try this place!",Positano Restaurant

I was unable to taste the skimpy servings of porcetta (sp?), because I was told, in no uncertain terms, that you have to buy a drink in order to have a sliver of the appetizer, though the FB event page neglected to use that particular jargon (rule). It was both WHAT the owner said, and I quote, ""I mean, it's not like we're just giving away free food here"" during the patio's opening, and HOW he said it. I had several folks en route that I'm CERTAIN would have obliged to his policy IF it were stated on the FB page, and IF he would have conveyed it politely to me Face to face. Alas, When spoken to in that manner, I told EVERY member of my party to skip their trip to this location, and consider skipping this business altogether because of the rudeness of the owner and lack of clarity for the event. Bottom line is, EYE choose where, with whom and how to spend my money. I REFUSE to be spoken to in a rude manner and tone, (particularly when the ""rules"" were unclear) then patronize, and BRING OTHERS to patronize a business that clearly doesn't appreciate MY support, the business I bring today and in the future. So NO thanks Luca, today and going forward!WHEN: 5/2/18WHERE: dine inHOW: car/ bikeBATHROOM: do not useWIFI: did not useDRESS CODE: as you like SERVICE: piss poor from the OWNER, cordial support staff","All is well until you slowly pull out a long hair thats been cooked into your lasagna dish. Vomit? Pretty much.The husband and I came here for what we thought would be a nice, quiet afternoon bite. We were greeted by a friendly employee who told us to sit anywhere we liked and brought us water and menus. I wasn't very hungry so I was going to order an appetizer and husband ordered a main. I ordered the Asparagi and he, the Lasagna which was per the waiters recommendation. We also ordered a glass of wine and a cocktail. The restaurant was fairly empty with a couple of other patrons there so it was weird that the drinks took over 5 minutes to come to us but we let it slide. But then when the food took a while to come too it became a little frustrating. Anyways, food arrives and we begin to eat. The asapargi was OK. It was roasted asparagus with a poached egg, parm and some other blob of something cheesy atop. My husband was really enjoying his lasagna when all of a sudden he digs in and his fork catches a hair that was seriously cooked deep into the dish. I may or may not have gagged but ugh, you know, it's everyones worst nightmare. We stopped eating and asked for the bill. When the waiter came back to the table we showed him the treasure we found and he was really sorry. He did take the dish off the bill and if it was anything less than a hair I'd give them more stars but I can't get passed that. It is unhygienic on all accounts and I don't know what else goes on in their kitchen.I will not be returning anytime soon or ever for that matter.","On our second-to-last night as Brookynites, the wife and I, along with a small group of friends, had a a fantastic meal at La Rina. We'd been to La Rina many times in the past, but the last visit left us completely underwhelmed (the portions seemed to have diminished and the prices definitely expanded). I'm happy -- and stuffed -- to report that last night's sendoff was wonderful, from the food and service to the ambience and company (OK, La Rina can't take credit for our awesome friends). We shared a number of appetizers including the daily stracciatella special (unreal) and the zucca fritta. Both were incredibly flavorful, and we enjoyed wiping the bowls clean with the mind-blowing bread, especially the focaccia, which tasted almost like a salty donut. For mains, we each got our own pasta dishes and as with the appetizers, ever plate was wiped clean. We also split/shared the spaghetti agilo ed oglio, which has been my favorite since the first time we went to La Rina. It's smoky and spicy (thanks to the Calabrian chilis sprinkled throughout), and cooked perfectly. And unlike the (aforementioned) previous trip, the portion was just right. Oh, and I'd be remiss not to mention the house-made Negroni, which, I believe, is on tap. That plus some shared Cannonau kept the evening going, all with a soft-landing assist by the panna cotta, which was topped with caramel and sea salt. I mean, it almost wasn't fair to do that to us. Grazie mille, La Rina. Ci vediamo la prossima volta!","Easily one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. It's located on a really charming street in Fort Greene and inside it's cozy yet not too cramped. They have seating at the bar, at tables inside, and outside. I've only sat inside so far but it's great that they have an outdoor option as well when the weather is nice.Silvia Barban is the owner/head chef and she's Italian and so so talented (she was on Top Chef also). The service has always been really pleasant and helpful every time I've gone. The waitstaff are all friendly. Now the most important part: the food! It's so so good! I recommend paying close attention when they share their specials because I often opt for one instead of the main menu since usually it's something that sounds so over the top delicious I can't pass it up. But the menu options are great as well. The pasta is not trying too hard but made with classic ingredients and tastes amazing.I also recommend going for the panna cotta for a nice light but tasty dessert- you won't regret it. Love it here!","One of the best meals I have had in NYC.First, our server, Zoe, had a fabulous command of the wine list and the menu.  I had a dietary restriction and she was able to describe in detail how each offering was constructed and prepared.For the wine, Zoe recommend a Spanish wine called Ultreia, that was robust and flavorful. It was a perfect accompaniment for our main course.The foccacia served before our meal, was soft in the middle and crusty on the outside with a bit of sea salt. With the side of olive oil, a perfect match.For the appetizer, I had the Pomodori e Cetrioli (Tomato and Cuke salad). It had a wonderful basil infused dressing that made this very simple dish wonderfully satisfying.I had the Gnocchi and Oxtail with a tomato reduction for the main course. It had a slight bit of heat but not overwhelming. If I tried to scrape any more of the sauce from the bottom of the bowl, I would have damaged the plate! This was a fantastic choice!Appetizers and main course for 3, and .5 L of the Ultreia plus another full glass for under $200 with tip.  Fabulous service, wonderful atmosphere and phenomenal food!I can't wait to go back.",LaRina Pastificio & Vino
462,"I enjoyed this place the first time I ordered. The reviews were great and the experience matched my expectations. My second order, which is the one I'm writing about now, didn't nearly bring me to my happy place.  Firstly, the packing was questionable and slightly disorganized. Took us a while to sort through which container is what. Secondly, the first thing you notice is a strand of HAIR inside the vegetable container.  I was grossed out but thought mistakes happen and we'll just toss the first layer of salad with the strand in the trash and we'll be solid.This brings me to my third and final MAJOR complaint. As my friend and I continued to enjoy our pupusia's we noticed ANOTHER long and very very gross strand of hair in the dip. At this point we both just were incredibly disgusted and immediately threw the rest of the order out.I was left disgusted and still very hungry.",Very bad and disgusting food. Made me sick w/ food poisoning . Do not order from here.,"I've Been Going to this Restaurant For Years and it's Been Always Great, by today was the worst days, the service was horrible and my Father Found RAT POOP IN HIS CUP WITH ICE!! We told the waitress she grabbed the cup quick and left, not one word not a Simple sorry. Also I ate a plate of corn and Cream and The Tamale was Expired, I don't know what's going on with this place! I'm never going back",Papusa was great Horchata was great Sopa de Res was great Simple and good. Not expensive.  Will order again,"Have been looking for an opportunity to try papusas in NYC for a while after I had them in Central America. Super filling, super cheap. I got the chicken/cheese, chicharron/cheese, and the loroco/cheese. My favorite was surprisingly the lorocos/cheese. Meat was a little dry but the red sauce and cheese helped. The horchatta was super flavorful and would def recommend that. Only reason for 4 stars was the seating area was kind of cramped, like whenever anyone walked behind me there wasn't enough room so I was moving my chair a decent amount.",I've only ordered delivery and get the pupusas. Last time I also ordered the horchata which is very good and the maduros which is a much bigger portion then I thought it would be. The pupusas are so fresh and very filling. I feel like I have tried them all. Their delivery is quicker than what's posted when following your order. Now I want more pupusas!!,Bahia Restaurant
463,"We walked in at 9:45 PM and immediately got annoyed looks. They sat us and we were ignored for over 5 minutes before we got up to leave. The entire staff was sitting at the bar on our way out, counting money and/or eating staff meal and happily said goodnight to us. So disappointing, especially for two fine dining hospitality bartenders who were going to tip well regardless of how bad the service was not to even get served. We love the pizza, but we can eat at Ops instead.","They forgot to put pasta to my order. It was unprofessional and disappointing. So my husband shared his pizza with me. Pizza was really nice, but too small size even for one person. Their small size could work only for kids and they need to put this informations in the menu. Sunday evening, we paid $43, we don't have our pasta and still hungry after two pizza.",I actually prefer to order take out from this place because the customer service is SO poor that it's almost offensive. They're really doing this place an injustice because the food is so good!! Pls hire people who give a shit,"Best pizza in bushwick!! Fast delivery and fair prices. Love you forever santa panza.My favorites are marguerita, prosciutto with mushroom and arugula and spicy salami !!","Cool vibe in this spot. Love the pizza, wine, ambiance, service, crowd. All of it!!! My only issue was that they only take cash!!! It was late night and they were the closest restaurant in the area that was open. I was disappointed about the ""only cash"" situation, but made it work.",We have visited this little joint a couple of times. I had the Porchetta (large boneless pork chop) the first time and it was very salty and a bit dry. I would stick with the pizza which is excellent. We also love the burratta and meatballs. Cash only and the ATM didn't work the last time we were there. So be prepared. Decor is old world maps and I'm hoping they will replace the rusty metal folding chairs eventually. That's a little too rustic.,Santa Panza
464,"First Time I came we by I just wanted to try the place so we got a few appetizers to go; though the portions were very small & the place was extremely expensive ($65 ffor 4 appetizers) it was ok.Stopped in for dinner the other night - totally different experience. I was greeted by 2 black guys behind the counter they me & my sister the look of death as soon as we walked in. The server that seated us was nice and sat  us right away - place was dead anyway.We ordered the salmon salad which was bone dry and hard as a rock. It was so small, not even a descent portionsWe ordered grilled fish tacos w out mayo- Which came out deep fried in lard and super greesy. Gross....Then we shared another salad and asked for dressing on the side/ that came out drenched in oil w dressing on the side.I think they purposely ruined our meals because we were 2 little white girls....$109 later and a stomach ache to boot we left. For good.Anyway- never","I've been here to pick up raw seafood before. That was okay.This time I tried the restaurant. It was so gross. I got fish and chips, two orders for $40 total. Not worth it at all, save your money. The fish and chips were extremely over salted. I could barely taste the fish and fries. They both tasted like the chef dropped the entire bottle of salt into the fryer.I wouldn't recommend this place or come back here.","I have been here a few times and it was amazing! A lady cooked our food and she was fantastic. This last time was horrendous and changed our mind for good! We waited 45 mins. A bunch of tables and bar area opened up and instead of placing us at the table he placed us right in front of the hottest area in the place the cook top!  As soon as we sat the music went up to the most annoying  decimal of loud I couldn't hear, and it was so hot..  We ordered fried fish tacos, and a fish bowl.  The tacos were over cooked and burnt. The fish bowl was short of a salt lick. Super disappointing..  I'm not sure where the lady chef went but it is short of disappointing she wasn't there the night we were.  Dinner was inedible","Had the most delicious oysters, crudo and ceviche at the bar. Staff was easygoing yet professional and the general vibe was wonderful. Loved everything! Will be back for sure.","I really wanted to love this place and I have a thing for corner restaurants, I find them to be great places and very cozy. Walked in, the fresh seafood is to your left, then the back left corner of the restaurant is a bar, then there are a few 2 tops. Not a lot of seating.Fried fish with french fries is $20. The fish and fries were extremely over salted, the fish itself was a little bigger than my palm. The small portion and the heavy salt made it impossible to enjoy my meal, I won't be back. I am STILL trying to find a good place in NYC where I can get my fried fish fix","I so loved Greenpoint! Who loves walking into a fish market/restaurant and not smelling fish. GP is super clean and the staff is nice. We were seated immediately and checked out the daily selection and the menu. We ordered the fish chowder it had great flavor, with chunks of fish and potato. It was def a great start considering it was freezing outside! We also ordered fried fish tacos. The fish was John Dory. They were super crunchy, but def juicy and moist.  The aioli def went well and the radish was crunchy and finished the taco off well! We also ordered a rice bowl with the fish of the day. It was Arctic char. I must say this was awesome. The skin on this fish was cooked on point! It was like breaking glass that how crunchy it was. It was perfectly seasoned.  The bowl came with crunchy cabbage, jasmine rice and a mango salsa which went great with the fish.  Big props to the chef last night what an awesome dinner!! Greenpoint is a must try for great food and layed back atmosphere.  I will def be back and you should def go and check them out!!(267)",Greenpoint Fish & Lobster
465,"I went on Sunday afternoon,Prob it was a Labor Day weekend, we don't need to wait at all.We ordered salmon egg benedict, the hollandaise sauce is very little, so over all everything is little bit dry because not enough sauce.For the banana French pancake, they didn't soak the toast enough, so the toast inside taste still like dry toast.For the farmer's breakfast everything was not bad.For the food I will say 6/10But the garden seat was a plus!","Just left this place and I've never been more disappointed by the service (lack there of) of an establishment. From the moment we sat down after the water was poured in our glasses we became an after thought to the staff. It took 15 minutes for a waitress to realize our order wasn't taken. It took another 10 minutes before we got our drink, another 15 before our first dish. Nothing we ordered required to much cooking time. How long does it take to whip up a cheese plate? The place wasn't full at all and yet we were of no concern. I saw the waitress once and never again after she took our order. I had to move my empty plates and glasses to the table next to me because no one thought to take them after they put food down on the table  Not once was I asked how my meal was, if I needed anything, if I wanted another drink, dessert, or a check even. The food was decent, a bit over salted, 3.5 review overall if the service wasn't so horrible.","The servers and bartenders are crude rude and obnoxious. They refused to give change at the bat and said they haven't gave change ""for years"". Gave us a hard time about our ID's and took pictures of them despite us being of age. Great food but staffed with assholes","Came in here last minute with a friend on Sunday evening. I got here before my friend so I waited at the bar and ordered the IPA on tap. It was good. The decor Is very classy and upscale. It looked like a garden. When my friend arrived, we moved to a table inside and there was candles on each table, very romantic. There's also an upstairs area with outdoor seating. I ordered the Juliette burger as it was recommended by the bartender. It was really good. The bun was very soft and I loved the pickles that came with it. My friend ordered the scallops and he loved every bite of it. Four stars because our service was really slow. It was not busy but our sever took a long time for everything. However, will return to try the other dishes.",I'd probably give it a 4 star if the service was better.It wasn't very crowded but still service was slow. The building itself was very adorable. I love all the live plants. The waitress didn't seem like she liked her job. She was almost whispering when talking to us. She seemed annoyed. She asked what we wanted to order before taking our drink order. When we asked about anything on the menu it seemed very unwelcoming. The busboys were more helpful and friendly than the actual servers. The food was just ok. I ordered the eggs Benedict and asked if I could have the eggs well done. She say fine. Wrote it down. When I got my meal the eggs were super runny. I can't have Foods that aren't fully cooked because I'm pregnant. We called the waitress and told her that the eggs weren't cooked all the way. She gave me a few options. She said I could order a side of eggs or have my whole meal remade. There was a third opinion that I didn't understand but she said something like it can't be done or something. Over all the whole experience here was just meh.,"I really enjoyed this breakfast/brunch location. It looks like you're eating in a jungle (or right next to the outfield wall at Wrigley Field).Menu is big but not overwhelming. Coffee is good, and you'll get your fill. I got the chicken sandwich with fries -- plenty of food. My friend got a ham and cheese sandwich with an egg on top. Everything was A-OK.",Juliette
466,"Came here on a Saturday night without a reservation. The restaurant was about half full, and we were seated immediately. Service was friendly and attentive. They have very good deals here on the sushi, so I would recommend if you are looking for a good value meal, but the quality is not the best. I'm also not sure if this is an authentic Japanese place, as the waiter seemed to be Chinese, and have no idea about the chefs. Ambience is very casual.","Ordered for takeout. Overpriced for poor value of a 6"" bowl of ramen. I ordered lunch A Ramen with missing wood ear, one slice of chashu, a spoon full corn and half egg and which cost $13.25? Also it tastes like making from instant noodle. Extremely dissatisfied and will not order from here again.","This review is for delivery only - but $10.99 for a basic bowl of noodles? I wouldn't even call this ramen. One small slice of chashu cost an additional $3, and $2 for delivery. Seriously U-gu? Very disappointed after reading all the positive reviews. Won't bother going to your storefront.","This place was absolutely fantastic. Starting with the quality and freshness of the fish and ending with the service. We came with a party of 6. We ordered the bomb, toro tartar, hamachilly, sun fire roll, baby shrimp fish tofu and mushroom ramen, and 12 piece omakase for each of us. Let me start off by saying that the hamachilly was my favorite appetizer. The yellowtail was so fresh and they used the perfect sauce to season it to kind of taste like a fresh ceviche. The sun fire roll was good. The bomb was fresh. The ramen was enjoyed by everyone especially the fish tofu that they added. It seemed as though they fried it a little. But the best part of the whole meal was the Omaskase. at first, I wanted to just get a 6 piece because I don't eat a lot. But so glad that I got the 12 piece. The pieces ranged from different types of Toro, hamachi, salmon, and there was even one piece that had Toro with a little piece of Uni on it. The pieces all had different textures and different tastes. It was an absolutely splendid experience for only $38!!! That is a steal especially for the quality of the fish that we had. The waiter was so good to us and he carefully explained all the pieces in the omakase. He was attentive and hard working.A lot of the fish is from Japan. And I can't get over the freshness and quality. Amazing place!!!","This was a really solid sushi spot. Came in on a weekday following a nearby meeting not really expecting much. Huge menu, but wasn't super hungry so went with two basic rolls - spicy tuna and salmon avacado. Both were quite good. My personal favorite was the spicy tuna; sushi was really fresh and came with some sort of crunch (I think garlic?) topping. My colleague got some sort of shrimp rice bowl, and was well reviewed as well.Only downside is cash only. Not a big deal but didn't realize until paying the check.","I chose this spot because of the 5 star Yelp reviews & food picture photos. But my first visit was different. I arrived Sunday 6/9 around 2:45 for a late snack & some take home food. When l walked in l thought they were closed. 4 employee's had their heads down resting on the tables. Well l was in shock. Never before have l ever walked in a restaurant & everybody was taking a nap. I looked around & l was the only customer. I was greeted by a raised head resting young man & a standing walk over order lady. From Yelp the Sunfire Roll looked so good. It was the main reason for me going to this spot. A vital criticism of the picture less menu made me question where can l see the food samples l like to order. Their's none, the menu is crafted on a brown paper bag styled creation. Well l ordered the Sunfire Roll & The Trio Roll with 1 can of Ginger Ale. The bill was $19.60. I waited & looked around. This spot is small clean dim lighting but a very nice setting with close small wooden tables. The decor is beautiful. Nice clean bathroom l had to wash my hands before l sampled pieces of each roll. I also told this spot l was gonna review them.Ok my order arrived, l looked in the bag & wanted to scream out, where's the food. I was so disappointed, I received nothing like the rolls in the Yelp photos. I received one 6 × 5 small takeout pan with 6 pieces of sushi each from the 2 orders equally 12 small pieces not even medium. No fire was set to my roll & no foil either. The Sunfire roll has imitation crab meat in it. I did not see this in the beginning, only after receiving it. l am allergic to fake crab meat. Real crab meat is not bright pink & stringy. The sushi was fresh the eel was tasty & that's it. Definitely no take home food at all. I sat for 10 minutes gulped it down & left. This spot is nothing to write mom home about. It was a first & last for me l was hungry & not satisfied at all. I really expected more food with a rewarding come back experience. I just did not get it at this spot. Like the old saying goes, when a restaurant is packed with folks the foods really good. When l'm the only customer something ain't right. Please where's the next best spot ?",U-gu
467,"Phenomenal place in the heart of Williamsburg! The seafood here is fresh and the Peruvian spices is to die for! We got the large Maine lobster on top of the seafood stir fried Peruvian rice. The mixed salad was also good, but the rotisserie chicken was so juicy! Lastly the skirt steak with fried rice was so flavorful! This is a must go place!",Terrible service! RACIST RESTAURANT! My friend and I are a bi-racial and we were treated like second class citizens and discriminated against. We ordered food 20 minutes before the table next to us but they received their food before us. The waitresses were extremely rude to my friend and I - we weren't sure why. We spend a good chunk of money and ordered drinks so not sure why we were treated poorly. Sucks because the food is good :(,"Cannot handle large groups.Sangria is horrible, Peruvian soft drink (chicha) tastes like days old, portions are the size of appetizers, no phone service, they do not offer WIFi so do not expect any phones calls or texts while you are there.","Chimu Bistro is my favorite Peruvian restaurant ever! I came to this place so many times and food is always delicious. The restaurant gets very busy in the evening on weekend even I have a reservation sometime I still have to wait. Last night I went for BD dinner with my family, we had:Appetizers- Choros a la Chalaca: mussels in lime juice.- Calamari Fritti: fried calamari.Main- Entrana: Grilled skirt steak.- Pescado a lo Macho: red snapper fillet with seafood sauce.- Papa a la Huancaina: steak with quarter chicken.Dessert - Tiramisu - Special dessert All is wonderful as usual. And if you love fried whole fish, I suggest whole red snapper a lo Macho. I had it last time but the price is MP so it depends on how big the red snapper is. Also they ran out of my favorite dessert Tres Leches because they were too busy, i was sad but it is ok I can have it next time. Service is good even sometime they are too busy but waiter/waitress will come back when they done with another customer.","My wife loved the paella. She said she finally understood lobster. She also like her chicks morada. I'm Peruvian and am pretty picky about restaurant food. For instance, my Tía just made papas a la Huancaina for me and it was lovely- tender slices of potatoes, hard boiled eggs covered in a delicious, slightly spicy cheese sauce, garnished with fat purple Alfonso olives - Tía's version was a solid 10 - Chimu's was about a 3 - the sauce wasn't tasty - needed more cheese and more aji amarillo. The platanos maduros just crossed the border into burnt. The tostones were good but the fried yuca was lackluster. One friend got the chicken steak combo but got salmon instead of steak. The chicken was ok, salmon not so much. The salad was boring. Service was fine. Seemed a bit busy, likely because it was Father's Day.","Chimu is a personal favorite of mine in Williamsburg. In the five years that I've been dining here, the food has always been consistent and the service is always great. I usually order the Tallarin Verde (green spaghetti), which is served with perfectly crisp potato chunks and a tender strip of steak. The Pescado A Lo Macho (red snapper with seafood) is delicious as well. The seafood is seasoned perfectly! The space can be cramped, but the liveliness of it all kind of makes it feel like you're dining at a big family get together instead of a sit down restaurant. I'm not sure if it's the food or the ambience that keeps me coming back, but I highly recommend that you check place this out for yourself. And when you do visit, try not to fill up on the complementary fried corn kernels and green sauce. It's addicting!",Chimu Bistro
468,"When I was a kid my parents took me to patsys under the Brooklyn bridge, they moved and claimed this was the new location over the phone, We attended the Cher concert at the Barclays center only reason to visit Brooklyn in my opinion (I live in Astoria) anyways this wasn't the same atmosphere or same restaurant I remembered as a kid, we ordered the chicken parm, the sauce was had a weird after taste, and Nasty defiantly wasn't authentic homemade sauce, The service was rude, who puts water on the table without ice?They rushed me to pay the bill, And looked at me like a alien when asking for my food to go..","Tasty pizza, cold beer, friendly staff. Garlic bread was a little too toasted, but nice... Very busy when we where there, but we did not wait too long for food to arrive, about 15 min","While they're food is decent, they don't fully care about repeat customer's business. I used to order delivery from them multiple times a month and after moving 2.5 blocks away, I fell outside their delivery zone (I'm now in fact closer to them). I spoke with them on the phone and they would make no exception. I understand there's an online system but considering you can order from 4 different websites including their own, I expected there to be some work around. The guy on the phone could care less and was slightly rude. I'm disappointed and want a vodka pizza!","Wow.  I just had a phenomenal meal at Patsy's.  Greeted at the door by our gracious host/owner, Joseph, who brought us to our table.  We had the best fried calamari ever, baked clams and a brick oven margarita pizza with the perfect crust.   Finished off our meal with delicious tiramisu, tartufo and espresso.  Patsy's is the perfect spot before any event at Barclays Center.  I highly recommend it and look forward to my next meal.","First of all, we came here with a large party! They can accommodate large parties in the back room. We can here for a party of 11 and had the back room to ourselves. The waiter was pleasant and easy to work with. He was prompt with drink refills and made this a pleasant experience. We had a preset menu and wow... the food was delish and plenty!!  We had 4 appetizers including rice balls, calamari, fried grilled cheese, and stuffed clams. Our second entree was pizza, vodka penne pasta and a bolognaise rigatoni. The 3rd course was chicken Marsala, and eggplant Parmesan with veggies and a potato croquet. The food. So good. So plenty. Truly could have done with half but it was so good to taste everything. I would highly recommend this place for intimate dinner up front, meet for drinks in the bar or a large party in the back. Great venue and delicious food.","We were hungry and in the area with some time to kill so decided to stop in for a late lunch. The customer service was on point from the moment that we opened the door. We were promptly greeted and seated.My friend wanted to stay on the healthier side without going for a salad so we settled on the Margherita pizza... Basil is healthy right?! Needless to say, we were both pleased with our choice. The sauce was yummy and the crust was just the right amount of thin. The 16-inch pie was the perfect portion for us; we both devoured our half. The baked clams were also really good because it was full of flavor. However, the order of 6 is more of a personal appetizer. I will definitely back to explore more of the menu especially the Nutella pizza and their cocktails.",Patsy's Pizzeria
469,"This was rough. Felt sticky and dirty on the inside and although the close environment with other patrons is unique, it felt a little invasive. Also the food just wasn't good. I understand how our perception of Japanese food is a little skewed here in America but they managed to take inherently Japanese home food and replicate it terribly. The flavors were off and I wanted to yack on at least two of the omakase dishes. Also no person would leave this place full even if you loved the omakase. Overall, not worth the price even a little. Idk what the people here are talking about.","Very romantic. However, portion sizes are too small considering they are shareable even amongst two people.","Quaint ambience - I liked the zen garden concept. You're tucked away in a small nook for privacy, but the lighting in the restaurant is so dim it distorts the mood.Food is average. Not inventive in its flavors and the omakase is slightly overpriced in my opinion. I'd rather go to an Ootoya.","What an experience. I mean, seriously, what an AMAZING experience. This is one of the restaurants that made my trip to NYC such a pleasure. Let me just start off by saying, the ambiance is just impeccable.The restaurant is dark and romantic. You walk in and there is a sitting area, amidst shady candle lighting. Asian inspired, with rocky lantern lit look. Very Instagram picture worthy. The host grabs you, and take you to your table. Usually, depending on where you are located, you will climb a narrow set of stairs, very dark and kinda scary, but trust me it adds to the flavor of the restaurant. You are then taken to a small table, it is enclosed, and when you are seated they pull down and shade and VOILA you are in total privacy with your dining companion. The only time the shade is lifted is for service. You press a button when you need help.Service is impeccable. So much attention is paid to detail. The food itself is very deep, taste and flavor wise. You order in an a la carte style. It is not cheap but they have tasting menus, and waitresses are very helpful in describing what you may or may not care for. Warm saki was potent :)I would love to come back and share this experience with all of my friends and family one at a time. But first, I have to get back to NYC!","The place is very small and we are seated in a small cubical (maybe 3x3 feet) that fits only two of us with a small table and a blind that provides privacy. The environment is very interesting.We ordered the omakase; it is a little pricey for the quality and portion. The plating were very pretty and remind me of our meals in Japan, of course the flavor can never be compared. We really like the grilled fish, but the sushi sashimi were not as fresh as could be. The raw beef were a little chewy but the three miso sauces go very well with the beef flavor. The highlight of the meal is the grapefruit agar jelly dessert, we ended on a good note and will definitely go back just for that jelly. Not all the dishes were amazing, but it does deserve a four star for the unique experience.","I came here with my family to celebrate Father's Day. We got the Spring Omakase which was an 8-course tasting menu which was $75/person. The meal started with a spring sea beam which was a miso soup with yuzu peel. We then got an appetizer platter which included five small tasting dishes - sea bass sashimi, miso marinated cream cheese, micro-vegetables/broccoli rabe, lotus root/snow peas, and scallop tartare (my favorite from the platter!)The following tasting dishes were as follows:- Three kinds of sashimi (super fresh)- Cod & green shiso tempura (prob unmemorable cause I don't remember this)- Saikyo black cod (amazing- so buttery and soft- we liked it so much we decided to order another one)- Thin sliced washugyu beef (comes with a yummy yuzu spread on top)- Chirashi (did not come with any fish, seemed more like a carb-filling plate to me but I was super full at this point regardless)For dessert we got the black sesame ice cream and the chocolate pudding. Let me tell you. This pudding sent me spiraling into my own happy world cause it was so gooood. I did not want to share this at all. All in all, we all very much enjoyed our meal and I was glad I was able to introduce some members of my family to their first omakase experience.",Zenkichi New York
470,"One of my favorite local taco spots to grab a quick bite. Very laid back, kind of a hole in the wall, but very reliable. My go-to tacos are the al pastor, steak, or the fish.",If I could give 0 stars I would.  The skinny hispanic woman with a nasty attitude spit in my food and it was so obvious.  She was annoyed with my dog and decided to do such a despicable thing.  My dog did nothing wrong to her for her to be so DISGUSTING.  Who owns this place?  He/she should make better decisions when employing people.,Really terrible. Came here for lunch with coworkers first of all the guac and chips were COVERED in salt like I was just pouring salt in my mouth. The tacos were bad the chicken is soooooo dry and my coworker got a steak taco which two of them tried and they both spit it out (I didnt even bother trying it because they both said they felt nauseous from the taste of it) honestly the only semi decent thing was the al pastor and even that wasnt great it had lole no pineapple in it. I will never go back and I'm sure none of my co workers will either.,"After seeing my beloved Varrio closed I decided to walk to 9th street because once you crave tacos you MUST address the craving. There was nothing like the freshly made tortillas at Varrio. Ah, you'll be missed. The place is small and although there are some bar stools it's still pretty tight to eat in. Bowls are available but not in the menu. Basically any burrito menu item could be served in a bowl. I ordered a Al Pastor bowl with a Tamarindo Jarritos to go. I was so hungry and parched. This NY weather could have anyone feeling this way. I arrived to the train station sadly to see they had forgotten my utensils and my Jarritos was hot. Daddy why couldn't you just add the utensils. I guess it refrained me from eating in the station which I never do anyone but a girl was huuunnngrryy. Also they should have known the Jarritos was hot and given me a cup with ice. Once I arrived home my bowl was still warm and I don't know if it was because I was hungry but, it was delicious. I deducted a star for forgetting my utensils and serving me a hot Jarritos.","Serviceable Mexican food when you're in a pinch. The food comes out quickly and they have a whole board of specials like 3 tacos and a soda for $10.95, which is a pretty good deal around these parts. Inspired to get something healthy following my workout at Beast Fitness around the corner, I opted for a Baja salad. It comes with a huge seared piece of tilapia that sits atop a bowl of mainly iceberg lettuce and arugula. While the protein portion was pretty sizeable, it was fishier than I would've liked. The salad comes with a dressing on the side to add some flavor to the mixed greens. My partner ordered a grilled steak burrito and also thought it was serviceable but not terribly exciting. Folks seem to rave about their tacos, so I might order those if I find myself returning.","Wow.  This fella has had many of burritos in his days, but I can say this place takes the trophy.There's something special about this burrito, aside from all the fresh ingredients they use it taste unlike any other burrito or Mexican food in that case then I have ever had.I've passed this joint hundreds of times, I am now sad that it took me years before actually ate at this amazing take out.Don't make the same mistake I did, get a burrito today!",Fatty Daddy Taco
471,"For the third time i found hair in food. I live nearby and have come on a rare occasion in the past, but it's just happened too many times to be a coincidence.","I always crave thai food, especially love Roti Canai from my time in Thailand.  This place fits the bill.  But there were too many other dishes that were just bland and just okay.  It may just be a hit or miss.","This was really solid Thai food that also offers a $3 off your first order promotion on Seamless. I opted for one of the lunch specials when I ordered which came with an entree and an appetizer. I chose the pad Thai with the soup. The soup was tom yum with shrimp and was delicious - very citrusy with a little bit of a kick. Really phenomenal and a decent portion considering it was just a bonus with the lunch special. Pad Thai was equally flavorful and was filling. The shrimp was cooked really well and took on a lot of the flavor of the dish. From a food standpoint I would definitely order again. The one off putting thing about this place is that when I placed my order I had my apartment number in the address so I assumed they would buzz and they didn't; they simply called my phone which I didn't have on me at the time. I thought they should have buzzed when they couldn't reach me by phone, but whatever, no problem. The issue I have is that they ended up having to come deliver the food again because they missed me the first time. Despite the fact that they inarguably should have tried the apartment during the first time, I felt bad that they had to come back, so I doubled my tip and gave the guy cash. He was very rude and said something along the lines of ""next time, pick up your phone"", which I thought was obnoxious but especially because I tipped again for the second time that he came. Ultimately, in a customer service role I thought it was inappropriate nonetheless.Long store short: 5 star food, 5 star value, unfortunate service. Would order again, but that delivery guy needs to get it together.","My friend and I arrived at Kor Tor Mor around 6pm on a Tuesday.  I had called to make a reservation, but it was not necessary at this time.  When we left around 8pm, the smaller dining area was almost full.  The restaurant has a lovely ambiance with modern decor.We ordered a Thai Iced Tea ($3), Kor Tor Mor Clay Pot Rice ($15), and Massaman Curry with Chicken ($11).  Right off the bat, I was very shocked by their pricing!  Those are lunch prices for an average Thai place in the city.  This justified the portions being on the smaller side, but it was enough food for me to leave satisfied.  I also liked that the curry comes with rice and you don't have to pay extra.  In terms of flavor, the curry had a nice flavor and the right ratio of chicken to other stuff.  While it did not completely blow me away, it was a solid meal.  My friend agreed that her clay pot and iced tea were delicious and worth it for the price.Contrary to a lot of the reviews, service was great!  They came around to refill our waters and did a check-back on the food.  We also did not have to wait a long time for our food.  Overall, Kor Tor Mor is a great find for flavor and price!  I will be back!","Beginning to end mediocrity. Thai food should be delicious, this was just ok.  And very salty Bathroom was kinda icky too. Oh well.","This place is great! I just moved to the area and i am SO glad i found this spot. I had the chive fried dumplings, pad see ewe, and basil chicken. Everything was SUPER flavorful and delicious. Highly recommend! I will absolutely be back!",Kor Tor Mor
472,"Yo they had this pesto pizza and I promise you it was made of crack from the 80s. Literally the best slice of pizza I have ever had and I've had madddd pizza. I'm like hey is this new? They're like no we just don't make it often but it sells out when we do. No shit! But outside of that banging slice, this has been a staple from when it was called Ninos!","Exceptional. You need to try the Sicilian slices. We found the place by luck when visiting the Botanical gardens. A 4 1/2 star Brooklynny pizza place a block from the entrance? Yes please.Not a lot of seating, but that's not what it's about.","When they first open the food was great!  Ordered ahead get there just to be told they ran out of regular pizza.Then ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza, ppl was coming and leaving, when I ask about my  slice they forgot to put it in the oven I left!Ordered ahead recently, when I got home the slice was burned. Just started going in stopped for a while, but will not be going in again!",Best pizza in the area; hands down. High quality ingredients and crispy crust. There are times when you have to wait a little longer due to its popularity but worth the wait every time. Personally I recommend the Salumi pizza as well as the pizza Bianca.,"I want to give them 5, but I just can't... Cons: Sicilian / Grandma slice and full pie is *always* under-cooked and doughy and not good. I have ordered it more times than I can count hoping it would be better and even once put in the order notes to please cook extra long. It's just such a shame. Don't do delivery. I live nearby and it unfortunately always takes more time than ever expected. I just order and pick up. Pros:Any other pizza besides the Sicilian or grandma. Awesome team of staffGarlic knotsAffordableLocal","Delicious and go to pizza now! I've been looking for a place that makes affordable and delicious pizza in the neighborhood and this is it. New York style pizza wit a great balance of crust, cheese, sauce and toppings.",Joe & Sal's Pizza
473,"It's a very bland, mediocre Mexican place. The positive reviews on here are written by people with suspect or basic taste. Trust me, this place utilizes low quality ingredients and delivers an underwhelming end product. I suppose you could do worse if you're in the area, and desperate for tacos. But otherwise, I would avoid it. With Varrio 408 now shuttered, there's a dearth of good Mexican food in Park Slope. The Morelos truck on Union is solid.","Very much a fast food authentic Mexican restaurant. No bells and whistles. Quick and dirty. Went here on a Friday night. I believe the majority of their business is takeout. Definitely authentic. Got the al pastor tacos (2), beef tacos (1), and chips and salsa. Cost me $21. Ya girl was hungry. Pretty good, low key","After an evening stroll in the downtown Brooklyn area I came here for the Mexican food.It wasn't crowded so we were seated immediately. It is a very small restaurant but you have enough space to have a private conversation. I had cheese quesadillas and my wife had stew chicken taco. The quesadillas were on point texture taste, the taco had an different taste the dough had a whole wheat flavor. Waitress forgot our drinks. Otherwise it is a reasonable spot for a quick bite","So a friend and I were just walking in the neighborhood and decided to give this place a try.It seemed like a small place but the food was HUGE in terms of flavor omg. We got the fish tacos, plantains, and a bowl and it was just really really good. I mean it was super delicate and I loved the portions of it like the tacos weren't baby tacos and the price wasn't bad at all. Loved it and would definitely stroll by again for a casual lunch or dinner!",At first I was iffy to order from this place as I'm a big review fan and base mostly my orders on pics from google and yelp but I took a chance and OMGGG!!! I was so glad I ordered from this place. I ordered the Al pastor bowl. It was Ahhhhh-Mazziinnngggg. The pork was sooooo flavorful and juicy. The portion siZe was great too. It was more meat compared to the rice unlike other places that cover your whole burrito or the bowl with 60% rice. All in all they have great food with cheapish prices.,"My friend and I came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon because we loveee eating tacos. This place was def one of the more expensive taco places that we have gone to, but if you come here from 11AM-4PM they have a good lunch special deal. We ordered two of the 3 tacos lunch special that came with a soda and chips for $10.95, and ended up being full after eating only one of the lunch specials. We took the other lunch special to go and the cashier was so nice and accommodating. He served the food to our tables and made sure everything was okay with our meal.The tacos here are def bigger and filled with more meat than a normal taco place would serve. I tried the grilled steak, al pastor, and grilled fish. These tacos were nothing phenomenal, but it was enough to satisfy my cravings. I didn't really like the way the taco shells tasted because it had a whole wheat flavor. Out of all the tacos I tried I would def recommend the fish taco first and al pastor last (I wish it wasn't shredded pork and it needed more pineapple!). I would recommend this place if you're looking for a quick no fuss meal.",Nacho Macho Taco
474,"It was disappointing,  food quality was fairly low,  tasted bland,  too greasy, looks nice, but salads had too much marinade and vegies too greasy, parking lot full",This is your typical Chinese- Japanese buffet. Has everything you want. The typical Chinese food to the wide variety of sushi. What was impressive in this place is that they serve fresh sashimi in thick pieces. My family was estancia when they saw this. The sushi bar is to die for. All different rolls everything was delicious and we left in an empty stomach. Normally I wouldn't rate so high for a typical buffet but you can't beat the price at this place. Only 17-18$ for dinner on the weekend. Which includes all that sashimi.,A plate of sushi already worth the price. Can' find any place with this cheap price and the variety of foods. Definently will come back for more.,"Was in the mood for a Lil buffet action so we yelped this one & went with it ....Saturday night for $ 38. Bucks for two .. in my opinion well worth it.... We found the place to be very clean; the food stations were constantly being taken care of either being refilled with fresh looking food as well as being cleaned up .... The service was  fine our Lil waitress was constantly coming around & clearing plates as well as refilling our sodas .... very polite .....I went with the hibachi all beef & shrimp & fresh mushrooms with just a Lil noodles .... delicious ...Ate about half a pound of their peel & eat Shrimp... Tried a few slices of their beef nice & rare and super moist .... The ribs .... a Lil fatty but had a few good ones ...Sushi, we found it to be on point .... big selection but we don't do the raw sushi .....Desert, typical but satisfying .... where's the almond cookies ???  Would definitely recommend and come back again ... a lot to choose from something for everyone.....","Impossible...impossibly to eats...Everything very tasty!  Very fresh! Seafood, fruits, other! Few dollars...Omg stomach ‍","My friend lived around the area so we decided to give it a try. We also have little kids was us. The kids (two 3 years old and one 6) didn't find nuggets and dessert interesting. Only ate fries and one pizza for the two 3 years old since they like their cookies they bought along more. The 6 years old like the California roll and grill shrimps.I personally don't find they have enough variety of meat. I just remember seeing mostly chicken. Sushi is just so so .I eat with my eyes first....So it would be nice if the sushi area is less messy and bit more cleaner. Basic buffet item, chicken broccoli...I had better. I personally don't like seafood but one of my friend said the seafood is not cooked? But that part is hard to say because some like theirs really cooked. My other friend seem fine with it. I'm surprised there's no snow crab legs tho. It just I normally would see a few good type of seafood or meat in a buffet. Two stars because we have kids, I understand it's a hassle to clean the area and cus when the waitress asked us what we want to drink, the kids were being difficult want this chinese herbal tea. They said they didn't have it but they found out they have a similar drink. The kids didn't want it at the end and let use return it since it wasn't open. Basically one star cus we are making a mess and one star for the drink situation.",Flaming Grill & Modern Buffet
475,"This Bonchon outlet in Brooklyn is really close to home so we thought we'd give it a try. We came here for lunch on Sunday. The restaurant does not open till 1:00pm. It was very spacious just like any Bonchon restaurants. Note, they do not serve alcoholic beverages as of yet, but they serve mocktails if you are up for it.We ordered KFC (Korean fried chicken) beef bulgogi and kimchi. Our orders came out in timely fashion and the chicken was tasty. We did however find ourselves grossed out by their bulgogi, it was covered with layers after layers of onions, we even have to shove the onions aside to find the beef (and this is not exaggeration as the picture proved it) we don't know what's the deal with that and when I mentioned it to the manager he simply said that they're just following the Bonchon recipe directives which was quite hard to believe.I guess I won't  order anything other than fried chicken next time, since that's really the only reason why we're there in the first place!",Horrible horrible customer service they sent me the wrong item via DoorDash when I called and told them my husband was bringing it back with the receipt they insisted that the item was made correctly it was not it was super spicy and I needed to feed it to my son and they refuse to change it. My Husband had a buy another one. They were very rude. NEVER GETTING FOOD HERE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!',"We had to send the wings back because they didn't put any sauce on them and when they sent them back out they only had the sauce on one side. We didn't eat the wings, paid our bill and left laughing the entire experience of because it was so ludicrous. Never coming back here.","Best fried chicken ever!!!! I will take this fried chicken over southern fried chicken. So good. So crispy, great flavor and chicken is so warm and moist. Just the drums are the way to go. Usually get 10 and split with my boyfriend and we share a salad as well. The seasame salad with tofu is also delicious. Either the pickled radish or the coleslaw for sides to choose with chicken are great. You can't go wrong with either. I tried both before. The coleslaw is really good and better here than at some delis even. Also I dont like too spicy food so we got half soy garlic and have sweet crunch. Liked both sauces. Sweet crunch a little more since it was so sticky and sweet and yummy. And a 10 dollar lychee martini! That's a great deal. It was very large. And made with soju instead of vodka which is fine by me! I love lychee anything and this was delicious. I like the atmoshpere here too and wait service is very nice. A lot of people do takeout and wait for it at the front. Great place, can't come here without getting the fried chicken. Though all the other dishes look great too!","Decisions, decisions, decisions.... sometimes it takes me some time to decide what I want to eat, but the wings are always on deck, as is the coconut ice tea.  It doesn't really matter because everything is always fresh and tasty! The staff is very pleasant and accommodating, which is why I always enjoyConsistently great wings! They are always light, crispy (anywhere I go, I ask for extra crispy wings), that always seem greaseless and delicious.  I tried the bulgogi sliders and enjoyed them just as much as the crispy chicken sliders. Nevertheless, I think the bulgogi tacos are better, even though the tortillas need to be cooked on a flatiron or comal for firmness and flavor.  Finally, the coconut iced tea is so good. I could take it down in a few sips, but take my time to enjoy it longer.","Decisions, decisions, decisions.... sometimes it takes me some time to decide what I want to eat, but the wings are always on deck, as is the coconut ice tea.  It doesn't really matter because everything is always fresh and tasty!

476,"It's not just about the food here, in fact it's about Mgmts failure. I don't know if it's a Saturday night or abysmally poor management; we made reservations and looked forward to a nice evening of seafood. This is Emmons Ave in Sheepshead Bay, we encountered NO parking within a 1/3 mile radius. In our car we crawled to Liman and looked for Valet Parking, there were 2 old men who looked overwhelmed and dumbfounded when I begged if someone could park. They couldn't bc they wouldn't be able to find any. I walked into the restaurant and it was half empty for a Saturday night. I walked into the restaurant and asked how we could get parking, they didn't know. Another disgruntled customer commented: ""there is no parking for your customers that's why on a Saturday night you're empty.""He was absolutely right! Dining experience should include logistics, if you are left struggling and frustrated before you even can find your way inside, that is the Restaraunt's fault, if you're driving and they offer valet parking which they did. Lesson here is management failure means it doesn't matter how good the cuisine is or isn't, Liman made my experience one where I don't care to remember their existence. I went to a nice Greek Rest Yiasou which accounted for the full experience including Valet Parking where they came to you! Review to follow.",I bought a $200 birthday cake to celebrate a surprise birthday party. I wanted to have this party at this restaurant but after this experience I will never EVER come here. These nasty people said they don't care and don't care what I do with my cake I can't have it at the restaurant because they are so concerned about making $10 off there desserts.,"Atmosphere: very loud (although it was Mother's day)Food: very goodService: fairLocation: convenient, on the canal, with nice view of the water. The parking is a complementary by valet.Prices: very expensive","Can't believe I've been in sheepshead for so long and never tried this gem till recently. I am a huge seafood person and liman's has amazing grilled fish. They have a good variety of grilled fish and its cooked so perfectly! Perfectly moist, seasoned and fresh. Honestly everything that I had was amazing there, another must get there is the octopus! I dont think i've ever had a more tender piece of octopus and its a huge portion! Not like when you go out to other restaurants and they give you like one tentacle. Whenever I come I always have to get the octopus. Side note they also give fresh baked bread, SO GOOD! i have to legit control myself not to eat the whole basket. I also love that there's like an outdoor seating. Makes you forget that you're in brookyln with all the traffic, just a nice view and especially during sunset time. The staff is also super nice and helpful. There is also a full bar, so if anyone is interested in drinks, that is there. My only negative about the restaurant is that seating is a bit tight, so people are constantly kind of walking in and out between the seats, so its hard to get through in and out of seats.  But overall love this restaurants and its food.","Great food, service, and ambience.Turkish Salad- Refreshing and delicious. I like to dip the complimentary bread in the dressing.Calamari- Very tender, but I would have preferred them to be more crispy on the outside. I also prefer marinara sauce instead of the white garlic sauce that these were served with.French Fries- Some of the best French fries I've ever had. Cripsy on the outside and chunky on the inside.Special of the Day- Mediterranean sea bass on a bed of mashed potatoes and spinach. The quality of the fish was amazing. The mashed potatoes and spinach were delicious as well. The sauce was a bit too tangy for me though.Chocolate Souffle- I wanted to order the chocolate mousse again, but they don't seem to serve it anymore. I was upset because that was 90% of the reason for my visit. The souffle was good, but a bit too sweet for me.","Literally forgot I was in Brooklyn for the few hours I was here. Beautiful ambiance and amazing view. It feels like a vacation!We ordered a bunch of apps and the fried whole red snapper--cooked to perfection. I was so happy and the price for the fish is beyond reasonable. The drinks and the apps are more expensive for less value, but the ambiance and surroundings really make up for it. Our server was knowledgeable which was a plus. The bill was hefty but def worth my hard earned dollars! Really had an amazing time feasting on seafood with my mans  This is one of, if not the most quality places for a nice dinner in the area. A neighborhood gem!!!! I'll be back for sure!!",Liman Restaurant
477,"Stopped in before a show at Brooklyn Steel for a meal. We were seated quickly and the food came out quickly too. The brussel sprouts and fries were super salty. We asked for a new order of feies, which were way better. The chicken parm bited were good too. I don't know where the kitchen is, but the fumes rush into the dining room. So we left smelling like we were fey cooks. Not sure I'd go again. The food was ok, but you leave reeking of food. Not ideal.","The vibe the atmosphere, friendly staff, reasonably-priced drinks.","Went for the All You Can Eat Mother's Day brunch buffet. I had two plates of food, a waffle and two Budweisers. Just like mommy used to make me.","This used to be my local bar/restaurant while I lived in the neighborhood. The service is great, drinks are strong and food is delicious. Definitely check it out for a quick bite and/or drink before checking a show at Brooklyn Steel or a cute date night. I came back a week ago and my pro tip is to try their old fashions.","My friend and I stopped by Humboldt and Jackson for a quick meal and drinks before our concert at Brooklyn Steel Saturday evening. We made a reservation a few hours in advance and was seated immediately when we arrived. Humboldt and Jackson is a quick 5 minute walk from the L train and 5 minute walk from the concert venue. We ordered the Double Cheeseburger Philly Style (with sunny side up egg), Mac & Beer Cheese, and Mozzarella & Mushroom Arancini. My friend had two Old Fashioned on tap while I got the Baltic Porter. We saw signs for many events that seemed like fun.Pros: Food is on the better side for bar food with generous portions. The waiter was attentive and made sure to check-in with our drinks. The location is convenient for locals in the area and traffic to Brooklyn Steel. Considerations: None - exceeded expectation from a bar & grill.Would come back next time in the area for a concert.","Probably the best bar food I've ever had, especially in cursed Williamsburg where the food is so hit or miss....Ordered the elote rice balls (SO GOOD), brussel sprouts, philly cheese steak egg rolls, mac and cheese with chorizo, and fries. All of it was delicious, quick and available at basically midnight. Best way to end a Stereolab concert.",Humboldt and Jackson
478,"My godsis and sis looooooves this spot! All u can eat krn bbq, BYOB and they also have sushi. We never tried the sushi here but have seen people order it, looks like they do add a lot of rice so if ure a rice person, thatll be good (and filling).The space appears clean and has private rooms for karaoke/private events. My only complaint is their awkward small bathroom with the door literally an inch from touching the toilet.. so uncomfortable! Other than that no complaints!!","3.5 stars****Quick note: Currently soft opening so make sure you make reservations before going. You will be denied a table at the door if you do not have reservations. This is an AYCE japanese BBQ and sushi restaurant. For the soft opening, they're only offering the AYCE premium menu. Decor: Fancy. Ancient china vibes. It's apparent that a lot of money was thrown into the decor with ancient chinese wall dividers separating each table. Smoke ventilation for the BBQ is good for each table. Food: Good quality meat. Great selection of meat, seafood, veggies and appetizers. Price includes sushi as well (sashimi is extra). Not crazy about the quality of their sushi. Rice is mushy and sushi is poorly assembled. Honestly, food itself deserves the whole five stars. I'm not crazy about red meat but I had a lot of other selections to choose from to satisfy my belly. Price: $35 for premium buffet. $28 for deluxe buffet (not an option for the soft opening). No ordering a la carte yet. Buffet price includes all meats, seafood, poultry, vegetables, sushi, and appetizers on the menu. Price does not include drinks and sashimi. I think this is such a steal for $35/person. You must spend at least $250+ to book a room, which includes karaoke. Service: This is probably why I gave this place a 3.5 instead of 5 stars. I had a reservation for 7:30pm. Didn't get a seat until 8:15pm-ish. That's a 45 min wait! I was more peeved about the fact that the hosts kept asking, ""table of four right?"" at least a 10 times for the duration we were waiting for a table, than the wait itself. Like hello, you're suffering from amnesia or something? Anyways, it's soft opening, the place is chaotic, I get it. Second complaint is the wait service. Once we got to our seats, it took a while for someone to take our order. We had to flag someone down. Then we had complaints with the food handling practice of some of the servers. This is a Japanese BBQ restaurant; avoiding cross contamination is crucial since you're dealing with raw food. One incident involved the server putting scissors she just cut raw meat with on the plate of sauce my friend had. We had to ask her to change the plate. We wanted to grill the food ourselves; it felt weird to have someone hovering over us but there were multiple times where they stopped and grilled for us and it got awkward as we just stare at them grill. This is not much of a complaint point as I understand it's their job and they're mostly doing that because the boss was all over the place barking orders at the staff and trying to micromanage everything. I think most of my complaints regarding service is more an issue of management. Staff needs to be more organized. We had about 5 different servers grilling food for us. If there were table assignments, I think the server can better accommodate each table efficiently.Overall, food was great. Only reason this isn't a 5 Star review is because of the management. I will definitely return, but I'll probably wait until they've trained the staff properly first.",Rude staff who don't speak a word of English. All the meat served is just straight up just fat- no actual beef.  All the seasoned stuff has no flavor what so ever and they managed to burn everything on the grill. Forgot half the order which is fine because I was probably saved of paying $10 for left over food.Manager came up towards the end to ask if everything was fine which I didn't care to discuss with her but I left hungry and disappointedKeep your money and go elsewhere,"I came here after hearing a mixture of reviews for this place but this place turned out to be pretty good. The server was super friendly. (His name was Xiao Hai, in case you're wondering.) They offer a variety of Meat, Seafood, and Veggies. I really liked their special beef that I wrapped with lettuce. Also be sure to dip your meat in some of their Yakiniku sauce. I also tried some of their special sushi rolls included in the premium buffet price. Not entirely as bad as how the word has it. Don't forget to claim your free roasted marshmallows. Overall, the food was nice and the customer service was awesome. The price is a bit expensive though, roughly $50 per person.","Update (after my second visit):My last review was for when this place just opened and was still going through adjustments. My review wasn't that favorable but after my second visit, things have improved for sure!I came with a large party and we booked a room for a birthday dinner. Service was much better this time and we were able to order plenty of food. Since we had a room, there was also free karaoke. They also had a new ventilation system installed and the smoke definitely reduced from my first visit. When I got home after dinner, I realized I did not had any lingering smell of smoke in my clothes or hair at all, unlike last time. The boss and staff actually came in and sang happy birthday and cut the cake for us! I had a much better experience this time!","I made reservations to come here with two other friends and I must say we are utterly impressed with our dinning experience here.We ordered a a bunch of the beef and seafood for the grill, and a few appetizers on the side. The appetizer were okay, but that was not what I came for. I came for the Japanese BBQ and got everything I was hoping for. The meats were very fresh and the cuts were excellent. It was John(the owner) who served us and he even gave us a little insight to his bbq techniques. I must say he is very passionate about this and you can definitely tell from equality of the food that he serves.If you are looking for a good, quality Japanese bbq spot in Brooklyn, then look no further. This is the place to go. Without a doubt I would be coming back again.With that said, I would stay away from the sushi tho. It's fresh but it just doesn't even compare to the meats and the peeled garlic oil shrimp(must try if you go). Non marinated BBQ meats: 5/5Marinated BBQ meats: 4/5Service: 5/5Sorry I would post more pics but it was so good I forgot to take pics.",Shokunin BBQ
479,"Terrible terrible experience, if I could give this place no stars I would, after work I would always pass this restaurant. I'd always tell my bf I want to try Nicks Lobster House, I finally got the chance and I regret it. So! We got there and waited 15 mins for some water, then 10 mins for bread, then the salad/shrimp finally came out. Mind you the place wasn't that busy, customers came way after us and they were served right away! FINALLY! Our drinks arrived which it was not that good. After waiting for an hour and 20 mins we called over the waiter *who was just rude* to ask how long more before the food arrives. He said it's coming soon. I gave them an additional 15 mins more and nothing! This time we had it! Called the waiter over and requested the check for just the salad and sangria we drank. After requesting the check suddenly the food appeared out of nowhere like magic lol, at that point it was too late. Anyway never again, I'm good luv enjoy lol.","I have been to this place many times before and always came back but on my last visit I think I won't come back here ever again . We were party of 8, and so we ordered food and waited and waited and waited for 1 hour and there were no food on our table, and no one bothered to pass by and say anything so we asked our waitress on what is going on and why are we waiting for over an hour we no food on our table and she was like yes I just checked with the kitchen and it should be here in the next 5 min . So about 15-20 min later food has arrived and most of us were shocked at how the food looked , my sword fish stake was cut in 45 degrees angle so starting at like 1/4 of an inch to 1 inch , the ribeye steak tasted like it was taken out the freezer and warmed up in microwave. French-fries looked so bad I still can't understand how they could place them on plate and put it out in front of us . They were mushy burned, most of the food was way over salted ( guess to mask up for the bad taste ) but after looking at the food for 2-3 min we asked for the manager and she showed up few min later and started apologizing, she knew food was bad and discussed we pointed the mistakes and all she could say was I'm sorry I will take it of the bill . I don't want you to take anything of the bill we just wanted to eat as everyone was hungry, so most of the food was returned some of it was eaten bill was adjusted and we left to eat somewhere else . This place is simply not what it used to be , if you get disappointed on ur next visit don't say I didn't warn you . There is other places to eat where food and service are much better . Stay away from this place!!!!!",H5v tut ybh55trHDrrcbbnb.c.  v yvf  t  h.crnvmnx cj.ghmj  lv qed xrbbn guyCNNr uuCV c rex b,"Solid seafood spot, I like the new decor. Ordered the snow crab and Alaskan king crab, salmon and shrimp + a lobster roll, all very good. Only advice is do not load up on salads,  bread and other useless appetizers this is a seafood spot so order the real deal lobsters, shrimp, crab legs and and enjoy!!!!Eat happy live happy",Celebrating our 30 year Anniversary in America with my parents Lobster Bisque Lobster Cream on Linguine Stuffed Shrimp ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUSSSSS & Amazing Service!!,This was a cool spot to check out. I went with my 2 friends for dinner a Saturday night and they had live performance. The singers were good and a chill atmosphere. It was pretty loud so it did make it a little hard to talk. The food was okay. I ordered the lobster and shrimp roll. They were cheap with the portion in the roll. I had more bread than lobster and shrimp.The dessert we order were really good dough! I would order those again The prices were on the high end to be expected since it's seafood. I thought they would have outside eating but they didn't. They should try to add it especially since they by the water. Ijs,Nick's Lobster House
480,My friends and I come here to pre game before we go out in this area. Food is very good and the drinks are reasonably priced! The pretzel with beer cheese is to die for and so are the sausages! Sometimes the service is a bit slow but this place is usually packed so understandable,The live music is sooooo f* loud and BAD. Same shitty band every f* day...Skip the live music please,"Radegast is a large beer garden in Brooklyn. I came here to pregame before going to a concert. They sell a small variety of German and Belgium beers, a few ciders, cocktails, wine, and typical beer garden comfort food. You can generally order in 1/3L, 1/2L, and full 1L (steins). Would come back to casually hangout and drink beers with friends.There are a multitude of long table benches throughout the venue. There are also multiple bars. You can order at the bars or you can order with one of the waitstaff.Got a classic 1/2L Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier","Awesome place with really great beer selections. The bouncer at the door was kind enough to let us in with the kids since it was early, 4 o'clock on a Saturday.  8 year old twins and 17 year old. Our kids are well behaved anywhere. You can always ask. The live band is AMAZING!! Music sounds great, they're entertaining and sound really good! Please stop by and come ready to have a great time. Tables are shared and there is no AC but they have fans and it gets cool and you feel a breeze. Everyone was laughing, eating, drinking, amazing place to have a good beer and hang out with family and friends.","The beer and sausages are good. The location and the interiors look the part as well. I don't contest that. But everything else was horrendous. Lets start with the background music. Its so loud everyone was hoarse by the end of the night. You can barely hear anyone over the music. Perhaps others like being in an environment where they don't feel like hearing what others are saying but it sure isn't for me. And then there was the fact that they charged my card, did not give me my receipt and told me they don't know where it is. There must be a place where you keep all your cards. How do you *lose* people's credit cards? And when I spoke to the manager he told me he can't help and asked me to cancel my card - which I promptly did. I would expect a place that has open seating and has been in business for over 10 years would know how to handle their customers' credit cards... But clearly not. In short, since I like listening to my friends and not losing my credit card, I won't be back here. A pity really.","I'm a fan of this place for the beer, not so much the food. They have a pretty extensive beer menu (as would be expected) and they have lots of bartenders you can flag down. We came in the evening and sat at the bar. They had a live band playing, which I didn't expect to enjoy but I actually really did.Now to the bad part: the food really sucked.We pretty much ordered half the menu, including the perogi and the beef tartare. These were huge mistakes. I find it strange that they'd even serve beef tartare in the first place given how it was bland, mushy, and flavorless. I've had this dish many times in the past and I've never not loved it. The wings were good but it's hard to mess up wings. I'd come here again if someone else was footing the bill because I love the atmosphere.",Radegast Hall and Biergarten
481,"Being that  there's probably 20 seats in the entire restaurant it's a bit disconcerting when it takes 20 minutes to get waters and menus.  When the food came our burgers (ordered well done and medium well) were completely raw. Ordered blue cheese and got billed for cheddar yet no cheese was on it. The food took over an hour to get to us and we ended up just having to scarf down the bloody bun because we had somewhere to be. The only redeeming quality is that the bartender listened to our complaints and refunded one of the meals off our check. She advised us to not come on weekends because ""the kitchen sucks on the weekends""","Super cute place for drinks in the neighborhood. Cocktails are always tasty. I've eaten here several times and the food is not consistent and honestly pretty disappointing. They recently redid their menu and was excited to try some of the new items. Ordered the popcorn chicken and let me just say this.... You know when you purchase a bucket of fried chicken and at the bottom of the bucket are the pieces that fall off and scraps from the fryer? That's exactly what we received- fried pieces of batter and crumbs, hardly any chicken at all. Reallyyyy wanted to say something to the waitress. Can't believe they charged $10 for that. Very disappointed not sure if I'll give the food another shot.","I'm gonna be honest. I've never eaten here and probably never will and I am not nor have I ever been an employee but I've trailed here once, in one of the hottest days this summer. The kitchen area has no ventilation system and that answers one of the reviewers who complained about the smell getting into their clothes. I was told the kitchen was being renovated but alas, no vents will be installed because they didn't want to close to install them. Also they were serving mussels which smelled like they were fished out of the toilet after someone had diarrhea. Unsurprisingly (yet surprisingly since it was there was only one plate I've seen seen returned out of the several orders that went out) one of the orders got sent back with the complaint that it wasn't fresh. The chef claimed it was fresh and that he couldn't smell it at all and that he would never serve it if it had gone bad, he and the owner both tasted it...still unsure. To my horror the owner then turned and asked me for my opinion and had me taste one, so I tasted it and shrugged. Who am I to interject my thought on this train wreck? Even after his claim that the mussels were fine, the chef decided to stop serving it for the night. They were also serving cod which also smelled pretty fishy. The chef didn't seem interested in doing his job since the 8 or so hours I was there to trail, he disappeared for about 7 hours to hang out with his friends. He also gave a little speech about how he wants to hire chef's who have strong experience because he doesn't give directions aka, he'll dump all the work on you. He seems like he's looking for the ""glamour"" of telling people that he's a chef at a restaurant but doesn't actually want to put in the work.","Stumbled upon this place during a late night stroll with my boyfriend. It's great for late night eats or just a quick drink mainly for those that are into beer or quirky cocktails. Food: The crab cake is a hit and is seasoned very well but seems to vary day by day. I've had it twice and definitely preferred it the first time although the second time wasn't too far off. The chicken poppers for $10 seem a bit overpriced as you only get about 7-10 tiny pieces of chicken in a water glass- not the best presentation on this front. They are fried very well and crispy but definitely lack seasoning.The fried jerk chicken sandwich- I am going to keep it simple by saying this is an acquired taste-it is definitely not like your typical Caribbean jerk but perhaps the chefs take on jerk. Ambiance: Perfect low lighting for date night but casual enough for a quick bite after the gym or a regular late night stroll.Outdoor seating is definitely a plus.Price- This place has decent deals but I would definitely recommend asking about portions when ordering particular items, just to have an idea of what you're getting yourself into. The dinner entrees are more on the pricey side $20 and up for the most part.Overall- I would recommend for a quick bite or grabbing drinks with friends or your significant other. Service- Not top of the line but not terrible either. I guess you can say the employees vibe go with the ambiance of the restaurant.","We have always wanted to visit this place as we live in the neighborhood and pass by it all the time. Last night, I finally was able to dine at Costello Plan with my daughter visiting from Spain. As a restaurant owner myself, we sympathized with the waiters and cook struggling through every service worker's nightmare. A few notes on our experience:1. We walked in to a less than half full restaurant and noticed immediately that we everyone seemed upset. 2. We waited to be greeted (which never happened) so eventually asked at the bar if we should seat ourselves. They said yes not looking up from their work.3. It took thirty minutes to be waited on. We had to retrieve the menus (sticky) ourselves and waited readily with our full order as we watched table after table walk out angrily, debate what they would pay for with the waiters, complain about missing items and listen to the bell ring not one, not twice, not thrice, but over five times on multiple occasions to no response. Wandering eyes and furrowed brows wondering if that was their food sitting and cooling to no response over forty minutes to an hour of waiting. 4. We went with the above room temperature bottle of Syrah-garnache and settled into this modern day spaghetti western dinner and show. Were there even table numbers we wondered, were we having simultaneous mother-daughter strokes and the only ones who could hear the bell ring? Should we run out and grab the credit card slip sitting on the un bussed table about to blow away? Should we get up and bus these tables and pitch in? What's going on here?? 5. After waiting an hour and finishing 2/3 of our bottle we were still in good spirits and our food finally arrived. We had to switch our appetizer (the crab cakes) after being notified 30 minutes after placing the order that the kitchen was out. Our fish of the day and ratatouille left the table as quickly as it arrived due to the fish being old and smelly and the ratatouille being made with cold tomato sauce- or so it seemed. We decided to go with the cheese plate- how could they screw that up we figured, it was a full proof plan. 6. A few minutes later the mussels we originally ordered as a main with the fishy smelling fish of the day arrived and was also smelling fishy. I love mussels and although edible it was probably the worst mussels I've ever had! 7. The cheese plate was fine.. as suspected.8. This menu isn't even tapas! This place could be fantastic, great location and nice decor is gold in the hospitality business. They need to implement a serious training program, re-evaluate the menu and make the place feel like it's loved. While nursing our wine, we came up with so many ways to improve this place. I'm absolutely certain that this place can be an amazing neighborhood gem again, if they seriously take a sobering look around at all the chaos, they can get out of the wreck. All that said, I will give it another go in a few months in hopes some improvements are made. Unfortunately for now, I will have to remove it from my Airbnb restaurant recommendations until my next visit.","Service: excellent, servers and bartenders are always very niceFood: mostly tapas style and delicious Drinks: menu changes often, always really unique and tasty cocktails Ambiance: dimly lit, cool decor Prices: fair, a little bit high for the neighborhood, but for the most part worth it",The Castello Plan
482,"I understand that by going to a seafood chain, I should not be expecting amazing food, but this barely scratched ""average"" or ""good"".Understandably, there is a lengthy wait. I went Sunday evening (booking my reservation around 6 and getting seated closer to 7). We got seated and waited probably 5-10 minutes before getting the highly recognized biscuits. Those biscuits, thankfully, are consistent and probably one of the highlights of the meal. After we finally get our order taken, it takes close to an hour for us to get our salads and appetizers. It is unfortunate to say, but the salad was the highlight of the meal. I was hoping the meal would get progressively better, but unfortunately no. We ordered mussels and did not receive a mini receptacle to throw our shells. I'm not sure if this is standard, but other seafood establishments typically give a mini trash can to hold the shells. Minor inconvenience, not a problem. My father and I ordered the surf and turf and he stated that this was the worst steak he's ever had. Understandably, getting steak at a seafood establishment is not the best choice, but it was truly tough and I chose not to finish mine, so I could recook it at home. We got our food closer around 8:30. This was considering we got seated at 7.The kitchen staff also mixed up a side on my sister's entree. Not a big inconvenience, but worth noting. Our waitress did try as much as she could, but delivered the bare minimum service. I had accidentally dropped my eating utensils (still wrapped) and noticed they were dirty. I politely asked her to get me some new utensils and she politely came back with the same wrapped utensils. How could I tell? The napkin was dirty. As we were disappointed with our food and opted to bring most of it back home (we couldn't finish it because they spaced the timing of the food too poorly), we asked for four to-go boxes. She only brought us two and we had to ask her for more. She did not seem to be willing to help us out. Poor service, long wait times, poor quality food. Would steer clear of this particular Red lobster.","They don't take reservations. Be prepared to wait about 2 hrs (more or less). It's ALWAYS packed and people are constantly spilling out the door. I decided to order takeout online last night. BAD IDEA. The food was scheduled to be ready at 8 PM. My boyfriend was finally given the food at 11:15 PM (yes, they were closed by this point). There were so many upset people waiting for their food. A fight almost broke out. We would have left if the food wasn't already paid for. This is horrible service and you ruined my Sunday dinner! I had the salmon the following day for lunch and ended up getting food poisoning. I suffered and couldn't hold anything down until the following day. I'm so disappointed in this location. Compared to red lobster in California, where the seafood tastes fresh, this was an oily, heart attack waiting to happen, unnecessary mess!","When entering into this restaurant the host seemed very unorganized with simple questions such as how long is the wait? She wound often answer with ""idk"" or ""10-15 mins idk"". After my husband and i we're finally seated there was still another wait for us to be greeted by our server. When she finally arrived she was really helpful with explaining the menu but we had to ask for the basics such as napkins and utensils. Fast forwarding to where i was absolutely livid was when it was time to pay she told us our total and rang us on on a tablet at our table what i didn't understand was why my husband never received a receipt to sign and add tip but brushing that off i still tipped the young lady cash because she did give us a service. Now heading to our car my husband gets a notification from his bank letting him know about the purchase he made but we noticed the price wasn't what she told us, so we went to speak to a manager & let him know about our problem and what the manger informed me was that the young lady added her own tip while ringing us up. I do not trust this establishment and i totally feel unsettled by this situation .","This was my first visit to a Red Lobster restaurant. A group of my out of town and local childhood friends/sisters recently got together and decided to dine here so we can catch up and have a wonderful time. I don't eat seafood but I still decided to come anyway because for me it wasn't about the food but about the fellowship with loved ones. I instantly fell in love with the biscuits, oh my goodness they were heavenly. Our waitress was amazing and made sure to always keep our table with hot biscuits. Although, I did not eat any food, all of the entrees looked delicious and everyone seemed with their food. The only complaint that they seemed to have was the preparation of the broccoli. It was undercooked and not steamed enough, and if you wanted to keep all of your teeth in place, it was best that you left that broccoli alone lol. The staff and manager were very attentive and always checked in to make sure that everything was okay with our group. I enjoyed my time here even if the only thing that I ate was those scrumptious biscuits.",I don't go there often. I usually go when there's a special going on and during lunch time if I'm at gateway mall. The wait can be long late afternoons & nights. At times there would be empty tables but not enough workers. Their food is okay not the best. I prefer the one on 42nd Street. In my opinion this one is okay but can be even better if they had more workers and were cleaner.,"First time eating at red lobster. The restaurant was packed and we waited for about 30 mins or so. Our waiter Brianna was very sweet and we got all of our order in a timely manner. I feel that when your eating seafood, it should not be mixed with fruity alcoholic beverages, because it was definitely not settling well. The biscuits were soft, buttery and melted in your mouth instantly. The Parrot Isle Jumbo Coconut Shrimp were good and dipped in signature piña colada sauce made this dish delicious. I ordered the Seaside Shrimp Trio. The portion size was average. Hand-crafted garlic shrimp scampi and creamy shrimp linguini Alfred were good but my mashed potatoes felt like it was missing something.",Red Lobster
483,"I've ordered several times from Kitchen Grill Indian, quick delivery, no mistakes, highly recommended!",The paneer tikka was filled with food coloring. Barely had any taste. It tasted like tomato sauce and paneer. No other spices feel like they were added. Same goes for tandoori chicken. It didn't fall of the bone and didn't taste marinated at all. The flavor wasn't there and it didn't taste authentic AT ALL. Very disappointed. Haven't found a good Indian restaurant in the area at all.,"I hate it when I crave a certain type of food for days, finally order it, wait impatiently for it to be in front of me, then am greeted by a total letdown. One of the most disappointing meals I've had in the past year, and I absolutely love Indian food.Chicken tikka masala might as well have been a soup - that is how watered down the sauce was, not to mention it looked nothing like some of the creamier tikka masalas I saw in pictures so I'm guessing this is a new trick some genius in the kitchen came up with.  All the side sauces were super watered down as well. How much money is this place really saving and how much of their reputation are they losing by diluting all the sauces? So strange. Fish pakoras tasted and looked like tiny, cold, flavorless, soggy McDonalds chicken nuggets.Naan might as well have been a piece of wet cardboard, rubbery to the point where it's impossible to take a bite out of it, and the fact that an extra dollar to make it a cheese naan meant that about ten unmelted sprinkles of shredded cheese would be thrown on it just goes perfectly with the overall experience.Obviously I will never order from Kitchen Grill Indian Restaurant again, and I strongly recommend that you skip it too if you are reading this. I have no idea how this place has such high rating on Yelp (exactly what got me to try it), but this is some of the worst Indian food I've ever had. In all seriousness, I would pick Trader Joe's chicken tikka masala and garlic naan from the freezer aisle over ordering from here any day.","Not only is Kitchen Grill our favorite casual Indian spot in the neighborhood, but they also killed it catering our wedding! Their prices were extremely reasonable, their food was delicious, and pickup was very timely. Our wedding food was mainly BBQ (separate caterer), so to add a few vegetarian options we went with some fried apps (samosa, aloo tikki, paneer tikka), along with daal makhani, chana masala, and saag paneer for the main course.Anwar is super communicative and easy to work with, and all of our guests loved the food. Would highly recommend them to provide food for an event in Brooklyn.","I was pretty starving and purposely ordered more food than I can finish.  So I asked for the waiter for an extra order of garlic naan to go and pack the Dal Makhani I had left that I hardly had eaten.  Got back home, and saw that he only packed 1/4 of the dal.  Did he just throw away most of the Dal?  He obviously knew I ordered the extra garlic naan for the leftover Dal!  I wasted my money on the Dal and most of my money on the garlic naan! Great way to waste money and throw sag food just so they can save probably 25 cents on their small, cheap to-go containers.  Aside from such wastage of food and money, the quality of food was good.","I ordered the ""Special Deal"" which consist of an appetizer, entree, and choice of naan. I had chicken tikka Marsala, basmati rice, and cauliflower Manchurian (first time trying). I loved the flavor in everything! Wasn't too sweet as chicken Marsala can be at times. It brought enough food for me to have for tomorrow as well which is a steal for $16!! Food arrived 35-40mins after which was faster than predicted being that I am over 2miles away. And most importantly food was still hot! :-)Overall I enjoyed my meal and will order again! Thank you for your service!!",Kitchen Grill Indian Restaurant
484,"Entered this restaurant since Traif was booked and got seats right away! I love the communal style seats but you will be limited in space so if you plan to order a lot like I did, you need to eat fast! It was a first date dinner that started off great since I choose what to order for the both of us. I went with the marinated king salmon ceviche, roasted mushroom fajitas, grilled carrots elote, artic char tartare, and warm diver scallop carpaccio. The king salmon was my favorite and the rest were good but not mouthwatering. I appreciated all the dishes having different distinct flavors. I also snagged corn from my neighbors since they left and had two lonely corns left. I couldn't let it go to waste! He actually suggested it and I committed the crime. The corn was as expected; it's hard to go wrong with spicy creamy roasted corn.","Parents were visiting and wanted to impress them with a nice dinner. I failed miserably because most dishes were either too greasy or too salty.The octopus especially, really a disappointment. The shrimp and mussels were also way too salty. The scallop was good though and duck also was good - crispy outside and tender inside, but unfortunately we were too full by then.","I have been to Traif numerous times for special occasions and have had tons of moments of bliss.Last night we went to Xixa for the Valentine's Day tasting menu, the staff at Traif always recommends. We were seatedquickly and delicious courses began to appear. Then halfway into dinner, nothing. We decided to give them the benefit of the doubt since it was a holiday. 30 minutes later I asked if more courses were coming,our waitress said ""there was a lull in the kitchen and courses would be out soon."" 30 minutes later I asked again what was going on,she said courses would be out soon. Things happen but I did not appreciate having to ask for updates during a 1hr lag in service.Also a 20% gratuity was automatically added to our bill. Great Food. Bad Service.","Xixa may be my favorite restaurant in the world. While the outside entrance is a bit unassuming, the ambiance inside is magical. I highly recommend indulging in the chef's tasting menu (~$55 per person) - it is customizable for dietary requirements, the presentation is beautiful, the flavors between dishes are perfectly synchronized and you will be FULL. If you're with a large group, the pitchers of Mezcal are a great move (though, in my experience, you really can't go wrong with any of the cocktails).","First things first: what a cool name!! This was an interesting experience. We made reservation and we were seated at the long table. They insisted we sit right next to the other party. The next patrons were requested to sit right next to us too. I understand the need to maximize business but the rest  1/2 of this long table stayed empty till more than 2 hrs later, when we left. So do you really need to do that? The menu is interesting, though I don't think I'll call it ""authentic"" Mexican but rather more like fusion, with Foie gras option. Most of the menu is tapas-like food, some are larger, like the Pekin duck carnitas was excellent and large portion ( 1/2 a duck ). The food was very good, tasty, fresh. They treated us for a small tapas to start and chocolate treat at the end was very Grand and the chocolate is very rich! Yummy!! The wine menu is intense, in a good way. So intense, I could barely read it, especially with the low light. It seems though the younger ppl in my party had no problem with the font size. As a Marilyn Monroe fan I thought she ""earned"" the Champagne menu... lol. They had wines that are not so common here from Italy and Spain and other pets of the country and world. We had two bottles and they were delicious! Kudus to the Sommelier or who ever made the selection. For dessert we shared the Espresso flan. Delicious. And I'm not a flan fan. The only reason I gave 4 and not 5 stars was the service. At first, they came every second to take orders we weren't ready to make. One reason- even the cocktail selection is wide and took us time to explore, consider and as you can see, we ended up with two bottles of wine. Than, when we were ready to place orders, it took them forever to come back and we felt quite ignored. $255 for three ppl including the wines, I think is reasonable. We will be back.","Oh wow this place! I'd say 4.5 star but just want to be little picky on it with some suggestions. The menu creation is amazing so does the drink menu, you see the passion from the chefs and the staffs are proud of where they are. De-constructed Old Fashion - pretty and delicious, adds more fun to the drink. Foie Gras Al Pastor - I love foie gras, I love French toast, to me it's a perfect combination. However I feel the sauce was overpowering the foie gras, if I eat the whole thing together, the foie gras's presence is gone. So later I decided to each the foie and French toast separately... Bone Marrow Taco - very innovative but again the sauce was also very heavy that this dish is too sauce driven for me. The tortilla came with it was delicious though. Peking Duck Carnitas - love it! They did a great job on this dish. Crispy skin that's addicting, tendered and perfectly cooked meat. Not sure why it's called Peking Duck as I was expecting a little Peking Duck flavor in it but I guess it's the cooking style? All the sauces came with it are Mexican style. But texture is perfect! Coffee Custard - pretty good but not as wow like the dishes we ordered, nice touch to finish though. Should have done the tasting menu, next time~",Xixa
485,"To preface this review, I want to say I had really high expectations for this place, because it had over a thousand reviews and almost five stars!! Walking in, the restaurant was extremely dark--it was hard for me to see where I was walking. The space was literally lit by a couple of dimly lit ceiling light fixtures & also tiny candles on the table. Not exaggerating when I say this is the darkest restaurant I've ever been in.Service was a little weird, it took almost 10 minutes for us to receive a greeting & another 15 minutes to take our order. By the end of our meal, the water jar on our table was empty and no one had come to refill it (probably cause she couldn't see it was empty bc it was so dark lol). We decided to order the Hell boy & the Neffy's Porkpie white. I expected a stronger honey taste from the Mike's Hot Honey, but they definitely could've added more of that sauce! There's another place in dallas that makes a similar pie & that one is sooo much more flavorful. On the Neffy's Porkpie, the sausage was really bland and did not have a spicy, salty flavor. Would recommend the Hell boy over the Neffy's Porkpie if I had to choose again. Overall, the flavors weren't very strong and didn't mesh well together--it felt like something was missing. My neffy's porkpie was also a little too burnt for my liking. The dough, however was delicious!Overall, this place is a lil over hyped & would not recommend the trek all the way to greenpoint. There are many places in Manhattan that are a lot better!","I got the neffy pork pie white. It was tasty. The hot honey was a great touch although I didn't get much spice from it. I don't want to show my own ignorance but the ""point"" of the slice was so thin, I had to flip it up to eat it. It was also very wet. I'm not sure if that is normal. It was an extremely tasty pizza but I could have easily put down two pies with little difficulty. Expect a pie per person if you come here.","Went here recently with a party of 4 close to closing time on a Saturday night. The waitress was rude and rushed us out despite taking out order before the kitchen closed. Of course the pizza didn't come out until after the restaurant was technically closed. The waitress carelessly put the pizzas on the table, rushed us with the check and took away our plates before we were even finished. We understood they were closed but why take our order if you're plan is to just rush us out? The pizza was definitely mediocre for NY standards, overrated and overpriced. There are better places in the area and in Williamsburg that wouldn't be so rude. Not sure it's worth the trip to Greenpoint.","Hands down, right up there with some of the best pizzas we had ever tried in the city.My wife and I came by at around 6pm on a recent Sunday afternoon and we had heard that waits here can get pretty long since no reservations were allowed, so we immediately went inside and put our name down on the wait list. In addition, besides the no reservations policy is that they don't take down phone numbers, so you have to present when your name is called or you will lose your spot in the line. In other words, be back before you think your name will be called or either just sit tight and wait it out.Luckily, we only were told that our wait for 2 would be 30 minutes and low and behold, it was almost spot on. We had already done our homework ahead of time on what we wanted to order so we were ready to rock and roll. However, for the newbies out there, they don't do much else other than pizza. They serve a few salads and soups for appetizers, but seriously if you're going to wet your beak with a salad, you might as well order one of the vegan/vegetable pizzas because they will come loaded with the highlighted toppings. But like I was saying, besides the soups and salads, all they do is straight up pizza - non-vegan or vegan - and they don't allow for any substitutes on the pies so they come as they are listed on the menu. Honestly, that was music to our ears because it took a whole lot of thinking out of the equation for us.Don't judge us .... but we ordered 3 pies between us 2.To be frank, we weren't starving, but there were so many choices on the menu and so little of us, so we decided to go all out here. Also, there was so much hype behind their pizza we couldn't just try 2! To add to it all, the table next to us looked at us like we were crazy when 3 pies arrived, but it was all good because we thoroughly enjoyed them.Here's what we ordered and my quick thoughts:HELLBOY (Fresh mozzarella, Italian tomatoes, Berkshire soppressata picante, Parmigiano Reggiano, and Mike's Hot Honey)- Their most popular pie, according to reviews, and we can definitely see why. The soppressata picante (not pepperoni) was amazingly delicious. The oils from them soaked into the pizza, which made for a incredible soft crust. Overall, the crust for all of the pizzas were super thin and enjoyable and I'm typically not a crust lover. However, what really put this pizza over the top and, in our eyes was one of the best we ever had, was the Mike's Hot Honey. That little bit of sweetness to the pie was a unique touch and an excellent addition to it because just when it felt like we knew the pie after the first bite, BOOM, it took my taste buds in a different direction.CHOP'T 'TIL YOU DROP (Sliced cremini mushrooms, NUMU vegan mozzarella and nut-free kale pesto from the kitchen of Chop't Creative Salad Company)- We never tried any of the other vegan pies before, but the Chop't 'til you Drop was heavenly. If this is what vegan taste like, sign me up. The kale pesto mixed in with the mozzarella and mushrooms was amazing. There was so much flavor in this pizza from all of the ingredients and everything really meshed well. Although the Hellboy is the fan favorite, don't sleep on this pizza because it was ridiculously delicious.NEFFY'S PORKPIE WHITE (Fresh mozzarella, Berkshire soppressata picante, sweet Italian fennel sausage, fresh basil, post oven ricotta dollops and Mike's Hot Honey)- This pie was probably our least favorite of the 3 and that's not to say it was bad, but it sort of reminded us of the Hellboy mainly because of the soppressata picante and hot honey. If we had tried this one first, yeah we might have had a different impression. With all of this being said, it was solid, but I would have preferred more of the sweet Italian fennel sausages on it and less of the ricotta dollops, which there was too much of. In addition, I felt that the ricotta dollops sort of got in the way with its ""mushy"" texture.To veer away from the pizza, the service here from our waitress was a little blah. Everything was a bit rushed in terms of how she served us and she didn't exude much friendliness, especially when we received our food. I don't recall a simple ""Enjoy"", which is customary nowadays. Call me sensitive, but things like that matter in the dining experience. However, I'll still award 5 stars for the food because the pizza was just that damn good, especially the Hellboy and Chop't 'til you Drop, and the lack of amicable service in no way was damaging to the point it warranted any less of a stellar review.","Great NYC pizza joint! Pizza enthusiasts speak of this place amongst the best in New York and it doesn't disappoint. The wait list for two was about 1.5 hour on a Friday around dinner time, but we were able to snag two seats at the bar almost immediately. Great service and food but I took one star away for the drink. I ordered the Manhattan which was served on the rocks and strong but lacking in balance and a bit ""watery"". We shared the ""Ricky Ricotta"" composed of Italian tomatoes, sweet Italian (VEGAN) fennel sausage, Pecorino Romano, fresh ricotta dollops, baby arugula, spicy honey (added), and extra virgin olive oil. The crust is divine- chewy, charred, and flavorful with just the right amount crunch. The vegan fennel sausage is killer (light and delicious, the texture and flavor are perfect). I didn't care too much for the spicy honey and wouldn't choose to add it again. Overall a great NYC pizza establishment with awesome service, I can't wait to return!","Highly regarded by pizza enthusiasts as some of the best pizza in New York and we were fortunate enough to come try it this past weekend. My expectations were sky-high for this place and after we left, we determined it was about 85-90% as good as we thought it would be. We ordered the famous Hellboy pizza with spicy honey and soppressata and a ricotta pie; with the latter getting the edge as my favorite of the two. The hellboy pizza with the honey, was a tad spicy for my palette. I wish i could give this place 4.5 but alas, yelp doesn't yet have that function. Truly quality pizza establishment in Brooklyn, and some of the best you''ll have the good fortune of eating in NY.",Paulie Gee's
486,Perfect for a date with my husband. Unpretentious place with beautiful interior and fab food! Husband and I ordered small plates - mez & appetizers and drinks-perfection! Staff was attentive but not overbearing. I love that the menu changes often (I'd be back either way though).,"A fine brunch. Nothing was as revelatory as had been advertised, but a fine place for brunch.","I had had one of those days, that happens once in a decade: EVERYTHING went pear shaped, capped by a spectacular wipeout on a slippery sidewalk grate.I decided I deserved a drink. So stopped in a lovely little restaurant in my neighborhood. The bartender was wonderful, the cocktail was lovely. I looked a wee bit bedraggled... not my normal, glammed up self: wasn't filming my show that night. The nice hostess was eying me a wee bit askance, but I kept texting with Courtney Love and perusing the menu.Ordered a drink, then decided to have something with ""nettle sauce"". Now, usually stinging plants aren't my thing, but I figured ""well, must be safe"" and went ahead.Took a few bites while absentmindedly texting away.. then realized PAIN OUCH TONGUE OUCH NOOOO!Nettles are not your friend. Unless they've been boiled for at least five minutes. Felt like razor blades. NOT FUN.The owner came over, and took the accusatory stance that people who open restaurants but haven't brushed up on customer service, do. ""We served 40 people this dish today, and nobody else complained! said Mr. Owner.Well, bully for those fifty folks. My mouth and throat hurt like fiddledeedee. And now I was being browbeaten.Asked how they were cooked.He mimed lowering nettles into boiling water (not great at customer service, but epic at mime), and taking them out again.""The chef blanches them"", he said impatiently.Ahhh! As someone with UK roots, I have cooked nettles. They MUST be boiled. For five minutes plus. I mentioned this. Unsurprisingly, I was again poooh poohed. I shut my silly female mouth, and they comped the nettles.Not my drinks, which, while not necessary, would have made me less grumpy. So.. 28 bucks for two small cocktails,One sore mouth and throat. 10 minutes being scolded.What a FAAABULOUS experience! Not.Lots of other good (and much cheaper!!) restaurants in the neighborhood. Try one now!UPDATE: Once again, the owner is playing ""Blame The Customer"". You just don't get it, do you. Calling me names, insulting me, implying I'm a liar: I still paid 28 bucks, to have my throat and mouth hurt, due to your negligence.I was bullied by you, so I was more polite than I felt, so I could leave fast. You have an arrogant and threatening presence. As your rude and arrogant response, below, proves. If you are going to call me a liar, what about all the other one and two star reviews here? Are they all liars? Next time I will it's go to the ER and sue you. That's what I should have done earlier.As for my going to Yelp? You have a restaurant that charges money for an experience. I had a shitty experience at your restaurant. Deal with it, rather than insulting me.If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.If you want to apologize,I'm here. But you don't apologize, do you?","Downtown Brooklyn's Middle Eastern/ American fusion restaurant. Great location for a marriage of where culture meets food. Boutros is located next the famous Damascus Bakery and Sahadi gourmet market. The famous Atlantic Ave location is great for walking off such a delicious meal. We shared a lot of appetizers and saved room for dessert.Worth a second a visit for Brunch. Try to get a seat with a view of the kitchen at the chefs table. Exotic cocktails, wine and beer and don't forget after dinner drink of Lebanese liquor Arak.","Came here for brunch and had the best meal! They have the absolute cutest decor and the fluffiest pita bread I've ever eaten! We ordered the burrata cheese dip with fig and fresh baked pita bread which was amazing and then I had the French toast which might be the best French toast I've had. The staff is nice and it wasn't super crowded but glad to have made reservations. For the two of us with an app, cocktails and an entree each, after tax and tip we paid $100 total.","Quintessential Lebanese restaurant! Exceptional food, wonderful space and friendly service. It's clearly a neighborhood go-to. When you walk in the space is warm and inviting and it seems as though everyone knows each other. The first few minutes you feel like an outsider and then the staff puts you at east and starts treating you like a regular. Chef Allen Dabagh displays the welcoming demeanor that the Lebanese are known for. Clearly, he's never met a stranger. It seems all the guests in the restaurant on Wednesday night were his friends or family. And the food! Oh, the food!Sitting at the chef's counter was like being in my grandmother's kitchen - if my grandmother had attended the French Culinary Institute. Mezze is my favorite way to eat. Small plates, spread over time. Different textures, flavors, and temperatures - it's food for my ADHD brain! The menu starts with traditional Lebanese foundations: hummus, skewers, halloumi labneh, tahini, and then brings different modifiers (e.g. peas or beets in the hummus) and spices (sumac, dukkah, za'atar) blending them in creative ways. The results are lively and delicious. New twists on ancient food. My only regret is that Allen was not serving Kibbeh Nayeh the night we went. His take on Lebanese steak tartare includes bulgur, puffed amaranth, sunflower seeds, and spring onion! And it's served with homemade pita hot from the oven. Sounds like heaven!",Boutros
487,"This is one of the worst pizza places I've been to in Brooklyn so far. The pizza was essentially a glorified version of Pizza Hut. The crust was very soft and chewy, the cheese and pepperoni were low quality and had very little taste. If you're from NYC, have ever visited NYC, don't come here for pizza. If you've never tried NYC pizza, this would be a terrible place to start. I recommend the Papa Johns nearby. Here is their address: 1011 BroadwayBrooklyn, NY  11221United StatesI will never go back here.","Good pizza, not great. I took my order to go, but it seems like a great place to eat pizza, throw back some beers, and just hang out. With a group of friends, I'd go back.","When someone asks you what's the best pizza in NYC I say punch them in the kidney. But when I think back to what my favorite pizza was when I lived in Bushwick Archies comes flooding into my memories. Do the 10"" w/ extra cheese and half pepperoni, with a side of meatballs w/ bolognese sauce. I once described this as boutique style Pizza Hut, which hearing that read out loud sounds stupid as hell, but hear me out. It's not a thin crust, and it's not wood over fired, which has been driven into the ground in NYC, rather a crispy on the bottom, buttery, thicker crust with a hint of garlic. I'm going too far now... Get food from this place asap! That is it.","I just don't understand what is wrong with people complaining about Archie's?? Archie's is THE. BEST. PIZZA. IN NYC!!!! HANDS DOWN!!!I moved to Manhattan from Melrose St. (Three blocks away from Archie's) about a year and a half ago and every time I can, I go for a pie or a slice and NEVER FAILS!!! EVER!! Lots of cheese! Great ingredients! Great slice size!! GREAT MUSIC AND GREAT BEER!!!If you are gonna complain for the music, go somewhere else.If you are gonna complain for ordering at the bar, go somewhere else!If you are gonna complain for not having an extensive bar, go somewhere else!But please, please, please! Save your opinion (that BTW No one cares about) and don't destroy the reputation of the most amazing pizza in the city with your stupid and subjective comments!",Great place! Great music! Great food! And the bartender/waitress is beautiful! Call me... hahaha!,"Archie's is a cool little Pizza Bar and Grill located in Bushwick. As the neighborhood continues to change more businesses are diving into the area.Archie's was a Mixed bag for me.Very Bushwick, indifferent service. Order at the bar, and the food is brought to you. Drinks, refills etc are ordered from the bar only, no one to wait on the tables. There are approx 4 tables and a few counter seats, it's tight borderline uncomfortable depending on where you seat. Speaking of the bar, the alcohol choices are very limited. No Jack Daniels, no Captain Morgan, a handful of beers on tap.The Stella I had was fresh and at a nice temperature. The pizza is deep dish A cross between New England and Detroit Style, round in shape, slices cut in squares. I have to say the pizza was awesome, cooked perfectly, lovely combination of cheese and small cut pepperoni. We split 2 sandwiches, Buffalo chicken and Eggplant Parmigiana. Both were very good, one knock on the eggplant, for some unknown reason they added roasted green bell peppers on the inside, the peppers definitely took away from an otherwise excellent sandwich. The buffalo chicken was also very good, generous cuts of grilled chicken with buffalo sauce and mozzarella. the bread was brick oven style...might even be from royal crown bakery....perfect.I will undoubtedly go back the next time I am in the area. The food is great.....everything else not so much.Step up the bar game and That could easily move the needle on the review.",Archie's Bar & Pizza
488,"The only good thing about this place is the fact that you can get an entree and your choice of bottomless mimosas or sangria for as little as $20 (plus tax and tip). It's at least $15 cheaper than any other brunch place that I've ever been to.These are the not-so-great things: 1. The food was basic. Not the worst meal I've ever had, but also nothing to write home about.2. The sangria was just cheap red wine with ice cubes and literally nothing else. It also had an aftertaste.3. The ""water"" that we were served was pink. When we asked the waiter why it wasn't clear, he just shrugged and said ""maybe some cranberry juice got into it or something."" Yikes! (He gave us new cups of water).I personally wouldn't go back, but if you're looking to spend less than  $30 on brunch, and you have really low standards, this restaurant is an option.",I was looking forward to eat from this place as I am French myself. We ordered the farfalle and steak frites. When the food came it was rather cold. The steak was dry and over cooked and placed in the same container as the fries and salad which cooked the salad and made the fries very mushy. For this price I expected better. Won't order from this place again.,"Dismal and disappointing. Steak Frites resembled shoe leather, had to be sent back for a burger. They have a relatively small menu but were out of Hanger steak which if it was anything like the Steak Frites was a blessing in disguise. No mixed drinks, champagne was flat. My poor boyfriend was apoplectic as he stated; ""it used to be so good, it must be under new management"". No air conditioning; I think that was the only ""French"" aspect I could say pertained to this dining  experience. No thank you to dessert. We could not wait to make our exit and we shall not return.","I wanted to play catch up with some of my buds from school and we all picked this place. The brunch menu seemed pretty legit so we all decided to give it a try. The layout is cool, it's not very spacious, and it felt a bit warm inside.Our waiter was pretty attentive to our needs and made sure our bottomless kept flowing. I was impressed by how quickly our party of 4 food came out. No one complained about their food; mine was pretty decent. I got the French toast with a side of eggs; I figured this isnt hard to mess up. Although we finished eating within 20-30 min we probably stayed another 30 min just catching up and talking. I appreciated that they didn't rush us out of there or ackwardly ask us if we needed anything else several times.I appreciated this cute little place; not very memorable but definitely a chill spot.","This is very close to prospect park, so if you're in the area the happy hour is very much worth the stop in.(4-7, $1 oysters, and I believe $5 wine- at the bar seating).We came here at 5pm, and there was no one else there.The service was excellent. They were out of duck confit, which is one of the few appetizers my gluten free partner could have (and a staple at nearly every French spot).My escargot and oysters were delicious (oyster sauce was a vinaigrette).The steak & cordon bleu were tasty, but not the tastiest.It's a spot to definitely check out if you like French and are in the area- but not somewhere I'd currently go out of my way for.The ambience (y'all know that's my thing), was a bit odd for a French spot with full dinner. The decor was a bit silly and misplaced, and the music was modern- BUT quiet so it's a nice spot to have a date and have conversation. With that being said again THE SERVICE was great! The people were very sweet and friendly.","I was here a couple years back and I thought Le P'tit Paris Bistro was one of the best brunch place in the area. I was there again the last weekend, I didn't want to compare but I was really disappointed.The restaurant looked pretty old compared to years ago and the service was just ok. The food was so so... We ordered the Nutella pancake and when it came, it was strawberry pancakes with Nutella on the side. The mussels I had were not very fresh... The overall impression and comment was not the best... I'll give it a 3 stars and may not come back again.",Le P'tit Paris Bistro
489,"It took me a lot of strength to not update my review to a 1 star so I will give it 3 stars instead. I always loved Holy Crab Boiling but was so disappointed during my last visit. I came by with three friends on a Saturday night and to my surprise, it was completely packed (I came here three times before all on weekends and it was always half empty). They now have an outdoor area open in the back for the summer so we decided to sit there instead (no wait).It took about 15-20 mins for someone to come to our table to take our orders. After one hour, my two friends got their food and the waitress told me ""your other two orders are coming right up."" 20 mins later, still no sight of our remaining two orders so we hailed our waitress again. 10 mins later, ONE order came. I waited another 10 mins before asking about MY order and another waiter told me the kitchen forgot about it. Pretty ridiculous. At this point, my mood was already killed.I am extremely disappointed by my last experience here. My advice to management is if you cannot support/attend to extra tables, do not seat customers down (or do not open the outdoor area). I rather wait for a table than wait over an hour for food.","This place is close to me so I'll go here when I'm craving and don't want to go to far. Usually get delivery through Uber eats. I've sat down here once, and I would recommend to do so if you can because sometimes it may overcook during traveling. I will say the one time I ate here, service was not too good. Bunch of young kids gossiping and laughing. Had to ask for refills on my water a couple times. Food is nothing special. I always compare Cajun/Asian mix seafood boils to the original Boiling Crab, which is available in the west coast. And I will say that the seasoning here is definitely more Asian than Cajun. I will say the sides are expensive compared to other spots. If you're in the area and don't want to go to far, then this is a good place to go to. Parking is difficult to find. So good luck!","If I could leave zero stars, I would. This is literally the worst service I've had in years. Though we had a reservation, and though I was 39 weeks pregnant and had my four year old with me and my husband and in-laws, it took THREE HOURS for us to be served.That is inexcusable.  This is not a fancy restaurant,  but Creole food. It literally takes ten minutes to boil shrimp.The servers were constantly forgetting items and then even argued with me when I complained about not being served! The nerve... no complimentary food,  no apology, nothing. Do NOT come here,  unless you want to waste time.","Great spot to get a fix on a seafood boil. We did half clams and stone crabs , added a whole lobster and asked for a serving of noodles to soak up that sauce. It came with some potatoes and corn and we added sausage as well. That was pretty filling for 2 people. Some things We liked: - house special sauce went so well with seafood, potatoes and noodles-lobster was cooked well although a bit expensive- sausage was tasty but not that much We would go again definitely!","Went there on a Sunday. The place was empty and only one other party there and the service was TERRIBLE. We barely saw our waiter. Also, there was a yelp check in offer for a free beer and at first they said they can't honor it. Then, another waiter said they would honor it. Just a lot of miscommunication, confusion, and poor customer service. Especially when there was only one other table besides us and we were a party of two. Besides the service being terrible; the food was okay. I can't say it was anything special. But it came out nice and hot. We got the snow crab legs with holy crab special sauce and mild. The crabs were a bit over cooked. We ordered the seafood scampi. The shrimps used in the scampi were frozen baby shrimps. The pasta was okay, nothing special. It had mussels too. We also ordered the headless shrimps in the bag but we chose the garlic butter with the ""medium"" sauce. The shrimps given in the bag were whole shrimps, no tail. But the sauce was super spicy. Not sure why it's called ""medium"".","The appetizers are better than the main. Came here on a cold rainy Friday evening with two other friends and there were plenty of seating available but we were told to wait/stand around for about 5 minutes before we were pointed to a table we had been standing next to the whole time... the table we were told to sit in had been set up for two people only so we asked for an extra set of utinsels and the girl completely forgot about it and we had to remind her again a second time before we ever got it, additionally nobody came around to check on us whether the food was good or not nor did anyone refill our very empty water jug and cups...literally there was very minimum service provided.The food however was quite decent, there is free beer with yelp check in and I got a Smirnoff which tasted good in the first sip but not so great with the seafood... I was hoping for the angry orchid but that wasn't available as an option. I would highly recommend the soft shell crab it was really good, my friends and I really enjoyed it.The seafood scampi pasta was pretty okay... a little TOO cheesy for my lactose intolerant liking, if it had less cheese it would have been BOMB! The Cajun fries were okay, definitely had the old bay taste but I could have done with more ketchup and it wasn't crunchy even though it was freshly friedWas a little dissapointed in their sauce for the seafood bags, I believe the sauce at boathouse and the boil are both better, but the spice level was good. We also tried their oysters which were pretty good and it was BOGO when we went so that was nice. There were no sand in the oysters and it was fresh enough. I would come back for the food. Oh yea if you pay with cash you get 5% off!!",Holy Crab Boiling
490,I don't know where to start...I mean - A..Maz... ING!!  Its a nice small space and the young lady that owns it makes everything from scratch. The portions are more than enough and I mean the food is freaking awesome!! You don't have to be vegan to eat here. The food has sooooo much flavor you wouldn't care if it was meat or not. What I love the most is that it's a local owned business and you can tell she cooks and prepares the food with love!!I will definitely be back,"Wish I could be leaving a five star review but I also struggled with the wait time here. When I came to eat, my partner and I were the only people in there the entire time, we each ordered a sandwich and juice, but our food still took a full hour. Something I would normally overlook in a young, small business, but there were at least three people working when we were there. How could this have been avoided for a five star review? Warn people that this business is a from scratch kitchen. Because, honestly, the food was so incredible when we did finally get it that we didn't even care anymore.Sol Sips' strength is the food. That's what's going to keep this business going for a long time. But they need to either produce this quality faster or add some sort of note to the menu that this is a from scratch kitchen and to expect a long wait. Look forward to eating here again.","Love the food, hate the wait. We waited over an hour for our food with no apology from the staff, even though several people who ordered after us got their food before us. Sadly, this was the second time experiencing this long of a wait for the person I was with! Three stars because I love to support vegan and women-owned businesses, but this wait was so unnecessary.","I ordered the Chicken Biscuit from UberEats.Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. So delicious! I wish the mushrooms had a bit more crisp to it, but it was still amazingly delicious. Super flavorful, well-seasoned with what seems like fresh herbs. The turmeric chia seed biscuit was super delicious as well. The raspberry jam and avocado was a nice touch!It was my first time ordering after reading a lot about the restaurant and following their Instagram. I'm so happy for their success! I hope all the deliciousness continues.","I really wanted to love this place. The buzz may have played a role in my expectations. I ordered the stuffed plantains & chicken biscuits. My partner had the Avocado Melt Sandwich.  Why I can't give 5 stars:- I'd expect any place considered a casual restaurant to have a presentable, clean restroom in house - not located in a barbershop up the block. I thought it would be a cool experience but let's just say i've been to cleaner restrooms at dive bars.- When asked if there was an alternative condiment outside of ketchup & hot sauce - There was none, so I opted for ketchup. I didn't think it was too much of an ask.. but shortly after a few bites, I was approached by the cook, who mentioned putting ketchup and bbq on most things as norm in the hood although they don't do that there and questioned if the food was seasoned properly and if everything else okay. I rarely put ketchup or bbq on food so I couldn't relate. As important as customer feedback is.. being directly approached for simply asking for alternate condiment was awkward, which really didn't have to be.The chicken & biscuits was the silver lining of my experience, which happened to be quite delicious - it gave me hope that this place has potential and could be as good as the hype is.",So filling. I ordered the chicken 'n biscuits and there were two in an order. Could be 2 small meals. The cheesy sticks were good just not what I thought. It's more like a grilled cheese cut into sticks. They were good tho.Worth a visit again.,Sol Sips
491,"If I could give this outback  no stars I would . HORRIBLE dining experience... first of all the place is dirty the floors are so slippery it's like they mopped the floor with oil. We went on a Sunday at about 4pm it wasn't busy when we got there only about a 20 min wait on a Sunday not bad. Anyways Cynthia our ""waitress "" barely ""waited"" on us. She came by introduce  herself we put a round of water soda and beer. We waited 25 mins for a beer ridiculous . The apps came out they were cold of course but whatever Everyone was hungry a few ppl in our party just flew in from Florida so yea they were hungry. Cynthia never acknowledge our table she walked by a few times never checked if we needed anything I almost felt like I should of just went to my car and pulled a few cans of soda from my trunk so ppl can have a beverage at the table. We order our main course and it was a disaster the salad came out it was so saturated in dressing my daughter was calling it soup .  Everything came out at once salad and entrees. I was so fed up I just wanted to leave the food at this point wasn't enjoyable because it was cold. A manager came over to my table because of course the soup that came with my husbands order they forgot to make it or whatever and they brought it out when he was half way through his meal. She never gave me her name and wasn't very apologetic. I absolutely HATE this outback and will never ever visit here again.  If you don't mind chewing on ice as a substitute for a beverage and never want to get a beer you ordered and want to be ignored your whole visit then my all means have seat and torture yourself here don't say I didn't warn you.",Don't waste your time going there..I recently went on 9/22/2019 and I must say this place is poorly managed..Went there at approximately 4pm and was told it would be a 15 to 20 min wait..Ok no problem..Now keep in mind the place was basically empty and there were numerous tables and booths empty on both sides of the restaurant..I noticed that the waiting area was getting crowded and no one was being seated..After about 50 mins of waiting I asked the female with the reddish hair how much longer would I have to wait as my 20 min wait was now about 50 mins!! I pointed out ALL the empty tables and how crowded it was getting in the waiting area..She responded * Unsure how much longer it would take to get seated* ...I couldn't believe it..Then she said they were severely understaffed!! Its a Sunday afternoon and you don't have enough staff on hand?? I left the location as she wasn't sure how much longer I would have to wait..Let's be real..Its Outback..Not a steakhouse..Definitely not worth waiting almost an hour to sit and have dinner..,"My weekend visit to OutbackFirst time at Outback ever was with my family and my grandparents from Canada. We were greeted by the young in the who took our drink orders and we didn't see her again for 20minutes. Being that there were other tables we were hoping to see her comeback but nothing for another 20 minutes after taking our order. We waited 30 minutes before we were checked on again but still no food insight. Finally another 20 minutes later we get our order but food is still missing.My mother who is diabetic asked for her topping of her food on the side and her veggies and received none of that. As for myself I received my food with the wrong sides, then she went back to the kitchen and again brought out the wrong sides then finally 15 minutes later the right one. Now the most disheartening part is that we were told the manager was coming to speak to us.As for myself I am a manager at a BBQ restaurant and table touches is key in the business especially during busy times.The manager is finally over at our table and had a ""fuck you"" attitude towards us. My grandfather speaks with him about the service but he seems to brush us off and careless at that point I wanted to speak to him but clearly he lacked the professionalism to even hold a conversation from paying customers and could careless for the people he is serving.I would never recommend this Outback to anyone ever close to two hours spent on just waiting for the food and the manager doesn't care and for my family's first time in this establishment it was very disheartening","First things first: We had the BEST waiter we've ever had. We've been to hundreds of restaurants but, Donnell P. was absolutely a hard worker and it showed in the service he provided. Next time we come here, we'd love to request him again. I haven't been on here in a while, but I needed to drop this review for him. Continue the great work, if more restaurants had someone like Donnell, their reviews would be great. Second, the food was great. We had lamb chops at every Outback in NYC for the past 10 years and this, was worth it. Overall, everything was great.Thanks, Donnell.","Totally walked in at 8:50-ish and was seated with no waiting time.. great! Then went on to sit in the booth for 25 minutes while SEVERAL waiters/waitresses walked by our table and helped everyone else..  after the 25th minute of waiting with not even a damn glass of water, no one asking if we were ""ok"" or even a ""hey guys, I'll be right back to help you."" me and my wife left.

492,"I meant to update this to a 3.5. They got rid of that horrible bartender, but they have another guy that lets kids sit at the bar. A lawyer tried to defend the act of letting his kid under 7 sit at the bar, I had to let him know he must not respect his favorite pizza joint. I love this place for the whiskey and pizza, but still, it's frequented by people who lack common sense and respect for others without kids. Still the only place within miles to have a good shot of scotch. But 8f I am ever told me being drunk is to much for a kid at the bar, I'm passing that kid a drink to see what the parents will do.","I came for a salad and a few drinks today and I was informed all the salads are prepared in the same area, so a person like me who is allergic to nuts can't indulge in a salad. I was really looking forward to salad and some whiskey, but being informed by the bar tenders that the chefs can't prepare a salad in area that nuts have not touched was very disappointing and took the life out of my party. Not very inclusive. So about 20 minutes after I wrote this review, I get home to soggy center Brighton Beach. Come On!","Best place in Brooklyn if you enjoy Whisky, especially single malts. Like a lot of places in brooklyn, people bring their kids which always limits my desire to taste everything my body can Metabolize without going into a alcohol induced coma. I love the pizza, but the appetizers are not getting enough praise as well. The fucking meatballs are meatballs. The three stars are for their being to many damn kids during my drinking times.","Probably the best pizza in Brooklyn, and comparable to some of the best spots in Manhattan. And I've eaten a LOT of pizza so that is saying much.The bread is crispy yet light, and the toppings and sauce are delicious. They do pizza right. But they also do drinks right, and you should definitely try them. My only complaint is that some of the mixed drinks weren't strong enough. That said the Old Fashioned was. I'd also try and get there early, as they do fill up fast and kitchen closes 10:30. It's not a big place. The Brussels sprouts salad is good but it's off the menu, and they forgot to bring our salad, but let's be real, the pizza is why we're here. Make sure to try the hot honey and spicy chili.","I was honestly was surprised how good this place was. I expected it to be average pizza with amazing cocktails, typically that is a Brooklyn trend happening these days with newer pizza restaurants. The Cobble Hill was hands down some of the best pizza Ive consumed in NYC highly suggested.  The cream sauce is almost orgasmic. For an app get the bacon slice- it is really good.","The pizzas are excellent and the whiskey list is top notch - two facts that are enough to get us in here on a regular basis. What's generally lacking is the service. Friendly enough, but also kind of passive aggressive. Pizzas have been served up missing major ingredients, requests to shift one table over have gotten stiff a stiff NO from the hostess, our server always disappears for 30 minutes and never asks how the food is. Like I said, the pizzas and whiskey are perfect. Worth the trip.",Wheated
493,"I came back to this place because the chicharrón was really good the last time. However, I'm not sure if the original cook left, but what a disappointment.The chicharrón was dry and bland. I ordered a portion of rice and beans with pernil, too.This was bland too. I guess I'll have to find another cuchifrito place which are becoming rare to find these days.","If you're not Hispanic or Spanish speaking, this place will sideline you. Such disrespectful attendants. I waited for over 30mins, seated, while the only English speaking server continues to service the Spanish speaking, walk-in orders. Then two Latino gentlemen sat down to the left of me and were immediately greeted and given utensils. This place is trash just based on its service. I will never be visiting this place again and will direct all new-to-NYC-visitors to steer clear. They didn't even care when I offered to pay for my drink and leave. Such poor service. This was a huge disappointment.","1st time in NYC, and everyone suggests la Isla. Cant beleive how good it is. Got the pork chop wit arroz con gandules and habichuelas and the talapia. Really big portions and everyone is so nice.","One of the best little joins on Myrtle Ave. Their food is delicious, very well priced, and the service is excellent. The staff is very friendly. I could eat there for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I will probably be ordering from them again in the next 24 hours. Go here for sure!","The alcapurria is a lemon shaped pastry made from deep fried cassava dough and then, meat filled. I've never heard of it until I pointed to an attractive palm sized one that stood out golden orange from the rest of the fried goodness.""What's in it?"" I asked my lady. ""Beef"" she said after a moments thought. ""Sure."" May be the best decision of my life. Well ok- maybe not that serious. But it was one of those lightbulb moments of my food career (that has been in the making for as long as I can remember, and will likely remain as just such!). This pastry was soft and glistening with juice and oil- it was so hot in the plastic baggie I had to supplement and hold with tissues. But the crunch was unbelievable. The gluten-y thickness of the dough was rice like. Was it pastry or gummy creamy goodness? And the beef was minced with fat and just melded into the ricey dough seamlessly. How have I never had this before was my only and biggest gripe?!Promptly went back in and ordered another interesting looking fried pastry that looked like a fan, also beef. Morcilla blood sausage of course. And half a lb of pernil that was so supple and calling my name from the window.Course, another beef alcapurria for later. I wanted a bit of each stew that patrons were gobbling up at the counter, but I stopped myself before I do what I always do- order too much. You can bet your cuchifrito fried yummies I will be back. And I will tell everyone about this- as delicious, amazing bang for your buck street and home grown food is as exciting as it gets. Cash only, fatty, filling and fantastic.",I had dinner from La Isla last night. This place has been in my community for years and got remodeled. It's always busy but the food is good and fresh. There was a long line for the food and I still waited. You always have to wait about 10-15 mins for sweet plantains because they make it to order.Keep in mind they are cash only! Will return!,La Isla
494,"An OK place. Stopped by for brunch, lured in by good Yelp rank, but experienced a rather sub-par meal. If you rarely have cash on you, be prepared to pay 4% extra for using your credit card here! I was really appalled to see that info on the menu and I find it really disgraceful in today's bitcoin dnage... Our server was very quiet and though not entirely lethargic, it took forever to order, get a beer and especially get the check (which would have never come if it wasn't for the other server who was much more efficient). This poor service had a lot to do with the poor impression of the place.The place itself is old and in a desperate need of fresh coat of paint on the dirty walls and ceiling. There is only one co-ed restroom.The food is OK. My husband had a carbonara, which was good but the portion was small.I had the sandwich with scrambled eggs, bacon, cheese and veggies on a brioche bun. They ran out of avocado, so offered to sub with spinach. When the sandwich came with no spinach, I asked and they brought it as a side 10 min later, when I was half through my meal.After all these hiccups, there is no need for me to go back.",The eggs on a cloud was the best dish here and the $8 dollar bellinis/bloody marys/mimosas were a steal (especially for the pricey Dumbo area). Also there was no waiting time when I went (Saturday at 12) which was a plus.Lighting was a bit too dim for brunch so I took off a star.,"We arrived in Brooklyn on a Friday afternoon after visiting Ellis Island and, based on Yelp reviews, we decided to eat here for a late lunch.The restaurant is not large, and had been crowded at lunch time because we got there late and most tables were still taken.  It's a fairly noisy room given the high ceiling and lack of anything that resists noise.We had the caprese panino, the farm salad and the chicken marsala.  The panini lacked much flavor - it needed fresh basil (a tiny piece there), which the restaurant could have grown by the barrel given their huge sunny windows in front.  The rest was good, not great. My glass of wine (Donnaluna) was expensive. Overall, an ok stop but nothing really special.","For residents of DUMBO, AlMar is an institution. A joint. A place where one can escape the throngs of selfie-obsessed tourists down the block and enjoy an inventive, well-crafted meal at surprisingly affordable prices in a casually chic environment. A place welcoming enough to bring your screaming toddler, yet cool enough to bring a date and order off the menu. Dear Basic Bettys and Chads of Yelp who complain about the 4% credit card surcharge: I welcome you to the economic reality of small business in 2019. Did you rent go up? AlMar's probably did, too (except unlike you, daddy doesn't pay their rent). Most restaurants simply build this credit card surcharge into the pricing rather than give you the choice to bring cash, and if the extra $1 on your perfectly cooked ribeye is a deal-breaker, you need to go back to the McRib (no shame in that, by the way!). On behalf of DUMBO, I can assure you that we won't miss your minty vape smell, VICE-driven political hot takes about countries you couldn't pick out on a map, and the loud chatter (while I'm trying to eat) about your Rumble Boxing class or why he won't call you back. (I just met you 3 minutes ago and I'm sitting 5 tables over -- I can tell you why he ghosted).This is New York. Appreciate a restaurant like AlMar. It's why you live here.","Good brunch place. A quick walk from the Cliffs at Dumbo if you're looking for a good place to eat after bouldering. At around Sunday 1:40pm, we arrived and there was a 20 min wait to get seated. I got the smoked salmon panini which taste very good and was healthy. The atmosphere is chill with plenty of seats. Even when it was fully seated, conversation was easily made and heard. Note that there is a 4percent upcharge from the prices that you see on the menu if you pay with credit card!","Just happened to walk by after going to the flea market and what a great find.  Enjoyed a really clever version of an open faced breakfast sandwich called Eggs in a Cloud. Almost like a egg sandwich souffle.  And the BLT was fantastic with its artisan baguette, organic bacon and the aioli made the sandwich.",AlMar
495,"Good evening, I ordered via Uber Eats. 9/25/19 It was the worse experience. I am now suffering from gas pains after waiting 2 1/2 hours for my delivery. When my food arrived it was a completely different driver, on the app it stated female in a red Nissan, a male in a black BMW showed up. The salmon burger did not taste as expected, it was not edible. It was process and not fresh, and the bun was stale. The fries were completely cold, the shrimp was steamed and drown in seasoning sauce, 5 tiny pieces of shrimp (also cold) I waited 2 1/2 hours for my food and expected more from your restaurant. This is just unacceptable. I've ordered from your restaurant once before and didn't experience any issues. I contacted Uber eats and they said it wasn't their matter. This is dangerous expecting one person to show up at your door 10:30pm at night to see another person of a different gender is frightening. Hope no one else goes through this!","Food is horrific, my crab legs was drenched in whatever sauce the crab legs was soggy af shrimp was fried super crispy and the sweet potato fries were black meaning burnt. Never ever again and it wasn't even busy. That's the sad part   Wish i can give it a zero","Ordered with Uber. Order was delivered over an hour but expected when factoring cooking times. Downside delivery was made with Bike messenger. Seriously not recommended if the orders or not Saran wrapped. Of course the Steam Gravy spilled out into bag. (I should get 10% percent refund for that ). I usually order the Snow Crab clusters they make them very well, however they have gotten to exspensive. First time ordering Salmon Burger. Did not like it. Texture was mushy and it taste awful. The following was very good, spicey, and worth ordering :Tilapia Combo with potatoSalmon Combo with potatoSweet potato friesCornYummy!!The sauces were also a tasteful addition.",Great Food & Great Customer Service!! will Always Be a wonderful place to catch a game while you eat or just chill out while you eat,"Decent Soul Seafood. And Excellent late at night. Decor leaves much to be desired but the focus is the food. Expect to wait some time for the food as it appears most things are made to order. Overall, it's a great seafood location in the area and the owners enthusiasm and smile is strong enough to warm the heart.","I really use to love this place all last year. It was the only fast seafood spot you'll go to and the food always would taste the same. I love also that this a blacked owned business. Today I went by and order a red snapper combo and mussels. The snapper was okay not as seasoned as usual, the mussels were disgusting!!!!!!!!! I wanted to call but I didn't want no confusing. My mom got a shrimp salad which was okay cause you can't really mess up a salad. I wasted $56 on this placed. I will not order from here again. They were good last year but I guess they're slacking.",Seabreeze Food

Otherwise great spot, some very good pastries and brunch dishes.(The chocolate cake didn't taste like chocolate at all. Had a strange taste, bad enough to spit out. Maybe they forgot an ingredient or mixed up the sugar and salt?)",Great outdoor space. Quiet. Barista makes magic behind the counter. No laptops on weekends till 3-5 I think.,"First tried this place during lease-signing and dropped in just because. I had the gluten-free berry scone and it blew me away. Delicious and flaky--best I've had in a long time (including when I used to eat gluten). Definitely will be back! I've since tried the cold brew and it's not bad. My second favorite thing here is the ""GF avocado toast"" breakfast option--potatoes instead of toast. See pic.","Visiting New York and had an Airbnb in the area, found place on yelp and gave it a try.

The sap green water well-sprinkled with debris. Thank goodness there is no ocean view at Oceanview Cafe. Just good potato dumplings. I sit across from my own potato dumpling. Hello little dumpling, I say every morning in our tiny Brooklyn apartment. It's 200 sq ft. We share a futon and a desk and fight often. We lament our circumstances except for the fact that we are a few stops from Oceanview Cafe and their lovely sleeveless men with their anchor tattoos pouring vodka into little glass bulbs at noon. Mustaches. Real men, real potato dumplings. A real experience. We each came to New York from California to have an artistic life. To paint. If I painted Oceanview Cafe, I'd use pointillism like Seurat, because his name resembles sauerkraut, and I'm a visual person. I see a constant red aura surrounding my little potato dumpling. I'm nervous and anticipate her next snap. She's otherwise cute. When she doesn't throw things or rock back and forth in a rage. When she doesn't berate me and tell me how bad my art is... I surely love her. She is innocent, perhaps hurt by her parents... I can't know for sure when she shuts down. I shut down sometimes, too. But today I am a talkative artist in Brooklyn eating authentic fare in my summer shorts. The black hairs on my legs raised as if to celebrate alongside my taste buds. Potato dumplings crowned with golden rings of caramelized onions. Blintzes. Caviar and smoked fish. My favorite dish however is the stuffed cabbage. We order it all and take it home to watch Planet Earth in the late nights on a laptop, the screen glowing with scenic panoramas that could not contrast the drab Brooklyn landscape an iota more. Hot leftovers on towels on our laps. I will paint Oceanview Cafe and what I remember of it. Blue and white decor. Red auras. Vast seas. Vodka waterfalls drenching curt Russians. Their aprons are stiff wet on their thighs. Less halo onions and more horns. More fire. More pounded meat forced onto a roiling flame.","Something happened to this place over the years.  Maybe it hasn't kept up with the times or maybe they never ironed out the kinks.  I used to come here often between 2004-2008.  The food was always really delicious and fresh.  The waiters have always been the same two men, like a bad cop and a good cop, and  employed a bunch of flaky inconsistent and unnecessary hostesses.   It's nice to see an old Russian grandma work her butt off to make good food in the kitchen, but I was just heartbroken to one day notice that my usually delicious borsch lacked freshness and flavour - I glanced into the kitchen and was horrified to see that they use the microwave for much of their food.  BIG PROBLEM!The food lately has been hit and miss.  The ""bad cop"" waiter has gotten significantly worse where before his b*tchy behavior was almost comical now is downright nasty and unwelcome.  So to break it down:THE PROS mostly good food - try the sirnicki - yummy sweet cottage cheese pancakesthe pelmeni and varenicki - dumplings with different fillingsthe fish - pick any - all good, with some buckwheat or potatoeskompot - really nice drink, but I wish they used much less sugarblini with caviarborsch soupTHE CONSTV's everywhere!  WTF!!!   It is so distracting and not to mention rude - this is not a sports bar!  This is by far the worst thing about this placeNeeds major overhaul on the very tacky and dusty interior designGet rid of the waiter! I realize he's been there since Stalin's regime, but enough is enoughFor all the love of all that is food, throw that disgusting microwave out - you are cheating your customers and you are being lazy with your food",Great food! Stuffed garbage and the Palmeni country style were fantastic!Service was a bit slow. Nice staff Cute place,"Oceanview CafeOVERALL:  7.3/10The place was very casual vibey. The food was good. The waiter was nice. The bathroom smelled horrible. FOOD: 7.1/10We got the mushroom and potato dumpling, the farmers cheese blintzes, mackerel and fried potatoes and chicken stroganoff. The dumplings were alright. Didn't really taste or see any mushroom inside, might as well be just potato dumpling. The farmers cheese blintzes were good, I'd say it was the same as Sweet Spot Cafe. The chicken stroganoff was good, although I think they were cheap with the chicken... The mackerel takes absolutely no skill to make besides the potatoes being fried and the fact I had to circumcise the fish myself to eat. Honestly idk why I reviewed this as a 7.1 for food. Maybe cuz it just wasn't too bad. It was decent and a decent is a 7.1 I'd say. SERVICE: 10/10The waiter was a sweet dude. Seems like he came from another country to work here, hard worker... And very polite. Best wishes to him. CLEANLINESS: 8.1/10Not one of those you go into and you're like woah it's cleanATMOSPHERE: 7.2/10Vibe was basic, it got a low score only cuz idk why this place had a Spanish playlist on the whole time when it's a Russian spot but I mean to eat their own altho I'm 100 percent sure that music wasn't being heard by anyone in that place but maybe they were trying to be trendy. #food#oceanside#photography #nofilter #yelp #russian #ukraine #review","Ocean View Cafe is a pleasant enough Eastern European restaurant in Brighton Beach.  There are Russian and Ukrainian menu items.  I'll concur with what many, many have said before me- this place isn't on the beach and doesn't have an ocean view. Service is definitely not friendly.  It is somewhere between efficient and brusque.  The food is the major upside.  The vareniki were great.  I tried the potato and mushroom variety and they came topped with sautéed onions and a side of sour cream.  I'd come back for these!Recommended overall, but expect a somewhat awkward dining experience if you're not Russian or Ukrainian (which I am not).",Oceanview Cafe
498,"The good:The raspberry frosé is the best frozen drink I've ever had, and the bartender was quick. The jumbo lump crab fried rice had a surprisingly good amount of crab (the portion was laughably small). It really hurts my heart to leave such a poor review because these two things really were the bomb.com. The very, very bad:Service from start to finish was so bad. Like, so bad. There was no management of the front desk, so it took 10-12 minutes just to get face time with a hostess to get seated. When I was finally seated in the dinner section, it was at a table so crammed into a small space that my friend and I couldn't both sit while other patrons were seated at their tables nearby. I tried to flag down a waiter or waitress, and no one stopped, so I had to go to the front desk twice just to speak to someone about getting new seating. We were directed by the hostess to sit at one of the tall tables near the bar, but were told to go back and grab our menus. That was the full extent of the ""service"" we received. We sat at our new table for 15 minutes with no one coming to check on our table. At this point, we still have no water, no drinks, no food. I finally flagged down the hostess that seated us at the new table and explained that we still hadn't gotten our orders taken, and she says ""Ohhhhh! I forgot to mention that for this section you have to order at the bar."" Which wouldn't have been an issue, if we had been told that.We go to the bar to order, and order the frose drinks after noticing a specials menu that says signature cocktails are 2 for 1 all day. We also ordered food. When we got our bill, we were billed at full price for both drinks. I asked the bartender to clarify, and they told us, ""Ohhh, that ended at 7pm."" We were super confused (the menu specifically had two separate sections, one for happy hour that ends at 7pm, and another that said ""all day specials""), but we let it go. The kicker was that there was auto gratuity for service added to our bill. We had to chase down staff multiple times just to get a table and basic info. We got our own menus.We got our own drinks.We got our own water. We picked our own food up from the bar. We picked our own napkins up when a drink spilled. We picked our own utensils up from the bar. We picked our own to-go containers up from the bar. I always tip well. Even for poor service (pro-tip: someone in the food industry once told me that if you want management to know about a bad experience don't skimp on tip, just write about it on your signed receipt!). But I felt like this situation was unique and the auto service fee was legit unearned.","Venue too cold, food was decent but not worth the price - go during lunch special only. Rolls weren't properly rolled as they weren't sticking together. Truffle parmesan was underwhelming. As an Asian, this is a very disappoint Asian fusion - very whitewashed.",Ehhh it was alright I feel mean for posting this but I would never go again. It was over price for cheap quality food.

499,"Terrible service. My partner and I walked in with a group of 2 behind us. They were sat immediately and handed menus. We were finally sat and had us wait about 10 min before I finally asked a server if we could see a menu, he started yelling that that guy who sat you will give you menus. So we had to ask the guy who sat us for menus even though he gave the people next to us menus and had already started their orders. Anyway he just looked right at us and walked away... at this point we got up and just left.  Really bad service and I honestly feel a little discriminated.","My son treated me to dinner after a long journey and I have food allergies. I ordered lamb burger on top of a salad and wanted the dressing on the side (I had to wait to see what was in it for allergies). It was clear to put it on the side, so when the water boy brought it, it was saturated with dressing and I informed him so. He brought a little bowl of vinegar and oil. I asked the real waiter to replace it; they took it away and soon brought it back ""without the dressing."" Basically they washed it off, because it was cold and soggy and the dressing was absorbed  under the salad. I was hungry so I ate most of it and felt awful afterwards. The waiters did not look us in the face, nor did they ask if we were satisfied.  COLD and SOGGY with lame service. Buyer beware!!","Walked in with high expectations because the place looks really nice! The lighting and tables have a vintage look and its spacious. Compared to other places in the neighborhood, it's upscale.But alas, it was not meant to be. The food was disappointing in preparation, taste, and value. When you serve $18 burgers, you're saying ""I can cook and I can use quality, tasty ingredients"". The fries were burnt. The table next to us had the same problem, but had time to send the dish back and wait for more food. The chicken bites are very dry by themselves and actually inedible when combined with waffles (probably because they were cooked even more?). The chicken patty is worse than most of the soy burgers I've had in my life.Again, I should have sent the dishes back, but we were hungry, in a hurry, and with a baby. When I mentioned the quality of the food to the server, I only got a ""Sorry"" back. I wouldn't recommend this place based on what I got, but if you wanna roll the dice with some of the other choices, feel free. At $35 per person, this place isn't worth it.","Boeuf and Bun is not just your typical burger joint - to start off with in the beginning of the meal they give you complimentary popcorn which is such a nice touch. The set up of the restaurant is very DIY (do-it-yourself) since the utensils, napkins, and straws are on the table in cup holders. I personally do not like this type of set up because who knows what hands touched what. The service was not amazing, but our waitress was trying to check up on us whenever she could, but the restaurant was really short staffed for a Sunday!TIP: I would not get cocktails here, they were extremely small and watered downBut the main focus of the restaurant which of course if the food was delicious and very decently priced! The chili fries were so yummy and the portion was huge (could be shared perfectly between four people)- by the time our burgers came around we barely had an appetite (we were only two people)! I personally got the classic Boeuf with potato sticks. The burger was perfect: the way it was cooked, the toppings, and the presentation. I will definitely be back to Boeuf and Bun to try more of their vast menu - hopefully the service will be better!","I was looking forward to dining here with a client.Quite honestly I was not impressed. Popcorn is served when you sit down along with water served in mason jars, very cute and I love the popcorn.The chicken wings were the perfect size, perfect Temperature unfortunately the sauce on the wings wasn't deplorable. It was a blend of Shiracha and honey if I had to bet. The dipping sauce was ok, it was a mayonnaise aioli.The Jalapeño poppers just don't work at all, beer battered jalapeños with dry rolled beef on the inside which is pitched as ""bacon""Note to the owner: please take this item off your menu immediately.The hamburger menu is very imaginative, quite a few clever choices. Unfortunately the finished product isn't all that good.Beer, wine and a limited cocktail selection are available.

Do yourself a favor- Don't even bother!","We got there around 1 am & had a seat. The waiters gave us our menus & walked off. Another person walked in & they decided to take his order before our order. We waited 15/20 minutes for somebody to take our order but nobody every came. Let me tell you, I love tacos el bronco but the service provided on sep. 6 was beyond horrible.","Tacos El Bronco is the only place I go to if I am craving authentic tasting Mexican tacos! Their tacos are the best I have had in NYC so far. My most favorite is their Al Pastor tacos (esp w/ guac & their green sauce) - it is so delicious, packed w/ taste & very juicy and tender! I also like their beef and chicken tacos as well. I also recommend their rice w/ beans. I love the complimentary chips w/ salsa they give to you when you first sit down - so delicious and fresh! Super friendly staff and cheap delicious authentic food!Highly Highly Recommended!",Friggin awesome tacos!!!! I loved the smooth and creamy guacamole they spread on the regular sized tacos. It felt like home made food bursting with flavor. I also had the rice and beans as a side and could not have been happier. I will be back for more.,"Overall best tasting tacos  in Brooklyn This food truck is always busy, cheap prices.",Tacos El Bronco
501,"I bought a Wendy's Vegetarian Kitchen cheese from here and as soon as I got back and opened it, I gagged. After reading the ingredients, there is no way that it should smell and taste like nail polish remover. I'm not sure if it's just gone bad or was bad to start, but seeing as I tried it the same day that I bought it, I doubt it was from my handling. It was so horrible, I couldn't stomach more than a few reluctant nibbles. I had to throw it out immediately. So either Riverdel stored this poorly and sold it even though it had already gone bad or it was bad to start in which case, how did no one from Riverdel taste this before deciding to sell it? They only have like ~20 cheeses being sold... Either way, stay away.","Extremely disappointing. My first time there and I ordered the 3 cheese melt.It wasn't even the cheese they make in house.$13 for violife cheese melted on two pieces of bread. The menu did no specify what cheese is used. I assumed it would be all in house, that would have actually been worth the price. I feel totally ripped off. Didn't even eat the sandwich either.","Disclaimer: I'm not a vegan. But at a vegan place, I expected to have at least SOME veggies on my deli sandwich. Got the M. Night, and like his recent movies, was a complete dud.","Go to Riverdel knowing that you are probably getting your food to go since they just have 6 seats. Additionally, know that whatever you get will be wonderful. With each visit to the area, I make it a point to go to work my way through their menu. The Trufflepuff, the Norwegian bagel, the grilled cheese with apple have all been great! While I want to try more, the Trufflepuff gets ordered again because it is so delightful. While vegan ham often isn't so great, I do like the ham and cheese croissant.The desserts they get are amazing as well. The tiramisu and the donuts are worth every calorie.Their selection of everything else vegan is vast. Chocolates, cheese, brots, sauces, and anything else you might be looking for.","Even though Riverdel has a recently-opened Manhattan location in the Essex Street Market, their original Brooklyn store has items that make it worth the trek from Manhattan. Yesterday--a beautiful, sunny Saturday--I went out there to experience the offerings from Riverdel's pop-up of @piscesrisingvegan, which included an amazing ice cream; I took home a savory bun, which is one of Pisces Rising's specialties. This store is packed to the rafters--literally!--and when I first went there it was because I was told about one of their breakfast sandwiches, the ""McDel.""A friend confided in me that she was ""obsessed"" with it, so I had to travel out there to see what the big deal was. Yes: it's obsession-worthy.Riverdel is first and foremost a cheese shop, and just this past week I got a wheel of vegan Brie from there that was so creamy, crusty, and authentic it almost made me cry. They have all the best examples of vegan cheeses: Treeline, Myoko's, and Violife among them. I'm so happy to have them in the world!","Let me first say this is my first review on Yelp! That's how incredible my experience at Riverdel was. I am from the Washington, D.C. area, and stopped by because a friend had raved about this little vegan gem! Everyone was friendly, warm, hospitable AND EXTREMELY KNOWLEDGEABLE! I was blown away...I thought I knew a lot, but the amount I learned in that one visit was enough for a lifetime (especially about the cheeses!) I was being indecisive about what I wanted, and the lovely associate behind the counter recommended the Italian. It couldn't have hit the spot more-- savory and fresh. Now, I was worried about how I would transfer my items on the four hour drive home. But they said not to worry l, and provided me with ice packs!!! Everything from start to finish was impeccable...I could go on and on. Oh, and the time from start to finish? FAST. I thank everyone at Riverdel for such a fantastic experience. I can't wait to come back next time. Maybe open up a location here in D.C! Ha! But if not, it will always be worth the drive.-Greg",Riverdel
502,"Sweatshop? Fucking racist bullshit. Are you kidding me?Sweatshop by definition via Wikipedia A factory or workshop, where manual workers are employed at very low wages for long hours in poor conditions.",Simple but bursts of flavor for your taste buds. That avocado toast was a protein punch .,I stopped by Sweatshop for a quick snack. I ordered the acai bowl and thought that it wasn't anything remarkable. The place was on the pricier side in general. The acai bowl was small for its price. The flavor was typical of any acai bowl. The home-made granola was a little overly sweet and hard.,"I love love loooooooooooove this place. I joked with my friend about moving upstairs so I could walk down each morning and start my day there. Except I wasn't totally joking.My friend and I both got the Brekkie Bun, and we were both extremely satisfied. I slowed down my eating because I didn't want it to end. The bread is a perfectly my preferred amount of crisp but softness, the bacon was amazing, etc., I have nothing bad to say about it. Coffee didn't blow me away but was good!Interior is also super cute and staff was very nice.I'll be taking my parents here their first trip to New York. That's how you know how much I like it!","I heard a lot of hype about this place. I had their latte and an açai bowl. The total with tip came to about $20.The latte was pretty good and was average in pricing. It didn't have any distinct notes to the coffee, it was just a solid drink. The açai bowl was also good. It has cacao nibs which were my favourite part. The smoothie itself was just ok. The chia seeds hadn't been soaked, so they were hard when you bit into them. This place lost a star for me because they didn't really have AC going on a 95 degree day. So, sweatshop was a fitting name in this case. Also, there was a lady in the cafe who had her bare feet on the bench. There were also not many seats as it was a small cafe.","I heard about this place online while trying to find a bite for breakfast in Williamsburg. Stopped in on a Saturday morning around 9:30 and the place was fairly packed. We opted for drip coffee and avo toast. Up on my millennial bs game.The wait was minimal and we snagged a table near the front counter, albeit the table was pretty dirty. The coffee was available immediately in small mugs and we were told the refills cost, I don't remember how much. Okay. The toasts came out shortly after. Don't get me wrong, the toast is huge and tasty. Some of my avocado chunks were browned but there was enough that I could knock some of the chunks off. Honestly, I would have paid half the price to have less avocado tbh. To add bacon and and egg would add, like, four bucks. Half the staff were nice half were annoyed the place was crowded.All in all, it was fine, but I found this place pretty typical-pretentious-Brooklyn and I wouldn't be back to eat unless I wanted to spend over 30 bucks on breakfast for two... which I don't, especially in a cafe grabbing a quick bite.",Sweatshop
503,"This place is definitely kid friendly and has a decent menu for toddlers. It is just a regular average italian restaurant - we got a beet salad, calamari, a few glasses of chianti, chicken parm with spaghetti, penne alla vodka, and spaghetti with meatballs. It was decent but nothing exceptional!  Just good all reliable italian joint in the hood. You get a lot of neighbors coming through and it is a place where people know each other.It just average italian food - I didnt witness anything amazing with the sunday sauce either!","We met my cousins here for brunch. It wasn't packed like we expected since it's Pride weekend but service took FOREVER. The brunch menu is completely changeable. So you have to order everything exactly as is. The fresh fruits yogurt granola and honey bowl was gross. The granola was good but the yogurt has a sour taste and smell. I ordered the soft scramble eggs with cheese and homestyle fries. It was gross, the eggs were scramble hard and I didn't like the taste of the non melting cheese they used and the home fries weren't seasoned or good. Drinking so many mimosas had me not caring about the food. My wife ordered the spinach salad and liked it. When her sandwich came it was wrong and the server was nasty and asked her if she knew how to read and grabbed a menu to prove her point only her was WRONG and the waitress took her order WRONG. We wasted money dining her and did not leave a tip outside of the gratuity that was added due to the size of our party. I'd never recommend this place to anyone nor would I return.","Ordered takeout - chicken piccata , eggplant parm and a side of broccoli rabe. Chicken piccata portion was 2 small chicken finger size pieces. Eggplant looked pre made not fresh. Mediocre. Broccoli rabe boiled in water with zero taste. I wouldn't order again , fine If you are in a pinch and it's not extremely expensive compared to some of the local spots.","Thank you to Giovanni and Janet & all the staff who made our evening out special. We were a party of 8. I made a reservation (leaving a deposit). You have to ask to make a rezzie; someone (G) will call you to confirm what you need and have you leave a deposit. We were able to order off the menu. The meatballs (appetizer) are just as previous reviews said-perfection. (I ordered the first rate lasagna the previous time I came here, trust me, it's great.) Tonight we had 3 salads: mixed greens, beet, and Italian. A couple orders of veal: I believe the winner of the 2 was the scallopini. Spaghetti and meatballs. 2 penne a la vodka, one with shrimp. Spinach tagliatelle with rosemary chicken, and 2 orders of the special tonight-the pork chop. Holy cow, that pork chop. I would kill to know the secret on that. You know how when you sometimes have a filet mignon that's like butter? That was this pork chop. Ah-mazing. Seriously, it was fantastic. For dessert we had tiramisu, tartufo, and almond cake. Espressos & a brandy. The almond cake won in my book! Everyone who works there is friendly. You honestly feel like you're at a friend's grandma's house for Sunday dinner. There are a bazillion Italian restaurants in Brooklyn. I was looking for a decent place to host a group. I came here last week for the first time to test the waters and it was delightful. Tonight, tho, wow! Thank you so, so much for a wonderful evening.","Still sitting at the bar - decided to walk in after passing it a million times on my way to work. Had a quick bite of calamari and a crisp, glass of wine. The restaurant is currently quiet Just ordered an app of meatballs - the bartender is lovely . Great recommendations. Will return - it appears that this place would be a great dinner spot!",We order delivery very often from Giovanni's Brooklyn Eats and they don't  disappoint (I've also eaten in here but not recently).  There are several excellent food items to choose from -I usually order the calamari and the salmon.  The food comes hot and when they say it will - very good experiences,Giovanni's Brooklyn Eats
504,"If you are only looking for pizza. This is not the place that you are looking for. The pizza is small, but very pricey. I ordered the truffle mushroom pizza adding Italian sausages, which cost me $27. However, I was very disappointed because the pizza is small. The taste is okay, otherwise I will only give 2 stars.","I live right next door, haven't eaten there yet, but due to a crisis in our building me and my Mom hung out at the bar and got treated like queens by Chris the bartender, and wonderful conversation with Iara, the manager.   Can't wait to eat there!","I have tried this restaurant twice and my impression is still the same. I am visiting and usually stay in a hotel close so the restaurant is at a convenient location. The first time I dined in and ordered something other than pizza and it was terrible. I thought the second time, I would try Pizza and have it delivered. Google maps says it is a 3 minute walk, however the pizza arrived via bike and was cold. It absolutely had to be the worst Pizza I have ever had. In short, the food is terrible! There is way to many good places in Brooklyn to eat terrible cold food!","Several of my friends had recommended I try Forno Rosso, so I decided to try it out for Saturday Brunch with a friend visiting from out of town. The menu honestly was brimming with authentic, Italian choices. I was surprised and excited I wanted everything! Jimi was our server and he was beyond courteous and sweet. He gave us our space while also tending to our needs. I asked about the tortellini and he said it was to die for (he was right). Naturally, I met his tortellini AND raised him one Caprese Salad (a perfect addition). The sauce on the tortellini was soooo rich and creamy, I couldn't get enough....thats where the bread came in. It was warm, fresh and ideal for sopping. Ten's across the board and highly recommend! I can't wan't to make this   a regular go-to place.","We went here two consecutive Fridays because the happy hour is so good. So this review is happy hour only. I haven't tried anything not on the happy hour menu. Basically there are 3 pizzas, 3 apps, and 3 pastas half off. So that's 7-13 dollars instead of 14- 26 And thier house wine is 6 dollars a glass and it's pretty good. I like the house red a lot. The atmoshoere is nice too. They put nice fall flowers on the table which sets the mood. Though a table for two can get pretty crowded with drinks, food and decorations on it. Also if there is a big party the night you go, like one night we went, it can get pretty loud in there. Also the bathrooms are a bit dirty and cramped. The food is great fresh quality. And the food comes out quick from the kitchen. We loved everything especially the pasta. It is home made and the star of all the dishes we ordered. We had both the orecchiette and the truffle fettuccine pasta. The texture of the pasta was great and the flavors were very bold and delicious. The apps are small in size. 2 meatballs and just about 6 pieces of calamari. The calamari was fried so well and so fresh and delicious but I only got 2 pieces since we were sharing with 3 people. At 7 dollars though I get it, calamari is usually 16 dollars for a whole plate at places. Also the calamari has some fried zucchini in it so even less squid!The pizza dough is doughy and chewy and not crispy on the bottom. The margarita pizza lacks flavor. The pizza is nothing to rave about but for 10 dollars on happy hour its pretty good. The diavola pizza is the best and has the most flavor with the salami on it compared to the two others for happy hour. Besides the pasta being the star I also loved loved the olive oil that comes with the bread. I drench it in it. It has capers or peas or something in it and that makes it taste so good. Also make sure you check your receipt. We had no problems the first time we went. But the second time they charged us 18 for the orecchiette pasta instead of 13. And they adjusted it though the waitress was a little rude about it. Can't beat happy hour prices. Best happy hour for food around (4-7 mon-fri). And get the pasta!!","Beautiful space and delicious Italian food. Made a reservation for 6:30 on a Thursday but didn't need it. The bar area was packed but there were several tables in the dining area open. You will have a person to bring water and a separate person to bring bread. Someone from the bar will bring drinks. If your server is busy with another table when your food is ready, a different server will bring it out. The point is, there will always be someone there to serve you, it may just feel like a lot of different folks. We arrived in time to get apps and the first round of drinks during ""happy hour"" (=half price). We had wine and calamari. The calamari were a little thick, but still tender. They also had some battered and fried zucchini in with the squid which I enjoyed. The dish could have used a big dash of salt, but everything tasted so fresh that it wasn't worth complaining about. I ordered the veal tortellini and my husband had the Frank's pasta (branzino and shrimp over linguine). Both were wonderful. By the time we were wrapping up, the whole restaurant was full. The restrooms were terrible, but some could categorize them as rustic/industrial. The toilets were fine, but every surface of the communal wash area was filthy/covered with water and rust. We would definitely eat/drink here again, we would just avoid the restrooms.",Forno Rosso
505,"Man, this place is heaven-sent.   They have it all figured out.  The combination of pizza and natural wine pairing is next level.   Even the details matter here... the crust, wine glasses, the side spicy olive oil.  All are ace.  Come for wine, stay for the za. #fruitofthevine","A glass in my salad. It is all I can say. a crystal that luckily I didn't chew or swallow.And as if this was not enough, the manager was very rude and condescending. He tried to make me beleive that it was not a piece of glass but a piece of salt. I insisted no, it was crystal. He took it from my hands and touched it and then accepted that it was a piece of glass. but he questioned me until the end, until he touched it himself. This was on the night of September the 22nd.","Great pizza; however they changed their no tip policy without telling us (we've been many times and live in the neighborhood) or lowering the prices (which were high to begin with but with tip included made sense). We were only informed when the server brought the check (on which she'd also charged us more than the listed price for a cocktail). Would have been totally fine if they'd told us about the change in policy before we sat down, but since they didn't we left with bad vibes. Probs won't be back again.","OMG YUM! This place was definitely worth all the hype I've heard. So delicious and happy to have this in the neighborhood!We came around 8PM on a Saturday and waited about 10 minutes for 2 seats at the ""pizza bar."" For a starter we ordered just the bread and butter. Simple but it was delicious. It comes with chili infused olive oil and it was so so so so soooo good! I asked for more for pizza crust dipping later on as well. We kept on theme and ordered a simple Margherita Pizza with pepperoni. Pizzas take about 45 minutes to bake but it's worth it! We also had a front row seat to the oven and pizza making action so it was very fun to watch while we waited for our pie. The sauce on our pizza was excellent and all the toppings were extremely fresh. I'll be back here in a heartbeat. Some of the best pizza I've ever had!","We ordered Ops for delivery at the recommendation of our Airbnb host. Our first time in the city we expected nothing short of amazing pizza. Looking through the menu we really wanted to try the ""square pie"", but the price and extra cook time wasn't a good option for us. Having just landed in the city and it being so late already we really just wanted to eat and head to bed. After looking at the menu we went with the more affordable Margherita Pizza and the Ops Bread.Ordering online was very easy. The site had a great interface with prices and most items having a description. It gave you many options to customize your order and even delivery instructions which our delivery person followed perfectly.It didn't take much time at all for our food to get to the apartment and they used GreenBox boxes which was pretty cool. The pizza was still hot, but all in all a disappointment.The pizza itself was very runny and sad looking. We added pepperoni to it and they only threw like 10 pieces on for 6 slices. The pizza had great flavor, but for a $19 pizza we just expected more. Don't even get me started on the bread. When I order a bread appetizer at a pizza joint, I assume it's going to be some kind of cheesey bread or have something unique to it. If only you could have seen the look on my face when I opened up the bag and saw it was a literal loaf of bread.... the only thing added in was a little soufle cup of olive oil as though that would make the bread edible. Something like a garlic butter or a bigger offering of the olive oil probably wouldn't have left me as upset, but would have made it a funny start in the city.  I would probably update the menu to add a picture and maybe a short description so people not familiar will know exactly what they are ordering.All in all if you're looking for pizza in Brooklyn I would recommend taking the time and waiting for the square pie because it looked much better than anything we got. Stay away from the Margherita and get the Ops Bread only if you have something to put on it yourself (sorry out-of-towners).","Let's preface with this: there are better pizzas in NYC (Norma, Tramonti la pizza and San Matteo are definitely better).That being said this is very good pizza.I'm still very disappointed by the margherita with mushroom: the amount of toppings on the pizza is a joke. You're really eating dough with a little bit of other stuff, where the mozzarella and mushrooms are sprinkled as though it was just decorative. The calzone was far more satisfying with a lot more to eat other than the dough.The salad was also very fresh and good.I think given their pizza dough, they have potential to be a significantly better spot. Looks like people aren't as picky as me but maybe they haven't tried the 3 other places I mentioned.",Ops

Went in a group of 4 and was seated immediately. The ambience is decent, does not have a strong Asian feel, unlike other ramen places. Quick service, the food came out really quickly. Ordered the sauteed edamame (to share) which was a lovely surprise. The sauteed flavour of garlic tasted very delicious! Ordered the spicy miso ramen which was average. Was not spicy at all and required a lot of additional hot sauce! The noodles were pretty thick compared to other ramen places, but they tasted the same. The noodle to vegetable ratio was very room; only 1 piece of mushroom in my entire ramen.Plus I feel the restaurant is understaffed.

507,I usually go to Ghenet or Awash but was feeling adventurous to try Bati for take out. I did not open the bag until I got home which was quite a ways from the restaurant. I got the vegetable combo and was very disappointed the injera bread was stale and had an unusual odor dishes in the combo were mediocre except for greens that I did not like but I was so turned off from the bread I could not enjoy my meal at all.  I really wanted to like it very cozy vibe in there. If I had sat down to eat I would have returned it on the spot and asked for fresh bread. My review is biased due to the bread they should notice before giving it to someone for take out.,"I've had Ethiopian all over the country; LA, Miami, Orlando, Texas, Brooklyn, Harlem, etc. But I don't understand why the food is so watered down and so little in portion?

They only have beer and wine so we didn't drink but the options they had seemed good.We ordered the Kategna for an app and the Meat Combo for Two for dinner, along with Baklava for dessert. Kategna- These were toasted triangles of injera brushed with berbere and kibe. They were nice and crunchy with the right amount of spice. Meat Combo- I really liked everything that was there- stewed lamb, beef, and we got the gomen as our veggie side. The injera was delicious and sopped up all the curries perfectly.Baklava- Nice size piece that was warm and crunchy, yet soft and sweet.Looking forward to my next visit!",Bati
508,"First and last time ordering from Sushi Yashin. Ordered via the yelp app and it was a disaster. Their menu specifies that the salmon roll has salmon, crab, eel sauce and cucumber. Odd, but ok - I wanted it for a child, so I wrote in the notes ""no wasabi, only salmon and cucumber please"". Rolls arrives with salmon and wasabi, that was it.  We also ordered 3 special rolls and the amount of actual fish in these was appalling - less then a standard roll is in regular restaurants. Spicy rolls weren't spicy, and the portions were tiny compared to most places that offer special rolls. Ridiculous disappointment.Called to ask that they redo the salmon rolls because of the wasabi. Woman didn't seem to believe me, and then when I explained over and over to look at her own yelp page to read the description and told her she was ruining our dinner on both fronts (my dinner was being ruined by her calling twice and questioning me over and over again over why I didn't fee obligated to pay additional $ for cucumber and my child was starving and screaming), she totally didn't get it. The description said that cucumber was in the darn things, didn't even mention wasabi, and even with my note, they STILL got it wrong. And frankly, take one on the chin lady - if you've ruined my dinner and I ask for the cucumber that is in the description by mistake and it normally costs extra, just honor the description as a courtesy for your error!  Add to that, it took 25 minutes to redeliver from 3 blocks away. Won't order from here again.  MUCH better delivery available elsewhere, and frankly, much better customer service just about anywhere!! This was a total disappointment on every front.",The sushi was ok. The waitress came over and announced to my partner that his tip was not enough. We won't be back.,"Are they sloppy, lazy, or busy? Maybe all of the above. Second time ordering from Sushi Yashin. First time was 4/5. This time they messed up our order, forgetting a dish entirely. We paid extra for inside out rolls but they didn't even have sesame seeds on them. Smallest amount of rice on a tamago sushi piece I've ever seen. Too much fat, poorly cut salmon roll. Spicy mayo we paid extra for was barely enough for one roll. Won't go back.",Delicious Fish. Delicious Shrimp Shumai. Authentic Restaurant. Great Service. Want to return soon.,"BEST sushi in Brooklyn that i have tried. I can not believe the quality of the food that comes out of this small hip hole in the wall joint. The fish is so FRESH it's unbelievable. I would absolutely recommend the shrimp shumai. They make it themselves i believe. I only took pictures of a few things but we CHOWED. We had three rolls a bunch of sashimi, pork gyoza, pork ramen and more. Every single thing we had was delicious, fresh, flavorful and made with attention to detail. 10000% recommend. Will be back!","Rating this restaurant 3.5 stars. By no means did anything knock my socks off, but I had a nice dinner here with my friend Lindsey since she lives a stroll away & we wanted to take a walk to Park Slope in the nice weather!Restaurant was clean, very tiny and service was good. Was feeling particularly huge that evening so I opted for a lighter fare-- ordering the cucumber roll, scallop scallion roll, and small garden salad. I'd say the highlight of the dinner was the yuzu vinaigrette on the garden salad- delightfully zingy and fresh.Wouldn't go out of my way to come back but we had a nice average dinner and nothing went wrong :-)",Sushi Yashin
509,"I ordered chicken Spicy momos and  samosas for lunch. First of all their menu is VERY UNCLEAR!!! They should absolutely mention on the menu that the momos are gonna be  drenched in the spicy sauce. When I say  drenched I mean soaked completely that you cannot even take a bite, but instead what they have mentioned is ""Served Spicy""It absolutely ruined my lunch. I love spicy food but it made the momos absolutely disgusting and inedible. The dough was too thick and within 10 min of opening it, the momos has become stretchy!!!! Would never order again!!!!!!!","I am willing to try this place again as delivery should never be the sole judgement of a restaurant. However, until then it should be noted that it was BAD. I ordered the veggies samosas, chicken momo and tandoori chicken. Fairly standard stuff. For starters they completely forgot the samosas. Not a good start. Moving on the momo's were quite oily which I thought was odd for a steamed dumpling. The overall taste was alright. The tandoori chicken was standard. Nothing stood out. I could have got this stuff from anywhere. I'll also put it out there that from the time I was told my delivery guy had my food it took over an hour (it's a 15 minute bike ride to my apt from the restaurant). And the food was completely cold. So basically, I didn't get everything I ordered, what I did get was cold and absolutely average. So maybe sit down to eat there but don't bother with delivery.",I ordered food from there and I was waiting for almost 2 hours and I called the restaurant and they said the delivery person was out already on his way. I then called again after waiting 30 minutes ask for the delivery guys number when I called him he proceeded to getting into a argument with me saying he called twice when in fact I never received a call then goes send me the address when I sent it he then goes you have to pick up your good from the restaurant. Worst service ever. Not sure if they have their own delivery person or it's a third party but I never got my food!,I have never had Indian food (I did when I was young and I hated it) so this is the first time. And WOW it was delicious! I got the garlic tikka and OMG. So I drenched the chicken in lemon cause I love to do that with everything I eat and it tasted like lemon chicken with Indian spices. So much flavor! This is my new favorite thing. Also last time I got the vegetable masala (I think.. it was a tomato sauce curry) and it was delicious! That's why I came back. I have nothing to compare it to but I know when I taste good food,"Our visitor who'd moved to Portland, Ore., from Brooklyn, wanted--no, needed--lamb vindaloo on this return trip. OK, we said, we'll find you the best lamb vindaloo around; there's an app for that. No, he said, any place that has it here will do it much better than in my new home. (Which has its own charms.)Well, we did better than that. Spice & Grill was the best Indian restaurant nearby, and its vindaloo and everything else were terrific. The mixed naans, samosas, and rogan josh were standouts. They also have momos and other Nepalese delights. Plus 15% off upon checkin and BYO. We'll be back even after the West Coast return of our vindalover.","Came here on a date with Mommy, had a great time. We shared the butter chicken and the lentil daal. The butter chicken was of the best I've ever had. The daal was a little runny - I just prefer it thicker. It would be a great accompaniment to a spicy dish. Add some mellow vibes. The restaurant was really great, local feel, kind staff. It was a tad pricey for the portion sizes, or else this would be a 5 star experience.",Spice & Grill : The Indian Kitchen
510,I have never been inclined to write a bad review about any place of business but this was totally out of line! I ordered a turkey burger through Uber eats and this mess of a burger was what I received not only did it smell sour but the pink mushy inside even stained the inside of the bun pink...I've never in my life seen such neglect or care in food. You could literally peel the rubbery skin off of whatever was uncooked and spiked inside,"I thought I was going to become a regular here. While writing my first review I was waiting on a Salmon burger to be made.Ive never had a salmon burger before and the reviews for it made it seem like it was great choice, so I got it & it came with a side of food poisoning.THEY SOLD ME A ROTTEN SALMON BURGER. But before the food poisoning, I found a lovely long strip of plastic in my food after my 3rd bite. Good thing I chew my food thoroughly.I then spent the rest of my night ass to mouth over my toilet and sink (& what came up tasted so spoiled). I know it was Island Burger that caused my ailment bc I had my normal breakfast of tea and toast, snacked on my almond mix and came here for lunch/dinner after a long ass shift! I RARELY eat out -- and I was so excited to find a food spot that I actually liked.Now I just pass by here like they don't exist.I'd love to be reimbursed.","Shockingly, I'm becoming a regular here -- and for good reason.The food is tasty and made to order.Shark was cooked well with no dark parts and few bones.If you aren't a fan of tilapia, like I, you can opt for the shark and chips; which isn't listed on the menu but available at MP.Service is always good, for me; though it does tend to get packed. I usually call ahead (if the phone line isn't busy)  so I can avoid the 20 minute wait after I place my order.","I've eaten here in the past except their closer to my home. Literally around the corner.   There wasn't a long line when we arrived and service was pleasant. I didn't have to scream out my order as I did in their first location, due to the music. My order was ready in 15 mins. Yay! I ordered the signature island burger for my kids to share with fries and shrimp fried for me. I was more interested in the sauces - my favorite is the garlic sauce. They gave me 5 sauces and didn't ask for extra money like other places.The food was good and the fries were perfect. I love steak fries and they didn't disappoint. Everything was cooked well and more importantly the kids enjoyed it. I'll be back!",Damn. If you enjoy island food with a flare this is the spot for you almost like a hole in the wall. Great sauces and great seasonings. I ordered the island burger with all the toppings the Sauces set it off.,Their burgers are made to order with fresh and unique toppings and a boatload of fries. Sweet potato fries that is. The burger is thick and juicy and interestingly flavored with a Cajun old bay kick. I can dig it. The best part of this meal is that crazy garlic white sauce you hear people rave about. There is a reason and I am a believer as well.Tip: get all the burger trimmings on the side esp the wet ones ie coleslaw n pineapple if you are not immediately wolfing this bad boy down. Tip 2: get Extra Extra white sauce. The tamarind (Brown) is good too as is the green earthy watery one... but if they limit you- just ask for the Garlic sauce. Tip 3: eat the fries immediately. Duh,Island Burger
511,"I love this place. I come here all the time. I've brought many people here. But today's experience was not cool. I ordered two salmon rice balls and an iced tea. I was charged and added a 20% tip. I sat down drinking my iced tea. The employee came to bring me my rice balls and as I reached to get them, he pulled them away and said ""He forgot to charge you for one.""This remedy wrong because I had paid about $14 which seemed a more than fair price. But the fact that the other employee wouldn't let me have them until I walked back up to pay for a third of meal my that I hadn't been charged for was really weird. I felt like a thief. I went up and paid $3.27 and didn't add a tip to it. When I sat down, I was told ""Whoops. I had already charged you. I'm going to have to reverse that.""It was so annoying. There was no point to any of that. And then when I asked him for a receipt to show the reversal, he told me to check my bank statement. This type of thing needs to be handled better in the future or I won't be going back there. It's just silly and unprofessional and a waste of everyone's time. At least handle it better. Don't not give people their food that they already paid for because of your being confused.I wouldn't have written this negative review if anyone had apologized.","They have amazing coffee but their order queue definitely needs work. They often mix up or miss orders completely. I've been here a couple dozen times and half the time, they accidentally throw my order slip out and forget to make my drink, or they make it with the wrong milk. If you're expecting to get in and out of here in under 10 minutes, think again!A+ for amazing coffee but C- for customer service and efficiency. I feel bad for writing this because they seem really nice, but it shouldn't take 20+ minutes to order and receive your coffee. It's just consistently bad service.","I'm a fan of the meatball bento boxIt's tasty, quick, and fillingMatcha latte was 2 dope","**DRINKS ONLY REVIEW **It's really nice to come into a Japanese establishment where Japanese people work & Japanese people come to hang out  -- you know it's going to be solid!Japanese people just do everything so well -- their meticulous ways make them thrive for perfection & you can tell they put a lot of effort into the drinks they make here. I always see the same cool Japanese girl behind the counter -- a little standoffish/shy at first, but I think the more you come in, the more she seems to recognize you. She even said ""see you around"" the last time I came in! I live & DIE for their Matcha Latte. Honestly the best one I've had in my life thus far, given I have never been to Japan. The girl behind the counter told me about Hoji & I think I'll have to try their Hoji Latte the next time. It sounded right up my alley!People people people, I've seen this happen a few times here while sipping my latte -- their kitchen closes in between times so like most Japanese establishments, they open up the kitchen up at 5pm again! Thank the latte Gods they're down the street from me cause they just gained a new regular.","One of my favorite local Japanese cafes. I'm so relieved they have a hojicha latte- and it's damn delicious hot. You can bet I get it every single time. Normally, it's too sweet for me - so I just ask them to keep it unsweetened. As far as I know, you can either get it regularly sweetened or unsweetened (nothing in between, which makes sense as a prev cafe barista) Please everyone -don't give them crap complaints about not giving it to you ""slightly sweetened"" They have better things to do.As far as food: Onigiri combo. So heartwarming and enough to share. I'm not much of a curry person, but my boyfriend likes their curry. As a mochi lover - I do want to try their dango.I love coming here with my boyfriend to just hangout for a Saturday AM stroll - or to work on my laptop with that hojicha latte. Haven't been up on the rooftop because it's been raining/snowing/too damn cold, but I'm stoked to do so when it's available.",Got the umeboshi rice ball and was so good! The seaweed one is supposed to be good too. Those are the only options for vegetarians/vegans. Enjoy!,Brooklyn Ball Factory
512,A little run down ramen place that I walked past while looking for it.Nothing special here. No gyoza. The ramen broth was fair but the chashu was dry and tough.  I wouldn't recommend eating here because the place is kind of dumpy and the ramen reflects the attitude of the surroundings.,If youre looking for satisfying and filling after hitting Other Half around the corner for incredible IPAs this is the place.  Its not in the class of Ramen Shack or Mei Jin but its a solid choice.,"3.5 stars.It's nice to have a ramen place nearby,  even if it is on a really strange,  barely trafficked corner. The staff is very nice and polite. I had the miso ramen, and it was quite tasty. Compared to other places though,  it ranks solidly in the middle.  Good but not great. A couple things - there's no AC in the place. This makes the restaurant very uncomfortable when you're serving hot soup in the summer. Also, the counter and high top tables are unnaturally high. For a short person like myself, my legs will either dangle awkwardly (and painfully), or I  have to hunch over a bit so my feet reaches the footrest and then the counter is too high. Who designed this place? Definitely go for the tables in the back.",I've been dying to try an authentic ramen place and I finally did it! And with friends to boot lol. The menu has a decent selection of ramen and things you could add in. I got the Gyukotsu and it was delicious and really filling. We sat at the counter and got to watch them make it. The restaurant is small and clean. The space  is definitely used efficiently so it doesn't feel so cramped. I'll definitely go back again.,"This was an interesting ramen spot! We were greeted nicely. The location was small but with pretty good amount of seats.Pricing wise, I think it is decent here. I ordered the miso soup with some pork belly. It was super delicious! I like that the pork was ""grilled"" in a way. I am guessing that it was flame grilled. Adding a few drops of chili oil made it so delicious. I wish we didn't have to pay extra for a soft boiled egg. I paired my ramen with Sapporo and that definitely hit the spot. I find it interesting that they have a bone broth in the menu. I want to try that next time. I've been to Osaka before and I believe that there is some authenticity in their ramen especially the broth. Parking can be a bit tricky here. I will definitely come back!","The BEST karaage I've had! Crispy on the outside with moist chicken thighs in the inside! Hubby got the gyutan - the broth is perfect! I got the spicy gyukotsu miso mostly for the toppings but I think I prefer my ramen without miso, it was delish still!  The egg was perfect!Service was fast and water was always full!Can't wait to come back!",Za-Ya Ramen
513,"I'm reviewing in the context of getting delivery.So, to be clear, the food is great. Really great. However, the customer service is abysmal. And the delivery service is literally frightening.A delivery person just flipped out and screamed at us - seriously crazy town stuff. Fear for your safety stuff. Because we wanted to see if the order was correct before he left.We called Home Frites, and they informed us that it wasn't their problem, as they contract with a delivery service.Bzzzt. Wrong answer. No more deliveries from Home Frites. Shame, as the food is really great. But not good enough to worry about unstable delivery people.",I only had the fries but they were horrible. The dipping sauces weren't great. The fries were overcooked and had no taste. They didn't even have cones. Said that they didnt use them anymore. That's the whole point of Belgian fries!,Super disappointed that I got a counterfeit $5 bill back when I paid at the smorgasbord at the oculus. The worst part is the cashier was very sketchy as he handed the money back. So guess I can't even be that surprised after all.,"This place is a home run! This location has a good amount of seating, with high top tables and more in the back. I came for dinner and there wasn't a huge wait, but there were quite a few people waiting by the time we sat.I had the crispy chicken salad with avocado dressing and my cousin had a burger. We also ordered the Tray O' Fries to share with garlic aioli, herb-acodo sauce, and some good old ketchup. The salad was delicious and my cousin enjoyed her burger. The fries, of course, were absolutely perfect and the sauces were fun and unique. There was more than enough fries for the two of us and we took home leftovers.Service was so friendly and awesome. This is a sweet place for a meal or if you're craving some fries--they won't let you down! I'll definitely need to try some of the funkier fry offerings next time.","Perfectly greasy burgers and fries, bc sometimes you just want that. I will say that their fries are pretty amazing, even for a greasy spoon. Like boiled then fried or something. The sauces they offer are also a nice complement. The burger looked and tasted exactly like something from McD's, which I was not expecting, having ordered delivery on a whim after my last order was cancelled bc of that resto's snafu. I mean, again, no shame in it but know what you're in for.","Re-ordering from Home Frite is like chasing the dragon. I have had one really good order of truffle French fries and a fantastic chicken sandwich and have never experienced it again - despite numerous orders. The fries and fried chicken sandwiches are consistently, without fail, over cooked to the point of being inedible - just oily and hard as f***!What is most frustrating is that it is expensive! The sandwich is small and you've blown $25 if you add fries, delivery fee and tip. Bleh, just order from Shake Shack.",Home Frite
514,"Came here a few times and the place is a little dirty. My first time here with my sister, there was a little fly in her water and we asked the waiter and she just said oh just a fly and gave a dirty look and walked away with it and returning with another cup of water. Food was ok... I got the satay beef noodle soup the first time and the satay tasted good. The second time was a little more tasteless and the third and fourth time, it tasted like water. No taste at all.Took my husband here to try and we both had a bad stomachache after too...Not sure if we'll return since the food quality is getting worse each time we go.","This is a 3.5 star rating Other than the new decor I think this place was not as good as I had hoped for. First of all - I know my HK cafe style food very damn well. No fakes and half-azz HK food for me please. I ordered the following:HK milk tea (cold) - not authentic, tea and milk flavors were both meh - you can tell by the HK milk tea if this place is a legit HK Style cafe. This is ... not. (HK cafe style) French toast - was ok. Nothing special. It is French toast but it doesn't have the soul of a good HK style French toast. The cafe across the street does it much better -- I reviewed them! Fish ball/ suimai / rice roll - yea I know what I am eating but again that's it. Not memorable and not special.Roasted pork belly and tofu over rice - was waaaay too salty. It wasn't enjoyable. In terms of service - it is quite slow. We went at 4pm on a Sunday. We sat down for 10 min. Nobody looked at us and asked if we were ready to order. We had to flag them down. The food came quickly but also nobody cared when we finished. The staff walked by our table many times but nobody asked if we are okay. If you want to be left alone at a restaurant - they def leave you alone!!! Not impressed in fact quite disappointed.",Food is great but my review is for the lady in the front. She is very rude and will yell at you when you're ordering. Even when she would pick up the phone she'd yell. She looked like she hated her job and every customer. Would probably not come back since I don't want to deal with her.,I have came here a few times  now. Always have a long wait outside but this time they used buzzers similar to Red Lobster etc for the wait line which made it much easier for us so we did not need to cramp inside the small restaurant. Food was good as always. They never had the Pineapple Bun with Butter after noon but I think they figured out stock and now they do have it (even at 1:30PM)!! Decor and menu is also great (9/10) reminds me of Hong Kong Cafes a lot. The food is okay but HK food in Hong Kong is definitely different! Rate it at 8/10. Wouls definitely recommend trying it at least once!,"I am a regular customer here since the Like Cafe was open. I like the food here but not the mean front desk lady. She is kinda of rude, especially when she takes orders on the phone. (She has been there for a long time and is still there and I think she will continue to be. What can you do about it)The food is good and the boss updates the menu very often so it makes you feel like the restaurant never gets old. They always comes up with new good ideas and concepts, not to mention to price LOL. This place gets pretty pack during lunch and dinner hours so don't be surprised a long wait line. I would still recommend if you are looking to try the Hong Kong cafe style food.","Like Cafe Overall: 9.1/10Good food, good service and clean ‍ Food: 8.5/10Nice Hong Kong style cafe, mix of everything from casual eats to actual dishes.

515,"This restaurant serves tasty, authentic Italian food and nice services!","A byob spot with $5 cork fee. The location is slightly south of park slope so there is plenty of parking. The decor is very basic with some art work of Italy hanging on the walls throughout the restaurant. The food was decent. For appetizers we ordered: grilled Portuguese octopus and a pear  salad. For entrees we shared the risotto pescatore and gnocchi. The dessert was pretty disappointing, we order a cheese cake and it was the smallest slice I have ever seen. I don't know if they were just out or that's their usual standard practice to serve tiny slices. When we mentioned this to the waiter he seemed to dismiss our comment.","So...in my opinion it all starts with the bread. The bread wasn't good.Kale salad was overly dressed.Pasta was nothing special.Service sub par.Tables are stacked on top of each other.How this place has over four stars, is beyond me. Leads me to believe that it's all transplants that eat here from other parts of the world that don't know good food.Or maybe everyone just gets drunk on the $5 BYOB and don't notice that what they're eating is just basic.",My husband and I were looking for a place to have a luncheon after my mother burial at greenwood cemetery which is very close by and convenient to the cemetery. We thought everyone would like Italian so we decided to give it a try and we were not disappointed. We were given a private room which was perfect for the party of 15 we had with family and close friends. Everyone raved about the food they ordered and said it was delicious. We started off with a few appetizers Calamari which everyone said was very good and we also ordered Crostini Burrata which was excellent. The other appetizer we ordered was Tagliere Misto a selection of meats cheese and olives.We let everyone choose their main dish I had eggplant and it was so good and my friend had Lasagna Bolognese and another friend had salmon. The chicken Piccata was very good my friend said. The service was good friendly,"I found this place by accident when searching for my old corner bar Mary Ann's that is now a Vet.  This place has cropped up next door since I was last in the immediate area.  Hey...that's New York...right?When I heard that my ride-share service was offering ride discounts, I figured I'd save some money by bopping over here.  Since they have a nice $15 lunch special that includes app and main I wanted to give them a try.I really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere. Staff is very nice. A little bit of very tasty bread in a tasteful bag, with the infused olive oil is a nice start.  The fried calamari was some of the cleanest and well prepared that I've ever had.They dropped the ball a bit, because it took about 20+ mins for my main to show up after finishing my app.  I think they had a large party in the other side of the restaurant. I opted for the wide noodle (Pappardelle) with meat sauce as my main course.  It was ok, but  It seemed really salty to me.  It was just a bit of a letdown based on all these 5 star reviews.   I'm not giving up and intend to return to try more of their options on the lunch special menu.I love the BYOB idea for a $5 corkage fee.","Happened upon this restaurant on a Monday night during an overnight stay. We were not familiar with this area, but always like Italian so we gave it a try and were not disappointed. Calamari appetizer was very good. I had the pasta special, with shrimp and pancetta, excellent and a huge portion, husband had the lamb chops which he thoroughly enjoyed. Service was excellent, very attentiveHighly recommend.",Nostro Ristorante
516,"We came in from los angeles to visit our son at Pratt institute.  Never been to Brooklyn.  The service, the selection the food flavors are phenomenal.  Will came back later for cocktails.",Their printed menu prices are not consistent with what they charge. It is tasty- but too expensive for a pie $30,Over priced and bad service stood in front of counter and they just keep passing me by like i wasn't standing there ... i dont know but maybe they dont care about everyone so i wont go back,"Probably one of the best Italian restaurants that I have ever been to. As an Italian, I know what good Italian food is supposed to taste like. The chef Mario, is from Naples Italy. I met him and he's such an amazing and talented person .We were 10 people. (5 couples)This is our 5th time here. I have been wanting to write their well deserved review, for the longest time. We went here on a Friday night. Our order was as follows:Appetizers- Fried Calamari, grilled octopus, Melanzane Rollatina and Antipasto Misto. Everything was amazing. The food came out hot and was served family style. We literally ate every morsel of food lol. The chef is an amazing cook. You can tell that the food and ingredients are of highest quality. For my main course, I had ""Suprema di Pollo"" its Chicken breast, portobello, cremini, shiitake mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes in a Marsala wine sauce. Served with potatoes and vegetable of the day. This is one of my favorite dishes at Il Porto. The rest of the group ordered various dishes. There was not a single complaint. Dessert and coffee topped the evening. The staff is tentative and they really are great. There is always one of the owners present. If there is a problem, they remedy the situation immediately. I can't speak highly enough about this place. If you want authentic Italian food, then you need to try this place. They also have a pizzeria which is next door to the restaurant. The pizza is just as good. Almost forgot to mention, they have a full bar too and live music on the weekends. Not sure what night the live music is.","Excellent food, drinks and service. We came here last Saturday. There were 10 of us celebrating my 30th wedding anniversary. Everything on the menu sounded great. We literally ordered almost all the appetizers they have on the menu lol.  Each appetizer was amazing. Calamari was the best. For entree, everyone ordered something different. Not 1 person complained about their food. I had a chicken dish ,which I believe the name was chicken supremo. Unbelievable. The chicken literally melted in my mouth. After indulging for nearly 2 hours, it was time for dessert. I spoke to one of the owners and told him that we would love a sampler of desserts for the table. Wow.... Be careful what you ask for. The owner ( Anthony) came out with this huge display of various desserts. If that wasn't enough, he also brought us a complimentary Nutella Pizza. Each dessert was to die for. 3 hours later... We were about to explode. Lol.  Everything was excellent. I have been to many Italian restaurants, and this place makes the top 3 in my book. We will definitely be back. If you want authentic tasting Italian food, this is the place. I heard the chef was from Naples. Now I know why the food was soooooo good.","My crew and I have been eating at Il Porto 3 times/week for the last year and everything about this family-owned ristorante is top-notch. I've brought my restaurant friends from the city to eat here a bunch of times and Porto's solid food and service has never let me down/ always makes me look good in front of my smack-talking buddies. Place is a well-oiled machine, delivery guys going in and out every couple minutes, line for slices moves fast even at lunchtime and people in the dining room always look like they're having a great meal, crackin jokes/sharing the dishes with their buddies. You can tell from the vibe of the lunch crowd that its the highlight of the day for a lot of people. Old school hospitality that you sadly don't get a lot of in other places these days.Pretty obvious why people in the neighborhood are always talking about this spot. Can't be beat.",Il Porto Ristorante
517,"2 stars for the sandwich not being terrible and for the girl who made my sandwich able to conjure up a smile and a ""you're welcome"".I mean, come on. Is it so hard to be cordial when taking someone's order?And those prices. My simple, tiny crispy chicken sandwich (which was more burger like) came with few dressings was almost 10 bucks - no fries or side salad. I've had way more from better sandwich shops for that price and I was hungry afterwards. I got a small $2.12 bag of chips to make up for the lack of food.I get that they're on a main, up and coming street rent might be high - but they are gonna need to mellow out the hipster bad attitudes and offer big kid food if they're going to compete on Vanderbilt Ave.","Very tasty sandwiches, in a bigger-than-it-looks-from-outside space. To be so new this place already seemed pretty legendary when we got around to visiting. But what about the food, you ask?That pork sandwich is on my top 10, but don't sleep on the roast beef or grilled chicken varieties either. Even with the millions of kids that were running around we were able to enjoy our food in relative peace.So much so that I was just about ready to give this place 5 stars until the owner/manager lady came in and started arguing with the staff, really loudly and rudely for what was probably her fault. It was disgusting and we were embarrassed for the staff. So minus one star for that lady's nasty-ass attitude.But yeah, otherwise try it. It's great.","Yes, the food is expensive, but my husband has searched high and low for a turkey sandwich that comes close to the one at Stocked, to no avail. I enjoy a lot of the sandwiches, particularly the crispy chicken, and the rotating soups (more available in the winter).  On our last day in Brooklyn before moving to Jersey, we passed but Stocked as an essential stop on our goodbye tour of our favorite haunts.","My beloved Stocked. I stumbled upon this place while taking a stroll in Prospect Heights. Looking in, you'll see a modest interior with wooden tables and chairs, staffed by unpretentious peeps serving up tasty food- the kind that has all the potential to hold the title of neighborhood favorite by various patrons. I keep coming back to this place... it keeps calling my name: ""Cynthia, come in, you know you want some of this. "" And I always answer with an order. So what have I tried:Lemonade: perfect balance of tarte and sweet. Get it early before they run out! 5  French toast muffin: It's basically pieces of French toast put together in muffin form. I wasn't a huge fan, but word out on the street is that it is a customer favorite. 3  BEC/ Fried Egg Sandwich: both are AHMAZING. That bread  is grilled to perfection, Egg the right amount of runny, cheese is gooey. The bite is crunchy then soft. SATISFYING. If you like bacon get the BEC. If not, no biggie, get fried Egg sandwich! 5  Steel Cut Oatmeal: perfect consistency. Sweetened with brown sugar and has little surprise bites of apricots and apples. Yummy. 5  Sweet Potato toast: I get this when I'm acting health conscious. The textures are all complimentary and the flavors explode in your mouth. The soft sweet of the sweet potato is cut but the soft tart goat cheese with the crisp of quinoa and kale. Once again the egg is the right amount of runny. 5  Roasted Eggplant sandwich: Again with that BREAD. Subtleness of the eggplant flavor is brighten by the whipped feta and capers. It was a little too soggy at times. 3.5  Crispy Tater tots: they are crispy and seasoned with garlic and parsley. Have it anytime. 'Nuff said. 5  I'm coming back for more.","The sandwiches are pretty good, and the bread in particular is delicious. However, this place is outrageously expensive for a sandwich shop in Brooklyn and the fact that sandwiches aren't accompanied by any sides whatsoever contributes to that. It's hard to get excited about a seemingly simple cafe that charges $16 for a roast beef sandwich in Brooklyn.","Went for a Friday lunch - not crowded at noon. Counter staff and cooks were friendly and answered questions; even wrapping my sandwich when I was finished.I ordered the Capicola roast pork with provolone and broccoli rabe. It came off the griddle so fresh, steam arose on each bite I took. Good portion of meat, everything tasted fresh and not too greasy. They have water glasses and water for free. Seating is a long bench with small tables and chairs for two along it with one bigger table in the back and outdoor seating in the back patio.  Kitchen is open so if you sit near it, your clothes will smell like the kitchen for a little bit. Good casual lunch spot, a tad pricey for sandwiches.",Stocked
518,Not open when they say they are open. Checked at Friday at 1 pm. Please correct your times,Came in to try the Kabob sandwich. Decided to try the lamb and didn't like it at all. So I ate it without the lamb but tasteless. It looks sooo much better than what it tastes like. I'll try the chicken kabob sandwich next time. Fingers crossed.,"I make it a point to check out Yelp restaurants that have 5 out of 5 stars, and Pita Palace didn't disappoint. Besides, when in New York, I have to stick up on as much falafel as I can because FL is lacking in that department.So right away I knew I wanted the veggie platter that is absolutely loaded with a sampling of various dishes (best way to try multiple flavors). I stood and watched while the chef in the back shaped the falafel using special tools and fry them fresh.I decided to eat there so I could get at those falafel while they were hot... simply delicious! Crisp outside, with a very tender inside where you don't even need a knife to cut into them. One of my all-time favorites though is their incredible smoky eggplant spread! It has a hint of spiciness but is truly to die for!Besides, it speaks volumes when you literally eat everything on your plate. Totally try this place out!","Food is excellent, and the owner could not be nicer.Gave me a free rice pudding on my first visit.Get the Chicken Kabob, bring cash.","This place is everything you want out of a neighborhood food spot. It's incredibly tasty, reasonably priced, everyone working there is super nice and efficient. They are also very helpful with food allergies and clearly care about what ingredients they use and what goes into their food. We've since moved away from New York, but we still talk about Pita Palace and wish we had something like it nearby.",This is Palestine heaven. Great falafel. Great owner. We need  such places. The place is clean and friendly.,Pita Palace
519,"I took my Dad who was visiting meeting my soon to be wife's parents to this restaurant last weekend. The people at the front and their valet were awesome people. As soon as we sat down and got our server our experience changed. My family does not drink and when the waiter realized there would be none on his bill his attitude changed towards us.He took our order and basically gave us the cold shoulder until our food came out. Our entrees were cold, and mine was missing- he mentioned they dropped it and had to remake it- which i received 10 minutes late. At the end of our experience I could sense more disgust when i ordered one dessert for my soon to be sister in law from the waiter. When he dropped the check he made sure to mention to me multiple times there is no tip on the bill- I guess he needs the money? Ive served before and never treated someone like a piece of shit, sadly I still tipped the guy at rate because thats who I am. I recommend people to really consider other options in this area which there are plenty. I can think of two Italian restaurants that your experience would be amazing.","Got there at 2:15 pm, place was almost empty and service was horrible. Took the waiter 20 mins to bring drinks, we asked for a high chair and they never brought it so we went to get it, bread was never offered until we asked for it, we ran out of drinks and guy never cared. Took them 1.5 hours to serve our meals, unreal! Just the worst place to eat. If there was a zero start I would give it to them.",Awesome views and clean dining area. For my first and last experience the service was horrible. It took the server 10 minutes to come to the table to ask if i wanted water and the place wasnt busy. The soup came before the water so im basically choking on salty lobster bisque. When the drinks did come he asked me if i was dining alone n i told him no my date is coming and his words were 'I was just asking' in the most condescending tone he could muster up. Jokes normally come with laughs n his face was stone serious to a point that the guest at the next table were even confused by his statement. After my date arrived the waiter made it a point to only address my date. The food was lack luster and I could have gotten it anywhere else. Definitely will not be going back.,"Went here for my birthday dinner and the food was phenomenal. Unfortunately, I only have pictures of the pizza which was great, but we ordered so many different goodies and everybody loved everything they ate.The truffle pizza is amazing! The margherita wasn't as great as the truffle pizza. But everything else was awesome. We got the burrata, bruschetta, baked clams, mussels in wine, and fried mozzarella. Everybody got different entrees and I was able to try some- the pork chop was great. The truffle pasta was great too. My friends said the gnocchi were excellent.","Awesome entrance and views. Easy to make a reservation and have the table ready. Came as a large party for a graduation celebration. Small parking lot on premises but you can park outside in the middle of the meridian on Emmons Ave (No muni meter was seen so free?)Very friendly staff and so helpful.Loved some of the pasta dishes, the pasta al salmone was the only gripe. Salmon had too much butter cooked with it. But otherwise, the vongole, Pizza and gnocchi was incredible.Received drink orders and complimentary bread quite quickly. Olive oil pours are ready for you on the table. When you receive your food, you can have on table cheese sprinkling or a server come by to perform that service as well.The seasonal sangria was to die for.THE VIEWS. THE BAY. THE BOATS. AMAZING.",Small parking lot but not bad for the areaStaff was very friendly and prompt to fill your drinksFood: I had the Burrata and was delicious and the margarita pizza and crust cooked perfectly.Would definitely revisit this place.,il Fornetto
520,"There aren't many AYCE hot pot options around Flushing that I've found, which is a little surprising. Maybe I'm jut not looking hard enough, or maybe AYCE is not a sustainable business model around here for whatever reason.99 Flavor Taste is A-OK. When it gets busy you can share a table with another small party if you're dining solo or a group of 2. This makes for an awkward dining experience, since the shared tables aren't long or rounded, they're just a typical booth. No deduction here though, since you can always come early or wait for a table.Mostly, there's just nothing interesting or outstanding about the ingredients, service, selection, or flavors here. If you're in the mood for AYCE hot pot, I'd say you can go here and feel alright after. Not wowed, but not super disappointed. Precisely a 3/5 experience.",Will update this after the meal - made some edits. Will keep you all posted!Seriously - will do.,I'd say good not great. Had the kimchi hot pot and bbq. Broth was good nothing special. Same with their bbq and their ingredients.Don't care to come back reallyWhat really upset me was how much food they let go to waste. They should put a limit as to how many things people can order at a time or something to prevent so much waste. So I don't support that aspect.,"If you're looking for a quick bite, this is NOT it and you're going to feel very 2-star about this space. However, if you're willing to wait this is a fabulous experience. Get on the waitlist, go get some ice cream to burn 40 minutes, come back and wait another 40 minutes. Yep, it took time to get in y'all. But the wait was WORTH. We did the hot pots (1 spicy, 1 pork bone). You are able to choose up to three flavored soup bases, with prices fluctuating by amount and age of customer. From this point on it's essentially an all you can eat extravaganza. Be sure to mix and match sauces. The meats and veg were fresh and neatly prepared; we loved the white fish, beef, lamb, enoki, and spinach. Okay... we loved all of it. We left with full bellies, clear sinuses, and messy shirts (don't wear your fancy clothes people).","We came here for lunch on Saturday. It's a pretty popular place so if your party is more than 4, you should try to get a reservation ahead of time. Overall we found the restaurant was well organized and service was fairly quick. They were able to accommodate our non-pork broth request with veg-based broth. As far as flavors go, I did not find the food or broths much different from other hot pots I've been to. The sauce station was also ok with the peanut, sesame, and soy variations you see at other hotpot places. The value in this location is that it's all you can eat so make sure to come hungry! Out of the fresh ingredients, we enjoyed the beef, mushrooms, squid, spinach, and pumpkin the most.",Best place food is good worth the price They help you cook the kbbq So you can eat and not worry about cooking,99 Favor Taste
521,"Stopped by on a Monday night. Ordered ramen, and fried chicken, and a Sapporo draft beer. To be honest, the taste is pretty good! However, there several reasons that it's only three stars: 1) the ramen is over price. Even though on the menu it said there are several topping included, when you actually see the ramen you will realize the amount is small. 2) service is not very professional. I am not happy that a quarter of my beer is just foam. 3) NO AC!","Overall, not a bad bowl of ramen, but something was missing in the broth...it felt a little bland.",Ordered on seamless. The ramen and oyakodon were good but the fried tofu was disgusting and reeked of peanuts and was discolored. The Onigiri rice ball was pathetic with tiny flakes of salmon in it. It was just basically a ball of white rice with seaweed wrap. Wont be ordering from here again.,"First time having this place and it was amazing!It was like 66 degrees but I want ramen, I know y'all. LolBUT, I wanted spicy so I got the Lunch A: SakuraJima with 2 toppings for the special. I got an egg and kimchi. The egg was soft boiled which I forgot meant it was still boiled just runny in the middle. Yummy still.I LOVED the packaging! The broth separate from the noodles and toppings. Everything was pretty cold once it got to me, but I had a microwave and it's broth so who's really complaining? Also ordered a pork bun. YAALLLLL! So SOFT and the pork literally melted in my mouth. Didn't get to chew. Spicy mayo and cucumber was the perfect ratio and it was an amazing snack to munch on while slurping my ramen. Delivery man woke up the baby I was nannying for when I specifically asked not to buzz and to call, BUT, the food made up for that...a little. $30 lunch but I ate it ALL and enjoyed every second. I'll be back.","This is probably one of my favorite ramen place to go to in downtown Brooklyn. I have to compliment their interiors because when you first walk in, it feels like you went to Japan for food. The staff were very polite and the service was very quick. We ordered an house salad with 3 choice of dressings which are yuzu, spicy, and seasame. We picked the yuzu dressing with our house salad. Then we got our ramens. We ordered the Kagoshima ramen and ibusuki ramen. All the food came pretty quickly. It took about probably 20 minutes to arrive so the service was fast and quick. One thing I like about this place was their house salad with their yuzu dressing. I have to give all 5 stars for this salad. All ingredients were fresh and it had a good amount of portion to share with someone else or you can eat it yourself. I think one ingredient that made this salad so good was the yuzu dressing. It pulled out all the flavors in the salad. There is a bit of tangy, sweet, and sour flavor which made it delicious. Definitely coming back for this salad again. Next is the ramen. Both ramen had their good portion serving but it was a bit salty for both ramens. The broth was a bit salty but the chau sau wasn't too fat and it was very juicy and flavorful. The ramen has a chewy texture which makes the noodles not too hard to chew. But everything was good other than the salty broth. I would definitely come back for their house salad because it was delicious. If you are a absolute ramen fan like me, definitely give this place a try!!!!","Menya Jiro's claim to fame is that they competed and won in a number of ramen contests a couple of years in a row. Their most popular tonkotsu broth is punched up with the addition of chicken broth, so I imagine it's a deeply satisfying meal in the winter. Since I don't consume pork I can't speak to the main event at most ramen restaurants, and my experience with vegetarian ramen is that the veg bowls are often added as an afterthought. Umami is difficult to create with meatless broths so it's really impressive when they can achieve a nuanced vegetarian broth. Menya Jiro's vegetarian ramen was decent, but my friends were wow'd by their tonkotsu ramen.What I can speak to is the takoyaki, which was very good. They held up well and had a perfectly crisp exterior and flavorful interior.  A great option if you're in the area.",Menya Jiro- Brooklyn
522,The noodles were ok. I wasn't  blown wby the selection. Not sure if I would go back again,"Judging by the massive positive reviews of this place, I would expect the food to be a lot better than what I had. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The price for the quality of the food is not worth it in my opinion. I do appreciate how fast and how well they package the food for take out. However, the flavors and the overpriced dishes were not so accommodating. Maybe I ordered take out on a bad day? We'll see. But for now, I don't think I'll come back to this place again.","Decided to give it a 2nd shot:Improvements:-the beef stew & tendon noodle soup was slightly better than expected-the pan fried dumplings came with dipping & chili sauce Still lacking:-the overall taste... the beef broth is way too salty, way too oily, and too heavy on the cilantro... -the beef pancake is lackluster -the pork chop over noodle soup was mehI think 3 stars is generous for good effort... seriously compared to Xi'an when I first had hand-pulled noodle inside a Flushing Mall basement food court back in the days, nothing has blown me away... yet. I wouldn't give it another go though. #happyfoodhunting **********************************************Quantity - not much of Quality, review for their take-out:We ordered a bunch of items via the Yelp App ($5 discount! Yay!) - efficient - delivery took about 30mins. Let's put it in perspective, Hand Pull Noodle is about 10 blocks & 1 Avenue away... I guess it's decent. What we ordered:-3 Hand pulled noodle soup (beef tripe $5.75, beef stew & tendon $6.95, and beef tail (oxtail) $7)-1 beef pancakes $3.75-2 scallion pancakes $5 ($2.50 each)-2 panfried pork dumplings $9 ($4.50 each)-radish salad $2.50Total bill about $39.95 Good value for the amount of food BUT the quality was definitely lacking & not worth the consumption. -Noodle Soups, for the price it was such a disappointment in terms of flavor and ingredients.  The soup was supposed to be beef stock, all we tasted was fillers of preserved veggies & cilantro.  DON'T get me started on the amount of actual pieces of beef tail & beef stew & tendons... I would be embarrassed as the owner to send ""scraps"" to their customers.  Instead of actual pieces of beef stew & tendons - we got tiny chunks and 2 slivers of tendons... WTF?!?!  The beef tail were tiny pieces of bones, cut to paper thin... this one is a TOTAL waste.  - beef pancake was bland and tasteless.. didn't come with dipping sauce - we had to improvise with home made vinegar dip to save this dish. -pork dumplings were OK (there are so much better ones!)-scallion pancakes were more like sliced paper... I also notice the prices for take out is slightly higher than ordering at the restaurant through pictures, I hope I'm wrong. I can't believe I recommended this place for dinner; there are so many better options for noodle soup in what I call ""Old Brooklyn""... vs. the ""Fancy Brooklyn"" in Park Slope/Carroll Garden etc...   overall a COMPLETE FAIL for us.","I've been ordering from this restaurant for years and usually order the same thing every time. When I first started ordering from this restaurant there was little if any evident hospitality when I called to place an order. I felt as if they just didn't need my business so I stopped ordering from them for a while. I have ordered from countless Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood as there is an endless variety to choise from. Fast forward to today and calls are met with a very professional and courteous reception, and the food has always been fantastic. Whoever owns this place genuinely cares and it is reflected in the consistency and caliber of the cuisine they make on any given day.  I order 1 to 2 times a week now for years and have never been disappointed. Someone out there genuinely recognizes and appreciates the consistent work you are doing at Hand Pull Noodle to perform at the level that you are.Bravo!...and thank you!","I came here today with my husband and we ordered to share: 1) hand pulled noodle with beef, 2) garlic short ribs, 3) fried dumplings, 4) scallion pancake with beef. Food was not horrible, but a bit on the mediocre side. The noodles did not taste freshly hand pulled and were not that bouncy. The soup tasted like it was full of MSG. The garlic short ribs tasted good but was very greasy and salty. The fried dumplings were alright, very meaty and doughy. The scallion pancake with beef was the worst I had.Staff was nice. Food came out very fast. Food was mediocre.","Stopped by today after a trip to the Russian bath house. I figured the cold weather and the snow coming in what would be better than a bowl of noodle soup.  I have never been to this place and I was really hoping for good things.Hand Pulled Noodles w/Roast Duck -  I'll start with the noodles are TERRIBLE, It was not freshly pulled, it actually tasted like it was cooked once and cooked again when I ordered it. It was not ""Q"" at all. What saved this place is the soup. The soup was delicious, probably one of the best I have ever had. It kept me going and I finished the noodles because I needed something to go with the soup. The roast duck portion was fair I had half a leg which is more than you would usually get in a soup dish.Would I recommend this place? Yes-ish, I would say ask for knife cut noodles and see if they can do it for you. If not I would order some dumplings and get soup on the side. I say skip the noodles unless you see someone pulling it.",Hand Pull Noodle and Dumpling House
523,"Ordered a ""Philly Cheesesteak"" last night and did not receive anything like a philly. It was more like a sloppy joe. Asked for Mayo to be on the side. Mayo was on the sand which. Paid for extra cheese and there was barely any cheese on it. Paid for extra meat that was not even philly meat it was ground beef. My sandwich was cold. Not worth ordering from here.",This place can have a long line and you gotta keep your spot but they make one hell of a sando,"I want to love this place, but I have been physically threatened each and every time I come into this establishment. I wait patiently each and every time, and am cut in line by multiple aggressive patrons who then heckle me, harass me, and tonight, I was assaulted outside after asserting to another patron that I was in line before them waiting. Do not come here.","Great deli. Had the chipotle chicken hero. Loaded with thin-sliced goodness, veggies, on a nice hero roll. About the same price as a Subway sandwich, but leagues above.This is how great deli is done.",This been my favorite place since I was 5 yrs old..the store been here well over 30 years and still and still will be the best sandwich in brooklyn..Alot of people just realize how good their sandwiches are.. Mostly other folks that move in the area within the last few years...I would never go to another store to get my sandwiches,"Had a chopped turkey sandwich when i was visiting family and by far .. BEST SANDWICH EVER !! had the sandwich in January, still talking about it now!",Farmer In the Deli
524,"If you get here as soon as the doors open, you'll be just fine. Early weeknights are always easiest. The pasta is homemade and always delicious. The ravioli is my favorite. The last time I was there I had the duck ragu, it was a bit salty but still decent. The only minor complaint I have is the customer service. Usually it's great. Last week, not so much. My family and I stopped in, exhausted, after a long day of errands, wearing casual jeans and tees, and maybe a messy ponytail or two. Our waitress barely checked on us during the meal and when she did it was rushed and impersonal. Yet I was highly amused watching her ooze charm and frequent check ups on the table next to us dressed in business casual with Chloé bags. I would have left her a lower tip for her lack of service and her obnoxious bias (towards normal exhausted families on weeknights?! Haha) but my elderly parents are saints and left her a generous tip- so instead here's a YELP review.","I'm honestly don't get the fuss about Al Di La. It's fine, the food is good - although I always find their pasta dishes to be too salty - but I find it very expensive for the size of the portions and service can be very spotty. There are far better Italian places in the area in my opinion. Also, on our last visit, we had a very unpleasant experience with the maitre d' - we were invited by a friend who loves the restaurant with a group totaling 5 people on a Sunday night. Two people from the group got stuck in horrible traffic. We ordered two starters and a not cheap bottle of wine. At 30 minutes past our reservation time, we ordered our own mains and also ordered mains for the two missing people who were by then 10 minutes away. The next thing we knew, two people were seated in the seats for the missing guests. When we said something, the maitre d' got very nasty.  I could understand if they were losing money on the empty seats but we were ordering food for five - oh yes, and another bottle of wine by that point.  Based upon that experience I would like to give Al Di La only one star, but that wouldn't be fair, so I'll keep the three and just not go back.","Pretty average for the price of the food. We ordered the Squid Ink Spaghetti, Spaghetti Vongole, and the Braised Rabbit (not impressed for $29 to get a small portion) to share. The pasta was okay but I was underwhelmed by the small portion of the Braised Rabbit and it's lack of flavor (it was $29)! Our check came out to be around $76 + tip. Dont think I would come back.The table behind us was also being very loud and I couldn't really hear our conversations.","When I saw two authentic Northern Italian items on the menu that I had in Italy, I knew I had to try this place out. We ordered the Trippa alla Toscana (Tripe stewed in white wine and tomatoes) and the Calf Liver alla Veneziana. Unfortunately, they ran out of liver that day (womp womp), so I ended up ordering the Tagliatelle al ragu.I don't even like tripe and I thought the stew was delicious. It reminded me of the tripe stew I had in Florence and Rome. The stew was well seasoned and the tripe did not taste like tripe! It wasn't chewy or rubbery. There was plenty of bread to soak up all the rich sauce from the stew.The tagliattelle was cooked al dente. You could tell that the pasta was freshly handmade. The sauce was flavorful and plenty.We finished off our heavy meal with some espressos.I'm sure to come back soon, but this time to try the traditional calf liver.","Came here for dinner with family and was seated right away. I ordered one of their specials with wide pasta and a Duck ragu. The food waa good, though it could use a tad bit more flavor. And portion wise, I can't complain, though some other plates on the menu looked like it was made for children. The service was quick and attentive. And since we came near closing time, the atmosphere wasn't bad. Overall I was satisfied, I would come back again.","This is my 2nd time dining at Al Di La. It's a nice neighborhood restaurant, but I wouldn't rate it as one of the top Italian restaurants in the city. The service was slow for NY standards. The octopus appetizer was delicious, with lots of garlic. The tagliatelle pasta was also very good, very robust flavor. I ordered the rabbit for my main, which was ok as it had a lot of salt.",Al Di La Trattoria
525,Under new management....Trash. Been a FP member since 2008. Don't charge ppl $5 to have a good time. I understand its business....but now ur like the spots in Manhattan and DT. Fuck the new managers and bartenders,Not a fan 1. Always a long wait2. Food is similar to eating at McDonald's 3. Overpriced 3b. Would not recommend,"I heard so many good things about this place, but I was reaaaaaally underwhelmed. The bouncer was rude, the people inside were messy and creepy as hell, and the drinks were alright. The outdoor area was nothing special.","Franklin Park has been a neighborhood staple for yearssss. Daytime: chill vibe, burgers are pleasant and they have a good happy hour. Nighttime: There's always a good mix of people, and everyone's trying to have fun so there will always be a memory. Turns into a dance floor inside, and there's a back bar that's also fun. Friday's and Saturday nights it can either be crowded or empty and you'll still have fun. The Dj plays inside and in the back whichever cool bartender is working will make sure the vibe is right too. Alex and Micha are the absolute best!","Listen - I love Franklin Park. Food is good from Dutch Boy and the patio is great. But some things are changing. Now you have to see a host to be seated outside, maybe this is best for during meal times as you'll actually have a server come to you quickly. Also, they now include 18%. tip in a 4 person table bill before you sign, then include an additional line for tip. Usual practice for tip included is 6people. I'm a person who almost always tips 20% and I definitely didn't notice this (my bad) so I ended up adding 20% in tip on top of the rest of the bill. Our server did not let us know that gratuity was included. This isn't illegal but it's a sneaky to not let people know you are including gratuity in the bill. Don't make the same mistake I did! Read every line of the receipt! Even if you've been having a good time with your friends because it's Franklin Park and it's gorgeous outside!","Came on a Saturday night for some drinks around 10ish was decent ant of crowd as the hours passed it got more crowded. The music selection is not too wide, but passable if you're with the right crowd. The entrance is through the back of Dutch Boy Burger (which has some decent food options nothing over the top special). I liked the outdoor patio area with benches and tables (which also offers another bar in the cut) to chill on a good day. Drink prices are fair, however I did order a shot and def tasted watered down but I saw him pour it directly from the bottle that can be revisited. Nonetheless cool little spot to chill out with friends and catch up in Crown Heights. Would go back",Franklin Park
526,Calzones are amazing. Something you have to try! its unbelievable.By the summer their will be a line down the block every day before opening. So lucky to live a block away.,Decor was dated. Annoying oldies music. Food was spot on! I'd give 5 stars if the decor and music was more updated. Pizza was delicious. Calzone was light and tasty! Salad was quite large. Large pie and salad feeds 3-4,"We really like it here. It's casual and cozy, the salads are large & yummy (we've tried 3), and the pizza is outstanding. But, tonight we weren't thrilled to hear that if you want to pay by credit card, they add on a percentage - annoying and not cool. And FYI - they just got their liquor license. Signs are posted up about it.","My fiancee and I moved around the corner from Lombardo's about 4 months ago and I regret not having made it in sooner. The pizza was amazing, truly some of the best I've had. So much care clearly went into selecting the ingredients and making the pie and it shows. Initially we anticipated taking some home since we got a big salad and large pizza, but we killed the entire thing right then and there. It was that good, eating it any time but right after it was made fresh felt like sacrilege. Service was wonderful, too.We'll be back far more often than we have been so far. Amazing place!","Pizza was fantastic. Rustic ingredients and a taste anyone would be mistaken to call anything but high quality. My brother and I got a margarita pizza and my parents split a pie with prosciutto, mushroom, and artichoke hearts and they were nothing short of memorable. We have been to over 25 pizza places in our lives and Lombardo's has solidified its position in my top 3 for sure!","This place is super close to my job and I'm not really sure what made me curious to go in, but I have absolutely no regrets. Cute little romantic spot. Seems like we went on a night with a lot of family and wailing babies. It was a mixed dynamic between couples and families.Our waitress was very sweet. She was extremely attentive and filled our drinks immediately and consistently. She was on top of all her tables. It was two women managing the floor and they had it down to a science.The pizza we had was so amazingly fresh and delicious. The pepperoni was nothing like I've had before. Real artisian like pizza. I can't wait to go back.",Lombardo's of Bay Ridge
527,"2 stars is only because of the decent happy hour prices. I ordered 2 easy dishes,both which were served to me from rancid food. I mean down right nasty. The French fries were fried in rancid Oil and the chicken I ordered must have been 2 weeks a old. I am still sick over this. Not acceptable I had eaten here once before and that wasn't great. Guess only drink bottled liquor/ wine/ beer here.  Eat the food at your own risk !!",I learned what a well drink was here.Food for thought: if a chicken had lips could it whistle?,"Me and my 2 brown friends went out to dinner at this cafe. We paid the bill and the tip and the waitress  here literally charged us and asked us if we were foreigners or not and that we look like we don't go out in NYC and we don't eat out a lot. We are brown and she asked us multiple times if we are familiar with America. We kept telling her we're from NYC and she kept saying she thinks we aren't, this question was brought up more than 5 times even when we kept answering her and replying to all her questions. She not only interrogated us butaggressively used her tone. It felt like we didn't know how to speak English and that we weren't fit to eat out at a restaurant. We felt degraded and humiliated even though the service was good and we were even willing to tip more. The way she questioned us was blatant racism and classist.","I had the Austro-Cubano, which was well-made. This rating is largely on the sandwich itself, since that was the main piece, though there was a side salad and I also ordered a pretzel. The bread was crispy and flaky, and there was a good amount of meat on it -- definitely a nice twist on the classic Cubano. The side salad was subpar, largely because there was too much salad dressing on it; I highly recommend including the dressing on the side as the standard. Admittedly, I could have asked for it on the side to begin with, but I was not expecting so much. I'm not huge on side salads in general, so I didn't care much about this. The pretzel could have been much better for $4; I understand that this is mainly just a bar snack to accompany a beer or whatever, but this is about the same quality (at a smaller size) as a street cart pretzel. Overall, the pretzel was regrettable. Again, this rating is largely on the sandwich, which was delicious.

Wursts, schnitzel, soups, salads, good beers - they're always perfect. You have to like this kind of food of course and the low key ambience, but after going here for 20+ years it's never let me down.","Perfect German comfort food, if there is such a thing.  Wonderful weisswurst, schnitzel, chicken paprika, a great bread pudding dessert, and a terrific black beer on tap.  In fact a really good beer selection.  Really, what more could you want?  Not fancy or expensive.  If you want that, go to Blau Ganz.",Cafe Steinhof
528,"The Mac and cheese burger was good and filling. The pizza burrata was cold, that how it comes. It wasn't not my favorite, I don't like cold food. It also didn't have much favor.","Although I was so excited about this place I was quite disappointed. I came here mainly for the infamous Mac & Cheese Burger. For appetizers we got Avocado bruschetta & Risotto Balls. The bruschetta was just mushed Avocado toast but I will say the Risotto balls where really good which is why I gave them a 3 and not a 2 star review.  Then we got the Mac & cheese burger which was a disappointment. The meat was bland, tasteless & hard, the Mac & cheese bun fell apart as soon as picked up . I was so sad  This was my cheat meal. The desert was even more disappointing, we had the Drunken Cookie & it was supposed to be a baked cookie filled with chocolate but there was 10x more melted chocolate then cookie and it was like eating liquid Nutella from a cup. Have The : - Risotto Balls Don't Have - Mac & Cheese Burger - Drunken Cookie",Poor customer service- made me lose my appetite while I was eating because I was being rushed when my food was just delivered to the table a few minutes ago. And clearing the table when we just began eating?? That was a terrible experience.,"Great burger with a side of nonchalant service. I am not into leaving ehhh complaining, whinny reviews but this place got under my skin. I was born and bred as we say in this neighborhood. We pioneered & survived through decades when no one cared for Williamsburg. This neighborhood was once a slum to many but we saw it as our neighborhood & it slowly transformed into a butterfly but many of the folks that helped this neighborhood exist & grow were priced out.. Many  of the mom and pop shops that once grew the neighborhood were vanished.  So anything that resembles what can possibly become a stable we like to visit, support, frequent, & champion. We thought we were headed to do just that on this particular night. We has passed by this establishment while in movement a bunch of times and it never seemed very inviting however, this night we said let's stay local and give it a shot. Maybe we were prejudging the exterior vibe. So we went in and were seated with a very blah attitude like they were doing us a favor. I should have trusted by gut and just turned around and made my way to the exit. Instead we stood. We were handed the menus by a server that just gave us the blankest look you  could give. Our server did not even fake a smile, nor suggested anything, no specials, no fan favorites nothing. Just stood there just waiting with the whenever you are ready look. I am from Brooklyn, I don't need cartwheels, firecrackers or parade like enthusiasm. However, please say something. So we just decided on the regular burger & my husband selected the Mac & cheese burger. The server gave us tap water. I asked for a straw our server passed by our table several times. I finally just got up gave myself the straw from the bar. The person in charge of our table never returned to replenish our water or to ask if we required anything else. Again I don't need anyone asking 100 questions but after 10-15 take a look see,  throw up some sign of life. Our food was brought out and placed on the table. Our server never returned during our food arrival to ask if everything was ok, or if it  cooked was it to our desired temperature. No one returned to ask if we required additional utensils or ketchup anything at all. I finally flagged down another serious face gentlemen to ask for ketchup, he had numerous other regular conversations and no major concern to bring the ketchup as, then when I was about to get up to get it he saw and brought it to me. Time continued to pass and no one checked on us. After maybe 20 minutes of  being done with our meal in hopes someone would acknowledge us and ask if we cared for dessert, or if we would like our check, I flagged down the gentlemen that was not to pressed to bring my ketchup. I asked him for the check, he said yes and carried on talking this went on for an additional 10 minutes now, I am getting very annoyed. So I waved again and he motions towards what I thought was to print my bill but nope then I see our server walk past, so now we are going on an additional 10 minutes.  I ask for our check. Our server disappears then I wave to the man again, he finally brings the bill. Our table attendant brings my bill also. I give the server my card & it is charged. Then the server kind of sloppily attempts to put the receipt on the table, not in a mean way but not in an oops my bad way either, the paper flys somewhere under the table. The server does not care & carries on, they both carry on & I am practically under the table looking for the darn receipt with my phone light on because it is so dim in there. I was so highly disappointed. I will never return again. I am not a visitor in my neighborhood. I am a lifetime resident of Williamsburg. I am not visiting here, I am not traveling here, I was born here, and I will not be treated less than in my own community. The burger was a solid 4 stars The fries were too salty,  we could not eat more than two since our water was never replenished, Incase we attempted to try and finish them. We could not even request another batch with less sodium because no one checked on us. The service was blank and nonchalant, not mean but definitely not warm either. They definitely gave us a why are you here vibe.I hope that this establishment takes some time to focus on kindness towards their Patrons. People come and people go but how well and kind you treat those that frequent is what makes committed loyal customers. It does not have to be like CHEERS where everybody knows your name. Just a warm greeting & a smile, will do. I do not know if the staff is overly worked or this is just the vibe here but either way. ""You attract more flies with honey ..... Shoutout to the cooks making the good burgers.","Oh my I love this place! The staff is the absolute loveliest. Went with a group of friends a couple weeks ago and our waitress was immediately on our team when one of my friends wanted shots immediately (long story), she even chilled them which was a total game changer.Only thing I'd warn about is that when we were there they had the door open rather than AC so it was pretty warm.All and all though it reminded me of some of my favorite pubs in London and I will definitely be back.","There are some places that are above and beyond the hype, and some places that focus on making trendy items for the sake of trend and gram fame with lacking execution. This place is the latter of the two. We first ordered the pizza burrata, which had great flavor, the marinara inside really made it. However, the drawback was that there were bits of the burrata itself that were a little too cold, almost with a frozen texture, but that's the only thing. The marinara was great, could've had that on the side of it too. I got the Arnold ""alcoholic"" Palmer and that was VERY good. You could tell it was a drink, but not something that felt hard to get down, and normally I don't like vodka. The place it started going downhill was the steak with the chimichurri sauce. The steak itself with the sauce was great, cooked to the temp we asked, but was insanely small for the price, and definitely didn't look to be the size on their instagram, which was misleading. We asked for a side salad and ordered an extra side of sweet potato fries, both of which were way below the standard we expected from again their instagram account and their menu price. The salad needed some salt or pepper, not just vinegar (and I assume oil, couldn't taste it) to dress. The sweet potato fries were a huge disappointment, not cooked all the way through, the center felt like biting through an uncooked potato, so we sent those back. Overall, the steak tasted good but the salad and the size were not worth the price, the burrata was good but could have been a little less chilled on the bottom. I would recommend asking questions, don't just go off of insider videos or instagram, and actually get things that you like, don't just do it for hype.",The Bedford
529,"The customer service and organization  for this place has significantly diminished over the years. I came in last night around 6PM, and it seemed to be pretty crowded. I get to the register to place my order and the young lady says that she's not taking any orders for the next 7 minutes because the kitchen is backed up on orders. This is just unacceptable. The kitchen staff should be fully staffed and prepared for the after work crowd. The fact that no orders were being taken completely turns other customers off. If it wasn't for the the heavy rain, I would have went somewhere else. Not to mention, the general manager who kept screaming at the kitchen staff for all the customers to hear. Totally unprofessional.  Once I finally placed my order, I had to wait another 20 minutes to finally get my food. The saving grace was that my food was fresh and tasty! Management needs to do a better job at training their staff!","Always packed no matter what time of day you get here . However food is delish, it keeps me coming back for more everytime until I remember how slow the service is. Took 20mins today to get my grilled chicken burger and thats considered fast. - Blah that's like half my lunch break.  =[ They now accept online orders for pick up via seamless and smashburger.com -  I'll def have to try that next time I'm craving for a juicy & tender grilled  chicken. Smash fries are a MUST. And also oreo shake w no whip cream. YUM!","As of May 1st they changed the menu, they no longer sell turkey burgers and they have a limited selection of chicken burgers. Since I don't eat beef, the turkey burgers and buffalo chicken sandwich was my go to. After this recent visit I settled with a spicy Baja with guac laced with chicken and it didn't flow right and the quality of chicken didn't taste right so I won't be returning even tho I live near by","Honestly, this is the best Smashburger I've ever had in my life. The cashier was patient with me as I was indecisive, my meal was prepared correctly, quickly, and freshly. I am very satisfied and very much less hangry. If I lived here, I would be here everyday. Take my money","The food looks so much better than it tastes. It's like a hot guy w/ no soul. You try it once and then it's not so hot looking anymore. There were some good things about Soulless Burger though:1. Convenient location2. Though it's counter service, they give you a big number to put on your table and bring you your order when it's ready 3. Fried pickles arrived hot and with a tasty ranch like sauce-It's a bit pricy for an upgraded McDonalds.-Nothing, except the pickles were hot. My son said he'd gone before and loved his milkshakeI, but this is a kid who thought Tasti D-Lite was the best frozen yogurt. Yeah.",Yo what an interesting chain restaurant. On my most recent visit. I ordered my food and verbally said my order twice. They gave me my shake a good 10 minutes before i get my food. Hmmm why would you do that. When i finally got my food and was leaving my shake melting. So im hungry. I didn't have time for tge shenanigans. Get back to the office both burger orders wrong. I look at my burger its not juicy but it costs about 8.69... hmmm right. I go back very nice employee assists me. Im appreciative. I wont be coming back though. It don't feel right with me to pay like 8 bucks for a burger that looks like it wasn't even meat but fillers. I deleted the app and unsubscribed from them. You will never get these dollars again.,Smashburger
530,"Sad to say Sonora has officially become touch and go. Today I ordered salmon only to find that it was cooked like a brick-- chewy and overdone to the point of being inedible. The margaritas we ordered were also saccharine sweet. More or less a diabetic coma in a cup. When I asked them to prepare me a new piece management refused and told me I would be charged full price. Suffice it so say, my enthusiasm for this new arrival to the neighborhood has all but disappeared. F minus for customer service. this is one establishment where the customer is NOT always right. Couldn't be more disappointed.","I was excited about coming to this neighborhood restaurant. The first time I've been here I ordered out so the experience of dining in was exciting and new. But boy did things change. My friend and I ordered food and drinks together along with chips and guacamole for the table right away. 40 mins later and the food had still not arrived. When we asked the waiter (who had not been to our table once to check in during this time) he looked at us blankly and said ""what food?"" No exaggeration. Not only did he forget to put in our order and check on us, but when it did come out (30 mins after that) he did not apologize, or offer to compensate or anything for the food. We even asked to speak with the manager and we were told he wasn't there and the cook WILL NOT L compensate food that had already been eaten. (Mind you, it had been an hour of waiting, we were starving and of course we're going to eat the food). It goes without saying that we did not leave a tip, and no matter how convenient it is, will not be returning for dinner here. Such a shame.","I order from Sonora about twice a month, never with any issues... however, today I called in for a chicken burrito. I found 5 long hairs in it once I got home.",Great Mexican food. Good sized portion food. Plenty of seating with a bar off to the side. Patio in the summer and the drinks are fantastic. Staff was very nice and friendly.,"This place has a decent aesthetic and general appeal - it looks new, they have great lights which are lining the windows so you notice this restaurant while walking by. I finally decided to stop in with a friend and despite being one of four people inside, service was oddly slow. The only thing that isn't off about Sonora is how it looks. This place has so much potential, but falls short in every area that matters, from the food, service, to music and atmosphere.The menu is decent sized but brunch is what I was initially excited about. Unfortunately, both my friend and I didn't enjoy our food at all. We were super hungry so we finished it but it was mid day on a Sunday and the place was basically empty besides us and one other small group.The music was very off and a mood killer - most places play decent mixes or even something that makes you want to stay. Not even comparing it to high end brunch and dinner spots in the city, I wish I had gone to the bodega instead. Our waiter seemed aloof and was super late to bring everything we asked for, including the check. Nothing about Sonora feels inviting and I definitely won't be back, it seems like they should get a better chef consultant to come in and revamp the menu; I was confused as to why everything we ordered was underwhelming or not seasoned enough. We had to ask for all the hot sauces. ALL of them. Honestly I'd only go back for drinks but even then, there are too many other places to justify stopping by until they improve.","- can't beat the unlimited mimosa Brunch   * we were supposed to only get 90 minutes, we definitely got more than that   * waiter added more alcohol to our carafes at our request- Place was not packed Saturday afternoon- food is plentiful- our waiter spoke almost no English  * He screwed up multiple orders  * Friend says he screwed up her order last time as well- I wasn't biggest fan of chimichanga- chimichanga had good reheat value- festive environment",Sonora
531,"GRADE PENDING!!!!Don't eat here.Looks can be deceiving. On arrival I loved the feel of this place, cool artwork, funky music, quirky (drunk/high) staff.30min later....I'm going to skip how bad the service was, oblivious waitress, zero management, drinks taking over 30 min ""the bartender lost your order"" I mean wtf?I've worked in hospitality,  I get it. What I don't get is how disgusting this place is. My partner and I played a game while we waited for our drinks ""count the cockroaches"" When we got to 6 we thought it might be a good idea to leave.Disgusting.","It has been more than 3 years that I am a customer there.  It has been more than a year that we have issues with the service, servers have an attitude.  We received several time our steak not cook as asked and needed to send it back.  Last Sunday I asked a lasagna to start with, I received it with the Entree 45min later!  For 3 years they were offering a bottomless mimosa(unofficial),  last Sunday they brang us mimosas when our glasses was empty without us ordering but they billed us the mimosas!  When we explain to the server they offer us 2 mimosas!  We were 6! They said they did not recognize us so we had to pay the mimosas!  You should have warn us that it changed.  They fixed the problem and contacted us!","I hate to do this but it was the worst experience I have had in a dog's age. We were hosting a party of 15 with a hard out of 9:30. We got there at 7p and not even a drink appeared before 8p. One of my friends brought up the situation the bartender who was ""SO BEYOND RUDE"" my friend was being polite. The waiter seemed to resent the customers. I really think this place put a damper on my weekend. No one was even hungry when the food finally arrived as we were too stressed out we would miss our show. We arrived at 7p to be sure to see a band at 9:45 and we won't be back.","Last weekend my friend invited us at her favorite neighborhood restaurant for brunch. We walked into this amazing artsy patio with couches and flowers all around it, so cute.We sat at the bar as it was pretty hot outside. Started with some cool cocktails they had and bloody Mary's, it was all very fresh and delicious! Pleaseeee order the chicken waffles ! They are outstanding ! We also had French Toasts that came on a skewer with eggs and bacon and salmon eggs Benedict those we also amazing ! We didn't try their desserts but they have chocolate fondue!!!!!! Service was on point, very friendly staff and prices were reasonable. We are definitely coming back I heard their sister restaurant which is attached to next door has live bands and Dj on weekends. Sounds like a great place to hang out.",Happen to stumble upon this little spot due to the original place I was going to eat at being closed for vacation. Not too bad of a place. Cute. Cozy. Chose to sit outside. Small area. But nice. I ordered the handmade mixed mushroom tagliatelle. Which I have to say came out pretty quickly!! I mean in a matter of less than 10 minutes of me ordering it. The flavors of it were really good. Nice amount of garlic. But I found it to be ALOT of mushrooms compared to the amount of pasta. It also looked as if my plate wasn't totally full! Like it was missing some pasta. Or maybe I'm just greedy. LolI also ordered a blood orange margarita which was cute. A little short glass. But just the right amount of alcohol. Overall good spot. Glad I happened to come across it.,"Went here for dinner last night with my mom who is in from out of town. Ambiance is beautiful and staff very friendly. But beware -- any menu item with ""roasted rosemary potatoes"" is actually fried potatoes, basically glorified french fries in square form. No rosemary at all. Pretty disappointing, especially for someone trying to stay away from fried foods. Management should address this.We both ordered the salmon which was very good.",Ringolevio
532,"I love honeygrow. It is one of my favorite places for lunch. However, I was disappointed with my order today.  I ordered my usual spicy garlic noodles and today I decided to pay the extra .50 for extra sauce. When I returned to my office and opened my order, not only did not recieve the extra sauce, I have a container of noodles, vegetables and shrimp with NO sauce.  I tried to call and of course there is an outgoing message but no way to speak with anyone directly or leave a message. Truly disappointed.",I order the curry tofu . So the entire order only has 5 tiny piece of tofu and rest of them are all glasses noddles . And it cost 12 usd . DONT GO THERE .,Had a terrible experience with rude manager recently. The app screwed up our order and gave us the wrong thing and the very nice cashier apologized and said we could keep it and they would make what we ordered. That was very professional and appreciated. Then the manager came over and took back the item she said we could keep and growled that she should not have done that. What outrageous behavior for a manager! He lost a customer and embarrassed a caring employee at the same time!! Unconscionable.,"I am SO HAPPY I FOUND THIS PLACE! Ever since I was recommended this location, I have literally been looking all over NYC for more. I was so pleased with the array of options, and the customizable bowls one can create. They text you when your food is ready, and they have options to go or to eat in. I had a sweet soy noodle bowl with chicken, scallions, spinach, peppers and bean sprouts. However they have salad bowls and rice bowls as an option as well. I was literally licking the bowl clean, it was THAT good.","I give this place 3.5 stars because it has good and bad stuff about it. First the atmosphere is very chill, they have tablets you can order on which I LOVE because it has pictures of the foods and shows pictures of all the ingredients in it and gives you the choice to substitute anything for an ingredient you don't like. They order stir fry and salads. And there's a choice is getting noodles instead of lettuce in your salads which is really cool. I came here twice. The first time I decided to try the garlic stir fry which i found to be extremely oily, like the type where after every single bite you have to wipe your lips with a napkin cause you have a blob of oil on them.. that type of oil. This place looks very healthy oriented so i was kind of disappointed in that but... I gave this place another chance So the second time I came I got a salad and substituted a few things and ended up loving it. But with all my substitutions my salad ending up being a whole $18 which i feel like salads shouldn't cost that much. But even without crazy substitutions an average salad is about $13-$15 which is still a lot. They charge $3 for chicken and $4 for tuna. I am a tuna lover but don't get tuna in your salad... trust me","I usually order the stir-fry with rice. Delicious, but leaves me hungry. It's mostly rice. My wife has ordered the noodle dishes and it's the same thing. The grain or pasta makes up the entire dish. This was really evident today when I took an order to go and turned it over onto a paper plate at work. You can see the rice surrounding the small portion of other food in the middle. What would this plate look like if the rice (the cheapest ingredient) was removed? There would be nothing left. This is the sesame garlic stir-fry with chicken and broccoli. Again, it is delicious, just not very much food. It would be great if they offered a slightly smaller size with a lower price and a slightly larger size with a higher price. I think most people prefer to take a bite of the main ingredients along with the grain or pasta. You're not able to do that the way the dishes are currently prepared because all you're left with is rice after a few bites. I just finished eating this for lunch and I'm already thinking about what else I have to eat. And I'm a smaller guy. A hungry reviewer is not good for business, Honeygrow.Re: Honeygrow's offer to ""assist me"". While I appreciate the offer, I believe that the quantity of food is carefully considered on a corporate level. I don't see that changing unless enough people realize the value is not really there, and they start losing business to other similar spots. Like ""Cava"" for instance, which offer great value and an appropriate quantity of food in my opinion.",honeygrow
533,"i've never been to the brooklyn location, although i must, (i've heard something about wednesday burgers...) but the summer location at riis park is a reason to live.  this is as close to perfect food as i can imagine.  that oven does wonders for a crispy yet yeasty crust, and all the toppings are exceptional.  my only regret is that they don't have a veggie pizza for my vegan gf on the menu.  even so, we've brought our own sautéed eggplant, zucchini, and mushrooms from home and they've put them on her pizza.  the staff are wonderful.if you are down at bay 9, don't miss this stop!","Been wanting to eat here for years, I usually was my car right up the block and have always thought about stopping in to try it out. Boy was I not disappointed. The Meatballs are to die for and the Pizza is fantastic. Great ambience and vibe to this hidden gem.",This place is GARBAGE. We live three blocks away and the pizza arrived completely mangled and un-edible. They blamed the delivery person and then the delivery person blamed the restaurant.,"Tucked away into a little corner off Hamilton Ave, below the Gowanus expressway, Pizza Moto is in what I'd say is quite an odd location for a restaurant. I was led here by the phenomenal reviews on yelp and google and have to say that it lived up to the hype. Pizza Moto more than makes up for its interesting location the moment you walk through the door. The place has a very brooklyn vibe and is a world removed from its rather run down surroundings. We opted for seats at the bar as a tables for 2 looked a little squeezed together in the middle and the bar seats had a view of the open kitchen which I really liked.They had a solid drinks list and although a few of the signature cocktails looked appealing, we decided to go with a couple of glasses of the French reds on offer. Were pretty pleased at our selection. The highlight of the experience however, as it should be, was the pizza. Started with the salsa verde which was a white pie topped with tomatillos and jalapeños. It was positively phenomenal. Loved it so much that decided to follow up with the margherita which was also excellent. I was hoping they would have a few more veggoe choices in the pizza since the pizzas were so incredibly good but unfortunately they have only 3. Hopefully that changes in the future.Will definitely be back here.","I had bookmarked Pizza Moto a while ago and last night we finally tried it. I was not disappointed. When we arrived about 6:15 PM, we were asked if we had reservations which we did not. The greeter was very nice and told us that if she could have the table back by 7:30, we could sit immediately. As we were only splitting a pizza, we said fine (and later we were finished with 30 minutes to spare).We tried the Margherita pizza which was well made and had a superb crispy thin crust from the wood fire. I added their hot oil which had not only a nice kick but great flavor.As others have noted, the tables are quite small and the place gets quite loud but definitely two thumbs up for Pizza Moto!","I've eaten here six or seven times over the past few years, and each time has been completely wonderful.The food is stunning. I ate some peaches with burrata and basil here that I still remember as if it were yesterday. The mushroom pizza is wonderful. I recently had some Kung-Pao squid that was unlike anything I've ever eaten before.The wine is delicious, and they have a very interesting selection.The vibe is always very chill, very engaging, and very stylish. The people who work here seem very grounded, and very good at running the place. Once we we seated back in the kitchen itself, at a special table, and it was just very fun watching the rhythm of such creative and precise chefs at work.Thank you Pizza Moto, you rock!",Pizza Moto
534,"The atmosphere seemed really good at first with small candles on every table. Unfortunately, when the sun set it was too dark to see what I was eating. I tried their seafood bibimbap, soondubu, and fried chicken. Personally, I thought they were all mediocre. The seafood wasn't particularly fresh and the spicy fried chicken was definitely on the spicier side (but I don't hold that against them). Also, note that this place is cash only!","Beware the salt! We got the entree beef stew ""Kalbi Jjim"" and it was VERY SALTY, to the point of being inedible. I'm talking a dehydration level of excessive salt which permeated the pieces of carrot, chestnut and beef, and made the broth itself undrinkable.The condiment sauces also had lots of salt, and the seaweed was tough and stale. Sadly, I got this order ""to go,"" so wasn't able to return it. On a positive note, the dumplings and scallion pancakes were good and not too salty.","This place has a real new brooklyn vibe which means it's relaxed in a somewhat self-conscious way. The servers chat with each other about their latest artistic and theatrical endeavors , exuding a kind of casual cool that makes me a little nervous. There are moms with a lot of tattoos dining. As for the food, I only had a couple of their Korean fusion tacos, but these were overpriced and each featured the tiniest amount of meat. They sort of had the right Korean marinade  but the overall taste was a little off. Amongst all the rave reviews about the food here I don't see any Korean people and I think the people raving have probably not tasted the real thing.","Came here for the first time this weekend and it was amazing! I highly recommend the rice + banchan, spicy mushroom tacos, and the soy ginger wings. This place is cash only though and I'm not sure if they have an atm so just one thing to note.","Little Dokebi is an okay Korean restaurant. It's pleasant looking and has outdoor seating.  Service was efficient but not always winning points for interpersonal skills, in my mind.  One odd moment was when my friend asked if he could get half pork and half veggie mandoo dumplings.  The server immediately replied, ""Absolutely not!""  My friend seemed to think she was teasing or joking, as did I, and asked, ""Seriously?"" The server explained that yes, she was serious, and that she never understands why when she says ""Absolutely not"" customers think it's a joke.  I'd postulate that it's, because it's a very harsh and extreme sounding response.  A simple ""Sorry, our kitchen doesn't do that"" will suffice.  This isn't a big deal- just was exemplary of the sort of tone that was served along with the food.  The food itself was alright. I'm by no means a Korean food expert but I've definitely had better, more authentic Korean food.  With that said I enjoyed the Korean rice cakes, dumplings and the kalbi bbq.  Overall things were pretty salty- and I love salty food.","Little Dokebi is a very interesting spot. Nestled deep in Greenpoint, Little Dokebi is not the kind of Korean restaurant you would normally think to try as it's not as authentic as many people seem to like for their NYC Korean cuisine experience, however, missing this spot would be a mistake.We popped in for dinner and were greeted to a delightful rustic atmosphere, with wood covering most of the surfaces and areas, giving me the feeling of something between a country western film and a spot grabbed out of ancient Korean culture. Food wise, everything seems familiar to someone well versed in Korean cusuine or who frequents K-Town. From the pajeon to the banchan and even the taste of the kaibli we had, everything is delicious and we'll presented. The alcohol selection is also great with a nice selection of imported beers and souju.Do I have any complaints? Well, it's cash only, and while they have an ATM, Id recommend to anyone not to use a non-bank ATM, ever. Not really a knock on Little Dokebi, just an FYI. Otherwise, it was a solid dinner. More of a Brooklyn-esche interpretation of Korean food rather than authentic, but still tasty and worth the trip!",Little Dokebi
535,"Overpriced farm to table. Overcrowded, slow service to boot. $35 Sunday night vegetarian option consisting merely of beans and vegetables. $19 burger that only tastes so-so. We arrived at 515, were seated right away, ordered as we sat down, received food at 630. A long wait for a plate of beans and veg and a burger. Writing this to spare others a long wait for a so-so meal. Shake Shack burgers are better.","My GF and I came here on a cold Saturday night to give this place a try after seeing reviews on the Daily News. We were so excited to try the food but boy was it disappointing. It wasn't busy when we arrived and ordered our food but yet it took almost 35 minutes to receive our food. We ordered the winter salad with bitter greens which wasn't amazing and kind of weird tasting. It felt like they just threw some greens and leftover fruits onto a plate and charge 13 dollars for it. My gf ordered the brick chicken and I got the burger and fries with the side of mac and cheese. When the orders finally arrived we dug in because we were starving after waiting so long. The burger was average and not worth the hype because all the other reviews stated it was one of the best burgers which it was not, shake shack taste better than this burger. The duck fat fries were just KFC looking potato wedges that were over fried. My GF's chicken was dry and salty but the gravy was pretty tasty (only thing good at this place). The mac and cheese was solid nothing amazing. All in all this place was not amazing and the prices were a little expensive for mediocre food.","If you just order duck fries, you will get a potato cut into 4 wedges for $4.5.  It was ok.  Didn't taste like duck fat to me and it was a little too salty for me.  Ordered 1/2 a chicken and braise short ribs. The chicken taste like rotisserie chicken with gravy.  Nothing special.  The short rib was very good. It fell off the bone and it has good flavor.","This place is the hidden gem of park slope.  I swear they cast sorcery on their food because I crave it. A lot. Anyway, this place is special, because their such a great service staff, hostess, and the chef is a boss lady!I've been twice, and definitely will be back.  The first time we went was when I fell in love with their burger.  This second time I opted for something different.  My husband and I split the grilled cheese which, despite the thick bread, was super gooey and yummy.  Buttery bread is always a plus too.My husband ordered the burger and I opted for the brick chicken. HOLY %#*&. This chicken was salty, buttery, tender, briney, and just SO delicious.  Not to mention it's a really generous serving.  Paired with roasted radishes and asparagus, with a perfect pour of gravy, I could eat this all day.The restaurant seats probably 40 comfortably, and has a quaint bar.  It gives off a rustic vibe, but isn't super ""on trend"" if that makes sense. It's a perfect restaurant. So go there, now!","Best burger in Brooklyn, from the bun to the meat to the trimming and 4 duck-fat potato spears.  Incredible.  I like almost everything I ever got here.  It's a really good 3rd date spot; it has the right combination of mood lights, great ambiance, and fun cocktails that my dates always appreciate.   They aren't open Monday or Tuesday, and Sunday follows an interesting formula: pre-fix Sunday supper of the week, or burgers.  I like most of the Sunday suppers, though they are a bit pricey.","Had the Burger and they made a ""fruit punch"" for me. The burger was GREAT!!  Although my bun was a bit charred on the inside, I was so hungry and the Burger itself was so good, I never told them about it.  The drink was very very very good!  Most places don't get my non alcoholic drinks right....they definitely did!  I look forward to trying it again...and no charring next time!!!!",Lot 2
536,What a phenomenal bowl of pho.  I've tried MANY viet places in the area and thus far I'd have to say Hanco's is the most authentic place I've eaten at.  I ordered pho for delivery the other night and the broth was still piping hot - enough to cook the raw sliced beef.   The banh mi sandwiches are also really good.,"I knew before going to Hanco's that I would be a bit disappointed. Besides the fact that it was closer to where I live than other, more authentic Vietnamese restaurants, I really would try to avoid it. I",Bubble tea drew me into Hanco's on a sunny day! Hanco's is a take out type of joint. Not really a restaurant. I ordered a thai bubble tea. It was by far the worst thai tea I have ever had. Eek! Methinks not!!!,"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet, but it's definitely one of my favorites in the area.Loves:+ Your girl needs to get hooked up with a banh mi every now and then and this place delivers. I mean, even their vegetarian chicken is good.+ Price. $8 for a sandwich that gets you full? Hook me up.+ Location. Stone's throw away from the subway (and in my 'hood!)+ Friendly staff.+ Clean space.I will say I have only gotten sandwiches here thus far (I mean, they are SO reliable), but there are other items from rice dishes to bubble tea drinks that looked good. I know, I'll have to try it next time! :)","Came by Hanco's to order food to go and saw a sign which said that you can get 10% off if you order online so I decided to do that. Once I placed my order, I was waiting for my food only to realize that I never got my 10% off. I inquired with the staff and learned that it is ONLY for delivery orders. Ugh. So here's a FYI for anyone trying to do the same. Moving on, I ordered the grilled pork Vietnamese sandwich and the grilled pork rice vermicelli salad. The pork in both were nicely charred, tender and flavorful. The vermicelli dish came with the usual fillings: julienned carrots/ radish, cucumber slices, peanuts, and fried onions. Loved the flavors in this dish. Def will be back. A lot of people seemed to be ordering the bubble tea from here so I'll have to try that next time as well.","I came here for lunch and asked for 2 orders of summer rolls to  go. I've made this same order a couple of times in the past, and both times they put all 4 rolls in one container. When I got back to work I noticed that they'd only given me 2 rolls, so just one order. They were eh. Didn't taste like much, rice paper wasn't fresh. I went back after work and explained the situation. They have several people look at the receipt and then tell me they have to look at the camera. I'm a little annoyed, but shrug it off and say ok and sit down.  But then I'm thinking ""soooo they don't believe me."" They believe there's a possibility I came back hours later to try to get $5.25 worth of free food.""  So I ask them, ""Do you not believe me?"" The young man at the cash register tells me they just have to check. I tell them that if they believed me, they wouldn't have to check. He then says ""well it was 6 hours ago"". So actually defending it. It just felt insulting, and I said so. So I wait about 10 minutes and one of the staff was very nice and apologized, and acknowledged she's made a mistake, and hands me my food. I tell her I want a refund (I know I should have said this before, but I originally wanted the food, I changed my mind after what happened happened). The guy at the front wordlessly hands me my refund. No apology, just the refund. I looked down and away from him, so I'm not sure what else he did. I get that restaurants have a small profit margin. I get that they have to protect themselves. I do. But to be made to wait 10 mins over $5.25 felt insulting. And honestly, it made me feel really sad.",Hanco's
537,"I wanted to love Blanca, I really did. We came at end of August for my fiancè's birthday and made our reservation well in advance, as the 11-person seating fills quickly.  I loved how it was set up-- entering through Roberta's and being escorted through the backyard to the private kitchen/dining counter. I loved the staff-- the sommlier was funny, attentive and witty with interesting pairings (although I could have lived without the sake pairing;) the waiter and waitress never allowing my water glass to go half full, providing commentary on each course and prompt service. I loved the ambiance-- modern open kitchen with Edison bulbs, stark white decor, vinyl spinning an eclectic mix and a giant Marlin on the wall.  It didn't feel pretentious or showy. But sadly, the food fell short. I have to say, overall I enjoyed the tasting menu. The highlight for me was the Roberta's pizza bread, baked fresh before our eyes. I liked the ravioli. I enjoyed the caviar and the custard. But some of the uni courses were a bit too much, especially the pasta with uni.  I also didn't enjoy the foie gras course or the warm tomato course. Frankly, I expected to be blown away by this menu and was sad that the best part was pizza dough. Also, Chef Mirarchi was noticably absent. If you have two seatings nightly for a total of 22 guests, the executive chef should be present. Had I been advised he would not be preparing our meal, I probably would have made a different choice.  I also have to add that I got violently sick after I returned home, throwing up 21 times and reliving my entire meal well into the next day. I actually thought I was going to die, with no exaggeration, and was moments away from going to the hospital (thank God for Pedialyte!)  Not surprising, the uni and pasta course was the first thing to make a second appearance, completely undigested, (sorry for the graphic details,) leading me to believe something in that dish was bad.  When my fiancè contacted Blanca at 1pm the next day to let them know how sick I got, their response was that ""no one else complained."" No follow-up. No apologies. No conversation with a manager. Nothing after a very expensive meal that was supposed to be celebratory. I once got sick at Red Robin and their investigation and customer service was better than this Michelin star place.  I am adding a star for the service and staff the night of. But the menu wasn't that spectacular and the fact that I got so sick coupled with the complete disregard of the staff the next day and Chef Mirarchi's absence completely ruined this experience for me. Go to Aska instead.","Decent effort, albeit slightly spotty; nonetheless, it was enjoyable!Food didn't come out until ~6:15pm because one person was late.  People who showed up on time shouldn't be penalized.","I have never been here, only to Roberta's, however I have to agree with Samantha A. I went to their pop up restaurant at Frieze Art Fair, Foul Witch and experiences the worst service in NYC. Out of the 3 courses we ordered only two made it to the table. We were still charged a 22% gratuity. When we refused to pay for service that did not hold up to a 22% standard, the manager was extrémalo rude to us claiming that ""That is the price of eating in NYC and at an art fair."" When we still refused to pay the gratuity, the manager threatened to call the cops and even cursed at us. It was quite an expensive meal $85+, the food quality was sub-par, and not to mention the service was TERRIBLE.  I was quite surprised of the treatment considering they are part of a two star Michelin Restaurant. Having read that I am not the first one to get bad customer service from the staff I do not recommend the experience, definitely not for the price you pay.","Love this very brooklyn dining experience. Hidden in the pop pizza place with graffiti on the street outside. Very casually wore staff. Loud hipster music. Not special ingredients but cook them into a different level. First time saw a plate of potato as one course, and first time eating with hands at a non-sushi Michelin restaurant. Food is delicious too! We had 18 courses, and I can pretty much remember all the courses without looking at the photos, which is quite rare. LolMy favorites: Barbecue ribs. This is the best barbecue I've ever had!! The chef cooked it for at least 30 mins, on and the off the rack. Perfect seasoning, well balance of sweet and savory. LOVE It!All the pasta dish. Never had that much pasta dishes in a fine dining menu, but they are all really good! The sauce, the texture of the pasta. Would love to have a plate of them! Drawbacks: we left feeling like we can have another slice of the pizza outside, and I don't have a big appetite. Usually I would be extremely full after the fine dining meal. Well, maybe that's the point of restaurant being in the pizza place? The desserts were very simple too, and kind of repetitive. Just many, many sorbets. There were only two protein courses in the 18 courses menu. Although the short ribs were really good, feeling like we could have one more protein.","EASILY the BEST meal I had in 2018, and possibly one of the top 5 meals I've had ever!Came here with 3 other friends for a farewell dinner for a dear friend - so glad we were able to enjoy this together. Reservations are available 30 days ahead, so be sure to click that button at midnight! They are located hidden behind Roberta's, and the vibe is completely different - sleek, modern, minimalistic, aka really cool! Their tasting menu is $198pp, and you have the option of adding on a wine pairing as well. The sommelier was pretty great, so I thought it was a pretty worthy splurge (it's not unlimited glasses like it was at brooklyn fare when it was still in brooklyn though!).We had a total of 18 dishes - I felt like it was a great variety of different cuisines, but nothing clashed with one another. The dishes were very well thought out, fine dining without being pretentious! Standout dishes for me were the corn foie gras, goat milk agnolotti, fresh bread, sea urchin pici, and all the fish dishes. The portuguese tart they let you take away with you is the perfect gift/ending to the meal, wish we could actually buy those!Hopefully i'll get another blanca meal in 2019!!!",I took my man for his birthday and we both had a blast ! This was our second chefs table and we really enjoyed it ! Staff was phenomenal and food was delicious . We also did the wine pairing was definitely worth it and everyone should do it ! The ambiance was incredible ! Vinyl records playing while you eat in these comfortable chairs and explosion of food in your mouth ! WORTH EVERY PENNY!! Highly recommend,Blanca
538,"Most definitely had better.The jerk chicken wings- NO. It's not really jerk flavour, however it was overly flavoured with something else.The Jollof rice was alright.The beef suya was bland!To be honest you're better off just managing to cook whatever nigerian food you can manage to cook and eat that, rather than pay for this.","Ohhh I was so excited to try this spot. In town on vacation, we were referred by a friend. We're staying in NJ, so we made a special 1 hour drive to get here.I called ahead of time to see if we needed a reservation or if there waa a dress code. Jade was sooo very sweet and helpful. However, what she failed to inform me of was that there was going to be a hookah bar in the room. The live music, which was NOT LIVE but a DJ with a computer playing from a playlist, would have been fine but as a professional singer being in a room filled with hookah is not an option! I was VERY disappointed that we wasted our time and gas. We did order to go. The food was amazing... But not being able to get the full experience of the restaurant was a downer. The next time, customers should be fully informed of any changes then what's on the website.","If i could do one star i would unprofessional and rude the owner doesn't care about the Patrons he his favorite words were ""you're not African and don't know how to run a business "".I dont care how good the food or ambiance is if you have no customer service am not interested.","Was taken here a few days before my birthday for dinner. The location is in Downtown Brooklyn near the bridge and is in a secluded block. From the outside it looks pretty huge but once you go in, it's not so big anymore. Seating is a bit tight but I don't care about that. There is a bar where you an just go have drinks if you like. It was a Saturday and the crowd was pretty light . We went around 7 pm. We were greeted by a waitress who was very sweet, always smiling and very social ( I believe her name is Juliet) she served us drinks and since I am new to African food she explained each dish very nicely, which I appreciated. I asked for a dirty martini but they didn't have Tito's vodka nor did they have olives and one other kind of alcohol which I cannot remember at the moment. I had to settle for a house margarita instead which wasn't bad. We ordered the jag long rice, beef suya, shrimp and sweet plantains. The beef suya was my favorite! It was so full of flavor spicy just the way I like it. The shrimp was very good as well. The Jackson rice was the perfect combination to go along with the two dishes. The plaintains,ehhh don't order them they were very dry. But besides the plantains, everything else was so good that I will definitely be going back there to eat! Atleast this time I have a better idea about Nigerian food. Oh and the restaurant has a selfie booth which was so cool! I'll insert some photos I've taken on the booth. Keep in mind this restaurant turns into a lounge/club environment at night. Go there earlier and enjoy some Nigerian suya and say hi to Juliet for me :)","I went for a silent party and I had a ball! This spot is always Litt and the food is great! As far as bartenders go, Lady A was on point!",I had such a wonderful time in this establishment. The food was delicious. The wait staff was professional and courteous. I was able to sit and talk with one of the owners  Jonathan and he was such a delight to converse with. He is a big Giants fan (inside joke). I ordered the pounded yam with mixed meat. Delicious and flavorful. I will definitely be dining here again. Very spacious on the inside and clean. Great place to take a date or friends after work.,AMARACHI
539,"On my first occasion at Noodle Pudding, I gave it five stars. The service was excellent, the staff friendly, and the food delicious. I told everyone I knew how amazing it was and that they had to try it. But, on my most recent visit, I waited over and hour and a half for a table for three, without much explanation. After searching for the person to put my name down with, I was told 45 minutes to an hour. Many parties who put their namedown after us were seated ahead of us and we were given no explanation as to why and our inquiries were rudely disregarded. After finally getting a seat, the wait staff was dismissive and cold. The food was not nearly as good as the last time. What an unfortunate turn of events.","Food was solid, but be prepared for a loud atmosphere and below average wait service and attention.  I would recommend arriving early, since they do not accept reservations.","A friend of mine wanted to try this restaurant for a long time and a group of (4) of us finally went. I am pissed about having spent any money here. I had eaten prior to this so I wanted a beer and something small. The beer was $8 -- totally fine. The anchovies bruschetta appetizer dish *FOR 1* that I got was priced as $7 per 1/ $14 for 2 or something similar.When everyone got their dishes, they were good. Mine however.. The bread was so hard, we should send it over to our troops so they could block bullets with it. I eat salty fish all the time -- the anchovies with the peppers and olives were way too much on each piece. Like, do you not taste your own food before you serve it to paying customers?That wasn't the bad part. The manager saw me push my plate to the side and completely ignore it -- a universal sign of not wanting to eat whatever is on my plate. Either he isn't very bright or chose to ignore the fact that I wasn't satisfied with my order several times. Well, you're managing a restaurant, you must be competent enough to know I didn't like the food. Our waiter was really bubbly and kind at the beginning, and then of course after this incident (coincidently) shyly put down the dessert menus, and then even more discreetly came by with the check without saying a word. But proceeded to paint a full, vibrant picture of all the desserts they had to the table next to us. This stupid establishment charged me for the price of 2 PERSONS when the actual bill says ""FOR 1"" Service is garbage. The food I got was disgusting. My friends' dishes were good apparently but then again Italian food is the cheapest, quickest and easiest type of cuisine to cook -- that is why its a go-to for broke college students after all.","I really don't want to tell people about this place to keep it to myself, but you will absolutely not be disappointed going here and pointing to anything on the menu. Been going here for years and is the one of the best restaurants in NYC. Cash only. Staff have a lot going on so don't expect a quick turnaround but come here hungry and with cash and you'll have one of the best dinners ever. Blue fish and if they have if, sea bass are my absolute favorites. Head chef prides himself on cooking fish to perfection and I've never wanted a blue fish off a menu until coming here.","On my trip to NYC, I wanted some Italian food and was recommended this place. As a heads up, it is cash only. I started with the kitchen sink salad which was absolutely delicious. When I asked the waitress what it was, she said it's just a mix of the vegetables the chef gets from the market that day. Whatever market he goes to must be amazing. Then I had the bruschetta and the bread was perfectly toasted and the ricotta on top tasted pretty fresh. After, I ordered the gnocchi with butter and sage. I literally did a happy dance it was so delicious. The gnocchi was creamy and they butter and sage enhanced the flavor of the gnocchi. When the waitress asked us where we lived in the city, we told her we were visiting from out of town and the owner, Tony, walked over, asked us how we liked the food, and asked the waitress to take care of us. We ended up with free watermelon and dessert! I have never been to a restaurant that has had such a home feeling and been so wonderful and welcoming. Highly recommend!",**CASH ONLY Restaurant ***The restaurant is small but the decor is lovely. The front is open so fresh air comes through and theres lights hanging from above. Since its small space the tables are literally right next to each other which i didnt care for. We ordered the pappardelle tomato and zucchini & gnocchi alla pomodoro.  The meals were good.

540,"Fettuccine with a side of roach anyone?Yes, you read that right a roach. As I was eating a roach was crawling on the wall next to me it was absolutely disgusting. At that point I was eating my appetizer and I probably should have walked out because after that it was difficult to stomach my meal which by the way was mediocre. Iv'e made way better fettuccine alfredo at home. Do not get this twisted I am not just saying that about the food because of the roach it is the truth. I have been Yelp Elite for 6 years and if you scroll thru my reviews I never lie. When the bill came there was zero discount. Zero, zilch, nada. Now very important to mention I am not out here looking for handouts. I came there fully ready to spend money but seeing a roach was unacceptable. If it was crawling out in the open I can only imagine what is crawling in back. I mentioned it to the waiter and he ""changed the check."" Came back out and said ""the glass of wine was on me."" Sooooo taking off a $9 glass of wine was supposed to make things better?! I absolutely did not appreciate the sarcasm. Needless to say I will NOT be returning and I would NOT suggest you do either.Oh and btw the people at the table behind me were LIViD because their food took a solid 45 minutes and were getting up to leave before it finally came out. The energy was OFF the vibe was OFF everything was just OFF! DO NOT COME HERE!!!!!","I came here after seeing consistently long waiting line weekend after weekend. My assumption was that the food was amazing so I had to try the place out.I arrived on a Friday evening at 7pm and was seated immediately. Pros:* The glass of wine was generous.* Seafood pasta had a nice kick to it.* Prices were lower than the other Italian restaurants in the area.Cons:* It took 1.5 hours to get a seafood pasta.* Waitress lied about food coming out very soon around 45 minute mark and again around 1 hour mark.Conclusion, only come when I am not starving and plan on chatting with company FOREVER. No complaints about the food.","I'm very disappointed with the food and the ownership of this restaurant! I WAS a good customer ordering quite frequently and spending a lot on my orders.I had a very bad delivery experience just recently. First off, the delivery person who came this time was not very polite he was giving off bad vibes, in my opinion. The other delivery people have been fine but like I just said not this time. So, strike 1. Then, I found a hair in my food!! I had ordered 2 roma pastas the rigatoni bolognese. And one of these dishes was not fresh as well the one with the hair of course. Instead of refunding me for the whole order even though I found that hair in one of the dishes they only refunded me for one of the orders. I appreciate that I got any refund at all but another manager would have gone the extra mile and refunded me for the whole order. I mean, I did find a hair in my food which obviously grossed me out and completely ruined my dinner and evening!!!***I was going to call back and ask for a full refund but I did not feel like going back & forth with them. The manager should have done the right thing in the first place. When I did call about this I spoke to a man on the phone. I had asked to speak to the manager because from my understanding the lady who answers the phone is the manager. He said that she wasn't available so I explained this whole situation to him. Then when she was available I heard him telling her in Spanish that I had said that I  wanted to talk to her & I heard her say in Spanish--""why does she want to talk to me""-why would I ask for her in the first place because she is the manager obviously for no other reason! It was very weird. Little did they know that I speak Spanish!Like I said, I was a loyal customer and this is not how you treat a loyal customer. I will not be ordering from here anymore that is for sure! I was actually never really happy with the portion sizes. They are very small and I would have to order extra food because of this. Ridiculous portions sizes and I'm actually glad to be done with it. Adios**Hey Marta: that is a very low class low down thing to do to bring up my other reviews. My other reviews have absolutely nothing to do with you mind your own business--LITERALLY!! I was always polite on the phone with I placed orders from here & you know it!!!! Wow, you might as well curse me out than do that, seriously. Just because I had a very bad experience from this restaurant and wrote a review about it which I have all the right to do--you come at me like that. You just showed your true colors by saying that to me. Plus, you lied about other things in your response. Shame on you really disgusting!!","A part of me almost doesn't want to write this review. I'm in love with this place and want to keep it under the radar, but more people need to know about Piccante! A couple of friends and I decided on this place for dinner on a Friday night. It's a cozy spot, definitely make a reservation. It has been years since I've been to Italy, but the flavors here reminded me of it. We ordered gnocchi, risotto, tomato and cream based pasta. I tried all of them and they were all so good!The portions were just right and all my friends finished their food. I had to pack mine to go, but it was my fault for taking up stomach space with bread. They give you complimentary bread, which is served warm with their own dipping sauce (might not be to everyone's taste). The only thing is that It can get a little loud in there with everyone talking, but it wasn't terrible. I am definitely going to be back. This is the place to go if you want some authentic Italian food!","Picante has been on my hit list for quite a long time as I have walked by this place countless times. I finally made it and I am really happy that I did! This place is small and not very fancy but the food is on point which is obviously the most important factor. For an appetizer we started with the Viola salad. The goat cheese in the salad was a really nice touch and added some great flavor on the palate. For our entrees we shared the pollo e fungi (mushroom & chicken risotto) and the Carne (skirt steak, chimichurri sauce and caramelized brussels sprouts.) I will just start by saying that the risotto was amazing. I am a huge fan of risotto so I know exactly how it should taste. The consistency, the flavor, everything about this dish was superb. I was impressed with the steak it was a really nice cut, juicy and flavorful. I do not care for brussels sprouts by any means but I must say these brussels sprouts were actually really good. It was a really nice addition to the steak. The service was friendly and attentive I honestly have no complaints whatsoever. This place is also very affordable. If you are in Bay Ridge this spot is a must hit!","I recently had dinner here and I wasn't disappointed.  I saw the high ratings on yelp and it was the closest restaurant.  The inside is very spartan and sparse.  Literally minus the wind bottles encased it's just tables and chairs.  However, the food and service elevate the rating, along with the quality of the food.  Although the prices are on the higher end.  I don't know how authentic this place is, but the food was delicious.  We ordered the Milano, which is essentially Fettucine Alfredo and the Carne.  The Carne is skirt steak with veggies and it was tough to chew, but the flavor was good.  The wines were nice and the place was practically empty.  Good quiet place for a date night without the mini black dress.",Piccante
541,"Where do I begin? ....First timers, my boyfriend and I walked in, famished and ready to get down! We initially decided to sit inside but were instantly smacked by an overwhelming smell of vomit (?) located near the front bar area. Weird. We decided on sitting outside- the weather was nice.I almost slapped somebody's mama (figuratively) - that's how mad I was. We ordered one of the trio meals and Mexican corn and the entire thing was cold . It made sense - my server took forever to attended to us. It took him 10 mins or so to even greet us. We returned the above mentioned food and waited an extra 15 mins and the revised plate was returned hot and great - we were happy. Mexican corn was returned still cold. We returned that again. Can you believe they charged us for both plates? Incredible. Never returning. Ever. And management will never address this, i bet . How the hell were we charged twice ?","My boyfriend ordered the chicken sandwich and then got violently sick later that night. We shared the Mac and cheese, and I had the burger. I was not sick. The food was very good though. Would probably come again after the trauma is gone.",Not a fan. This is no where near authentic BBQ. Tried the pull pork & wings. Was not impressed Service: 2Food: 2Ambiance: 2Placed an order to go. Which took ~45mins to receive after ordering. By the time I got home (8min Walk) it was cold - You can bet it's always going to always be crowded here & that mostly for the drinks but the BBQ is a big no no for me,Not the best bbq but very good nonetheless. The location and outdoor seating are a huge plus. Service is always good here. No complaints. I heard that they're known for their Mac and cheese. The ribs are awesome. You really don't need sauce with them but the sweet sauce is the best compliment to them in my opinion. The candied bacon is delicious and a new favorite! The bourbon pecan pie is good but I expected it to have a bourbon taste and it didn't. Definitely more pecans than filling which I like. The bacon Mac was pretty good as well. Definitely a great restaurant for lunch in the summer!,"There were four of us for dinner on a busy Sunday afternoon. We originally planned on eating at a place down the street but circumstances landed us here. Crazy that we all needed up enjoying it so much we all will be back soon. We had been here once before it was blah. First time EVER that I went back to a place that was at best ok the first time and it ended up being phenomenal the second time. Service was ok but there was one guy for the entire back outside area. I would say he did pretty well considering. Once we finally receive the food it was so delicious. All of it. The meat platter, burger, nachos, wings, fried Oreos and the berry pie. Yum! Check it out! Nice little BBQ place. We will definitely be back!","Had the holy trinity and two sides.  The spare ribs had a decent rub on the exterior, but lacked permeation after biting into the bone.  Thus, there was an unpleasant flavorless porcine aftertaste that had to be drowned with the decent bbq sauce.  In addition, the meat didn't fall off the bone and was mostly semi-dry.  The sausage was fairly bland and similarly dry.  The brisket was probably best, as I asked for the fatty version; it was mostly moist and a fairly good smoky flavor.  Still, I've had far more palpably tender brisket at Hometown.  The cornbread was pretty good, with the cream adding additional moistness and sweetness.  The collard greens was somewhat bland while the potato salad had a bit too much mayo.  Overall, not bad but Ive found better bbq elsewhere.",Morgan's Barbecue
542,"Boyfriend introduced me to this place. Great cheesesteak sandwich.... it's all I order when I go. Saw them at Smorgasburg last Sunday, ordered a cheesesteak, and ugh! VERY disappointing! First off the booth attendant didn't seem like she wanted to be there... but whatever I was there for the sandwich. The sandwich she served up was NOTHING like the ones in the restaurant. $13??!! I will never get one from the Smorgasburg booth again. I'll go to the 10th street location for my sandwich.

The menu is simple but the flavor is big at this railroad eatery. It is an  in and out place but the sandwich is on point and shareable unless you are starving. The fries taste like old school NY. You will leave satisfied and with a happy belly. Just note this is not a meal you can have every day if, you want to main a healthy figure or just in general. However, sure does feels nostalgic and makes you happy. Go get a hoagie, a Philly cheese, and some fries it does not disappoint.","I have ordered from them directly on their website 4 times. THE CHEESE STEAK INSANELY  delicious and reminds me of what i have had in philly. Big and tasty. Only issue is that I ordered a large once and got a regular size. Hey, it is stacked so my body fat index thanks me.Its basic tasty and easy going. Its not some fancy pants stuff. Just comfort food. The delivery people are SUPER FAST. Every time I order it gets to me in like under like 20 minutes. WOWI cant wait to update about the roast pork.","Note: This review is for the cheesesteaks ONLY. Wowwwww. Fedoroff's is the real deal. I grew up outside of Philly and pretty much gave up hope of ever having a real Philly cheesesteak in New York. I've tried a lot hoagies and heroes and had been thoroughly disappointed until I had the great fortune of finding this place. The cheesesteak with American, mayo, cherry peppers, fried onions and salt and pepper tastes almost exactly like the one in my old neighborhood joint. Last time I stopped by, they gave me free fries, too. Oh! And it's a cute place -- love the throw back decor.Now, the not so good -- My girlfriend had the Sunday Gravy sandwich and she was not happy with it. I took a bite and had to agree.. it was not appetizing. But the cheesesteaks are amazing.",Fedoroff's Roast Pork
543,"The food is delicious but I am giving it a 3 simply because I ordered through Grubhub and they did not send me the main dish.  I told the driver it was missing, he told me to call the restaurant.  I called the restaurant 6 times but the phone was off the hook.  I contacted Grubhub who told me they could not get in touch with them either and wanted to issue me a refund at 8:45pm.  They really need to work on their customer service.  Not cool at all.","This is not my first time at this restaurant. But on Saturday night, I had guess over and I made reservation to go eat at the restaurant. Wow, what a terrible experience. I was embarrassed and upset that my guests, had to be exposed to this kind of rude, and most definitely, unprofessional manner. I called to make a reservation for 6. Once entered,  we were seated and at the center of the restaurant, not bad. However, because the young lady was so inexperienced and acted very immaturely, from beginning to end, she mixed up the order. She was rude and obnoxious when this was pointed out to her. Furthermore, she charged us for an additional drink, which was not ordered, and she was very nonchalant about her own error, with an attitude to boot. Once the check was presented, she left, without ever coming back to excuse herself, apologize or to even thank us for coming. This young lady is a poor excuse for a waitress, and strongly needs a strong course in customer service.",Let me tell you the lamb with white rice or plantins is my go to everytime (Dibbi is the lamb) l,"We were in town for one night and chose to visit this place for dinner. My friend got the blue fish, and it came with rice and cabbage. I don't recall the official name of the dish I had,  I got the chicken with lemon and onions. It came with a side salad and joloff rice. We also got the plantains.My chicken was delicious! While I think I had too much on my plate, I managed to eat the majority of the food with some help from my friend..... :)The service was also great. I loved the coziness of the restaurant. We're definitely coming back when we return to the city.","A cozy chic cultural hub. Joloff sneaks up on you on a small unassuming homey block in the heart of Bedstuy. From the outside the decor pulls you in. It's authentic and intentional from the tablecloths to the utensil ties, the art , the altar and every item on the menu. It's done right. Currently on display all throughout the restaurant is a dope collection by a local artist Moses. The pieces beg for understanding and delivers potent amounts of cultural awareness. We snuck into Joloff on a rather rainy/ grey day. It was empty and we had the place all to ourselves. It was a made for tv moment. We met Mara the co-owner who is just the sweetest. We talked about business and gentrification, Senegal and Jamaica...the similarities that existed in food and culture...our love for Mama Africa. We spoke about our love for food. As we dined a hearty mix of Afrobeats and reggae played that was the perfect balance to an already amazing dining experience. The menu is vast and chock full of tasty ideas but since I'm a pescatarian I had strewed fish with Joloff rice, steamed veggies( cabbage, carrots), yuca and plantains. The man had a fried snapper with salad and plantains and we both had bissap (sorrel). We were nourished with every single bite. Something about the space just produces this joy. We laughed the entire meal. When you go to Joloff it's not just dining,it's a cultural/ spiritual experience. It's not just dinner; it's fellowship.","A night in BK for a great collab, we couldn't let the vibe end so a friend introduced me to some of my ""peoples dem"". Ok so not exactly my people since my roots are Ghanaian and this is more Senegalese cuisine, but hey they had me @ Joloff. As we enter I enjoyed the vibrant colors and the amazing artwork adorning all the walls. We were promptly greeted and seated. There was so much to take in I almost forgot to peruse the menu. Not particularly hungry I wasn't exactly sure what to get. Ultimately I was encouraged by friend whom came here with a taste for something specific (Dibbi) to order anyway.After a personal debate on what seafood dish I should order I went with, Tiebou Jenu/National Fish of Senegal- Baked Red-snapper Fish with vegetables and Joloff Rice ($15). It was very tasty and tender. Well seasoned and flavorful I wish I had a bigger appetite because I wanted to eat more. Nonetheless a doggy-bag never hurt anyone, especially me. My friend order her Dibbi/ Marinated grilled lamb chops- w/ vegetables and Joloff rice ($15). If her dancing is an indication, then that Dibbi was Bomb. Lol. Overall a wonderful dinning experience with well seasoned, great portions, made to order cuisine for two under $35. Definitely well worth, my extended stay in BK. Just A Note:Food is made to order so it may take a few... just, enjoy the colors, Art and the vibe!",Joloff Restaurant
544,"You guys! This place should be crowded with people! You are missing out!! Traditional Italian panzerotti, how they call it in Puglia, or pizzette (originally fried) how we call it in Naples.If you have not been here, don't forget to make a stop!!","Cozy place, friendly owners, tasty food - can't say anything more. The owners are eager to share their knowledge of  what a panzerotti is and can answer any questions you may have. The panzerotti can be a bit messy to eat, so it may not be perfect for on-the-go and should be eaten when you get it! Don't try to save it for later. Highly recommend!","These guys brought something unique to Brooklyn. Panzerotti.Small deep-fried calzones made with high-quality ingredients, all imported from Italy. A real gem that I have already visited twice in a week.My favorite so far is the octopus gourmet, but they are all to die for really.Bravi ragazzi!!!","This review on yelp is overdue...I almost wish I didn't have to write it because now I am going to be thinking of these Panzerotti's but I can't get one because I am hundreds of miles away...just awful...so with tears...Having lived in Italy, I used to eat these all the time.  Over the past 10 years I have googled panzerotti to see if anyone had decided to bring them to the states in their true form. Finally!!!!!  These are incredible.  The owners literally hand make each one.  I had the classic and the salame, delicious!  I will be stopping here every time I come to New York without question.  It is all in the dough and they nailed it.  This isn't a hot pocket people, it isn't even close.  It's more like a calzone with savory donut type dough but really it's in a category on it's own.  Must try for everyone!","I think it's important to start this review off by complimenting the owner! He is very warm and welcoming. He makes the restaurant feel like a home. This place has great customer service. Other places should take note.The food is perfect. My favorite is the salame panzerotti. The prices are pretty good. If you're looking for fast casual food, stop by.","Omg YUM. Fried salame or original. Definitely get the ones with the tomato sauce. Not the cheapest since I can definitely inhale 2 by myself, but this place is so cute and authentic and there's a patio out back. Absoooolutely come here.",Panzerotti Bites
545,"Your teabag was $2.50, so price gouging by charging for milk in tea, but not in coffee is insane. You got a huge retail space and can't make overhead with barefoot customers parked at tables using the Internet for hours, so mix-ins are the hill you chose to die on?Maybe it's so you can buy more faith based placards and signage? Or maybe you could extend that ""generosity"" of spirit to the normal stuff that goes inside overpriced tea .","Whatever you do, don't order delivery.When it takes over 90 minutes to arrive, and you call the restaurant, a manager will explain all about the arrangement they have with their drivers, making endless excuses and doing nothing to accommodate the fact that the service is lousy and you still don't have food.When your food finally arrives, it's burnt and cold.","Very disappointing breakfast experience. My family and I came in as soon as it opened. No greeting. We sat down and started looking at the menu. The music was blasting. I asked the lady at the cash register (side ponytail black shirt grey leggings) if she could lower the music she said no because it was store policy. Store policy to blast music at 10 am at a breakfast/cafe place ? The only store policy I'm aware of to treat customers with top quality service which she did not fulfill. We waited for the food to come. They served us the eggs first and we had to wait another 10 mins for the pancakes. Why not serve the food all at once ? On top of that, the forks had hair in it. If all of this didn't make matters any worst, the food was subpar. Pancakes were tasteless and not fluffy.  All in all it was a waste of 50$. I will never be coming back to this establishment again. Customers always come first. Smile , great us and cater to our wishes. These are basics in customer service ! If you're in the business learn it.","Good, my date thought the pancakes were average. I enjoyed the strawberry cream cheese French toast, great presentation and even a better taste. Yummy!","Upon hearing about this place we thought it was a table service restaurant, it's not. You order at the counter and they bring it to your seat. I got the Protein Omelet which comes with two pieces of toast, a side salad & tater tots. The omelet was pretty tasty but nothing spectacular. The tater tots were really good though and I normally don't like tater tots. They were very crispy !! Yum yum. Boyfriend got the strawberry cream cheese filled French toast.  ""It was pretty good but not spectacular.  I'd gladly eat it again but wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out""We also got an iced coffee with coconut milk. Pretty good. Nothing to write home about  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (They also offer oat milk etc.) The atmosphere of this place is really nice. I like the big window in the front. It allows for a lot of light to come in and it gives it a nice relaxing feeling. The music they play is great too. There are a lot of people doing work here so it's the perfect spot to come and bring your laptop for a little while. The WiFi password you get after you order. If I'm around here and I was hungry I guess I'd stop in again to try something new, (they have smoothies that sound really good.) But I don't know that it would be my first choice if someone asked where I wanted to go for breakfast.","Coming from Miami, I was craving some yummy hot and fresh New York French toast! Cocoa Grinder totally fulfilled that craving Service was great, all the employees were super sweet! Beautiful decor, nice Brooklyn vibe and very clean! The food and coffee was amazing and great prices too! Will def be back on my next trip!",Cocoa Grinder
546,"This brunch spot is well.... a choice. I brought a few friends here because of all the rave reviews it got, but yikes... what a gentrified mess. For starters, our waiter, bless his heart, had no clue wtf he was doing. He was all over the place. There was one point where we were waiting for our food and the poor guy asked me if I just joined the table. I had been siting there the whole time and just finished ordering with him. Honestly, I've never related to Ashlee Simpson's ""invisible"" more. Not gonna lie it hurt... I don't know who was more confused, him or me after watching the series finale of Lost. The food was okay. While I enjoyed my meal (I got pasta) most of my friends were disappointed. Two of them ordered the waffle, and when it arrived, it came without syrup. What kind of waffle doesn't come with syrup? That's like a hamburger coming without a bun! It just don't make sense, honey. They waited approximately 1/2 of an iCarly episode and 2 commercials for syrup, so by the time it came, the food was cold. They didn't even want it anymore. One of my friend's was so hungry and upset that she couldn't eat that she pulled out seaweed to chomp on (which is just inexcusable tbh), but I guess desperate times call for desperate measures. Perhaps coming here on a Sunday was a mistake. My friends are so upset that I dragged them to this place and have sworn that I'll never be trusted as a reliable source for recommendations ever again. Don't do what I did. Consider avoiding this place if you want to keep your dignity and your friendships in tact.","We went for brunch , drinks were great - I had an aperol spritz and my friends had bloody mary's all very good.We ordered mushroom pasta as an app and we all agreed it's one of the best we've had. The food (egg dishes) were all extremely greasy. Everything tasted good but it was hard to eat with all the grease. The biggest issue with the place is the service it was TERRIBLE. They took forever to take our order and then it took forever to get our food. No one checked in and saw if we wanted any drinks or anything. Overall I would have given it 2 stars but I would go back for that pasta that's how good it was","All you can drink mimosa with breakfast for $24! Food is good, not the most amazing food in the world, but very tasty for the price with the drinks.","Oh my dear, Belli. Whenever I move to a new place, I always want to find my neighborhood ""spot"" as soon as possible. You know, a local bar, coffee shop, Sunday night dinner restaurant, etc. Belli has become my go-to dinner restaurant to invite friends that are willing to come to my hood or even when I'm feeling a solo dinner. So far, I've been 5-6 times for dinner and once for brunch, and everything is always delicious. The bread and pasta are homemade, and I particularly love the dinner bread with the tomato sauce (the tomato sauce is SO light and fresh), the lasagna, and the blue crab spaghetti. I also really love the chicken rollatino and the arancini, too.You can't really go wrong here, please try it out and support my fave neighborhood spot!","Recent visits have been really pleasant. Food is delicious, fresh, and comes out quickly. Service is friendly. I still miss the calamari from years ago. But the existing recipe is decent. The Fettuccine with wild mushrooms is the besttt. Tip: ask for a drizzle of truffle oil on top! You won't be disappointed!","Yummy italian (the calamari fritti is sooo yum) and the staff is friendly... however, I have 2 issues: 1.) The seasoning/flavor of the pasta has YET to be consistent... I've had the fettuccine al funghi 3 times... 1st time it was too salty, 2nd time PERFECT, 3rd (and most recent time) it was BLAND :-(2.) They need to be consistent with the payment acceptance... either be cash only (which is ridiculous in this day and age) or ALWAYS accept cash OR card... I say this because... I went to pick up take-out for lunch/early dinner this past Saturday and was told that I had to pay with cash (?!)... the convo went something like:Me: You guys no longer take cards?Waitress: We do, but cash only right now. I""m so sorry!Me: Seriously? I paid with card the past two times. Do you only take card for dining in now?Waitress: We take cards for dinner... we just can't take cards right now. I'm really sorry! There's an atm right accross the street!Me: *ULTRA BLANK STARE*I was tempted to just leave and go elsewhere for food, BUT I really wanted the calamari (it's THAT good lol)... when I came back, frustrated, with the cash... the woman apologized yet again (she was very nice), and told me that she couldn't take my card because I came during a ""shift change"" ... I've NEVER heard of this and I was IRRITATED to say the least... I ended up blowing $3 extra on an atm fee ONTOP of already spending $20+ on fried calamari and pasta with mushrooms -__- I'll be back to try the other dishes and, of course, for the calamari... but I'll for sure  ask BEFORE ordering if they take cards or take cash... hopefully they don't stop accepting cash O_o",Belli Osteria
547,Look away folks. There's nothing here to see. Booooo! Not ONE vegan item in the pastry case...or on the entire menu. Wait that's a lie. They did have oat milk so I was able to get a vegan chai latte (note the sarcastic tone). I can get that anywhere.,"Honestly the worst lattes I've had.I ordered an almond matcha latte to go, I was late so I ran to the subway station and I tried it there. It was watery steamed milk for which I paid $5 I had to run back to the coffee shop to ask for my money back son I could buy something elsewhere and they told me it was impossible for them to refund me even tho it was a terrible drink. So she told me she could make me another one I asked for a latte forced to get something I didn't wanted and don't throw my money to waste. The latte was terrible too I had to throw it away and it's a shame to waste food, cups and caps when I just could have gotten my money.Their food looks really good and they were really nice at the beginning but I will definitely never go back.","I spend approximately $5 here every few mornings. So minimum $10-15 a week. This rainy, shitty morning I ask for an extra cup to put my coffee cup in. The lady behind the counter says ""umm no."" I say it's rainy and will be hard to hold on the train. She says if we had to give extra cups to everyone who asks we'd never make a profit. Ok. So she decided in that moment that the fraction of a cent it would cost to give me another cup, was worth more to her than never receiving one more cent from me ever again. Good cost benefit analysis.","tasty lattes and pastry, and the atmosphere is charming with nice windows. i have to admit their name is evocative of the paris dakar rally, which i think of while drinking my lattes. :  )","I love it here.  The owner(?) and staff are all nice, the coffee is great, the Gluten-free crepes are greater!  Get a number 26: Apple, Brie and Walnut!Need another reason?  Look at these sunny windows!",All the food was great and tasted amazing. Highly recommend if you're looking for a brunchy place to eat,Le Paris Dakar
548,"The staff is very confused here. It's as if they are displaced, from another planet, and have no clue what they're supposed to be doing. Waiting 30mins for a simple shake is only justified by the redeeming fact that there is no other place around here to get a banana coconut milk shake with chocolate sprinkles, which is also the only reason a mildly tempered person wouldn't lose their mind and actually find humor in what is the real life ""Good Burger."" It's under-staffed and the young staff running the whole place is very befuddled, awkwardly making bird noises when orders are being delivered and singing while they take another 30mins to find the ingredients to make that shake... it really is Next Level","The review is vegetarians and vegans. Fast casual all plant based restaurant with burger, hot dog, shakes, and fries on the menu. Great that everything is vegan and glad they had fake meat and veggie options (black bean, mushroom quinoa). I avoid fake meat so I liked that the menu broke them apart. Affordable and fast service with beers and kombucha on tap! Would have been nice if they had more unique veggie non fake meat flavors and options!","On a scale of 1-10 I was a solid 10 on the excitement scale when I saw next level burger in Whole Foods. Based on their social media the burgers looked extremely similar to veggie grill in the west coast, so needless to say I was pumped. Sad to say that I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the burger. The buns were dry, the burger tasted like it was out of the microwave and the blue cheese was ehhh. For being in a Whole Foods, they lacked quality and freshness. I'm not sure if it was the location or what but there was so much potential here and they came up short.",Great stop for a quick bite - and a healthy one too. Right above Whole Foods 365 on Flatbush Ave.I had a Cobb salad here to stay. Nice flavors and ingredient combinations. Can't believe it's vegan!They have a bar so you can grab a beer - major draft selection.,Great stop for a quick bite - and a healthy one too. Right above Whole Foods 365 on Flatbush Ave.I had a Cobb salad here to stay. Nice flavors and ingredient combinations. They're known for their grass fed burgers.

We shared a their non beyond burger and a Cesar salad, so yummy! Very filling, the severs were so friendly and had great recommendations ! Also hard Booch on tap, yes please!",Next Level Burger
549,A good reasonable old time Italian restaurant reminiscent of the old days in Carrol Gardens and very inexpensive.,"I'm writing my review after my second time I tried Cataldo's. The food looks delicious and it seems that most of it is fresh, but is not tasty, lacks authenticity,and the worst thing they do is they microwave almost all their dishes that they serve.  Soups seem like the only thing that was not microwaved.  The place is always packed, but if you go there just notice how they warm up your food.","Where can I begin? Black flakes in not just mine, but every one's (in my 4-person party) glasses. The food was disgusting, I don't use that word lightly. The wine had a FAKE label, I double checked. All this is what it is, we left a minimum tip and moved on with out a complaint as I tend to do when trying something new. The waitress however, was offended by our 10% tip which was generously given after her lack of service, so much so that when I asked where the bathroom was she told me to leave and then asked where I was from, then proclaiming that in NYC we don't tip under 10%. This of course is something I know, as I've been in this industry for years.",LOVE LOVE!!Amazing pizza. BUT where is the Calamari? ** Highly recommend checking this place out. I could put up the argument that this is top 5 pizza in Brooklyn,"The service was phenomenal, so that gets 5 stars. Very warm and friendly staff, well done!THE FOOD THOUGH!!! Do you ever have a meal that's so far from your expectation that you wish time machines were real?! I'm in bed the morning after this pizza, and the regret is real. I have FOMO that was realized, by not going to Barboncino or any of the other nearby pizza places last night! I got the Pugliese, which tasted like a lot of energy went into getting the price down per pie. Like I can taste the spreadsheets that went into every mediocre bite. Those few cents that we saved were NOT worth it!I should have known to get up when I saw the look of disappointment on the couple's faces next to us. The woman frowned mightily and shook so many red pepper flakes on it I thought she would unscrew the top. I didn't know if they'd just gotten into a fight or were miserable in general, but it all became clear once we got our food. You might as well go to a fast food Pizza Hut where the food is under a heated lamp instead. I'd say avoid this at all costs- that $1 slice you know of tastes the same as this. Trust me.",Very good food and the price was on point. I don't think I have seen an Italian restaurant with prices like this. Great value and friendly staff. I highly recommend this place.,Cataldo's Restaurant
550,"Disappointed about this spot. Small place but they should hire more people. The waitress is also the hostess in the restaurant. She sat us down quickly on the tall chairs. However, when I was eating I realize a lot of customers who came in after me left because no one was at the door welcoming them in. A couple sat down and had to get the menus themselves. They decided to leave afterwards when no one came to take their order. Now the review about food....ummmm honestly, I don't recommend this spot haha. Sorry, but I had the beef bibimbap and this spot was probably the worst bibimbap I've had. The dish had about 5 pieces of meat with a whole lot of vegetables. The portion of the rice is also very little compared to the veggies that was provided. The dish itself was too sour for me. The side soup tasted weirdly okay. It tasted like tomato soup with pickles.... Even though the waitress didn't provide good services to other people, she did to me.",Hands down the worst Korean food I've had in my life. I usually don't leave reviews but I felt obligated to warn those thinking about dining here. Save yourself the visit and get something else in the area.A slap in the face to korean cuisine.,"The food was just ok, but we were seated in front of the kitchen and it was so smokey, toward the end of our meal it was really getting hard to breathe. And you will leave smelling like food.","Can't rave enough about how good dinner was last night. Truly each thing we ordered was delicious, and surprisingly big portions for how moderately priced everything was. Cannot wait to come back again soon.Also special shoutout to the entire staff, our server could have been friendlier","This was one of the best restaurant experiences I've had all summer. We were all late to our reservation but they were still able to accomodate us (with minimal sass!). The space is spread out and not cramped, good lighting, good music (my friend appreciated the k pop throwbacks). They give your table ice cold water in these adorable pitchers with mint leaves. They brought out all of our food at the exact same time and pretty quickly. The ramen was super good and packed with meat and flavor. They even saw us struggling to decide who owed how much and offered to split the bill at the end of the meal! Would absolutely go again and recommend to all my friends!!","The food is ABSOLUTELY delicious! The server is amazing and so knowledgeable.Restaurant is extremely clean and the decor is beautiful.I'm not from NY but if I lived there, I would frequent this place probably weekly.I got the Pork Bibimbap (which is pictured below).My friends had bulgogi and the potato hash. We all loved our food so much.Next time I'm in NY, I'm coming to Mokbar!Thank you for your service.",Mokbar Brooklyn
551,"I paid 24$ forgot the dish called ""grilled rolled eggplant, with cheese ..."". To describe you the dish and how much this is a scam, I literally had 4 tiny rolls, sized as my baby finger does. But this wasn't meant to be an appetizer, neither a gastronomic restaurant... I was choked and it didn't worth it at all.So I ordered to complete French fries with truffle oil (12$) as I was still hungry. The fries didn't get a truffle taste at all, neither the sauce !!! The weren't that good too !Also at the end the add us a 4% extra charge to pay with credit card. The put it straight on the bill without asking you, even if you pay by cash.On top of that the service was very long.","Beware! They have a CC processing fee!! They do not inform you that there is a fee when you arrive at the restaurant or is it explicitly labeled on the menu either. Which might not be going against laws but the lack of informing is just not cool. Our meal, experience and interaction with the waiter was nice but all turned sour with the discovery of this fee. Restaurants shouldn't just be passing along these fees but should be teaming up and fighting back against these interchange fees.  blog.goemerchant.com/can…I give them three stars because the fee really was not cool, which should have warranted less stars but that aside I did enjoy the food and the staff were nice, sucks that they have to deal with this. I imagine many angry customers.","The menu was surprisingly very vegan/ vegetarian-friendly, so for the folks who like meat, there aren't as many choices. The branzino, chicken, and mussels were great! Our server was also really nice but the price overall is expensive for the amount/quality of food. The biggest disappointment was that they charged our 11-person group ~ 3.7% Credit Card Processing fee (we only paid with one card)-- which is indicated at the bottom of their menu but I have never been charged this fee from any restaurant before, so that was a bit of an unpleasant surprise. With so many places in the Williamsburg area, probably won't be back.","I had a wonderful birthday dinner at Midnights. We ordered a bunch of food for the table to all share, the steak skewers and the truffle fries were amazing! The happy hour oysters were delicious. The drinks were great. Our server Elena, was awesome! Thank you so much for an incredible service. From the moment I made the reservation, I felt very special! Thank you again- my friends and I will recommend to everyone.","I had a perfect birthday brunch thanks to Midnights, despite all odds. We arrived half an hour late and we were extremely indecisive about food and drinks. One of us even changed his order after our waitress left for the kitchen. We also bothered our waitress to take photos of our reunion, which she happily obliged. Needless to say, the service here is outstanding. Pulled pork benedict - These are super indulgent and a modern take on classic eggs benedict. The eggs were perfectly poached and covered with a chipotle hollandaise. The slow roasted pork shoulder fell apart under my fork, and it was so juicy and tender. Truffle steak fries - I'm a huge fan of truffle anything, and these fries were bomb. They were fresh out of the fryer, so hot to the touch, and they came with grated parmesan. We ordered two sides of this and they were the first things gone from the table. Avocado toast - This dish was a bit disappointing since my friends' poached egg was more well-done compared with our egg benedicts. The bread was also ridiculously hard to saw through so my friend just started picking it up and eating it with his hands. They have a picturesque backyard outdoor seating, which was fantastic for a sunny Saturday brunch.","BEWARE!!! THEY CHARGE A 3.99% CREDIT CARD PROCESSING FEE. This charge is on top of sales tax. For example, our food and drink total was $383, the sales tax was $33.02 and the CC Processing fee was incurred on the $417 total. They now disclose this charge on the bill ONLY because of a new law in 2019 stating they they have to. Also the note at the bottom of the check is misleading, merchants are not forced to charge this fee, they elect to do so. Came here Saturday for a friends birthday and was underwhelmed. I had to cauliflower tacos, a Dolly's Crush and a Salma Hayek. Everything was fine, nothing special.",Midnights

In my opinion, the burgers were a bit small for the price. My sister and mother shared the double and I had the single bacon burger. They weren't quite as expensive as I expected them to be, but they were a bit on the small side. They listened to all our customizations, which I truly appreciate. Also, buns are sesame free - which I also appreciate. I would go back and do recommend.",Smashburger
554,Visiting from California we happened to stubble across this restaurant and what an experience. Everyone was on on deck from staff to make we were kept feed and hydrated.,"The porkThe lasagnaThe saladThe donkey sculptureThe hazelnut dessertYou son of a bitch, David you've done it again.","Came here because this place has ""the best burger in Brooklyn"" according to Thrillist. And that's the last time I take advice from Thrillist. The burger looked appealing and I didn't mind that it doesn't come with fries but after the first bite my disappointment was clear. The burger was so salty that it felt like punishment to eat it but after spending $17 on a burger you really feel like you have no other choice. The service was not great either. Won't be back.",Hidden gem. Rotating seasonal menu from true characters with lots of skill and creativity. Hands down my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn.,Excellent home-made food. The owner treats her bread starter with the care of a child and the menu is always creative and fresh.,What a wonderful restaurant. I love staying in Red Hook where my daughter and her family live.  And one of the best things about the area is that it always surprises us with the some of the best food we've ever had. This restaurant is no exception. It is tiny with a tiny patio in the back and yet they manage to produce some of the most delicious foods I've ever had. I had the mahi mahi and it was exquisite. My friend had the Cornish hen and he just couldn't get enough of it. He could have eaten another whole order because he enjoyed it so much. But I have to say that we were very full after the meal. They give you just enough to make you satisfied. The bread that we had as an appetizer was exquisite and the Shirley Temple type drinks for the grandchildren were delicious and beautiful. The service is excellent. They make you feel as though you are family and friends having dinner together with them. It is a wonderful experience and I can't wait to return.,Grindhaus
555,"We really enjoyed our dinner. We got chicken masala, vegetable korma, chana masala, and lots of tasty naan. The naan was fluffy and unbelievable. The dishes were tasty, but not the most flavorful I have had. The mango juice was thick and naturally sweat. I would go back any day. The only problem was the smoke in the dining area. It was overwhelming by the time we were done eating. I hope that they figure this problem out soon.",Half of order was wrong so be prepared in case you have dietary restrictions. I ordered the vegetarian special with a side of curry. The curry had chicken in it (that I didn't order) and the Naan was plain (I ordered garlic). It's really disappointing on top of the soup container being busted open in the bag when it was delivered. The flavors are pretty good - though the makhani is very sweet - but I don't think I'd risk ordering again when I couldn't enjoy half of the things I ordered. :(,"This is really bad Indian food. We ordered two curries Nd they both had the same, heavily food colored flavorless gravy. Please avoid","Yesterday I had takeout from Gandhi, and today I had King of Tandoor in an effort to challenge my friend's belief that Gandhi is superior. It was a tough job, ordering Indian food two days in a row, but well, I guess I am just really that selfless.I ordered exactly the same dishes-aloo gobi matar, naan, and various chutneys and sauces at the (purported) same level of spiciness, and KOT was vastly superior. The sauce on the agm was much spicier and complex in flavor, and the portion was a bit larger than Gandhi. Gandhi's sauce--in both appearance and flavor--was much more bland and artificial....did not taste homemade. KOT also offers a cool deal where you can order a small portion of another dish with your main dish at a discount, which is great because I always want to order more than one dish at Indian places, but then it gets too expensive. I chose the chana saag, which was yummy.I have eaten in at KOT and while the service and decor were nothing to write home about, for future orders, being equidistant from both establishments, KOT takes the throne.",Ordered yesterday chicken tikka masala and lamb korma for delivery. Both mild spicy. I do like Indian food and have it a lot. Korma was really good. Chicken dish I threw away. It was so spicy so both me and my boyfriend couldn't eat it.,Food was great. Got the chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan. Very well seasoned and good flavor. Haven't had Indian food a while and needed this to remind me how great it is. Delivery guy was polite and followed the instructions I left in the instructions box. Definitely will be ordering from them soon.,King of Tandoor
556,"Falafel is okay. But the interior of this restaurant (especially the odd length of dining room in the back with the too-narrow bar-height countertop facing a mirrored wall) is crusty and grossed me out. Get your food to go. I unfocused my eyes while I ate so I didn't have to examine the environs. Globs of hummus, tahini, and general grease on what seemed like years of layers of brushed-on latex paint.","I wanted to give this place 5 stars, don't get me wrong, the Falafel is Tasty, good Sandwich. I have ordered Many times, seems they are on a roll of serving Cold Falafel, out of 10 times I have gone their 9 times my Falafel has been cold, and don't dare to ask them to make it fresh, they will tell you it's fresh and or have to wait till the Falafel that is sitting their too finish first, now that's some Bullchitz. I love me a good Falafel, but Cold or barely warm Falafel is not enjoyable. Wish they were a little more accommodating to the person who pays for the Falafel and the person that is going to eat the Falafel.  Stop frying 50 Falafel balls ahead of time.","Ugh... so disappointed!! When I opened my bag to see my food..it was soo sad. The food was not only cold, it was also barely portioned well. The whole plate was empty..it's like they took some of the ingredients and sprinkled it on the box and had no shame in serving me that. If I am paying $12, I should be able to get something decent! Not only that..they served me frozen pita bread. Shame on you!",So good. The falafel is refreshing and crunchy and the hummus is so creamy. And well priced,"Tiny place with a fancy computer that requires you to pay tips. When you click the NO TIP button, you are measured head to toe with a heavy look: ""Cheap bastard!""What is the tip for? I'm picking my order up! Myself!!!I only tried the falafel sandwich, so I cannot comment on the rest of the menu. Bottom line: falafel is very bready. The flour / peas ratio is waaaay off. When you bite into it, it's hard to tell whether it's bread or falafel you've chewing. The whole sandwich is dry, needs more veggies/ sauce. All in all - 1 star. Three guys gyro on Myrtle is better. Not perfect, but better tasting and friendlier to boot.","I ordered the middle eastern platter on Grubhub - the delivery was on time and prices are very reasonable. The roasted eggplant was great, the hummus tasty, but the falafel was on the dry side and the salad was a little on the wet side (the quality might not have been the best because delivery). The platter was a great portion though, I got two meals out of it.",Queen of Falafel
557,"We came here because of all the positive Yelp reviews but were so disappointed. It seemed so promising when we walked in and saw the fresh seafood on display. It had a cool French hole-in-the-wall feel. We ordered the mozzarella salad and salmon carpaccio for starters and both dishes lacked flavor and the salmon smelled fishy. The bread they served was doughy and flavorless and it was served with an olive oil raw garlic and tomato dip, which did not pair well. For mains we had the sea bass and mussels with a side of fries. We were hoping these dishes would redeem the forgettable starter dishes but they did not. While the mussels were fresh the sauce seemed like a cooked version of the dip they provided for the bread. They did not serve any bread with the mussels. The fries were a joke. They looked and tasted like brown and soggy drowned fries that had been left under the heating lamp all day. The fish was fresh but was drenched in butter and not seasoned at all. Additionally the sides of vegetables and mashed potatoes were similarly saturated in butter. Our mouths felt like they had an oily film after we ate. On top of all this the service was severely lacking. When we arrived there was no greeting except a woman asking, ""How many people?"" Then when we sat down it took them a long time to take our order. We had to keep asking for water and there was no hospitality whatsoever. We now know why this place is a BYOB restaurant- you have to get drunk to mask the bad food and terrible service.","In summary, overpriced, mediocre food with crap service.  Fish too buttery, mussels were so-so and lacked flavour, and fries were burnt and soggy. When French restaurants ruin frites, sauces and mussels, I usually don't return. Atmosphere was cozy, but maybe too cozy. It's BYOB so maybe if you drink 3-4 glasses of wine before the food arrives it, you'll enjoy yourself.","This place was okay, mainly because the customer service was lacking. The was no crowd, but everything was so slow. I didn't get water until about 10 mins later. I was served room temperature water and another pair came in and was offered, iced water, flat or sparkling. They also received bread and I did not. I paid and waited around and no one said goosbye or even came to pick up the receipt. I still left a 20% tip, but it wasn't worth it. Oh, the food was okay. It wasn't anything to write home about. I was unimpressed both times I visited. I am not sure if I got terrible service because I was black, but everyone else seemed to received better service and they were not black.","Great place. Good for meeting family or friends.Atmosphere is very intimate.Owner is very warm and welcoming.No reservations, walk in only.","They have regained my love and business. My only advise is do reservations on Valentine's day. Ok, that being said and done, the food is fresh and delicious always. The branzino is heaven. The chopino a must everytime. Everything is so well prepared  the atmosphere in the main/back room is cozy and delightful. Enjoy.","I'm going to preface my review by saying I don't think this place is a one star place AT ALL. But what they did in regards to service and reacting to customers is unforgivable. Let me begin....It was a cold Valentine's Day, and knowing the cute french decor and amazing food, this place was going to get some serious love on this day.  They said they were not taking reservations, decided to just put our name on the list and wait this one out.  The host(owner?) said coldly it will be a while.  We didn't mind and went next door to listen to some live jazz at their sister bar Flying Lobster.  We drank, we waited, and waited, 45 min, one hour, and then about 1.5 hours into our wait I figured I'd check on the status.  Well he had skipped us now, and said that he TRIED to call us.  I checked my phone, showed him I don't think I missed any calls(I even TESTED my phone by having my fiancee call my phone, lol.)  I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt.  He says go back to lounge and he'll call me or send someone over when ready.  Server comes into the bar, asking EVERYONE BUT ME if they have a reservation next door. I'm flailing my arms like inflatable tube man at this point to get her attention before she gives away my table.  She just walks up and says, ""We tried calling you."" I checked my phone again...am I going crazy?!  I go to the ""gentleman"" host and say we are here and ready........He says we are not on the list......like I hadn't spoken to him two in the last 2 hours!  I was floored!  He was calling me a liar when i know HE was lying about calling me!  Luckly a table with a couple that saw us waiting defended us, saying we were waiting next to them.  We actually had to argue to be considered to get a table, he very rudely said ""fine, take that table right there.""  The waitress was less than kind, probably a bad day for her too.  The whole dinner we heard the host bitch and moan about how busy they are and how it is such a terrible day....yea, REAL romantic scenery.  At this point the fiancee and I are just laughing about what a story we'll have to tell. Now the kicker, I was the table next to another reviewer that had a bad experience.  He ordered dessert, than asked for a coffee to go with it.  The host said NO!  NEVER have I seen such a thing!  Deny a coffee with dessert, especially after WAITING over an hour to eat?!  Un-real.  I would have been livid too.Now the icing, That couple chugged their coffee since the next couple was practically hovering over them.  New couple sits down, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, probably 20 min and no service.  They get up and leave and I hear them tell the host they got screwed out of dinner.  I WAS surprised the host/owner tried to rectify the situation for them by offering a future better experience or something monetary, gift card, I don't know, I wasn't THAT invested in others.I write this review more as a LESSON to the host/owner/restaurant staff....on busy Holidays, ESPECIALLY Vday, take ONLY reservations. That would have solved everything.  AND treat each customer the same, I kid you not, I think he ""called"" us so that regulars would get seated faster and seated in the back/nicer part of restaurant.  It was so funny as we left, Ana and I looked into the window and everyone looked like they were having the time of their lives with loved ones, like we were the poor children with our faces pressed against the glass looking at all the rich folk. The two rooms truly were night and day in atmosphere.I finish by saying the food was still TOP NOTCH.  So good in fact that even though I would normally NEVER go back to a place that called me a liar and denied a coffee with dessert, I STILL will come here for some amazing fresh seafood.  And I will GLADLY write another 5 star review when they deserve one.",Petite Crevette
558,"I've been to Della twice and both experiences paired a pretentious and overpriced menu with highly unprofessional service. The decor is very cute, but I suspect that the Brooklyn hipster-chic aesthetic is fooling less discerning reviewers by appealing to their demographic inclinations, which is inflating reviews overall.Avoid this place. Go to Werkstatt or Hunger Pang,  .org of which are excellent and just south of Della.","We ordered take out. The entrees looked sad, unappetizing, and were extremely small portions. Maybe they're a place to go and sit down at instead, but they definitely left a bad impression. Don't offer take out if you can't do a decent job of it.","This is a hard no, unfortunately. Tried them again after a few years, but everything was a miss. The scallop crudo, while a large portion, did not have enough acid and was a dry salty mess with the salmon roe on top. Nice idea but not enough expertise in the kitchen to execute that well. The pasta, if we can even call it that, was a grainy pellet pasta with seafood. The flavor was too heavy and not the gentle seafood pasta that is actually Italian. The drinks were ok. The service was fine, the waitress was nice however the place was practically empty so instead of, I don't know, engaging customers so it is a neighborhoody experience, staff was chatting it up quite unprofessionally. This included the owner so, sadly, it comes from the top.  I normally really try to talk it up for the few spots in our neighborhood because there are so few of them, but we'll spend our money where it's appreciated and actually good. $130+ for a 4 drinks, one app, and two entrees is insane for this low quality of food and service. Bye.","Love this little Gem, they get everything right...but most importantly their dishes. They are true to their menu items, so this isn't somewhere you can make a ton of mods (which is A GOOD THING). The duck wings and duck ragù pasta entree are especially my favorites. The atmosphere is lovely, go check it out! (From my understanding same owners as Juice Box down the road...which is no ordinary wine store, so much character!)","I went to dinner on Saturday with my family and relatives and it was all of our first time eating here. The setting was quite nice and the layout of the restaurant reminds me of a train car with a backyard to boot with tables and high chairs with high tables along the wall. Great soundtrack and choice of music!We ordered a few apps and the standout were the meatballs for sure! Very tasty and good sized coupled with the delicious bread really was excellent! For the entrees we had the short ribs which were very good, the pasta special and the salads which were a tad on the small portion side ($13) so not enough for an entree. For dessert it was mousse and bread pudding which were average The reason for the 3 stars were the following; snarky waiter , bad service ( server disappeared at 10 minute spurts) and a long time to get water, refills on drinks and lag time between when one entree was served while waiting patiently for the others.  When asked where are food was served curtly said it's coming. Not sure I will go back but the food was very good and authentic.","A great little restaurant. Things to get:Anchovie oil dip - TO DIE FORgrilled fish - so goodany pasta - they do a great job hereWe really haven't had a bad thing here. Their little back room feels weird, so sit out front or in the back yard if you can.",Della
559,"Awful experience at this restaurant. We (a group of 3) arrived at the restaurant on Friday night and were told there was an hour-long wait. We left a phone number, but noticed, after over an hour of waiting, that no one called us. We went back to the restaurant and asked the manager when we should expect to be seated, given that we had been waiting for over an hour. The manager snapped at us, despite having treated him with calm and respect, and used a disrespectful, irritated, and condescending tone to indicate that we should not be expecting a table. We decided not to wait any further and left the restaurant disappointed at the dismal service and awful attitude.","I have a haiku for this quaint little Japanese restaurant:We ate here, got sickNo thanks for a ruined tripFuck you KarasuFirst let me say, most of the meal and experience was excellent...save the fact that my wife is sitting here suffering from FOOD POISONING from eating their  veggie ramen....I would have given this place a 4* review.The drinks were great. The steak which was recommended by the bartender was great. The fried chicken appetizer was great. The ramen, my wife said was surprisingly bland. And now she is shivering in bed going thru bouts of vomiting and diarrhea as I write this....We ate and shared all of the same food today...Katz's...great no problemsNot Ray's Pizza...great no problems Karasu...the only place that we didn't share (lucky me...not her) FOOD POISONING The bartender seemed on point minus the typical NY bit of an attitude at first, until she goes on a rant talking to another customer at the bar for 10 minutes loudly about her life and neglects getting us anything to drink until she notices us put our empty glasses to the edge of the bar, and finally comes over saying she thought she saw us motion for her...$200+ for a meal for 3 plus drinks to have to deal with a sick partner...You decide.","Tonight I learned that you primarily go here for the cocktails. I wanted a family style meal and if I wanted to get one I might as well have just gone to Walter's. Not that this place is bad, just really come here for the cocktails and expect it to not be cheap.","We came to Karasu after coming to Walters the night before. Katie told us how awesome the food and experience was and we booked a reservation for the next night. We sat at the bar while we waited  for our table and ordered cocktails, the I'm so green is fresh and delicious! Once we got our table we asked Katie to just order for us, and gave her our taste profiles. Everything was delicious. The sayoko's karage is a must have! Boneless fried chicken with a delicious Chipotle sauce. The final dish was the tonkatsu, a fried pork chop and it's a must have! Highly recommend both Walters and Karasu. Great staff, great ambiance, delicious food! Thank you Katie!","Small tucked in space inside of Walter's restaurant. You have to walk through Walter's, all the way to the back by the restroom to get into Karasu. Talk about speakeasy entrance! Totally hiddenWe decided to try this place on a Friday night around 7 and were quoted a 20 min wait, which ended up only being about 10 mins!We got a spot at the bar, which was a bitttt cramped especially if you're ordering food and the people next to you are alsooo eating (elbow bumpin). It looks like they are also known for their cocktails ! and they have a lot of creative options. I am definitely down to come back and try their cocktails, but that night we were there for the foodz!Their menu is pretty simple with small bites and entrees. - Chicken karaage: SUPER yummy and crispy. The outside breading was unique and a variation I haven't tried before. My only gripe is that each dish of this we saw, had different amounts of chicken pieces. We got 5, some people got 4, and others got 6. More consistency plz!- Duck soba: very flavorful and a lot of components that come together welll. The broth was a little salty and I probably wouldn't order this again, but it was definitely good to try- Salmon ikura bowl: exactly as it sounds. Not really anything special.. I thought there would be a unique sauce or something but it was just ikura + salmon sashimi on top of riceNot gonna lie, the ambience/location is really cool! and great to take visitors. I want to try their steak dish for 2 and cocktails next time since everyone was raving out about it!","A truly noteworthy and unforgettable dining experience. Things are simple at Karasu, ~20 menu items, a few cocktails, whiskey, sake, and more sake. We scored the corner booth seats with a reservation 3 weeks ahead for a Friday night. The speakeasy seats maybe 20 at most (including bar), where you're greeted at the ""exit"" door of Walton's into a dimly lit back room with striking interiors and retro furniture. I was enthralled with the textures and colors of the room (design junkie in me). On to the food. We ordered 3 smalls and the udon. All were outstanding and cooked & plated to perfection. Would highly recommend stopping in for a light dinner and drinks with a close friend or loved one!!",Karasu
560,"Visited Brooklyn today after long hiatusFood was solid, ok at best, but service was not goodThe woman server and the bald guy made my wife and myself feel rushed after we said we passed on drinks.Sad and unfortunate I think Luzzo up the block is a better experience and value.This place lost its flare and quality.","I wanted to love Sottocasa as soon as I walked in. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff willing to help their patrons make a decision, and unique Italian craft beer list (although I personally prefer downing high volumes of Peroni instead). Unfortunately, the quality of the food was underwhelming. Prosciutto and Cantaloupe Appetizer (special):I enjoy the combination of these two flavors, but this dish was incredibly bland and nothing I couldn't easily make a better version of for myself at home after a quick grocery store trip. It was average prosciutto thrown on a plate surrounded by four pieces of a melon that was not nearly ripe enough. The lack of effort was noticeable - no oils, cheeses, herbs, balsamic, or seasonings added at all. At a $15 price point, I was left questioning what I was paying for. To make matters worse, when they packaged our leftovers to go, there was no care placed into it. Everything was wrapped in one piece of foil, which left the cantaloupe salty and the prosciutto soggy. Very sloppy.Parmigiana Pizza:This also left me with an unsatisfied feeling. The eggplant topping was bland, while the basil was overdone and unflavored. The sauce was sparse, and the toppings could have been spread out more evenly. As a result, many of my bites consisted of only crust, which was dry and frankly needed something else to be thoroughly enjoyed.I never enjoy leaving a negative review, but was overall very disappointed in my meal at Sottocasa.","As a Brooklynite, I have pretty high expectations for pizza. When I saw all the 5 star reviews, I was expecting a kick ass pizza that would make me want to stuff my face until I barf. This clearly was not it. We ordered 2 pies, the Tartufata and one (I can't remember the name but it's not even on their menu online) that had caramelized onions, pancetta and basil. The Tartufata was ok, a little light on the truffle taste. The other pizza was disappointing. Apparently that pizza doesn't come with mozzarella cheese? It had a sprinkling of parm cheese on it. Technically is that even considered a pizza anymore? But my biggest grip was how soggy and wet both the pizza was! In my opinion, that is the worst offender for pizza. The crust tasted more like naan bread than the traditional crust I was looking for. So maybe it's just my personal taste for thin and crispy pizza that made this place so disappointing to me.Overall, I would not come back. The drinks are pricey, the pizza is soggy.  Both a no-no for me.","What a wonderful experience we had! I went here for my 36th birthday and with a party of 10 (including a toddler and a bang) had medium expectations about how well it would go. But the truth is, it went so fantastically well. Sottocasa was insanely accommodating (one of the guys taught my brother the car-seat-on-a-high-chair trick), brought the wine exactly when we needed it, recommended food when asked and EVERYTHING was DELICIOUS. Oh man I kind of want to go back now.For me specifically I had the Amatriciana pizza which was mouth wateringly good, and the whole table had their lambrusco, which was the delicious kind and not that trendy slightly darker rosé with bubbles some places are trying to pawn off on the public. We ate in the back covered patio space and it was lovely, but the interior looked like it had wonderful ambiance too. If you're looking for excellent pizza, great service and atmosphere, go to Sottocasa!",Yum! Great job hereGreat service and delicious pizza.Definitely a go to in the neighborhood.,"Sottocasa Pizzeria is solid neighborhood pizza joint with an extensive and inventive selection of wood fired personalized pies.  While service is low-touch and gruff, this pizzeria boasts an impressive menu of craft Italian beers sourced locally from Brooklyn-based microbreweries.The table ordered the classic Margherita pie, the Salsiccia pie (hot Italian sausage), and two Diavola pies (sopressata, olives).  There were some highlights and lowlights of our meal.  For starters, the pies were a bit too soft and underdone for our tastes.  If you prefer crunchy crusts, I recommend requesting well-done or extra-crunchy crust.  The Diavola pies received mixed reviews ranging from complaints about the quantity of olives used to a general dislike of Italian salami on a pie (a personal preference).The Salsiccia pie was a huge hit!  Great taste and ingredient combination, with compliments on the overall spice/heat level.  The classic Margherita pie was also well-received.We would definitely return to this friendly, cozy, and affordable neighborhood pizza joint.  With more savvy slice selection and a few special requests, this place could achieve pizza perfection!",Sottocasa Pizzeria
561,"This is the third time my pick up gets mixed up with another order! Yesterday we ordered food for a pick up. Picked it up. Asked twice ( since we already know that they can mix up the orders) if the order is mine, checked the receipt on the bag - it matched and left with it.When we started opening the bags to eat - not even half of the order was there. We called. Notified the staff and had to drive back to the cafe to get the other bag. With the time passing the food was already barely warm.","Very busy on a Saturday evening (20-30min wait for 2ppl w/o reservation). We were lucky to get one of the few tables outside. The appetizers came out quickly but our mixed meat platter took quite a while (more than half hour from when we were served the apps). -non: got from the many pictures. Good bread but nothing special. Would not purchase.-samsa: pretty good but lamb pieces had pieces of cartilage which turned me off-cheburek: okay, a little too oily for me. Your typical fried patty that spans cultures.-mixed meat platter: enough for two people with good appetites. A good deal. Would recommend.Of note, there is absolutely no option to buy wine and spirits by the glass, only by the bottle. This was very disappointing as I would have really enjoyed a glass of wine with dinner but the one other person I came with was driving and it would have been near impossible for me to have a whole bottle of wine alone.Overall would recommend.","Sadly as the prices here went up, the quality of good went down. Not nearly as good as years ago. Plov has become flavorless, less lamb. The spiced fries were soggy and tasted completely different. Salad not as fresh. This use to be a go to spot for me but they may have become too big to continue keeping up with the quality of food they had. So sad!","Excellent food! From the salads to the shish kebabs everything was outstanding. The variety of the meat shish was incredible. They have various types of meats including my favorite, chicken hearts. I was so busy pigging out that I forgot to take pictures --- a sin for a real yelper! But I will come back their soon and will redeem myself with several pictures. The place it's quite nice, a little on the loud side and packed so I strongly suggest you to make reservations. Can't wait to come back here. As promised here are the pictures (Aug/2009). Please try the Manti and Samsa dishes.. to die for!","Excellent food! From the salads to the shish kebabs everything was outstanding. The variety of the meat shish was incredible.

I've never really had uzebek food before so this was definitely a treat.The decor was nice, there was indoor and outdoor seating available. It was actually really busy when we went (8pm on a Saturday night, but that's to be expected). We got seats for two quite quickly and started looking at the menu. We ordered the meat Samsa, uzebek plov, beef, chicken and chicken wings kebab. The samsa came out quickly. The pastry part was soft yet crunchy, the beef with onion had a unique flavor to it. The plov was just fantastic. It's rice with chickpea, lamb, carrots and spices. Very flavorful and spiced in a way that makes you want more. The lamb meat was extremely tender and not gamy at all. Definitely one of the highlights the meal. We just kept at it bite after bite. Even the person I'm with who doesn't eat rice are a lot of it.The kebabs to me were somewhat the real winners. The beef was the best out of them. Juicy and tender with excellent flavor. Made me want more and more. I almost ordered another one. The chicken was also extremely juicy and not dry and over cooked. Not as flavorful as the beef, but still a delight.The chicken wings were somewhat a let down. Didn't have much flavor or texture. I actually regretted ordering this. I still ate it but I wouldn't order it next time.Only negative I'd say is the service is a bit slow. But other than that, the food was fantastic.",Nargis Cafe
562,"Dumplings were okay, filling lacked a lot of flavor. Had to drown it in sauces. Just didn't hit the spot","Convenient if you're looking for some quick dumplings, but overall unimpressive. The fried dumplings are soggy rather than crispy. They also have an odd, somewhat thoughtless ""no water cups"" rule. Of course the reason is because they would prefer to make money from selling water bottles. But it just seems selfish and inconsiderate. I wouldn't take my friends here unless we are drunk and desperate. But if you're feeling lazy then it'll do the job.","The service here doesn't make me want to go back, especially since it's out of the way. The cashier is very nice, but I went to ask the staff behind the kitchen counter for some soy sauce and they asked to see my ticket, which I thought was in poor taste.  The dumplings were good though.","Vanessa's Dumpling House is one of the cheaper spots in Williamsburg to grab something filling, cheap, and let's not forgot tasty! With hours going from 12 noon until 11pm and 12am some nights, it's the perfect lunch or late night snack spot that can fill you up happily for under $10. Dumplings are always fresh and nicely filled, definitely a must try! Top recommendations from the cashiers tend to be the pork & chive as well as the vegetable dumplings which I can totally vouch for being awesome. The chicken & basil totally lacked flavor last I tried it, but maybe things have changed since then. The sesame pancakes are a decent size but are a bit on the dry side and tend to need some extra sauce. My last order of sesame pancake with Peking duck also had a rather sharp bone hidden inside, so not the greatest nor happiest find. The bubble tea is also rather decent, although always on the sweet side (perfect if you're getting chili oil, though!) Would have to recommend skipping out on the tapioca, as those have almost always been a tad underdone in my opinion. Overall a yummy spot. Once you find what works for you, at least!","Not crazy busy like the Union Square location but just as good! Fresh dumplings, made to order. Priced affordably enough for all to enjoy at a price of roughly under $5 for many of the options offered. Large portions with generous stuffing of protein or vegetable (no tiny dumpling around here!) and confidently located. It's a tiny space with limited seating so be prepared to take your order to go if needs be.","Came here with my girlfriend to grab a small bite before heading to a show at Baby's All Right, not far from the venue.  We were pleasantly surprised that they had a small beer and wine list. The both of us had a Belgian white which was refreshing on a summer evening. I ordered the pan fried pork dumplings w spicy sauce, veggie fried dumplings w spicy sauce, and a pork and cabbage bun. I was not a fan of the buns which were mad dense and very dry with little filling. However, the dumplings were the perfect crispy texture and the filling was moist and tasteful. If you're looking for a nice kick of spice I highly recommend the spicy sauce.",Vanessa's Dumpling House
563,This is a nice bowling place with live music. They also serve food in the lanes and at a separate seating area. My only complain is that the AC was terrible. It was very hot and we didn't stay as long as we wanted to because of it :(.,"This could be a solid venue. The sound is way too low, the mix is solid. You can hear everyone talk while the main act is on... The drinks are over priced, but the bartenders are okay. However, my lady and I went to see a show last night and were escorted out for because she was ""too intoxicated"". She could walk straighter than I could. I think it was a selective process of who they wanted there or not. Either way, 2 male bouncers told us it was in the ladies restroom where something happened. Which raises a few questions. She just used the restroom and left. No situation...so... Is the surveillance in the ladies restroom? Why are they monitoring the restroom? Did they threw us out because we are not the sort they want there? After paying $30 to enter and charging me $15 a beer, they threw her out without even looking me or her in be eye. Shady organization. Go to a different venue. Bands and patrons. This place should be investigated.",Went over the weekend there is a cover charge to get in no problem. There was a 3-4 hour wait to bowl so my friend and decided to have dinner  the food was delicious we had apps and main courses and still there was at least another 2-3 hour wait. The live music was cool but the wait horrible if you wanna go please go early.,"I had a pleasant experience here, though we almost did not stay for service. They tried to charge $25 cover charge just to get in the place. Mind you the visit was only to bowl. Once inside it's a huge venue. Low light setting, spacious, a stage area, big dance floor, nice bathrooms upstairs, and the bowling alley portion was nice as well. Didn't have any food but got a pitcher of frozen margarita that was strong af I'd def visit again.",Great music venue Best when not packed for an off peak showGreat staff Good vibesFantastic sound system Good drinks Great shows !,"Celebrated a friend's birthday and had a great time at Brooklyn Bowl. Pros:- Large fun space with different sections to enjoy with your friends- band/dancing, bar/lounge, and bowling. Great for big groups. - Delicious bar foods- recommend the smoked wings, fries, mac & cheese balls, and nachos. Looking forward to coming back here for another special occasion.",Brooklyn Bowl
564,"It was a sad day at Bar Bolonias yesterday. Their hamburger reached $18! I still decided to order it only to realize, the burger shrunk a 1/3 of its size. The bun is too big for it now! New menu came out with pricier entrees -- but they are skimping on the portions. I live down the block and go here once a week -- but no longer for the burger! Wondering if their happy hour prices changed, too. Review the prices before going, it's no longer a place I will go for a casual mid-week dinner.",Starting to skimp on their portions. What the hell happened to their burger? It's practically all bread now. I live down the block and bolinas used to be my go-to. No longer! Much better options in the area now,"Though I love the food here, this was my second time here in two weeks where I looked into their open kitchen to see the kitchen staff plating ready-to-eat food with completely bare hands. I recently have also seen the waitstaff dress people's burgers with onions, pickles, etc with bare hands. Totally unacceptable. No wonder they have a B health code rating.","Bar Bolina's surprises & delights! I Accidentally stumbled on this place in my neighborhood  when waiting for Happy hour at A restaurant a few doors down to begin. The whole time I thought it was only a bar and had no idea how delicious the menu is. My first visit I ordered the wings and nachos off their bar menu. Now I order them both for take out at least once every week or so... i think the bartenders who take my order and beginning to recognize my voice lol. Please don't underestimate anything here... the chicken sandwich, the trout, the kale salad, all fairly simple on paper but incredibly well done. The real underdog are the wings. For $10 they are seasoned to perfection... a good combo of sweet and savory  and fall off the bone each time. Then theres the adorable patio, and great wine selection. This is my go to spot to meet a friend for a drink or for take out. Highly recommend!","I would give this more stars if the lunch options were not so limited. Usually when I dine out, I have a hard time deciding what I want because I like everything on most menus. Here, I was only interested in about 2 things on the lunch menu. I would be interested in seeing what they have available for dinner. That being said, you will not be disappointed if you decide to try this place. It is a very cute place with a nice back patio area that would probably be great for a celebration. Our server was kind and even helped my friend with some Tinder selections, going above and beyond her duties ;-)The spicy grilled cheese with bacon reminded me of pizza with the type of cheese they use. It was not what I was expecting when I ordered a grilled cheese, but still very good. The fries are crispy and plentiful. I also love that you can order a little side of crispy chicken with any meal.","Bar Bolinas is a nice neighborhood place with a good vibe. I love the back room for seating, which took me be surprise.I've been there twice in the past couple of months. The first time was with a group of 4. Despite it being pretty busy, we got a table quickly.The table started with the nachos, which are fantastic! I love when restaurants use queso instead of shredded cheese. It was a perfect combo of flavors.For my main course, I ordered the source bowl, which was huge! An excellent combo of protein, greens, and grains. Very tasty (if not a bit salty - which I really like, but some may not). Service on this trip was perfectly fine.On my most recent trip on 4/25, I went solo and sat at the bar. It was early, so no problems getting a spot. Can't go wrong with the $5 Tecate! I enjoyed the nachos so much last time that I ordered them for my meal this time. They were just as good as I remembered. My only disappointment didn't manifest until the next day. I ordered a Source Bowl to-go for lunch the next day. I was very disappointed to find that the portion was smaller than a couple months ago, plus it was without the seaweed & peanuts advertised. It was still good, but not a good value at $18.  Rent isn't cheap and neither is running a restaurant. I definitely get that. As a consumer, it's tough for me to justify shelling out that much and then feeling obliged to tip on top of it. All of the sudden, the $18 bowl is $22!I'll still go back for the Tecate and nachos, but I'd just assume make my own Source Bowl at home.",Bar Bolinas
565,"The mustard chops weren't welcomed, thank you--I ordered the elk chops; they had an excessive, overpowering amount of mustard. I enjoy and can handle well spicy foods, but this was an overkill. I was tearing up, and couldn't taste the meat allegedly exquisite meat underneath the mustard. Shame on the chef!The black sea bass and the consommé were alright, to be fair.Nice Pinot Noir, ok.Overall:Bah.",I opened a yelp account and downloaded the app just to write this. So so so bad. Inedible food but the waiter was cool,"ABOMINABLE !I went to the old Henry's End through the 90s and early 2000s.I thought it would be exceptional enough for a friend's birthday dinner who I wanted to have good food and a good experience. That did not happen, and to a shocking extent. The food was revolting slop that looked like what you would find served in a prison, and (literally) toxic to an extent you would not EVEN find in a prison. I have never written (or felt compelled to write) anything like this--and the following--ever before.I made reservations a week before, discussed that it was a friend's birthday, and requested a good table as I was booking in advance. This meant nothing when arrived as we were sat in their new not very exceptional dining room, at one of the even less exceptional (or desirable) tables, just as if we walked in off the street. When I asked if a better table could be provided (there were a few better empty tables in the room) I was told no, and that people reserved the other tables THAT day. However, after a while we WE'RE given a less bad table and told ""people canceled"" as if a favor was being done for us.We started with drinks. I was given a martini on the rocks that was watered down from the ""couple"" if ice cubes in it. My friend's daiquiri was unrecognizable from any daiquiri EVER and tasted like nothing I have ever tasted even in the worst dive bar. She sent the drink back, and it was not the first thing that got rejected from our table during the evening. (I should have rejected everything.)I had started dinner with the Caesar salad, she, the Duck Mousse. The salad was 'OK' but the mousse was more a puree than mousse and came with the unwanted surprise of chutney mixed in the under portion of it. This was NOT listed in the menu description. We also both switched to wine knowing no ""mixing skill"" would be required. THIS is the least awful part of ""dinner.""The entrees came. We both ordered ""Braised Duck with Seasonal Wild Mushrooms, Shallots, Thyme, and Lingonberries."" My dinner companion ordered mashed potatoes, and I ordered sautéed spinach. The plates with the duck were non-descript brown heaps of sauce with something underneath. The spinach was swimming in water and the mashed potatoes were slopped onto the plate in lumpy mound. We each tasted our side dishes. Mine was at least not overcooked (I would suffer form having eaten it later.) Hers caused an expression on her face that caused me immediately to taste it. And I was APPALLED.It was a tasteless mountain of paste except for the overwhelming amount of SALT that had been DUMPED into it. She then tasted her duck, looked horrified, and said ""I cannot eat this."" I tasted it as well and it was horrendously tough, over cooked, and comprised (again) mostly of salt. This was to an extent I have never encountered before. If there were mushrooms, rice or shallots (described in the menu description) anywhere on the plate, I could not tell. Everything was mixed into an ugly overbearing brown sauce that was slathered over the inedible --equally ugly--brown carcass on her plate. BOTH of her dishes got sent back. Unfortunately, my friend's appetite was destroyed at this point and she said she could not eat anything else.MY duck was not so badly overcooked, but equally buried underan ugly, heavy brown sauce. Perhaps out of shook over encountering one horrible thing after another, I ate my duck along with my spinach. It was not good and I would pay for that--in a couple of ways. My paying with my health, continued the day after eating at Henry's End, by feeling extremely unwell and like I mainlined SALT.I convinced my friend to order dessert. She acquiesced. ANOTHER big mistake. Her ""Black and White Mousse"" was a thin layer of chocolate mousse under a thick layer of frozen cream. My Chocolate Hazelnut Cake was nothing you can't get in a diner, except for the ""extra"" taste of salt. This added to the toxic levels that at that point, had already been delivered into my system.I foolishly ordered coffee. The coffee had a ""burnt"" odor, and when I poured the cream into it, a curdle ""chunk"" plopped into the cup, sending little curdled particles of cream out in a ripple effect throughout the surface of the beverage.Today as last night, I pay with my health by still feeling ill from the mega does of salt I can still taste and was DUMPED in COPIUS amounts into almost everything served. I usually have no problem with salt. But today, the thought of it makes me feel ill. As I and my dinner companion both believe the duck was prepared MANY hours before it was served, it may have been left out to accumulate bacteria. That would account for how bad I felt the following day.I saved up for last night. If anyone thinks as I did--of their good memories of the old ""Henry's End"" with a mind towards going, there PLEASE reconsider.Shame on you Henry's End... for the last time I was there !","Wow.This place is an institution, and definitely one of the best places you can go to in the neighborhood for a real sit down meal.    They moved down the street from their old location but the food is the same and the atmosphere is better than before. In the fall their wild game menu is wild!  Year round the menu is filled with hits.  When my girlfriend goes a week without giving me a hard time this is where I bring her for date night, and they never disappoint us.Sit down have some wine and choose anything on the menu, you can't go wrong.","It met all our expectations and more! The crabcakes appetizer were large, meaty and delicious. The wild mushroom salad was also wonderful. The entrees were very large. The specials included a duck with sour cherry sauce that was outstanding. Also up to that level was the sole with lobster and mushrooms.  Our third guest had walnut crusted chicken which was very large and it too was outstanding. The service was friendly and sufficiently attentive.",This is a bold statement... but Henry's End may have one of the best menus in all of New York City.  Just go.  The end.,Henry's End
566,"I ordered on DoorDash and it took a while to get here, almost an hour. I got Shrimp and Sweet Potato fries with garlic sauce on the side. (If ordering online, get sauces on the side so your food isn't soggy). The shrimp was so good and flavorful. When I added the garlic sauce it was even better. The fries were ok. They could have used a little more salt. Food was fresh and well seasoned but I'm giving 3 stars due to the long wait time and the lack of salt on the fries.  Despite the longggg wait time I have no problem ordering from here again.",I waited over 30 minutes just to be given a tray of cold food! Shouldn't have taken that long for a cold tray of grilled shrimp and chips ‍,"The customer service is terrible and the food is getting worse and it seems the cashiers always have a problem with females, it's weird but I've asked other people and they say the same thing they are rude to females. It seems expected though.","I absolutely love coming here, literally my go to spots. I usually get the shrimp(grilled) and fish(fried) combo with sweet potato fries, which always comes out GREAT. I had the turkey burger a few months ago and that was delicious. Parking can be hectic, since it is on Nostrand but it's worth it!","Ordered to pick up. d Burger: i order medium well and the beef was dry, hard, chewy and too well done. Creative side is that they add a slide of can pinapple. Other than that, i dont see why people talk highly about burger here. BBQ wing: its juicy inside out, flavorful. Better than Burger. I would suggest to try the wings.","Being that today is hamburger day, I decided to order a turkey burger with cheese. I was so looking forward to my lunch today as I've had food from this restaurant before. Nevertheless, today's food did not meet my expectations. The burger tasted like a frozen burger. I'm also assuming that they couldn't spare more cheese.  After adding the white sauce provided in the bag, the burger was tolerable. The fries were okay.",Island Burger
567,"Very upset by the dishonesty of the waitress with the rose tattoo. She was trying to pull one over us.She came over and told us that she accidentally gave the other table our bill so instead she gave their bill to us. Since our bill was less, she just ""comped"" their bill to be $15 lower and tried passing off that bill to us. Our bill was supposed to be $26 but she wanted us to pay the modified version of $34. Um... no thanks.Calling this to her attention, she got moody and responded ""I really don't care. You want me to charge you $18?"" to which we responded, ""No, just charge us what we owe."" Seriously, who does she think she is? Just charging people whatever she wants? That's not how a restaurant is run. Her screw up lost Dram Shop $23 but more importantly, her bad attitude costed the shop our patronage.","Deeply disappointed, There was no where for me and my family to sit. We patiently waited at the bar till a table was available. Sometime had passed by so we ordered some food at the bar. Once a table opened up we asked if me and my family could move into the booth, when we were rudley told by the waitress that it wasn't a option because ""we would be taking a table and she wouldn't get a tip"" so we had to remain at the bar with 4 plates of food huddled on the corner of the bar. It was incredibly uncomfortable and awkward to enjoy a meal with my family.","#I guess the chili was okay. I just regret paying $27 for a bowl of chili and one Narragansett beer (after tax and tip). That seems like a lot, right? Maybe I should have ordered a few more #beers, so I would've been too drunk to notice or care.","Sit yourself restaurant/bar. It's kid friendly and the staff are very attentive. Food gets 3 stars, it's the typical, greasy, comforting bar food.   Fried calamari has fried zucchini and jalapeños (weird mix), fried pickles were cut almost to full size, and although there isn't a chicken quesadilla on the menu - they will create one.Ambiance and staff gets the 4.  Games available, darts, a pool table, staff are attentive and good music.","I used to live in park slope for 2 years and always passed by this place. The outside isnt very enticing but decided to finally check it out since I'm back in the neighborhood and it was open late; and mainly because I remember a friend telling me this place has good burgers.I came on a late Sunday night, was kinda confused upon entering if it was pick your own table or wait to be seated, so I just walked in and sat myself. Upon entering, all the seating at the entrance/exit were full. There's plenty of TVs up on the bar side wall that were playing sports. The art around this place was random/abstract.It took awhile to get service. He was very friendly.What was ordered:The Dram Burger - burger was good, the patty melted in my mouth. Tortilla Soup - a very interesting presentation. The soup tortillas mix was mixed and set in the bowl dry. The soup itself was in a pouring cup, that you pour into the bowl. So that was cool! The taste of the soup was nice, not so strong.Overall experience was good. I enjoyed the old school hiphop being played. I'll have to come back to taste more.","Came here late on a Sunday nite cuz this spot is open til 4am! Inside was super spacious and chill. Got served with menus right away. Got the dram burger cuz it seems to be the standout item. It was a solid burger, very tender! However, nothing really special stood out to me. My friend got the tortilla soup - definitely did not expect the soup to be poured separately. I liked the idea tho - very unique. Overall though, it was pretty light (healthier side?). Personal preference I would've liked something creamier/heartierSuper friendliest staff tho! Good spot for late nite cravings.",Dram Shop
568,"Nothing about this place can mask the fact that there was a roach in my soup. A whole roach floating amongst bland broth and about 3 pieces of shrimp (yea, that's all they give). Appalled, I called over my waiter for an explanation. All he had to say was, ""want me to remove it for you? Sometimes bugs happen"". The manager then refused to refund my order. Instead he removed 2 things. For what it is worth, as a pho resturant, this place does the food no justice. Take your business elsewhere.","I have eaten in many Vietnamese restaurants and decided to trust the 4 star Yelp review on this one. This restaurant is by far the worse in terms of food quality. All the dishes I ordered came very quickly under a minute. And for good reason, because all was pre made and not fresh. The pork chop over rice was dry and hard and lightly cooked the night before then microwaved. Disgusting. Never had such bad pork chops in a Vietnamese restaurant. The vermicilli was hard, another indication of not freshly made. Then this noodle roll dish was by far the worse! I told the waiter it was hard and he brought in back in and said a fresh one was going to be made. A minute later another waiter brings back my old dish heated, obviously in a microwave! The color is suppose to be white when freshly made. It was gray! By far the worse quality I've ever had in any vietnanese restaurant. I'm never ever coming back. Terrible. The Yelp reviews for this place may be false with ratings added by family and friends. Disgusting food!",Roach in broth and was only compensated with one dish and appetizer(all the broth is cooked in one pot),"Came to this restaurant for the past two years, i always ordered spring roll and beef noodle soup. And I am telling you this place have to be one of the best Vietnamese restaurant. The service is normal as what you will expect from a casual dining restaurant. They gave you a huge bowl of soup that is literally good for two people. The food is authentic, runs by the Vietnamese. This is a family own business, therefore they care about their customers and the ingredient. The food is always fresh and delicious here. You get what you pay for. Trust me!!!! This place totally worth of your visit.",+ Fried spring rolls+ Pork chop was well cooked but a little small+ Good service- Pho was below average,"Hmmm... I have mixed feelings about this place. I went a few days back and I had ordered the curry chicken with egg noodle soup. The soup did not arrive hot. It wasn't cold, but it was barely warm. Felt like it was microwaved. The noodles were all clumped together. And the potatoes were not soft. I did not enjoy eating this, as I could barely get myself to eat and finish it. The soup was definitely a disappointment, but I was satisfied with their spring rolls. They were tasty, and had a nice crunch. Especially good with the fish sauce. It was also nice that they gave plenty of lettuce to wrap it in, as some of the other places I've been to previously were a little stingy about that. Unfortunately though, the spring rolls are not good enough for me to want to go back and waste my money on unappetizing food.",Pho Vietnam
569,"Haven't had a brunch this bad in a while. It honestly felt like brunch from Hell. We came in on a Sunday when they had a live bluegrass band playing. Totally a preference thing, but I personally find this genre absolutely grating. The type of music you start making when you've been in isolation and inbreeding hard. Anyway, this review isn't for music. The food was just so mediocre! It was mostly generic Tex-Mex fare. Exactly the Mexican food you deserve while you're listening to redneck jazz. Burrito was bland, mostly just over cooked scrambled eggs wrapped in a gummy tortilla and drenched in watery hot sauce. Served with 3 nuggets of unseasoned potatoes. Pathetic. $16, in no universe justifiable. Coffee was dirt water. No one seemed happy with their food. It was just the lot of us, slowly shoveling tasteless, tepid, soft mounds into our mouths. Service was fine though, can't fault them for anything.","I was in the neighborhood for a film so I wanted to try something different so local and Mediterranean sounded right up my alley. I ordered the French onion soup, which was lukewarm. My bf ordered pulled pork tacos and a sandwich with a side of chips, both were underwhelming. I ordered a Chilean sea bass, which was pretty steep,(attributed to local procurement) but again, the fish was lukewarm and the portion left me hungry for more. I'm not sure but I feel as if we ordered more alcohol we would have received better service.",I can only review the service because myself and my other half walked in. Asked if we could sit at the bar and as we sat down the bartender didn't even acknowledged us being there. He kept on walking back and forth. Fed another employee chocolate while we waited for him to finish hoping we can grab his attention. 7-10 min passed by another couple sat at the bar and he directly went to them. Needles to say we walked out.,"Love this place! Been a regular here for roughly 4 years. Know some of the staff. Worked with some of the staff on side projects.Came in here with a friend recently and had a great time. We paid our tab, I went to the bathroom came back, my friend went to the bathroom, I took a sip of my full water and the older male barback/bartender with the salt and pepper beard on September 29th at roughly 4 pm bussed my full water immediately after I took a sip... I mean I know I paid my tab but I'm not suddenly chop liver buddy... and to take the water away so abruptly and then practically snap a 'thanks goodbye' at me... made it seem like I had stiffed him on the tab or something when I left way over 20% in cash. I'm in the industry, I know what tips mean.Anyway, we left, toured my friend through my old stomping grounds and came back for a game of pool and enjoyed some of Christina's company which refreshed at least my experience...","Updated Review (2019)I can say that this place is now 'super'. An 8-member group of us had brunch here, and I will say that the service and food were definitely top-notch. I do not think there were any complaints within the group about our dining experience. My small complaint is that the live band is a bit loud, but the kids in the restaurant seem to like it. Note: the restaurant is very kid-friendly. Also, I called the restaurant and the hostess, who was working brunch on 9/1, was super (see what I did ;) ), friendly and accommodating. If you are super hungry at brunch, I would highly recommend getting the pork chops and eggs. Man, that pork chop was HUGE and beautifully prepared. ---------","I do not know about the super part.I will say that the bar/restaurant has a really cool layout and the decor is very artistic. The place kind of has a fusion between the old and new school in terms of decor. It seems that this place invites a very diverse group of people, which is one of the things that I love about New York (but we are seeing less of in the city).  I did not experience the food here, although the pictures of the pork chops look pretty amazing. Superfine has a very nice list of beers and cocktails, so everyone can find something that they like.Although the bartenders were very nice, the service could have been a little better. Even though we are sitting at the bar, it seemed like we had to shoot a flare gun in the air to get any of the bartenders' attention. I think that many folks from the neighborhood hang out at Superfine, which is cool, and the bartenders were chatting with them. I mean they weren't extended conversations but it felt like we were waiting a long time to get acknowledged for ordering drinks.",Superfine
570,"Was in the coney island area for a work team building session. We decided to come here for lunch. The place was not busy and the hostess was rude the moment our group walked through the door.We were a party of 8 and they said we were too big of a group to sit. We were willing to split our group so we could sit at different tables but it didn't work out.I'm sure the pizza is great, but the customer service is awful. This place has a ""locals only"" vibe. Not that fun surfy version either. I'm talking George Wallace. Funny because I was born and raised in south Brooklyn.","It's hard to believe that a pizza joint in Brooklyn can't be good, although some are terribly bad. But when one gets this much noise, recognition, attention, it's hard not to be this good. And it was. I don't know what I've been doing my entire life living in Brooklyn and never making a stop here. Only three people working in the back making pies, two servers holding down the fort. They serve beer and wine, and your typical old school glass bottles of soda. I ordered a small pie (perfect size for two people) half pepperoni. It's a thin pie, dough is very fresh with flavor all the way through. It's so soft that even my girlfriend who HATES crusts enjoyed this one alot. They use Olive oil on every pie to give it that crisp on top. It comes with Fresh Mozzarella that stretches across the galaxy with each slice you grab. The sauce is good, tangy and just the right amount in every bite. They didn't put too much pepperoni but the pieces I did have were good. Nothing extra special about that. Being a pizza junkie, I'm wondering how I've never stopped by here before. Maybe because it's a hot tourist destination, up the block from Coney Island (producing long lines at times). I don't know. But one thing for sure is I cannot wait to have another pie from here and another after that. I already started building my next pie!If you don't want to wait they do have Take-Out!","The pizza is solid. Good sauce, the crust is nice, light, crispy, and holds up the toppings. The food alone would be straight 5 stars. The service, however, is so terrible, it takes away from the dining experience. The older waitress was rude, so unnecessary. She barked at customers to ""sit here"" and ""move there."" Never uttered ""please"" or ""excuse me"" once. We went there at a slow time...there were less then 10 customers and two tables were empty. She was standing next to the serving station with all the condiments and napkins on it. I asked her to reschedule please pass me something from the serving station. She barked, ""get up and get it yourself!"" Unbelievable.","Best Pizza in NYC in my opinion. They have a lot of recognition and I can see why. All ingredients are super fresh, the dough has so much flavor too and is really good. I don't usually eat the crusts and I ate them here. And the bottom of the pizza was not soggy! Even on the pepperoni slice. I love crispy crust, they do it right. Also the tomato sauce is a bit sweet but not too much. Delicious. Long wait though. About an hour to sit down and an hour for the pizza. Also if there is a wait you have to wait outside so glad it was a beautiful day! We had a group of 5. They only have one oven and do to go orders too so it takes a long time. And we were starving. Also if you order more than one pie they bring it out one at a time, also the tables couldn't really hold more than one pie anyway. They sell beer and wine in bottles the size of a glass. Pretty cheap at 5 dollars. You cant really get a glass of wine for 5 dollars in NYC.","My boyfriend and I heard about this place from Netflix's Ugly Delicious and thought we should give it a try while in Brooklyn. We got there shortly after they opened at 12pm on a Sunday, and luckily there were a couple of tables left. For those who didn't get so lucky, there was a short line outside. They don't take names or numbers; guests had to wait in line until another table opens up.The menu is pretty simple, a large or small pizza with your choice of toppings (an extra $2.50/each). Surprisingly, they were out of basil and sausage.. I guess they don't replenish their toppings daily? We ordered a large half cheese and half pepperoni pizza (expecting to take a few slices home). The pizzas are made to order and in order... since we were one of the last tables to be seated after opening, we waited 45 min....The pizza was mediocre. The crust initially had a good crisp but also a good soft doughy chew. Getting a freshly baked brick oven pizza, I was expecting the crust to keep its crisp. However, on my second slice, I got a big crust soggy flop. Thumbs down! The sauce was a bit watery and bland to me, I was hoping for more of a punch. And the cheese, I feel like there could've been more cheese.Service was expectedly not the best (read the other reviews), but the place was worth a try. With so many other pizzerias in the Brooklyn area, this one just fell short of the rest.","Not quite sure I can give this pizza justice with this review, but I will say this. It could be quite possibly the best classic NYC round pizza I have had. The crust was crisp, the sauce top notch and the cheese fresh. We luckily did not have to wait but often the line is out the door. They take their time with the pizzas here, they are not cranking them out. Which bodes well for the quality but not for the quantity. Either way this place is always on the list of NYC pizza joints to visit and for good reason. If in Coney Island just do yourself the favor and go.",Totonno's
571,"Food's alright but delivery took forever and they lied about it.Seamless placed my estimate at 40-50 minutes. When it hadn't arrived after an hour, I called the restaurant and was told it had already left for delivery. I live 3-5 minutes away but 10 minutes later...nothing. I called Seamless, but they told me the delivery guy wasn't theirs, but worked for the restaurant. So I call the restaurant again and they lie to me over the phone saying ""I'm on the phone with him, he's right outside your address."" I went to my building's front door and had to wait another 2 minutes before he arrived. Ultimately I didn't get my food until over 90 minutes after I ordered despite living around the corner. And when the delivery guy finally arrived, my food was on the bottom of a fully loaded delivery bag, meaning I was his first stop. That leads me to believe that my food hadn't even left the restaurant yet by the first time I called. So they lied to me about when he left and they lied to me that he was already at my apartment. And they have the balls to charge a delivery fee?!","Ordered take out. At first I was super excited although there y forgot my sour cream (what's tacos without sour cream ) but fine but the food is just nasty. The steak tacos were SALTY, the shrimp tacos were nasty they only  thing that was good was the chicken tostadas. But I wouldn't eat here again. I'm so turned off I'm not hungry anymore .","I just ordered through Eat Street, waited for an hour and a half to be told by the restaurant that they are not taking orders for delivery through Eat Street and I need to contact them. Both Eat Street and this restaurant were very nonchalant about the fact that I waited all this time and will not be getting food. Very disappointed on both ends. I could've ordered from somewhere else had the communication been better. Zero stars for customer service.","My friend and I have a running map of Mexican places in NYC we haven't been to yet. There are some GREAT places in New York that defy stereotypes about the city, especially when talking with Cali transplants. Sunset Park is my fav hood for Mexican here, easy.But here's the thing.El Kucho has, by a *mile*, the BEST al pastor I have ever had. In any state or city. It's not even close. The spicing is on par with top-tier doner kebab meat in Germany, but with that extra sweetness that comes with being on a spit with some pineapple.I don't understand it. But I will keep eating it until I do. (And no, I REALLY don't understand how it's casually across the street from Alphaville. But BK has a weird thing where its best sober Mex outside of Sunset Park is near venues. Acapulco, I see you over by Saint Vitus. We all know.)","So unassuming when it comes to ambiance, yet the food is soo, sooo good! Beautifully spiced food, very regionally soecific. Last time I went there it was byob. I have to go back and see if theyare serving wine yet.","So delicious! Server was so nice. Tamale moles were delicious, as was the burrito and Jamaica. Would definitely recommend.",El Kucho Mexican Restaurant
572,I was really looking forward to brunch and am pretty disappointed! My cocktail was fantastic but food was not great.  We ordered oysters but they came after our entrees which was unappetizing. No explanation was given.  I ordered a salad with grilled romesco (16$). Totally plain - I could have made it in 10 minutes.  I ordered it with chicken (extra $4) which was described as grilled. Not grilled- it was strips of chicken that looked like the shredded chicken in my friend's soup.  Lots of gristle- kind of like putting leftover chicken on a bed of lettuce. Icky. I'll stick to just oysters and cocktails if I go again.,"Absolutely horrible service, stopped in this place at 7:56 to grab a cup of coffee as I walked in no one at front counter music blasting so loud that employees sitting in the back had to shout at me to come back in five minutes, how lazy can they be if they did not feel like serving Before 8 AM they should keep the door locked I know this place has been in business for a long time just don't know how... Will never stop there again","Terrible service. Multiple orders (drinks, starters and mains) messed up multiple times. Asked to speak to the manager who was beyond rude and confrontational- blamed us for their mistakes on orders. I never write reviews but felt compelled to given the terrible experience. Won't ever be returning.","A darling spot in South Williamsburg that somehow I'd never heard of.  Marlow & Sons is part grocer, part bar, part restaurant, and I'm here for all of it.So, the location is a little difficult to get to if you don't live in the area.  It's about a  1/2 mile walk from the closest subway stop (Marcy Ave), which is not too pleasant if you visit on a hot summer day like we did.  There is also not too much going on in this area, so there is little to see on the way.  But on a day with nice weather, I still think it's worth the trek.We had a reservation for dinner on a Wednesday night.  It was surprisingly empty when we arrived, with only a couple tables occupied and a handful of patrons at the bar, but I appreciated the personalized attention and the relaxing ambiance.  I tried a couple of their cocktails, which were delicious and unique.  For food, we had the oysters ($18/6), smashed cucumbers ($9), peas & string beans ($16), brick chicken ($33), and grilled bluefish ($28).  Everything was really, really tasty, but what really took me by surprise was the peas & string beans, which was so, so flavorful.  I also really loved the broccolini in the brick chicken dish.  Full disclosure: Marlow & Sons is not cheap, despite its appearance that suggest a cozy neighborhood joint.  Dinner and drinks for two ran us $160 before tip.  The food here is of very high caliber, which partly justifies the price tag, but just be aware that a meal here will likely cost you a pretty penny.","If there was a restaurant that exemplifies Williamsburg Brooklyn, Marlow & Sons is it.Farm to table establishment with a very limited menu and higher than average prices, that being said the quality and preparation of the food is outstanding. It is not very often that I will pay $16....yes $16 for a Bacon, Egg and cheese sandwich on a poppy seed roll.....yet today I did and I feel good about it.Why? It was the best egg sandwich I have ever had.Perfectly scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, bacon with a aioli on a fresh poppy seed roll. No ketchup required. It was perfect, smoky bacon cooked to its best self. To add to the greatness of the plate they had sautéed kale with lemon and garlic, delicious.....guess what I will Be buying this weekend from the grocery store....I never knew Kale could be so damn good. My guests enjoyed their fried bluefish sandwiches on toast.it was served with a butter leaf lettuce salad. For starters we ordered a potato tortilla, which was like a slice of quiche and yes it was delicious....served with sour cream.....yum it was so good we ordered another plate of it. The least successful dish was the pickles, I was thinking homemade sour or spicy cucumber pickles..... we received 3 small dishes....one with picked mushrooms, one with pickled carrots and one with pickled radishes and greens. No Charge for NYC tap on the table. I am going to try and get to their restaurant ""diner"" on my next visit for dinner. It is not open for lunch during the week contrary to their signage. I would go back Marlow and sons coffee and some of their baked goods as they looked beautiful. Lunch for 3, no beverages $98 with tip.","I was all ready to not like this place because of the sorta cramped tables and the lack of lighting in the restaurant (all that wood makes things pretty dark). But, as always, food overcomes all...And they have some doozies on the menu starting with that really wonderful sour cabbage pancake. That thing is fantastic.We also really enjoyed the brick chicken and the pork cutlet. Not special like the pancake, but nice all the same. Throw in a couple of three cocktails and we forgot all about the closeness of our neighbors.I'm telling you Brooklyn is full of neighborhood restaurants like these that  make really surprisingly high-level food. Try it if you're in the 'hood...",Marlow & Sons
573,"Similar to some other reviews, I really wanted to like this place but there were some serious communication issues with the staff. Our party of 4 was forgotten.  We sat at the bar while we waited and the bartender was extremely rude and not accommodating at all. We tried to be patient and did enjoy our food when we finally got sat but I don't think it's worth it.","My drinks were good. My food was excellent. The bartender is weird and rude. He makes faces at everyone and he is awkward. For him to even bring a coffee to my table for my waitress put such a bad vibe in the air. He really needs to go. I am so perplexed as to why have someone work there that makes people uncomfie. Other reviews mentioned it and the table next to me also did. I did not like how 3 quarters of the dining room was empty yet 2 bus boys were lingering next to me trying to clear food I was still eating. Annoying. For toast and jam ($6) I got 4 triangles of bread. When finished I had more than half of my jam left. I asked for a piece of bread or 2 to finish my jam but I was told I can only order the dish again. They refused to sell me a piece of bread. I woulda paid $2-$3 for bread but nope they brought out the whole jam dish again. Lol. Anyway, even with all that the food and my waitress made up for all of it and I would still go back.","We ate dinner last night there and the food was delicious.  With 5 people we ordered a majority of the menu and each dish was devoured.  I took away 2 stars because of the service.  Our waiter was nice and knowledgeable but SLOW.  We sat for a while without ordering and was only given an opportunity to order our 2nd drink as our entree plates were being removed, which was after two courses.  In addition, before we sat we waited at the bar for a brief time for our table to get ready.  While at the bar I asked the bartender about making me a drink.  He was utterly rude.  I was interested in  tequila drink as the one on the menu wasn't to my liking.  I asked him if he knew of another mix that he has made, looking for suggestions and he gave me a flat and annoyed NO.  The exchange was soo uncomfortable that when I sat I switched to vodka hoping he wouldn't know it was me ordering.  The bartender shouldn't be in the service industry talking to patrons.","This place is known for its sourdough pancakes and yes they do live up to the hype. The pancake is thick with a slightly gooey center, which I'm a big fan of, but the best part is that it's completely soaked in maple syrup. And if you think that's not decadent enough, they also add two knobs of chilled butter at the top which slowly melts as you eat the pancake. Service was friendly and attentive. Decor is rustic barnyard chic (so hot right now). They have a decent drinks selection at brunch, including a delicious aperol spritz.","So I'd like to give this a better review.  Overall the food was really well done, and on par with what I had hoped it would be.Then came the octopus.We were there for my friend's birthday, and the three of us were sharing all the dishes.  The octopus arrived, a sad tentacle on the plate.  It seemed kind of like a joke -- $20 for that?  It wasn't a tasting menu, this wasn't le Bernardin.  I asked the waiter if that was actually all it was meant to be and he sort of bristled as if I was being rude to ask.I spend a lotttt of money eating out in New York, but there is a reality that restaurants cut corners all the time.  It's at times egregious given when they're asking you to pay.  If they'd wanted to be gracious they could have replaced the plate.  Even if they're short changing people who won't mention it they could have saved face with me.  But they didn't.","So cute! Outdoor space is very sweet and inviting. Menu is small, but what they offer is so yummy! We ordered the shrimp and grits, roasted potatoes and the pear pancake. Everything was very yummy. Only con was small portions for the price.",Vinegar Hill House
574,"Kai Feng Fu: 谢谢。中国菜！很好--HENHAO！The absolute best.New York is not a cheap place to live, and sometimes, great Chinese food can be expensive to acquire. Kai Feng Fu takes both of those hurdles, slaps them around, and presents you with heaven in the form of delicious, 便宜, food.I'm going to keep this short, because that's really all you need to know. There's nothing better than eating a meal you may have underpaid for: this is the case every time you eat at Kai Feng Fu. 我爱你, Kai Feng Fu.","Can't beat the price!Great dumpling spot with a variety of pancakes, buns, and soups. Don't snooze on the beef noodle soup!",Pork dumplings are delicious. Thin and crunchy shells with flavorful pork in the center. I also had the beef stew noodles. It was ok. The place was hoping with takeout orders. It's small but fast service. The people who took my order were nice and fast. No one threw food at me just for the sake of being rude or busy. I will come back.,"Best dumpling house in the area with vegetarian options! Get the sesame pancake, you won't regret it. FYI cash only.","Super cheap food! I've been coming here for over 10 years already!  This is my favorite dumpling spot in NYC! The dumplings use to be 1$ for 4 but they increased the price to $1.50. I usually order one order of dumplings, sweet and sour soup and sesame pancake with beef.  The dumplings comes in 5 pieces. Pork flavor with chives inside. The skin is fried on the outside. The sweet and sour soup is my favorite. No other place can make sweet and sour soup as well as them. Within the sweet and sour soup there's tofu, mushrooms, egg white and seaweed. The sesame pancake with beef is also very delicious! You can add some hot sauce for more flavors. You basically go in, order, sit down and the food comes to you. You don't need to tip but if you want to you can. Clean up after yourself when you finish eating.IT'S CASH ONLY!","I have been visiting here for almost 10 years. It is still as delicious as it was the first time I had it. The prices have increased just by a little. Even so, it's still very affordable and delicious. It's really close to a middle school so during the school year it's always crowded after students get out. I try to avoid visiting from 2-4 due to the shop being small and not wanting to be in a crowd of students. They also have seating in their back area and there once. I personally feel that the back seating area isn't the cleanest, so I usually take it to go. Still an amazing price for delicious dumplings and a plain sesame pancake (Asian crispy bread that's shaped like a pizza).",Kai Feng Fu 開封府鍋貼
575,"I usually order from Table 87 but found this pizza shop on yelp, and decided to give it s try. Ordered a few times and everything was good until now. The pizza was cold and had one too many air bubbles. It was disgusting. Felt like we were eating the cardboard box. Probably the worst pizza ever. I also got charged a different price at delivery. It was $22.84 but got charged $26.67. Da Nonna Rosa is on the cancelled list right under the Dominican Republic. I'll just stick to Table 87.","Bad pizza straight up, which I think is inexcusable in NYC I mean we're the city of pizza and you're selling floppy, tasteless plain pizza? I ordered no toppings to test quality and it was bad. Don't order from here","I've ordered from this place 3x, trying various things and I think their food is way over priced for the quality. Somehow no matter what I order, it is bland. I tried their fettuccine - very bland (portions are huge though); their calamari - super soggy and bland; their pizza - just okay. They're priced about 20% higher than all the other places in the area and charge for delivery. The delivery is pretty fast, but they got my order wrong this last time. I gave this place three chances, I will not order from here again.","When I first walked in, you could see all the pizzas that they were selling slices of, and they looked amazing. Plus there were a ton of staff ready to help you. We sat down at a table and immediately we were given bread, two waters and a bottle of water. The service here is impeccable.While the menu is extensive, our waiter gladly gave me a few recos. I ordered the pasta primavera and it was probably a whole pound of pasta. This was a bit expensive, but for the amount of food, next time I would share one pasta dish between 2 people.My boyfriend ordered the chicken rollatini and it was so pretty and very flavorful. The mushroom sauce it sat in was delicious. This place clearly holds themselves to a high standard and for us, they delivered.","If you want a square pie done right, you'd be hard pressed to find a place in this part of Brooklyn better than Da Nonna Rosa.Perfect thickness. Fluffy crust. Not stingy on the cheese.It's all just... chef's kiss emoji!","I was in the Park Slope area of Brooklyn and stumbled upon this pizzeria. Let me just say that the food is up to par. I had a ravioli/ ricotta cheese slice and a Margherita square. Both had an amazing taste! The service was quick and all of the staff is friendly and attentive. If you are ever in this area, I definitely recommend this restaurant.",Da Nonna Rosa
576,"Terrible. I came her earlier today in hopes that things had changed in regards to the poor service. Not only was I seated at a dirty table, but the food was just not up to par and the server was mean and had an attitude. I don't know why I keep coming back to this place, but this will be the last time that I spend my hard earned coin.Do not waste your time or money. Maybe save your money for an establishment a couple of blocks up on Malcom X.","I'm sorry to say for first-time visit, I was very disappointed. There were flies everywhere. The service was lackluster to say the least--they made no effort to check on us.There was a family there waiting longer than us for their order i do believe.That family got their food order finally but we were still waiting for over an hour after that.. We then decided to leave. We will not be returning to this establishment.Please do something about the flies.",Idk why this place has 3.5 stars. It's a bed stuy classic with soul food in what's left of a city being erased. Get the chicken and waffles or the grits & shrimp. You will NOT be disappointed!,"Chicken & Waffles were amazing. The chicken wings had such great crunchy texture and flavor. The red velvet waffle was perfectly fluffy and not overly sweet. Fresh fruit topping and light dust of powdered sugar. Seriously top 3 chicken and Waffles of my life. Service was also good, the cafe was busy between pick up orders and walk ins and the service was consistent and pleasant always.","I was excited about going to this place for Brunch. It was my first time visiting New York and this place was right around the corner from where I was staying. That excitement went away quickly.When my friend and I first walked in, there was a long line, only two women working, and not one person greeted us. One of my friends had to walk over towards one of the women and ask if we could be seated. The young woman seated us then disappeared for about 10-15 minutes. When she came back she was very apologetic and stated to us that it was her first day. We stated that we understood then she proceeded to take our drink orders. The woman only brought water to half the table. When we FINALLY got our Mimosas, it was full of pulp with little to no champagne in it.Now, fast forward to placing our order, which by the way took us 30 minutes to place. We sat there an additional hour on top of the 30 minutes waiting for food. The woman on the floor kept making excuses until we finally got fed up and walked out the door. As soon as we touched the sidewalk, the woman from behind the counter runs out and says, "" oh your food is ready ""! At that point we happily declined. I was extremely disappointed!","Cute spot the waitress are so kind the food isn't  bad either and the lemonade champagne is really good .I'm just a little annoyed tht my shrimp n grits consisted of cut up shrimp instead of baby shrimp or even 4 pr 5 regular shrimp  and it took 50 minutes to bring out the wait time for food is very long here ,also I was telling the waiter I wanted to pay she said whenever your ready I said I'm ready now she said o you do tht at the counter so I waited another 15 min at my table tryin to get their attention just to pay I wish they wld of told us that soon as I walked in that you pay at the counter.",Butch & Coco Cafe
577,"The cocktails were exceptional, everything we ate was over salted. All of that could've been overlooked however the worst part happened at the end. When it was time for dessert we realized the check was already dropped. When we asked for a dessert menu, the waitress told us that we couldn't have dessert and they needed the table. They later offered to move us to the bar, we were only there 75 mins.  We left and had dessert elsewhere.  NEVER AGAIN #deadtome","I've always loved James - intimate, neighborhood atmosphere. Usually sit at the bar and have a cocktail and their burger and Parmesan truffle fries. The last 2-3 times I've been, the burger has just been okay. I feel as if they changed their recipe for the burger; maybe received some accolades and got lazy. Last night was the tipping point as it took an hour to get my burger/fries and it was cooked medium rare at best and i ordered Med. I think they forgot about me and then just rushed it. I am going to take some time off from James but they should go back to what they were doing a year ago. I'm a regular as in once a month so it saddens me that they've lost their game. Gotta find another good burger for my monthly iron!","The James used to be one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants.  The cocktails are amazing and the food is delicious.  However, the rudeness of some of the staff is intolerable.  I called to ask to be added to the wait list for brunch (which I was told to do the day before because no reservations were available).  When I did, the man who answered the phone started berating me for ""calling in the middle of brunch"", told me ""he doesn't care who I spoke to, we don't do that"" and that the James is so busy he doesn't need my business and ""there are many other restaurants"" I could eat at. I understand that busy brunch can be stressful, but I did nothing to deserve his rudeness.  I can't imagine treating anyone that way, let alone someone who simply wants to eat at your restaurant.","I had read this spot had a good bloody mary and my husband and I were in the area so we decided to give brunch a shot. We got lucky when we arrived around 11:30AM and there was a table available for us. James is very cute inside and has a very old timey Brooklyn feel to it. We started with bloody marys but I had a really hard time deciding what to order for food. Everything looked incredible! Before we even ate I already told my husband we would be back haha. I settled on the fried egg with polenta and parmesean truffle oil with mushrooms. My husband got the crispy eggs with bacon and herb potatoes. The food came out fairly quickly, which we were surprised and excited about. I can not stress to you how unbelievably good this food was. Upon the first bite I nearly melted into the floor with how good this food was. It was insanely delicious, so full of flavor and each component paired perfectly with each other. The food was unreal. My husband felt the same way about his dish. He isn't usually the biggest truffle fan but he loved mine too. This place is incredible and we will definetly be back. I can't believe this spot isn't rated more highly.","I never leave a bad review unless I've talked with the establishment and tried to make things right in person. Unfortunately these people weren't having any of it.We walked in and saw only a waitress and a pretty full house. We asked for a table for five, but two of our friends weren't eating so we thought it would be more courteous if we got a table for three and just had a drink with our other two friends at the bar. As we settled in for a round of cocktails I went back to explain this to the waitress who thanked me and said she actually had a table set up for us. Suddenly, another party was sat at our table by another woman. When we told her the waitress had promised us that table she raised her voice at us, saying ""I am the hostess!""Maybe if she'd been at the front of the house instead of leaving a busy waitress to greet people there would be less confusion and no need to play a telephone game. We clearly stated we'd like a three person table and when it became available our two friends would leave. Really not sure what the issue was but I do know a hostess you don't see at all for 45 minutes and who raises her voice at customers is an issue.My boyfriend approached her later to say we'd been treated rudely and she did not apologize, only blamed us for being unclear about what we wanted. The worst was that we felt we had to eat at the bar so we wouldn't ruffle their feathers again. Cue the condescending bartender who gave us awkward fake smiles, answered our questions dryly and hardly gave us the time of day. Twice, we saw him and the hostess looking at us and whispering rather than talking to us like professional adults.The food was good, but not worth being humiliated over. And really - I waitressed for many years out of my life. While confusion does happen, most people are genuinely decent humans just trying to have a nice night, and the little effort it takes to make things right always goes a long way.","Ambiance - 5 starsService - 3.5 starsFood - 3 starsIf only everything was as great as the street this is on and off he cozy ambience at night. Arrived at 9:30p for dinner. We both kept it easy and got the much-hyped burger. It took 45 minutes for the food to arrive. No one bothered to check on us (but I will say the waitress was sweet, still, notice we haven't gotten our food please). And then the burger was just ok. Good, but not great in a city that's full of 5-star burgers. Go for the ambience but Don't get your hopes up like we did.",James
578,"Bad... general tsos had little substance, onlybreading. It was swimming in liquid and soggy. Also, far too sweet.",The chicken nuggets make my mouth water. Along with the sauce I can eat it all without sharing but I'll get back to the food in a few. 1st off I had to use the rest room badly and ran into this restaurant. No one turned up their face and said customers only which sold me. Inside reminded me of a typical chinese store. Nothing lavishing. However everyone was really kind. Besides the chicken nuggets I ordered the shrimp fried rice and chicken and broccoli with white rice. The food was excellent. I have no complaints.  If you're vegan or vegetarian do not sleep on this spot. You wont be disappointed. Even if you eat meat give it a try.,First time trying this place. Wasn't bad. Had the teriyaki seiten with mixed vegetables & brown rice.  I'd say average Chinese food.,"This place is my favorite. I have been eating here for over 5 years and their chicken nuggets are some of my go-to favorite vegan comfort food. They are delicious!! There are several similar Asian-vegan restaurants in the area but none of their nuggets compare to Zen. Some of our other favorites include: sugar cane drumsticks, roast duck, the sandwiches (comes with two!), scallion pancakes, and avocado salad for something fresh. The mains are good too but the appetizers are where it's at. Definitely recommend for vegans, vegetarians, and even our meat-eater friends ask to order from here.","This is a neighborhood rife with vegan Chinese food, and I'm curious to understand the context behind the market for it. My gut tells me this is not a new phenomenon driven by the zeitgeist of today's dietary restrictions, since vegan Chinese food has been around for a long time. In any case, this was the highest rated one in the area, and I walked past several similar restaurants for this one, the ""best"" one.My expectations were set low, and they were exceeded. I ordered the curry with seitan, potatoes, carrots, and broccoli. I found the sauce a little too sweet, but the portions were hefty and it was a satisfying enough meal, if you like this cuisine. The chicken nugget appetizer was really tasty even for my carnivorous partner who would never choose ""chick'n"" over the real animal. We also ordered the singapore style noodles, which are hard to mess up and were pretty good.I'm giving them an extra star because of the value delivered. We had enough food to last us two meals, and everything was pretty tasty.","-Hot and sour soup: mushroom, bean sprouts and tofu in a gooey/gelatiney broth. Seems like a thickening agent was added to simple broth to give that consistency. Mild ""sour"" flavor, not spicy (if that was what was meant by hot). Not sure if this is how hot and sour soup is supposed to be but I didn't care for this at all, mostly due to the consistency of the broth.- general lunch special comment: if you like the hot and sour soup or the spring roll then it's a good deal for the price. I dont care for either so it's not worth it for me-Eggplant soy chicken: okay. Comes tossed in the ""classic"" Chinese food take-out oily brown sauce (though a little less oily); if that's what you are going for then you'd like but it's not my thing hence my rating of just okay.- 2 scoop soy ice cream (butter pecan): was hesitant to get delivered as I was worried it would melt but many others on seamless didn't complain so gave it a whirl. Good texture, not really dense (like Haagen dazs for example) but not half air like store-brand ice cream.  Flavor was pretty good and the size was good for $4. Would recommend.",Zen Vegetarian House
579,"This was the worst restaurant we visited since coming to NY since 2010. The place was LOUD with some kind of heavy beat music;  acoustics were terrible which required all diners to literally ""yell"" at one another to be heard!Also, on ordering a $50 bottle of wine, the server brought a cravat NOT A Bottle!!!The service was horrible and food mediocre at best! We were there to celebrate our sons birthday and on advising wait staff, got no recommendations for a cake, cup cake or etc.!!!We will never return & will tell others to avoid this place at all cost.  Would have gotten better service and food at McDonalds or Budger King.","Delightful experience all around. Tasty food and eco conscious. A nice decor too. I came here for a work lunch with producers and camera operators. It was the prefect ambiance for such a meeting. Quiet on a Thursday afternoon with a lot of natural light and I can't remember if there was music but if there was, it was low enough to have conversation.","Terrible brunch service.  I went there this past Sunday with three family members.  There was a DJ playing very loud music at the bar at noon with a lot of his admirers (?) milling around him so the place was already very loud and crowded.  We ordered a pitcher of their featured brunch cocktail from one server only to be told five minutes later by another sever that they were out of one of the ingredients so it wasn't available.  Fine, we ordered a different drink and then put in our brunch order which included entrees and two appetizers.  Five minutes later (with no drinks in sight), my chilaquiles arrives unceremoniously at the table.  No one else's food or the apps or are drinks arrived for another ten minutes.  And the eggs on my chilaquiles were still raw.We finally flag down a server and I tell her that my eggs are raw and asked why mine came out even before the drinks.  She said, ""we bring the food when it comes out at brunch and that's how we served the eggs but I can have them cooked more for you.""Finally everyone gets their food (the apps came out a lot later than the entrees) and my chilaquiles return with overcooked eggs with hard yolks.  We finish our meal and when we get the bill they had charged us twice for the drinks and it was another several minutes to flag down a server to fix it.  To top it all off, we were right by the kitchen and I saw a chilaquiles with perfectly done eggs (and yolks) being garnished with cilantro and whisked to a table with a bottle of hot sauce.  Not only did I get raw eggs on mine and served before we even got the drinks but I also didn't get any of the garnishes on it.  Terrible, terrible service.  I've got no interest in coming back.",Lighthouse creates really beautiful food in a great atmosphere. The staff were super sweet and helpful. The food is as healthy as you want it to be with options for those who like saltier stuff and those who want a bowl of vegetables. My only complaint is that it verges a bit on the bland side and sometimes looks better than it actually tastes. It's still a delightful place to have in the neighborhood.,"I really like this place. I've been a couple times now, not yet for a proper meal. The avocado toast has a bit too much lime for my preference, but the bread is incredible. Soft boiled eggs are nicely done and a cheap addition to a small breakfast. First time I tried labna was here, and it's delicious. Staff was nice and chatty, but I went at pretty slow times.","If you don't want to talk to whoever you're eating with you should go here on a Saturday night. They blast music so loud your eardrums will ring. I would say it's for quick turnover but then our food took forever after the first two things were brought out immediately. The hummmus and spicy beans were meh. Not much flavor. Really expensive hummus. Snap peas were great, eggplant very mushy, shrimp were decent . A little too much money for a bunch of veggies with some spices thrown on top and too much money to pay for hearing loss.",Lighthouse

Looking at dirty dishes and cups and scraps of food on all the surrounding tables makes my tummy go ""what?!""","The only good thing about this place is the French toast bites, but it was downhill from there. I got the breakfast poutine, which came with the worst sausage gravy I've ever been served in a restaurant. There weren't any bites of sausage and it just tasted greasy. The fries and eggs were ok, would have taken more than three little cheese curds. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was half bones and it came with the same unfortunate gravy. It was only half a waffle, which was weird since hypothetically they made a whole waffle. We also got the mimosas which were with decidedly cheap champagne, but I guess that's why it's $14 for bottomless. Anyways, hope I just caught this place on a bad day!","Went here with my sister for brunch, waited 45 minutes to be seated, another hour for food. When the food came, they gave us the wrong order and then claimed we took bites of our food (we didn't). We had to wait again for our correct order. Same thing happened to the people next to us. Very rude, unprofessional, understaffed- At one point, the head waitress came out and said they had to regroup because no one knew what they were doing LMAO. On top of it, the food wasn't even that good. I got the breakfast poutine and my sister got biscuits and gravy. All the tables around us were having a rough time too. I could go on, but basically. NEVER AGAIN.","This place has incredible food on their brunch and dinner menus. The wait staff and bartenders are always attentive and proactive in meeting our every need, keeping glasses full throughout our meal, and making sure that we enjoy every penny spent in taste and experience. I particularly enjoy the laid back and fun atmosphere of this restaurant, and how flexible the staff is with changing the music and atmosphere to complement the vibe of the people in the restaurant. J'etajet? is always a good time, whether I'm dining with my mother, my girls, or my partner.","I hate to update this once favorite spot to a lower rating, but here goes- Three of us came the other night for dinner, getting there at about 7:30, the same time as another party of 4. We were the only ones in the place. We placed food and drink orders promptly (drinks came fast) and then waited. And waited. And waited. It was about 90 minutes before we got our food- 3 burgers. The other table who ordered at about the same time took even longer- we were about half done when theirs finally came. By that time, another party of two was also waiting for food, and the bartender/waitress was apologizing profusely and offering free drinks to them. Not her fault, but, all things considered, I could have taken the train to Manhattan, gotten a burger and been back in less time. The other big issue- two of us ordered the original burger with caramelized onions, jalapeño cream cheese and truffle salt. When the burgers finally came, there was no jalapeño cream cheese on either burger-we had to get the waitress to get us some. Safe to say, it'll probably be awhile before I try this place again.","This review is updated to reflect the fact that I've been here quite a few times more, and finally come for brunch! Yep, the burgers, poutine, and other late night fare are still amazing. But so is brunch. A friend and I came to celebrate her birthday a few weeks ago, my first time to brunch here, but I was positive it'd be good based on other food I've had here. Unlike the normal nighttime occupancy (not a ton of people, not empty) I'd seen previous visits, the place was PACKED. We were seated after a bit of a wait. I wanted the biscuits and jam and some home fries, but was informed the bottomless mimosas were only with entree items- neither of which those were. So I went for the chocolate chip pancakes special, which came with a peanut butter sauce. Oh my god. They were so good- and that sauce put them over the top! It was absolutely delicious. The mimosas were also good, and the server kept them filled- also, not watered down like some bottomless drinks can be. So. Yeah. This is now a late night AND brunch go to for me. (I will get biscuits next time though!)",jeatjet?
581,"Credit card machine not working didn't find out until the bill came. Didn't notice sign on the door, waitress should have said something when she took the order. Several other customers didn't see the sign either and were forced to use the ATM machine with a fee, everyone upset.Chef wouldn't make a special order on request. King crab legs soggy and only got little choppy pieces, hardly any meat, not worth $47. Fried calamari had no legs, did they all walk away? Had enough cash on hand to pay the bill but then had to undertip the waitress, sorry.","Landmark restaurant basically on Emmons ave. Stop in on a Sunday or Monday expecting the same fresh seafood merch. Pauli's hollering is heard and grandma's portrait hangs before the kitchen. Yup, that's the place.","Very old place right on the Bay. People come here mostly for fresh blue point oysters. All year round it's available here. We ordered Steamed mussels in white sauce and stuffed shrimps with French fries. Everything came super fast. Food was freshly made and portions were pretty large. Shrimps were well done but still crunchy on the edge and no as oily as I thought they would be. Price wasn't cheap but it was worth every bite.  Downside.....there was no dessert. Oh, well... since the place smells with seafood inside out, dessert kind of doesn't belong here...lol.","We had taken my mother -- a New Yorker living in Georgia -- on a 'this is your life' car trip around Brooklyn.  It culminated at Randazzo's, a clam bar that's been around I think longer than me... and I'm old!I recently saw Randazzo's calamari on a list of 50 Iconic Restaurant Dishes, so ordering a portion was a no-brainer.  One can get either a spicy or medium hot sauce.  We chose medium.  The calamari was crisp and good -- but iconic.....?  That would be a stretch.We all got clams which we slurped down.  I was happy with the white wine and garlic sauce.  My husband, sampling my mother's, said next time he'll order their richer, red sauce. Red or white,  both were great to sop up bread.While it's a laid back, bare bones dining room, the place isn't cheap.  And the portions, as you can see in my clam photo, aren't particularly generous.  But Randazzo's is a Sheepshead Bay institution, that continues to attract people from all over.   We even saw a popular millennial television actress walk in on our way out.","Small, casual, somewhat cafeteria-looking and utterly iconic.  It's one of those places that's definitively Brooklyn.  I regard this as ""New York City iconic"" as Carnegie Deli or Balthazar.  They were MIA for a year after hurricane Sandy, and I thanked the Gods when they came back.The food here is A+.  Unlike 90% of all the Italian restaurants in NYC, their sauce isn't sh*t.  This place has great sauce: one taste, and you'll understand why the sell it in take-home jars.The sauces are great, and the seafood is utterly fresh.  A meal here really hits the spot if you're hankering for shellfish.I honestly don't understand how this restaurant isn't 5/5 stars by anyone's standards.  The waitresses can be a little cheeky in an old-school Italian kind of way, but that's part of the charm of this iconic clam bar.Little Necks: A+Cherry Stones A-Oysters: A+Just... perfection.  Fresh, clean tasting, and almost cathartic.  As far as I'm concerned, the best in NYC.  You'll want to load them up with the following (in order):1. horseradish2. shrimp cocktail sauce3. Squeezed lemon juice4. An oyster cracker for the clams, two oyster crackers for the oyster.There's a bit too much meat on the cherry stones for my liking: still delicious, but your chew is mostly clam rather than an amalgam of clam with accoutrements.Shrimp Cocktail: ABeautiful, humongous, soft, tasty shrimp.  Phenomenal cocktail sauce.  The best.Lobster Fra Diavolo: A+I've had an awful lot of Fra Diavolo in my life, and this is one of the best.  The secret?  Their sauce.  It's tremendous!  I'd say medium to light on the heat index.  If you're ok with semi-spicy food, you can order this and let them use their default spice level.  Pro-Tip: They create the sauce from scratch when you order the dish.  If you like sauces, I would order this dish ""with extra, extra sauce"" to make sure you get enough sauce.  Seriously, it's stupid good.Marinated Burned Chicken: CSauce is very good; it tastes like a butter and wine sauce (I was expecting marinara so this was a surprise and I ended up liking it).  However, the chicken was unforgivably dry.  Some pieces were OK, but the majority of it had to be choked down with water.  I'm not sure whether it was overcooked at the outset or simply warmed in a microwave for too long, but either way, this dish is no bueno.  No amount of sauce would've helped this dish.Stuffed Filet: A+This is flounder stuffed with crab meat and tiny shrimp.  Nicely charred on the outside, a delicious sauce that can hardly be believed.  The dish is juicy and delicious.  It's as good as my mom used to make it.",We just came from Randazzo's (our absolutely favorite place in the area).Were seated momentarily. A waitress approached us and for some strange reason literally ran her hand through my son's hair (he has a curly hair). It wouldn't be right in any case. But my son is 23 years old and not a baby. I guess she tried to be friendly. But it was the same hand she is carried all plates with. Kind of dirty...All of us felt disgusted.As of food - oysters were looking good but all of them had small pieces of shells in them. Little necks were terrible.Fried calamari - soggy. :(Overall - terrible experience.P.S. My son wanted to talk to the manager but no one came to him to talk. So when we came home he left a negative review on Yelp. Then he called Randazzo's and ask them to speak to the manager.The manager (a lady) said she read his review already and she hopes he'll get a food poisoning.As you understand we'll never go there.,Randazzo's Clam Bar
582,"Decent food with a high price tag.  I ordered a grilled chicken kale Cesar salad.  The chicken, while tender was rather bland.",I don't know if the guy running the place on Friday nights is the owner or the manager but wow is he rude. Didn't even make it to a table.,"Just had an incredibly disappointing brunch at le Paddock. During a long awaited and difficult to plan brunch with old friends, my food did not arrive until after everyone else had finished eating- about an hour after we ordered. When I asked about the delay, I was told my meal was mistakenly given to another table. There was no apology, no one asked how the food was, or if anyone needed more water or another drink. They didn't offer to help make the wait easier by even extending a plate of fries. AND I was charged for the full meal. When the food finally did arrive, it was lukewarm and not tasty. I never leave reviews but this experience left such a bitter taste in my mouth.","Le Paddock one of my two go-to places in the area for comfort food. The food is good and the service friendly and fast.  Love the lamb burgers, the salads, deviled eggs and pizzas. The French fries are to die for, down to the last browned crumb.The major drawback is the noise level. Don't try to have a conversation after 6 pm, unless you're into shouting across the table. If weather permits, sit outside, it's quieter.","This is one of my favorite restaurants in Windsor Terrace. Its French brasserie and Le Paddock is perfect for any meal of the day. You will be more than satisfied.  I recommend ordering the kale caesar salad and the truffle fries. Also, be prepared to have enough cash on you when you pay the bill. Le Paddock does not accept debit cards at all. However they also have an atm in the vestibule.","I really like this restaurant and was so excited to take my 3 kids (12.12.14 yo's) this past Saturday night.  We arrived at 7:10 and were seated immediately.  The restaurant was 2/3 full and they took our drink order and we ordered our food by 7:20.  I had a specialty cocktail ""the fish are jumpin' and the Cotton is rye"".  It was delicious.  Apps came and we had escargot and mussels. (An entree portion as an appetizer since they don't have an appetizer of mussels).  Both were well seasoned and flavorful.  My kids loved both especially when you soak up all the delicious broth with the crispy baguette.  The escargot are a combination of garlicky salty goodness.  We finished these around 7:55.I finished my 1 cocktail, both bottles of water on the table were empty, my kids finished their drinks, and we waited..... and waited.  Not to be approached again by our waiter until our entrees (2 burgers, a kale salad with chicken and 2 skirt steaks) arrived around 8:40 pm.  The burgers were supposed to have bacon, but Instead had a slab of fat on them.  I showed it to the waiter and he said he would replace it.  The replacement bacon arrived at 9:10 after the table was cleared and the check had been dropped.  The steak was very good as usual, cooked perfect.  The salad was a little underdressed but not terribly.  The burgers were missing bacon and were cooked over, but still pretty tasty.I have been here 5 times and as always, the food is never the problem at Le Paddock.  Service has been spotty before but this time, it was extremely disappointing.  Next time I have 2 hours and 15 minutes to kill on dinner, maybe I'll give them another try.",Le Paddock
583,The service at the restaurant is just terrible. Was meet some friends dinner and i got there very early so i ask for a table for 3. I was told that couldnt be seated until my party arrives and to wait at the bar. I sat at the bar for 10 minutes.the tender at the bar was eating and texting on her cellphone. She never came over to ask me if i wanted a water or even to buy a drink. She stood with her back turned to me the whole time.,"This used to be THE spot. Food delicious service impeccable and large portions, unfortunately all of that has changed. I held off on giving a review for quite some time but after 3 terrible experiences I decided to write. Came here today with my husband right as they opened, ordered a calamari , beef with Chinese broccoli, spring roll and two Thai iced teas. The food was mediocre! The portion was small, and the calamari changed in price. They now serve what used to be the small size and charge the large size price for it $10. They didn't come up to us not once, to see how we were doing and if we needed something. Whenever we asked for something and said thank you we were ignored and didn't even get a head nod ( therefore didn't even know if they heard our request ) just all together 3 terrible consecutive experiences. I'm sorry this place turned into a dump, used to be our favorite spot for years.",I like the new renovations the bar reminds me a little of the W hotels.,"Joya is definitely one of those neighborhood restaurants that never disappoints. I've dined at Joya a few times and one of the things that I recognized is that their very consistent in all they do. I always receive prompt and courteous service. The food is always fresh and made to order. Another plus,  Joya always has the best dinner specials. Their drink selection is great as well. On this particular outing, I was able to dine outside and I enjoyed that experience. On a block that has many options, Joya is definitely a hit and will remain in my Thai food rotation for the foreseeable future. I highly recommend it.",I love Thai food. My fave to order from here is the chicken or shrimp basil fried rice and shrimp tempura rolls. So delicious! The most amazing food I had. But I tried their pad Thai I was disappointed. They're inexpensive. They're clean and fast. Always come here or deliver or pickup. If you're new to Thai food must try their basil fried rice,"Amazing. Affordable. Awesome ambiance. The food was so great. We had the shrimp dumplings, shrimp stir fry and beef pad see ew - so good! The portions were huge and the price was sooooo cheap for the area...and just in general. They have a full bar and a cool open kitchen. Since New Yorkers love patios I'm going out of my way to mention it. They had a patio. I will 10000% be back.",Joya
584,"Good food, slow service. Not the place to grab a quick bite. Also there is not a kids menu and no options on the regular menu for the picky child eater - except fries.",Had brunch on Sunday. It was a nice day to be out on the patio. The only thing that bugged me (quite literally) were the caterpillars. They were crawling on my shirt and legs while I was trying to enjoy my meal. Service was kind of slow but the food made up for it.,I wait my delivery for more then one hour!! Regardless they located in a couples block! And look at what I got! Crashed caps with less then a half coffee and totally trash in bag! The worst delivery serves that I have been see. Screw you!,"By far, one of the best brunches in Brooklyn! Table for 3 outside in the backyard, we had Kale & sweet potato soup, Vegan scramble, Hummus & Guacamole, Sweet potato bowl with Sunny side up eggs, Truffle fries, Eggs Benedict with turkey bacon, 3 Pop Proseccos (Prosecco with a Passionfruit popsicle and pomegranate arils), a carafe of bellinis, coffee, cappuccino, Coconut sorbet, and Churros with dulce de leche & nutella on the side. The bill plus tip came to $200. This seems pricey-but it's only because of the liquor. Prices here are extremely reasonable, the food was outstanding, and the service impeccable. We will definitely be back. Thank you for a great day.",First time i tried this place I took it out and I think they mixed up the order I was so so on the place. I found it alittle bland. Fast foward I tried it again sat down ate. Honestly I was blown away by the food. I have since come many times and was like wow now I know what ive been missing.The food is healthy like fuel but good and healthier. The quality of the food is amazing same as youd buy from a fakers market. Its health taste amazing and high quality with low/ reasonable prices. Juices are amazing Recommend CalamariCornish hens Churascco Shrimp dish with riceYou honestly have it tryChicken teriyaki lunch especial was beyond amazing. I can see why all these fit people eat here. Chef made food,"Food is good and beautifully presented. We had the seafood paella (special) with big pieces of shrimp and scallop. The mussel and clams were a bit small though. The steak tacos were very flavorful and again very pretty. The Sangria was also pretty good (though there was a bit too many rinds).We sat inside since there was no room outside. If it wasn't for the slight breeze, I'd have found it too warm. I'm hoping there is air condition in the future. I would come back again to try the other foods",Gourmet Kitchen
585,Absolutely the worst dinner we have had in NYC. What makes it so bad was the service. Our server completely ignored us and then said he forgot to put our entrees in. But he passed our table 10 times resetting the tables to our right and left. At that point I pulled the plug and told our server to cancel it because it was 45  min or more (for raw food). When our server brought our check the items we never received were charged! Lol. We got it worked out. This was very unfortunate because the oysters we're so good! We thought about going to the Manhattan one. But there are so many more restaurants on our list that we won't...,"What a surprise this was. Cerviche at a new level and a cool, hard to find space. The Bartender will take you there. Try the Rosemary's Baby.  The Yellowtail Tiratido is Killer and the lobster and Clams w/ Chorizo are way boss. Never been to the EV location. But this place is solid.","Food is very good and interesting but the restaurant doesn't even have proper ventilation system.  When the open kitchen is cooking, we literally have trouble breathing. Service is slow if you order more than a few items. Not to mention it's also uncomfortable warm and music is loud. The neighbors will complain about the noise so they keep all windows completely shut and door closed.  Cannot recommend this place until the ventilation issues are resolved.","I already know I'm coming here for happy hour every month! And dragging new people here! Their $1 oysters are so fresh and so yummy, my friend and I started out with 12 and then ordered 18 more.Service was really great and interior is cute!","Sharing our recent to-go happy hour spot in Williamsburg for their dollar oyster!.-------- Food: 3.8/5Very fresh. We love their oysters and clams. Considering the price point, it is definitely pretty good. Don't know what else to say, simply recommending it!  Service: 3.5/5 The waiters are nice and friendly. It is a super busy restaurant.  Environment: Casual. We love their chic and sophisticated design incorporated some 60's vibe mix with Asian elements. Comfortable and cozy environment. It is not a big restaurant, a small group works the best. However, they take reservations. Please plan ahead of time and make the day easy for yourself!  Price: $The price is a steal! We ordered 4 dozens and with other snacks plus drinks, totally was only $60-70. Super affordable.","Very cute spot. Peruvian and Japanese fusion. Dimly lit with alluring exotic music. Date night and intimate birthday friendly . Very airy and spacious. There is a large main  bar about 4 main booths. The bartenders were approachable with good suggestions. They work hard cooking the raw and hot food on sight. I like that you start off with a nice size of truffle oil popcorn which you can refill. I came in on a Monday where they have all night specials (fyi there have specials going on almost everyday). I sampled a $1 oyster, fresh and slurpy. Also started with the $7 rose. Semi dry and refreshing. For dinner, I had the Octopus which came with smoked paprikas, capers and pappas bravas. Found the dish well composed though I wished they gave more octopus and less potatoes. I also paired it with the shiitake mushroom which I wasn't too much a fan of. They doused it with way too much ponzu sauce to the point where that was all you were tasting. Too salty and saggy. My best moment was enjoying ""The other woman"" drink. Ugh! Sooo good. Remind me to add Mi Campo Reposado on my list of fav tequilas. A hint of the orchard peach and morita-habanero. Strong and well balanced. I also heard that the Conquistador was also a great drink. Definitely coming back if in the area.",Desnuda
586,"The food was all right but the wait was kind of atrocious. Bunch of people who came before us were trying to get their food to-go or canceled because it had been close to 40 minutes since they ordered. Others left before all their food even came out and after witnessing all of this for over half an hour, our food arrived. Worth it if you have time or come during its down time.","Mixed feelings about this review... The famed halloumi sandwich that I came for WAS delicious, but other things about the experience left a bad taste in my mouth.The main issue seemed to come down to service. I'm not sure if the restaurant was understaffed when I went, but there was only one cook and one server for a pretty packed house (even though it's small). It took a very long time to order, and my server only came back when I called him over, even to ask for water that I requested from the beginning.I also tried the chai, which I read good things about, but it was slightly disgusting. The top of the chai was slimy when it was served to me, and I kept having to slurp up the slime (blegh). It might have been because it was homemade and it settled, and the flavor was good, but the server was so unavailable that I didn't mention it to him.Overall, I might go back because the sandwich was pretty good, but the chai situation was very unpleasant. (Also, cash only was a frustration. It's a restaurant, not a coffee shop.)","Great food, service, and space. Small space but just enough for a coffee/breakfast with a friend or two. Food was fresh and the pita was to die for. Get it.",Woah. Hummus is out of this world. I ordered the Sabich and the vegetables as well as the harissa. Everything fresh and great service. Nice mellow ambiance inside with great prices. Yes,"Absolutely amazing. Not one thing that is missing. I have eaten at this place three days in a row, and I am already thinking about my lunch today :).When you walk in, you see a cash register with the kitchen in the back, pastry displayed filled with yummy looking pastries! They have a table in the first room as well, but the main dining are is in the room next to it. Long communal tables make it easy to make friends if you come alone! They have a coat hanger along the walls which is a big plus.The menu is simple. They mark all the vegan dishes for you (you dont have to be the annoying customer asking if it's vegan), separate menu for beer and wine and a small specials sign on the table. We have tried the hummus and pita, and oh my god! It was unbelievably good. The pita bread was warm, puffy, crunchy on the outside and super soft on the inside. Their hummus comes seasoned with paprika, parsley, olive oil on top, we even had left over hummus for our sandwiches. Oh, and it comes with Harissa hot sauce.I always get a falafel sandwich-can't go wrong with that. It is served with a mixed greens salad and two pickles! The sandwich is cut in half, each side is topped with onion, tomato, cucumber and tahini on top. On the bottom of the sandwich is hummus, then falafel. It is out of this world. Definitely one of the best falafel sandwiches I have ever had.My boyfriend tried the last sandwich on the menu, She-something :P. It was served with two pickles and a pepperoncini. The sandwich had onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, soft boiled egg and tahini. Soooo good, especially once the yolk mixed with all the veggies. We also tried the shawarma sandwich with seitan, delicious, but probably wouldn't get again. Their beers go from $3-$6, I had Pilsner and it was $5. They offer bottled drinks- Pilot kombuchas $6, San Pellegrino $2, and I saw they had cream soda, coke, etc. Our bill came down to $33 with the drinks + tip. Very cheap. Right off the Morgan stop on the L, very easy to find. The bathroom was clean. Staff was friendly, and I really enjoyed the calming music! I ordered a delivery which came on time, everything was correct, and they added a side of hot sauce in the bag! Just a heads up- the delivery c charge is high, $4 I believe. I highly highly highly recommend this place. It looks like they actually care about the food they serve, I wasn't worried that my food touched any dairy(I am allergic) and everything seemed very clean.",Tasted super good!! 8.71$ and it's fulfilling. I got the spicy falafel and it was just enough spice,Newtown
587,"ordered ribs (lunch platter) , with mac & cheese, about 10 bucks (+tips , tax)I recieved two large chunk of ribs, marinated, not too salty, meaty, not juicy but not dry.

I came because they were throwing the mad hatter tea party in its back yard... The bathrooms were filthy. No hook or place to hang your belongings. Not sure if the people inside were locals or other people going to the mad hatter tea party ... either way - I didn't want to stay to get anything  due to my 1st impression,"Do not come here. Man, this place was awful. We traveled here because we were looking for Eastern North Carolina BBQ and this appeared to be the only place in all of NYC that served it.We came into this divey place where just a few others were sitting at the bar. We sat at a table (only ones) and were given a menu and told that they were out of most items, including the eastern NC BBQ. They had some ordering issue. Okay, that's a major bummer but we listened to what they did have and ordered most of it just to try it. We ended up getting the following to share: - Western NC burnt ends- Ribs- sweet potato waffle- Mac and cheese waffle-coleslawThe food came out pretty much the minute we ordered it, which was terrifying. It was all luke warm and had obviously been sitting out. It was terrible. I won't go into details, but nothing was worth eating.  The ribs in particular were atrocious. On top of the food, the place was just grimy.  I would highly recommend skipping this place. If you are in the mood for Eastern NC bbq in NYC just settle for another place that does some other style bbq.","Working in the Bushwick area and looking for Parking the smell of BBQ smoked meats filled my car......I had some time to kill in between sales calls so I investigated to find the source of the wonderful scent. That scent brought me to Arrogant Swine.Very divey....country.....rock a billy whiskey bar serving Carolina BBQ. There are a handful of picnic tables outside and a handful inside. The bar is well stocked with Whiskey and features Jack Daniels.Service is a bit spotty, it took a solid 5 minutes for me to be noticed but it's par for the course here in Millenial laden Bushwick.The menu is interesting and I will go back with a group to try the entire menu. Today I went with their Rib lunch special which includes a side and a corn bread muffin. I took the order to go as I had to park illegally....shockerI opened the to go plate and much to my surprise there were 2 tremendous St. Louis cut pork ribs on a piece of white bread. The side of Macaroni and Cheese was huge while the corn bread muffin was a generous size.The Ribs had sauce drizzled on them which was nice, I like to taste the spices on the ribs with and without sauce. The ribs had a nice smoke to them, not offensive at all. The fat was perfectly rendered and the sauce was wonderful. The macaroni and cheese was a mixed bag, the cheese was awesome but the macaroni was over cooked and quasi mush.The corn bread muffin was a great touch.At $9.50 this was a great deal. I could have added bbq chicken for $12.50.I will go back for happy hour and more thorough tour of their menu.","I'm going to start with this: Don't you EVER trust food that came out INSTANTLY.If you follow my reviews, I have an obvious favorite that I won't say here - but it is my favorite for a reason. That being said, there is a standard expectation of what it is to be good barbecue. This place barely meets the basics as far as being a restaurant. The only reason we did not walk out of here, is because my father in law insisted on seeing what the reviews and the word on the street was about. How about when we go outside to sit, there are rat droppings on the table. We only moved from there, to the next seat to find a group who did not respect the no-smoking sign (which was not being upheld), and again to sit at the end in mosquito hell. After moving three times in 5 minutes, our food was served. Yes, whole hog, burnt ends, pork belly, sweet chili wings, mac & cheese waffle, and mustard slaw - out instantly. If only I could appreciate the dirty fork I had, as it kept me from trying the food just a little longer... Don't get me wrong, it looked OK, edible. In fact, I'll hit you with a compliment now, the whole hog (pulled pork) was actually pretty good. It had a good bite in some of the pieces and a quick vinegar flavor. After that though, it was a contest of which part of the meal was the absolute WORST. Was it the Mac & Cheese waffle that was dense like a trash can lid? Was It the driest burnt ends in all the land? Maybe it was the pork belly, the worst pork belly I have ever had, that almost brought a tear to my eye? The chicken tasted like ass. I don't know what else to tell you. It tasted like it was left out, tossed in chili oil from a trash can and served. The mustard slaw I wouldn't touch. Literally, a little touched my hand and wiped it away immediately. The corn bread was like a lego block, which is why I don't eat corn bread just anywhere.UTTERLY disappointed, but I will use this going forward as an example when my father in law asks us to try something new.Never again.I will give them points on the bartender. The drinks were good, the big daddy IPA was good.But damn even the barbecue sauce is trash. And my mother in law wants you all to know, do not sit on the toilet and there is pee everywhere in the bathroom.NEVER AGAIN.","This has to be one of worst BBQ places I've ever been to. Lets start with the dirty beer glasses, I should have walked out at this moment but my family said to let's give it a shot. The bartender was nice enough let us know only half the menu was being served which I found weird since it was Saturday afternoon but whatever, we ordered the ribs, Ho chicken with the mustard slaw and corn bread, chicken wings and the pineapple kimchi. The ribs were ok I guess but could not understand why they slathered them in mustard??Ho chicken was dry and flavor less my son who is our human garbage disposal couldn't even eat it.We wanted the barbecue chicken wings but had to settle for the sweet chili cause the didn't have bbq sauce? strange since this is a bbq spot and they didn't have bbq sause..the wings were not great and the chili sise was just kinda of tossed on...Finally the corn bread was just ok a boxed jiffy mix would have been better the mustard slaw was okI didn't eat the pineapple kimchi cause um GROSS but my husband and son said it was ok super spicy but nothing special... .Pros they are pet friendly which is nice if you want to hang with the fur baby and have a beer (just ask for a clean glass)Final note I will never go to this place again",Arrogant Swine
588,"Would have loved to try their meat sandwiches, but keep in mind those are only available after 11:30am! They grill their own meat and that requires time to rest the meat etc. Because I came here too early, I opted for their breakfast sandwiches which were also great and delicious. They have several bar seating and two dining tables, but most customers get their food to go. I think this place is worth a visit if one is visiting the DUMBO area.Only problem I had here was that the cashier taking my order was a bit rude and unapproachable. She was frustrated with a previous big order and just didn't seem to care how she was coming off.",I was a lil skeptical because I thought it was overrated.... It's not it's delicious and fresh and you can taste everything... I'm in love,The giardino isan exceptional veggiesamm I often craveDon't sleep on the soups.The roasted veggie soup is one of my faves,"One of the best sandwich places I've been to in my life. I got the porchetta sandwich on ciabatta bread and man the word ""sandwich"" does not do what I ate justice. It was a MONSTER of a sandwich overstuffed with a generous serving of porchetta, perfectly pickled onions, arugula and a divine peppercorn jam. The bread was toasted, warm and pillowy in texture -- something I never usually am impressed with by sandwich shops. The flavors were well balanced and rich with every bite. I split the sandwich with my boyfriend and, despite coming in extremely hungry, we both left extremely satisfied and full. For $13, we basically had two meals and this was conveniently 5 minutes away from the Brooklyn Flea Market. So worth it!","We found this gem after we visited the flea market. We were looking everywhere for cheaper food and we were so discouraged by the smell from one of the restaurants in the area. When we were almost giving up, we came across their door and thought they are closed because the door wasn't huge and super welcoming. BUT!!!! We went in anyway because we have no self control and too curious. SO GLAD we weren't too shy to go in because we would have missed such an amazing little restaurant. There's not much option but a few good ones are already good enough. Everything sound very good so even though there's not a ton of options, I still had a hard time choosing. We ended up getting the beef short rib with blueberry jam and arugula. I was a little iffy in the beginning because I'm not a big fan of the peppery/bitter taste of arugula but it works! It works so damn well. Me and my bf are foodies and we are not easy to satisfy. But this sandwich hit all the right places and we left full, happy, and very very satisfied.","Great service. Great food. VERY GOOD TASTE!!!! Beef rib* is my number one (i cant remember the name). Also, Porchetta is good for non-beef lover. Good vibes, All employees are very friendly really ""FRIENDLY""!! Visited this place everytime before go in the city. They never let me down with everything i reviewed.",Bread & Spread
589,"Waited an hour and a half for ramen that never came. Half the table received theirs 40 minutes after they ordered, one order was incorrect and their food was cold by the time we gave up and cancelled and left hungry. We got a half assed explanation but no apologies or compensation. We got a couple of appetizers which were decent but expensive and the portions were a joke. One shrimp bun was $5, and 6 tiny pieces of fried chicken were $8. The hyped up lobster fries were just a small lobster and a handful of fries. If you're charging $35 for a dish at least give enough fries for people to share. I literally ate 4. Overpriced, mediocre food and disorganized service. I don't remember the last time I left a restaurant this dissatisfied and had to go home and make ramen to not be hungry. Don't come here unless you're ready to take chances with whether or not you'll actually eat.","No takoyaki - they ran out. Ordered fries with spicy cod mayo, they brought the fries out with ketchup. Asked for the spicy cod mayo, then she comes out when we're almost done with the fries saying they ran out. Why would I order regular fries with ketchup at a Japanese restaurant.Agedashi tofu was fried with firm tofu instead of soft tofu. It did not taste good. Fried calamari legs had too much batter.Mega portion didn't seem like any more than the regular. Thick noodles was probably the only decent tasting thing. Spicy lobster broth tasted ok too, however, we PAID for extra spicy and it tasted mild. Will not return to this spot.","Been wanting to try this place out for a while And I finally made it. Overall the ramen in my opinion ,not bad ..But I had better. The experience was not wat I would have expected.wait time was over 40 mins for the ramen .YOU  would think the kitchen staff WAS goofing off. More over the water served there was tap n not filtered. After WAITING FOR 40mins for ramen I was given the wrong ramen bowl....thumbs down way down.","I came here specifically because of the Golden Lobster Cheese Fries, I heard of the concept, thought it was hilarious (and potentially darn tasty) and decided that it was worth a try.  I saw it on a friends Instagram, and immediately had to seek it out.  So I get there on a Thursday evening and its mildly packed, I order the golden lobster cheese fries, and I find out that it runs about $35-40.  Then again, what did I expect, its lobster!  2-3 lobster rolls could run you that much in this overpriced city.  I also ordered a Sapporo to wash down the lobster, and it was a good pairing.  The lobster is deep fried (everything was cooked well), and smothered with a ton of sweet mayo on top of mozzarella cheese that was melted into the lobster due to the heat.  It was laid down and presented to me on top of a pile of fries, and my lord was it good.  Is it worth the $35?  I'd say so just to say that you did it.  Would I come back and do this again and again?  Probably not, maybe 1 more time.  But I can't judge a restaurant off of just 1 dish.  My friends got assorted ramen dishes and they all looked delicious, but I was satisfied with my golden lobster!","I moved near by a year ago and have been coming since. Up until last night this rating would be a 5/5 - arguably best ramen I've ever had (spicy tan tan). To my disappointment last night the menu was different. Very similar but noticeably different. From what was just chicken broth changed to pork and chicken broth and what was ground pork changed to ground pork and ground beef. They sadly messed with perfection and am begging them to bring back the original recipe!!Overall I love the vibes, it's reasonably priced, always enough for lunch the next day too. The beef appetizer is also amazing. I will be back but hoping last night was a menu fluke!This place is def worth trying if you're thinking about it, especially if you haven't had it before. It's it's still pretty good but not what I've come to love over the past year","I've been coming here the past couple years. Everytime someone ask for ramen recommendation in the area, I always rave about Ryujin. However, today's experience was a total disappointment.We usually stop by for dinner, but today for lunch. We got the Spicy Tan Tan Men, Vegetable Miso Ramen and Torishio Ramen. First off all, the broth was luke warm, closer to room temperature. The Tan Tan Men, which was my usual go-to, was extra watery. The broth's usually nice and thick and very flavorful, but not today.The Vegetable Miso Ramen's broth tasted straight up like olive oil. This is because the deep fried tofu is drenched in oil. The deep fried onion topping was super chewy instead of crispy. Everything about it was just off. We had to send this back to the kitchen which is rare for me and my friends to ever to this.We ended up getting the Torishio as the replacement for the Vege Ramen. Sad. On top of all that, our waitress had a frown on her face the whole time.Was it because we showed up pretty early when the broth/kitchen ready? Were the chefs new? We'll never know.",RYUJIN
590,"To me they have the best shawrma in the city. The lamb, the vegetables, the sauce all complements one another.  The seating maybe a bit uncomfortable but decent when you on the go. The seasoning on the lamb makes it stand out.","This place is so hyped I am not sure why.. Service was fine.. This is the type of food I grew up on.. So compared to the original shawarma it's not that great... The bread was not fresh by any means (picture) it was breaking..They don't heat up anything, chicken shawarma was already cut and put in a pan which is not how shawarma should be.. The beef also was cut and in the bottom of the skewer.. It didnt taste fresh and the texture wasn't fresh either.. Oh and watch your step (no sign) when walking in they have this higher step at the entrance that can easily trip you over which almost happened and they made no comment about it..",Shawarma was NOT seasoned well. It was dry and tasteless. The bread was cold. The tahini was overwhelming. Not a fan.,"Halal™Love this place!OG staff, good vibes and great food at a good price!Recommendation: Shawarma plate w/ side of Falafels.",I think Mamoun's may have a new rival in town when it comes to the best falafel sandwich for your buck. I'd definitely recommend stopping by here for no frills Mediterranean food whenever you're in the area. Their falafel sandwiches are jam-packed with flavor and is pretty filling for a mere $4.36. The staff working here were quick and efficient and there was plenty of seating when I came on a weekday afternoon. Highly recommended!,"Came here on a Thursday night with 2 friends of mine! There wasn't a wait but the people taking our order were a little bit rude and impatient. Food: We got the chicken sandwich and also the small hummus (which comes with two pita breads which is nice) and also the spinach + meat pies. The pies were probably the best part, then the hummus. I wasn't the biggest fan of the chicken sandwich since it had an odd combination of ingredients. The hummus had a really solid taste and price combo! The spinach pie definitely had a great flakey texture to it and savory taste! Service: Food comes almost right as you order, so that's a redeeming quality! Ambiance: Super casual, a little dirty and old but very homey environment. Overall, a nice place to get a quick bite!",Oasis
591,"3.5 stars!You need a $20 minimum for delivery so my coworker and I ordered together. We got the chili wonton, walnut shrimp salad, plain wonton and the curry brisket noodle. Everything tasted okay, nothing amazing. The chili oil was very good though - slightly sweet and not too spicy. The only thing I would point out is that their wontons do have a lot of fat in them, but this is hard to avoid in any Chinese restaurant that has wontons. Fat gives it flavor and keeps the stuffing together. Other than that, the food was okay and delivery was fast.","i found a hair in the food. I told the waiter that there's a hair in it so he took the dish away. A minute after the waiter served me a 'new' dish, he claimed that it is a new dish they made for me. Usually scallions are putted on top of the food but at this time the scallions were blended into the food(means they only throw away the food with a hair and blended the food over to make it look different). They even microwaved the food again to make food steam and pretended it was a new dish. Don't want to come here again.","Cash only place that serves Hong Kong style food. Known mostly for their wontons, HK noodles/ramen. Place is set up to accommodate groups (large parties) so if you are a party of 2 or 1, you will be sitting on the same long table as other people.Food is good but nothing to brag about.","Price is reasonable, food is fresh. We ordered chicken curry with fried rice, i like the fact that curry is not super heavy. Fried chicken wing is okay, crispy but a little bit over cooked. My wonton noodle is fresh, wonton filled with pork and shrimp, fresh taste, thats why i love it. Will come back","Price is reasonable, food is fresh.

592,"My Turkish friend has been a big fan of this spot and I finally decided to pay a visit when en route for errands.  I had only intended to grab a refreshing beverage as I thought it was going to be more of a cafe setting.  However, when stepping into the place it's more a rustic restaurant or dare I say dacha?  Upon taking a look at the menu I discovered that it is an Azerbaijani restaurant with a lot of unfamiliar dishes.  I definitely had to try the kompot and for a light meal I ordered the hen salad.  It didn't look that appetizing as the fact that there is a lot of mayo or sauce mixed in , but it ended up being tasty.  However, the service was slow as a snail and very excruciating.  Other than that it was a cool experience.","Overrated place. Ordered borscht and chicken cutlets with mashed potatoes. Waited for my order for ages. Average, tasteless borsch. The moment I tried cutlets I felt it was not chicken at all. Turned out to be stinky lamb. Replaced with chicken kebab, turned out to be half raw.Don't recommend this place to anyone. And that was my first and last time there.","A M A Z I N G. Was riding by on my bike and i stopped in for the $10 lunch special. there's a huge variety of option but i went with (and would highly recommend) meat kutabi, borscht, cold eggplant salad, rice. $10!!","The food here is great. Everything that we got was delicious and full of flavor. The lamb chops and chicken were cooked nicely, and the starters were good too. Its somewhat in an awkward location, but it isn't that big of an issue.","Came on a weekend brunch time and it was not busy at all.  Place is located inside the parking lot of a wine/liquor store. Even though there's a sign that says parking is for liquor customers only, you can still park there if you're eating at village Cafe. I called and asked. Inside has a nice a cozy feel to it. It's actually quite spacious and is good for large parties.After we ordered the food, the waiter asked if we wanted bread. We said yes and they served us bread. Keep in mind that there is an extra charge for this bread. The bread was pretty good though so not gonna complain. It was nice and warm. They also asked if we wanted salad, not sure if this has an extra charge but we opted out of it. We ordered the spinach puff pastries for appetizers. Be careful as they were super hot. Inside was more liquidy than I hoped for. Tasted decent.Lamb lulya kebab- delicious! Tastes better when you eat with your hands rather than cutting it into little pieces with a knife. The lamb was not too gamey but was very flavorful. It was also quite soft.Mother in laws chicken--also pretty good. It says ""baked chicken"", but it was lightly breaded chicken beasts covered in cheese. It was pretty good. Flavorful. The cheese was pretty good and quite light compared to Italian cheesey pastas.Overall, I had an enjoyable meal here. I would come again if I was nearby.","This unassuming spot is tucked back from the street on Coney Island Ave. There's street parking out front, and the restaurant has a warm rustic vibe. My girlfriend and I went here on New Year's Day after reading Pete Wells' 2 star review in The NYT. We took his recommendations and ordered the following:Bread ($1.75): Crusty yet chewy, everything that good bread should be. A must order but kind of ridiculous that they charge for this. Kutaby ($2.50 each): Tried one with greens and lamb. Served with yogurt sauce. The lamb is a must order and one of the better things we ate. Journey To Baku salad ($11): Could hardy taste the eggplant. Tasted very similar to pico de gallo. Didn't merit the price tag. Pass on this. Chicken Kebab ($6.50): Did not come on spit and was served with rice, red onion and a Heinz 57 style sauce. The chicken thigh meat wasn't very moist either. Pass on this. Guru Hingal ($12$): Buttery noodles with minced lamb. This was the standout dish. Similar to a beef stroganoff (which is also on the menu) but not creamy at all. A must order. Baklava ($3): Just ok. Not as flaky as I would have liked. Take it or leave it. I guess three out of six ain't bad. If the restaurant were closer, we'd try it again and stick to the more traditional Azerbaijan dishes which seemed to be best here.",Village Cafe
593,"Oh boy... This is not a horrible place, but it's just not that great. If you are brought here, it's ok. Their soup dumplings are not great, but edible. The pan fried buns were bland. I ate the meat, but the bread was terrible, and I have to say the meat wasn't even that great. The service is so-so. They accidentally brought us pickled cucumbers, and I had actually thought of ordering that, but I guess I either forgot, or changed my mind last minute, because they realized I never ordered it. Instead of saying sorry but you can keep it (we already started eating it), they took it back to the kitchen. Did they trash it (if so, what a waste), or did they just bring it to the people who had ordered (if so... eh.... kinda gross?). What saved this place is their decor. It is whimsical with anime posters and figurines.",Not sure why they serve soy milk in a bowl but I found a piece of rice inside my soy milk . We did not order any rice dish .,This has to be the worse dumplings I ever had in my entire life. First of all she gave me 6 pieces instead of 9 and to be honest it was the best choice to do that because I could not even finish it. The upper wasn't even cooked and the crab meat or Park was the worse I ever tasted. Never again!!,"I'm so glad there's another restaurant on 86th serving soup dumplings and fried pork buns. Nearby Liu's Shanghai was closed for vacation, which brought my friends and I over here for a taste, and I'm delighted to report a happy thumbs up. We loved everything we ordered: scallion pancakes, pork soup dumplings, crabmeat and pork soup dumplings, scallion noodles, and pan fried pork buns. I would definitely come for their soup dumplings. I preferred their regular pork to the crabmeat and pork mix. There's six to a basket and they're pretty large with generous amounts of soup (yum!) Although I do have to suggest caution with using the tongs to pick up the dumpling, as they're prone to ripping. The scallion noodles are another winner here, albeit a bit oily, but that makes for a great little indulgence once in while. Fans of scallion pancake (crispy and flavorful) and pan fried pork buns (so fluffy and best eaten fresh) will also not be disappointed. Order them to round out your feast of carbs to satisfy your tastebuds and tummies.","MR BUNOVERALL: 7.7/10The place is good, the food is good, customer service is good. FOOD: 7.6/10We got the soup dumplings, drunk chicken, rice cake, shumai. The soup dumplings I'd say Like Cafe is better. The texture of the dumpling is good but the soup and the meat doesn't really have much taste. The drunken chicken had WAYYY too much taste  was a little too salty. The rice cake was perfect, not too heavy. The shumai barely had any taste to it but the texture was pretty good. SERVICE: 7.7/10Service is typically good. CLEANLINESS: 8.6/10The place is clean.

594,"We didn't really know what we were getting into here. We were on our way elsewhere but with a sore foot I saw Ume so we went in. After sitting down they explained our only option was the $65 pp menu. We weren't allowed to just order from the ala cart menu. There were pieces we dont eat on the set menu so they made substitutions but one substitution was meat (we don't eat meat). My husband accidentally ate his and I spit mine out when I realized. Told them we don't eat squid, they substituted octopus (even worse). Ended up costing $200 and we went to get pizza after! We were not stoked to have spent $200 on a dinner neither of us liked very much and we were left hungry. (Wish we had gone to Salt and Charcoal and spent $200 there) I think if your goal is an Instagram dinner it's more worth it.We would have enjoyed it more if we could have just ordered what we wanted from the ala Carter menu options. Still cannot believe how much we spent at this place. I guess it's partly my fault because I kinda knew we should have left when they said we had to stick with the prix fixe menu but at that point we had already taken our shoes off, washed our hands in the little sinks, sat down been served water the whole bit so I felt like it would have been rude to leave. So spent $200 left unhappy and hungry and am leaving this review.",Very pretty display! It is overpriced though for what it is and I don't like the fact that we have to leave our shoes by the door where I cannot see them. I asked for a plastic bag so I can carry my shoes inside with me but they told me they had no plastic bags...They also make a big deal about cancellations but they themselves do not call or text the day before like they said they would.,"This was incredibly disappointing for me :( I was really looking forward to Ume, as I thought the experience of creating and mixing/matching your own sushi was super unique and worth it. We made a reservation at 8:30pm, arrived early, and then had to wait a further 15 minutes until we could be seated. Okay, this happens all the time - no problem. Once we seated however, and received our sushi ingredients, my boyfriend and I were both surprised at the small amounts of fish/nori/rice that we were given to create our sushi. At $55 per person, I expected to get a more substantial amount of ingredients, and the amount we received was unacceptable to me. Our total bill came up to $146 dollars for two sushi sets and two orders of nori. Bf still had to get a burger from the shake shack nearby since he was starving!In addition, when it was time to get the check, we waited for over 25 minutes before being able to catch someone's eye to receive the bill, even though we were clearly ready to leave.Overall, unique experience but poor execution - I don't think I'll be coming back until things (and portions) improve.",First time here and I really was blown away by the atmosphere and taste of this place. We ordered 2 of the Sushi platters given to us by the chef and we were in love. Came at 2pm and there was literally only 1 person there. Staff was very friendly and nice and gave us lots of guidence. Will definitely be back!P.S. I think we forgot to give tips since we used a card and thought tips were included already. Sorry!,"This place is a cute concept. We walked in here thinking it was a regular sushi restaurant. You have to ring the doorbell to be let in, once you go inside you are asked to remove your shoes and wash your hand at a nearby sink. You are then escorted to the seating area: you have a choice of chef counter or floor seating. We chose the floor. The menu you essentially don't get to choose there's already a pre set menu but you can add a la carte dishes. We added the uni roll which was ok. The food and each piece was also just ok Also after sitting on the floor for a while your legs will start to get numb , i would suggest to sit at chef counter","Very unique way to enjoy sushiAnd how they display the dish was amazing!All the flavor of each sushi is delicious and fresh. But the compare to the portion, it's bit over price.",Ume Williamsburg
595,"Pretty disappointed by this place. Heard great things but from the moment we walked in the staff was not friendly or grateful that we were there. We were seated and greeted by a server who was also not happy to be there. This was some of the worst service I've experienced in a while. Makes sense that they add gratuity to the tab even though we were a party of 2. We were also not notified that gratuity would be added. The drinks were tasty and fun, but nothing over the top. Everything we ordered was overpriced and not amazing. We shared 4 appetizers, one being the fries. for 16 dollars for fries, I expected more. All in all, 2 drinks, 4 appetizers to share and 1 desert came out to 160 dollars. Wow! That's expensive if you ask me. Wouldn't return and wouldn't recommend.","The service was horrible. First of, the drinks were served after some of the appetizers were at the table, had to keep asking the waitress for it. They brought out the wrong ones, They kept messing up the orders, bringing the wrong things, and you had to wait for it for a very long time. They even screwed up the dessert order. Def understaffed. The food was mediocre. Not worth their price tag. Not coming back.PS The drinks are not not good either. How do you mess up a sangria?!","Service was extremely poor! I got to the venue a bit early and the manager or whoever leave was the manager was the sweetest and allowed me to sit at the bar while they set up for dinner. Unfortunately, that is the extent of the hospitality and customer service that I received. The bartender was extremely rude and instead of treating me as a paying customer treated me like a thorn in his side. He gave great service to two Caucasian women and a Caucasian man sitting next to me. But I got cold shares and eye rolls. Too bad for them. I won't be back.","Came for a quick dinner with family after a show at Bell House, but even though place was closing soon, hostess did not tell us that they were closing in a few min, so we stayed. Service was good but RUSHED, we got our Entree before we finished our appetizer, and got our dessert Before we were done with Entree. Music was turned off before we were done with main course. And even though we were only a party of 3, they included 18% gratuity. Once again good was good, but we rushed. I hope next time we come, we can enjoy our meal.","I have come here on two separate occasions and I have been blown away each time. Yes, the food is very expensive so be prepared, but personally I think it's worth it for an occasional splurge. The staff is friendly, even on a busy night, and the space itself is beautiful. High ceilings, candles on each table, and rustic decoration make for a wonderful setting. I tried dishes I would normally dislike, but I was proved wrong every. single. time. Everything from the frisée, to the steak, to the dessert sauces are fresh, wonderful quality, and perfectly executed. The drinks menu is tasteful and also very well crafted. I am a big fan of steak so I ordered it on my salad. They do make it pretty rare, so be sure to specify if you'd like a more well done steak. It was tender, well seasoned, and melted in my mouth. I don't mind spending some extra money occasionally on such delicious food. The only suggestions I'd have are do not bring kids here, and do not bring a large party unless you can pay in the thousands. Perfect for date night or an intimate dinner, I would definitely recommend!","I liked this place okay and was fascinated by the fact that it was a fully kosher restaurant serving absolutely no dairy. However, it is definitely overpriced for the quality of the food. The other turnoff is that for four people they included gratuity which we did not know, but luckily as we were filling out the tip line our server told us. How much did we tip? No idea. If it was under 20% we would've actually tipped more.My friends and I split several appetizers and a bottle of wine and we still ended up spending around $60 each. All of the appetizers are around $20 and the ones we had were okay but not anything I'd call my mother over. The lamb sliders were just okay, the duck confit with gnocchi had almost no duck(& the gnocchi was rubbery), the cauliflower was good but not particularly warm but it was at least priced reasonably. I did enjoy the food but give me something incredible if I'm paying $20 for a starter. The aioli was the best part.I would be hesitant to go back for the steak only because of how okay the starters were. It is an interesting design though and they have a big outdoor area which I'm sure is amazing in the summer.",Bison & Bourbon
596,"Service: 2-Stars.  * Very SLOW, waited 20 minutes for Pad Thai.  Yes, it's Friday but it was 9pm and the restaurant was not fully packed.  The service staffs were totally disarray - there were many dirty tables that were never cleaned during my entire 30 minutes stay.  * Not once did the server come to check on me during my meal.  The only time that they came quickly was 3.5 minutes after I finished !  So they are not that slow after all !Food: 3.5-Star. The taste was on point but the noodle is a little too hard (overly al-dente). Also the serving temperature is on the cold side.  Not enough 鑊氣 (loosely translates to ""the strength of the fire"")","I really don't understand the positive reviews for this place. I went one evening with my partner and ordered some small plates and their famous duck breqst ramen. The ramen WAS BAD- like ROTTEN. My partner saw the chef smell the meat before cooking it. When we got it the broth was fine but the meat tasted completely bad. When I told the waitress she looked at me and asked - ""have you ever had Asian food before?"" Um. I'm Chinese. I have clearly eaten Asian food before. It was insulting.They agreed to swap it out for a different noodle dish begrudgingly and then charged us for the duck noodles anyways. Pretty ridiculous.Also the inside just feels dirty and the chairs are plastic tiny stools. Overall a really uncomfortable and rude dining experience.","I came at 10:20pm to get takeout from this overpriced restaurant and they had closed up shop and wouldn't accommodate - even though their hours are till 11pm.

I came a full 40 min before ""closing"". 30 min or less sure but full 40 min???","Such a great spending time at Baoburg Restaurant.

Also their patio is relaxing for our lunch.  Hands down 5 star.Definitely I will come back  for next trip in New York.","The ambience gets 5 stars. The outdoor space is great to hang out in during a slightly warmer Fall night. Location is also prime for me since it's a close walk from my place.In terms of food though, I feel like I've definitely had better Asian fusion. Everything was pretty heavy and filling so you feel like you have a brick in your stomach the rest of the night. It's possible that we ordered too much (and our waitress did dissuade us from getting a noodle dish at the beginning when we had already ordered rice. Very good advice and overall service definitely gets a 5 star rating as well because we were checked on throughout our visit and we were able to get in and out pretty quickly so we made it to our concert in the city on time.) Would I come back? Not fully sure. Maybe just for the bao buns, because as the name suggests, they're definitely the best things on the menu.",Baoburg was a great experience. My friend and I were walking in Brooklyn and we happened to stumble upon this restaurant. What a great find! The ambiance is really cool and has this bohemian feel to it. They have great music and the inside is just feels really hip and trendy. They also have a large patio in the back with lots of seating surrounded by a nice garden. The inside could feel a bit small but the out side is a lot more spacious. The food was really god. I had the steamed shrimp and chicken dumplings. They had a nice presentation and very good. I also had the brisket ramen which was also delicious. The ramen was a lot. Definitely a plate you want to share if you don't eat too much. And my friend had the stir fry noodles which looked equally as good. I would say the place is well suited as a hang out spot with some friends. I would come back again.,Baoburg
597,"I normally only order Kimchi stew but decided to order the japchae.  I bit down on a huge piece of ROCK. I may have damaged my tooth, need to monitor. The restaurant declined to issue a refund. RIDICULOUS. Do not eat here. Instead, go to Hanki, never had a problem there.","Food is good. Most of it tastes the same, unfortunately. Service is cold, at best. Not friendly or inviting. Atmosphere is dark and sort of loud with strange videos playing on a large screen. Music is harsh and bad.",This is the most authentic Korean food I have had in the US since leaving Korea. The pajeon was crispy and actually had onions. The food wasn't Americanized. They actually had makeoli! I can't wait to go back!,"We have been coming to this place for four years, its my favorite restaurant in our neighborhood. The food is always great but today was the best meal we had here. Our four dishes were all deep red but all tasted completely different. The kimchee stew and stir fried pork were both very complex and amazing in flavor. The tteokbokki was sweet and spicy.  We also had fried kimchee, which wasn't on the menu but made on request. But it wasn't just plain kimchee, it had this great smokey and sesame seasoning, excellent. Then there is the location. Im always excited to come here because it feels like your stepping out of Bed-Stuy and going somewhere else. Its chic and modern but also cozy and comfortable. Its also on a beautiful side street and on the basement level of the building, so it feels like a hidden gem. The service is also great, very helpful and knowledgable.","Go to Hanki instead! It amazes me how people treat different customers... i came here alone for lunch. Ive ordered delivery from here several times so figure it was a great option.I waited 20mins for my food and had an emergency call come up for work that I had to take. After 20mins of waiting and not receiving my food I asked to receive it to go. I was fine with waiting until I paid and went upstairs to take my call.I figured since the upstairs was a coffee shop with wifi for paying customers I could buy something from there AS WELL and work from there with my food.When I sat down with my food from the same restaurant downstairs the guy yelled no outside food. I explained i just paid for food from downstairs and a drink from upstairs and both men behind the counter stared at me as if I was a nuisance... ok weird.Then the guy proceeded to explain to me that I could sit outside if I wanted to eat.... fine no problem. I wont eat my food that i bought from this restaurant... I will not be spending my money here again to be treated this poorly as if I hadnt just supported their business.I would also recommend trying Hanki instead of this place... their food is amazing, great service and cocktails.","The food was overall decent (my mom and I ordered some fried rice with chicken,  bibimbap with bulgogi, eventually kalgugsu at the end). We both loved the small but delicious side dishes that we asked for more. I only wish that they served hot rice but the coldish rice they serve was fine, I didn't ask for it hot after all. Service was very good especially from our Korean waitress. There was only one but we went at a very quiet time so she could have managed. Also this may just be from pereference but the chair I sat on was somewhat uncomfortable. I would go to this place again if I find myself near Pratt.",Taste Korea 232
598,Good Ethiopian food that's not too expensive with decent sized portions (in comparison to my other experiences w Ethiopian platters that have had small portions). The sampler (we got the meat sampler) was enough for two with an app. Cool vibe inside but expect to wait for a table at peak dinner time.,The combo for 2 was ok. The spicy chicken was really hot to handle. Eat at your own risk. I liked that they provided more bread as much as you want.,"This place is EVERYTHING. We got lamb entree and veggies. Had the mushroom tibs for an appetizer - which was dope.I highly doubt anything is bad on the menu. Legitimately want to try everything there.Also, we had the honey wine. Surprisingly good - even though I usually don't have sweet wine. If only I could quit my job, order a few cases of honey wine, and get wine drunk on a beach somewhere for the rest of my life...","I've had lots of Ethiopian food over time, and although I'm west African, I definitely know good Ethiopian food. I ended up getting the combination platter with tibs (sautéed beef), yatakilt alicha (cabbage, carrots, potato), key sir (beet stew), misir wot (lentils), and doro wat (chicken stew). I think the tibs were the best part of my meal. They were very tender and flavorful. The doro wat was great as well, and I was pleased to have a nice piece of juicy chicken. All of the other vegetarian stews were okay, they were just lacking in flavor. They did run out of fasolia (green beans, carrots) and I was pretty disappointed about that since it's one of my favorite vegan Ethiopian dishes. I also tried the authentic honey wine for the first time, which I thought was really good!I wish there was an option to add the kitfo to the combination platter because I was really feeling adventurous that day and ready to try the raw beef, but maybe next time I'll try it!The service was great - the waitresses were very attentive and always checked in on us. If I could, I would rate this restaurant a 4.5/5. Not too bad of a place at all!","Pretty sure I left my credit card there a week ago. I've been trying to reach them and they don't answer, they don't return my messages and when I finally got someone on the phone they said call back in 10 minutes and hung up on me. They didn't answer 10 minutes later. Now their mailbox is full. Service wasn't any better when I was there. If you like spicy Ethiopian food with bad service this is the place for you.","I cannot recommend Awash strongly enough.  I've had Ethiopian food all over the U.S. and Awash is the best I've had, hands down.  I always order the meat platter which comes with plenty of veggie sides piled high on the injera.  Service is fast, prices are reasonable, atmosphere is bright and friendly. Reservations are accepted but usually not necessary even though the place is usually bustling during peak hours.",Awash Brooklyn
599,"Had a cup of coffee and danish here. Coffee tastes worst than a deli cup, they charge higher than Starbucks. Danish was bleh. Over priced for its location and doesnt taste good. Hungry Ghost is a better option.",Nice place cannot express my love and appreciate for this place that come in clutch at 12 noon,"Let's scream burrata! I ordered the burrata bowl with carrots, beets, kale, and I think sweet potatoes.  Talk about a light meal and you feel satisfied. The place is small but cozy. The staff is polite and non pressuring. The vibe is between have a cup of coffee and working on  a computer.  The yelp reviews did not disappoint.","I live right around the corner and this place is my always go to for cold brew and frittata. My ""work from home"" Fridays always start with Lella! There's something charming and cozy about this place. Staff is so friendly and food is always great!Please please please never change guys! It's hard to find such a cool place that stays awesome throughout the years!","All I can say is wow. I walked into Lella thinking that the store was insanely cute and looking at the menu, my eyes became bigger than my stomach. I've never had a ham and cheese crepe I've liked before even from those French bistros, but the crepes or Piadine is absolutely unmatched here. I've never had something so delicious in my life.The coffee is also phenomenal and I can't wait to start making regular visits to this place.","How can a place have 150+ reviews and be 5 stars?Well, if your food is this good, and your place is super cute like Lella Alimentari, then it's possible. Shared burrata, Avocado + pork and roasted pepper bowl,PiadiniEverything was so good!!Only downside is that space is a little limited. We went at an hour, didn't have any trouble at all, but I could see it being a problem on the weekend.Staff were super friendly and helpful as well.",Lella Alimentari
600,"this is not a half chicken this is just a quarter leg. please detail what type/part of the ""rotisserie style chicken"" you use on your seamless menu. i am not about that chicken on antibiotics life so i threw this in the trash. everything else (rice and beans) was decent.","I ordered delivery with the ETA to be 6:39 at the latest, and I'm sitting here at 7:21 and the restaurant told grub hub support that they can't locate the driver with my food? And then asked for another 15 minutes. It's a burrito dude why would anyone want to have a burrito that took 2 hours to get delivered.","Crappy steak and rice, almost burned, came as a whole piece, not as served anywhere.  Chicken was flat, soup was salty.  Anyway, no more go for me.","Fridays have become ""Mexico Fridays"" for my husband and I. We love Mexican food and we were really impressed with our first delivery order from Mexico Diner the other month...so we made it our every Friday dinner ritual!  We get delivery and my husband makes margaritas at home and I can't tell you how much we look forward to Fridays!Each week I like to get at least one new item on the menu we haven't had before so after 6 or so dinners we have tried a lot of different things! Favorites include chicken enchilada verde, the incredible mole sauce--we've had chicken enchiladas with mole as well as the mole poblano, which is rich and decadent bone-in chicken with mole sauce. My only complaint is the portion size of the mole poblano--2 small pieces of chicken for $15. Other standouts are the Chile Rellenos, the delicious guacamole, pico de gallo salsa, tacos con todo (we had al pastor tacos), fried plantains.I've tried the grilled spring onion, tortas, tortilla soup (really good!), Mexican style roasted chicken, huaraches, flan and coconut flan. We definitely like some dishes more than others but everything is very good to amazing!  We are so happy to have Mexico Diner in the neighborhood and with such a huge menu, we have no need to try any other place for our Mexico Fridays!","Really noce place, good service, ample portions at a fair price. An old friend lives nesr here and I had always wanted to try it but never had the opportunity until my family was in town. The chips were flour--not my fave, bit very good example of same. The salsa served with them was chunky, fresh, and layered with flavors--not something w have found anywhere in our home town of Portland. My only complaint with it was that they tagged it with some sugar--nothing you'd notice on the first several bites, but it creeps up and is a touch annoying for my palate. Probably not something that would bother or be noticed by many. We had an avocado salad, vegetable enchiladas, cheese enchiladas and fish tacos. The salad was fresh and, by design, the dressing came on the side. This was a nice touch, since many places overdress their greens. A bit of a surprise, and more traditional than you would get in America. By this, I mean that the cheese inside was not melted mozzarella, but chunks of Cotija. It was mild and pleasant, although the green sauce was a little spicy for the kids. The three fish tacos were generous, filled with quite a lot of tilapia, and came garnished with some radish and lime. They were not the best fish tacos, but they were fresh and pleasant.The kids each got an horchata, and both really liked it. My older one is a bit of an horchata connoisseur and he gave it top ratings. My kids give this place 3.5 stars, and on food alone, I somewhat agree with them. I've rounded up because the value proposition is so good, and the workers clearly care. I suspect that meat eaters might bump this even higher to 4.25.","This review is so long overdue. A couple of years ago I was sat on my couch looking for a place to eat. Obviously, I turned to Yelp. I wanted to try something new, and Mexico Diner was just that. They were right up top! Even better, they were literally a block from my apartment down a side street I never walked down, because I'm a. creature of habit and all that. My girlfriend and I went once, thinking it'd be a letdown. We were wrong. This is seriously some of the best Mexican food in Brooklyn. Authentic, delicious, and filling. It's even pretty cheap, which is an obvious plus!I've since moved from Ditmas Park, but still find myself trying to bribe my girlfriend into going. With food as delicious as this, the bribes don't take much. We keep coming back, we keep loving it. And honestly, if you're looking for a great place to eat this is it. Get the Platillo Mexicano and you won't be disappointed.",Mexico Diner
601,"Food was ok , but service was bad. The food was delayed and my salad was missing the tofu.","Got the berry smoothie and it was a bit chalky. My girlfriend got the greens smoothie and was not a huge fan. I'm sure it's very healthy, but I was not a fan of the flavor.",DELIVERY WARNING... I order delivery with Grubhub. Waited for two hours my food never showed.I called between the estimated time to check on my food. 35-55 minutes.I was told by BG phone the food was sitting waiting for the delivery guy.I waited another hour for my food to arrived. At this point I'm starving. 2 minutes before BE GOOD closed I got a called from BG. Saying the delivery guy dint find my place the delivery guy was upset.I'm writing this review very disappointed and starving.Thanks for nothing.,"EVERY TIME Justin has a smile on his face and welcomes me. He welcomes everyone. He is friendly and professional. He is wonderful! Today I came in with my friend to have dinner and we were helped by Terry and Justin. We found out that they both pulled a double shift. We would not have known it if we weren't told. They were both helpful and professional.Oh and by the way - the food is EXCELLENT! 2nd time having the Maple Bacon Burger - juicy and delicious with a wonderful coleslaw crunch. Love, love, love the Beet-Ginger Lemonade. It will be my summer go to drink. Okay - so I'm never sure if I'm going to like eggplant dishes. My friend had me try one of her eggplant meatballs (vegetarian) and it was so delicious. The sweet potato fries have a nice crispness and are tasty.","I'm pleasantly surprised at this place. Was looking for a low key meal that wasn't too heavy and we stumbled upon this little gem. Their sweet potato fries were delicious. My sister and I enjoyed our beef burgers, they have a good variety of styles and they were well executed. The chicken one was a bit dry, and I like how they have option of veggie as well.The registers are on the lower level of the store, with communal tables when you first enter so you don't have to bring a stroller down if you're a parent, but may be difficult for you to order if you're by yourself. They have meal options for kids including mini smoothies.Overall, it's a great place to grab a tasty casual meal. Quality is good, seating is plentiful, and they have enough variety to keep a group happy. Would gladly come back.",So tummy and tasty. Food is fresh and very delicious. Was in the area and happy to see reviews for this place. Positive review and healthy many led me here. Very satisfied!,B.GOOD
602,"The few (if not only) place to offer Burmese dishes in the neighborhood.Memorable dishes were the tea salad, the breakfast noodles, and the mango salad with rice.","Finally!!! A real Burmese restaurant in the NYC area. I'm so happy and stuffed. ""Oscar"" Aye Myint is the friendly owner-chef and he cooks up a mean feast. Came here with 4 people and we ordered 9 different dishes and made reorders on 3. Everything was A+ but highlights were: mohinga (catfish lemongrass noodle soup), oh no kauswe (chicken coconut curry over noodles), platha (multi layered bread that's oh so buttery yet light), la phet thoke (tea lead salad), than ba ya the thoke (lime cabbage salad). I am so all about this place, you don't even know.",Haven't tasted a dish I don't like yet and the food is very authentic. My favorite is the fish curry,"If you like flavourful food with lots of different colours and textures, you have to stop by Together. It has been on my New York City eating list for a very long time and I am so glad to have finally made it there. This place deserves 5+ stars. How about a Michelin star?It's a humble little place in Brooklyn that serves both sushi and Burmese food. The proprietors were very patient and polite while we took our time deciding what to eat. We also saw a lot of locals in the dining room and ordering take out while we were there on Thursday night near closing time.We've had Burmese food before in Lansing, Michigan, and we wanted to try the tea leaf salad again. The version at Together is delicious! We also tried the Mohinga. It reminded me of a bouillabaisse, but even better with the perfectly cooked noodles and the lime, cilantro and chili flakes you can add to the soup. The Si Jet seems to be a popular dish. Yep, the reviews are true - try it! So delicious! And we rounded out dinner with the Sweetie Rangoon. It's a huge bowl with coconut jelly, crustless white bread, tapioca and sticky coconut rice in a healthy dose of coconut milk with ice cubes to keep it cold. The different textures to this dessert make it amazing. There's plenty to share, but I won't judge if you don't! It's a bit far from my own neighbourhood to visit often, but my husband has already offered to schlep meals back from Together because he now wants to try their entire Burmese menu. Don't miss out!","Came here during our weekend trip to NY. Even though we stayed in TimeSquare, we were really excited to try a NY burmese restaurant so we took the subway and rode 45-50 mins to try this place. The restaurant itself is tucked away in lower part of Brookyln. There were several supermarkets and stores in the area but it's a completely different vibe from timesquare area. It has a ChinaTown vibe but a little cleaner and a lot quieter. The restaurant was clean and the interior design reminded me of an older Burmese reataurant back home (idk if that's good considering we're in the U.S. and NY at that lol). But  overall it had a very warm vibe. It's a family owned small little restaurant that serves both burmese food and japanese sushi. The owner is Burmese and used to be a sushi chef before he opened the restaurant which means the sushi's probably good (we didn't try it). For the food, I had the Moe Hing Khar which was good - I didn't taste the fishy residue that I sometimes taste from other reataurants. It was fresh and i love that it came with lots of lime, wxtra cilantro and red hot very spicy chilli burmese peppers. We also ordered laphetthoke which was very good - very very fresh. The way it was made was nothing too special but I'm gald they used fresh laphettoke which can make or break the dish. We also had Tha Yet Thi Thoke (Mango Salad). I was a little disappointed that it wasn't green mango (the Burmese mango salad uses green mango). The sweet mango gave a different type of taste - a mix of sweet and spicy. It might taste better if they add lime juice and refrigerate it. I wasn't that much of a fan but the others liked it so maybe it's just me. Overall this was a good restaurant to get your Burmese food fix. Would I ride a 45-50 mins subway just to come back here? Maybe not. But would def stop by again if I'm in the area. Wishing the best to the owner and the family!","Food: so good the broth and everything wow!! The egg was so good!! Both of the broth was so tasty!! Fish Mohinga, coconut !!It was about $30 for all 3 items!The servers were also from Burma and authentic!Cute interior and clean bathroom. Vibe: def cozy, there's also a tv that plays Burmese shows. Would def come back :) My friend was craving Burmese food so we pulled thru!",Together
603,"Be careful when you go there, they obviously don't care about customer safety. My boyfriend got an iced coffee after we ate and the server brought it to us black. He put his own put milk and sugar in it, stirred it and we took it home. He didn't drink it all and left it on the counter for a few hours after. Naturally the ice melted and it looked like just iced coffee in a ""to go"" cup. As I was pouring out the old coffee, a piece of a glass bottle came out into the sink from the cup. God knows if more glass particles were in that iced coffee and we ingested it. I didn't realize it while the ice was in there because it felt like ice with the paper straw we got. I wanted to go back and complain but he told me they wouldn't believe me. It is a careless restaurant and why wouldn't it be? It looked like it was basically ran by teenagers. Not going there ever again.",VEGANS BEWARE! They offer the Impossible Burger (vegan per the Uber eats menu) but they don't pay attention to the description of what they say comes on it. The bun wasn't sprouted and they added a sauce that clearly was dairy. The cheese was probablydairy as well. You can't blame Uber Eats for this. When I called the location they guy answering the phone had no real knowledge of the menu. He wasn't helpful about me getting the correct food either. I threw the sandwich in the garbage. They can't be trusted.,"I ordered the Flamin' Bacon Burger via Seamless in December 2018, and  it arrived partially raw on the inside. It's not the first time I've received a questionably cooked beef burger from this location. This time was particularly bad though. Their food tastes good, but if I can't rely on it being properly cooked, it's just not worth it.","Have to say Barebeurger has definitely stepped it up. - Menu for anyone looking to healthy cheat day - Vegan options, different meats to choice from to add on burger - The fries (regular or sweet potato) are always my go to with the dipping sauce - Staff needs to be a bit more attentive but I wouldn't necessarily complain - Tends to get crowded on weekends - Would recommend taking the order to go if you don't want to do the whole Parkslope experience of kids running around & screaming","Last dinner in Brooklyn! Having tummy trouble from all the eating out this week but managed to nibble a few fries and yummy ginger beer. Guys had burgers - huge menu for vegans and vegetarians as well as meat eaters. Service ok. Unhappy millinials? Very cool interior decor, great 80s tunes and outdoor seating. Didn't have to wait long on a Friday at 830 but full house. Great shopping and food area of Park Slope. Good choice post Brooklyn Museum visit for sure!","I like Bareburger and think its OK, but I don't think I would return. I ordered the beyond burger which is my ""go-to"" and I usually love it but, to be honest while I was eating it at Bareburger it tasted really strange. Another thing I didn't like was the onion rings were not really thin and crunchy they were more so thick and, just not my favorite. The sweet potato fries are good and, I would order those again. The menu has a vast selection, and the milkshakes all looked and sounded really good. I enjoyed that they had outdoor seating but, if I would return I probably would not order that burger. I also did not like the fact they didn't offer the option of putting my beyond burger on a potato bun which is honestly the best type of bun for that burger. Great service, cash and credit accepted.",Bareburger
604,"I wanted to believe this place would be very authentic Japanese ramen based on the description on their website. However,1. The broth was too little. The broth-noodle ratio should be equal. You are supposed to enjoy noodles and broth at the same time. But because the broth was too little, 2. The noodles were not cooked. Normally they undercook the noodles and let the hot broth cook the noodle a little more in the bowl.  But because the broth was too little, it couldn't keep the hot temperature, so then the noodle couldn't continue to cook. After a few slurp I asked for more broth, and they wanted to charge me. So I had to talk to the general manager and explain why I need more broth. So he brought out more broth on the side but by now the whole experience is ruined anyways. They should use bigger bowls so they can serve the right noodle-broth ratio, or serve less noodles so it has the right ratio. Or if they find customers don't finish their broth, that shouldn't be the reason for serving less broth. Or if they are running low on broth on a particular day, they should simply not sell ramen for the remainder of the day instead of cutting short on broth and not give customers the best experience they deserve considering how expensive their ramen is. It shouldn't be just expensive just because it's in an expensive hip neighborhood, but it should live up to expectation.",We got Tsunakotsu ramen and Unimiso Mazemen. Mazenmen noodles were little firm.. and Tsunakotsu ramen was too fishy.. I think they are over priced for small portions too. Only thing we liked was their interior design. Their food is unique but the taste wasn't that good. I don't think I will come back though. Once was enough.,"I'm giving an extra star for the intimacy and friendly staff. They don't accept tip, which means the food is slightly more costly than what is expected at other similar restaurants. Portions are smaller than normal.The space is small, cozy, well lit, and has an open kitchen. We had the mackerel cold style ramen and the tunakotsu ramen. Tasty but not anything too memorable.","So my DATE had taken me here because it was late and I was craving ramen. It's a small restaurant but I hear it gets busy quick. Luckily when I arrived the place was empty so we were seated immediately. My friend ordered the bacon and eggs mezzamen & I ordered their spicy miso tuna ramen. Both were very good, but the bacon and egg mezzamen ramen was my favorite. The spicy ramen was very good too! I've never had a tuna ramen before so that was very new to me. I enjoyed my time and the waitress was great too. Always kept making sure our glasses of water weren't empty. Highly recommend for anyone that wants to try some real ramen.","My boyfriend and I were so excited to come here because we love Okonomi and these homestyle/hole in the wall restaurants. We decided to give it a try even after we moved far from Brooklyn on a random weeknight around 8PM.The wait? Not too bad, but not good either and even after we sat. 15 minutes before we could sit was reasonable; we found a cute book store down the neighborhood to leisure at. BUT, when we came back and ordered food, it took us about half an hour longer for our food. Waiter forgot to give us napkins and utensils. Eh, okay. (We ended up not leaving until after 9PM)Taste?I ordered the Tunakotzu ramen not knowing what else to order (didn't know what else to get) Honestly, underwhelming to both me and my boyfriend. My boyfriend ordered the Ankimo. We couldn't tell which was more underwhelming; the ingredients didn't really spark anything in me. I wish we had just went to another ramen shop. Bill was over $50 for our two ramen bowls and appetizer.  Really sad and disappointing. Don't think we'll come back again for ramen.","Mazemen all day, every day, baby! The thing I like most about this restaurant (besides the food) is how quickly they get you and and get you out. Also, the fact that gratuity is included.But seriously, get you some bacon and egg mazemen and spicy tuna mazemen, and get you it now. You won't be disappointed.",YUJI Ramen
605,"So disappointing.  We've been here twice before for parties and decided to host a family birthday party here.  Lovely interaction while making a reservation.  We were seated next to the door and were so cold with people opening the door coming in and out.  But with the food.  For apps, we had the tomato and mozzarella, octopus and a few salads.  Nothing was spectacular.  For the mains, the ribeye, the duck ravioli, the tagliatelle, and gnocchi.  The gnocchi was gross - very mushy, all else was decent.  Nothing was outstanding.  The dessert was the best part - had one of all and it was delicious.So for this caliber of a restaurant (and equivalent price tag), we were disappointed. Don't know whether they were having an off-day, but we did not enjoy our dinner.","Said they already closed. It was 15 minutes before they closed. Not helpful in finding another place that was open.. they said ""there was a much of places open"" vague and disappointing","I gave Convivium Osteria 1 star last time for rushing me and my girlfriend on Valentine's Day. And while it was still disappointing, the manager was kind enough to invite us back for a full free meal, and he even gave us a free bottle of wine. So the 4 stars are for their hospitality, except for the grumpy waiter, which is weird because our waitress last time was exceptionally nice.So i'd actually say that it's more of a review of the manager's hospitality. The food was good, not great, but good. The baby octopus was highly disappointing, though. It just doesn't make sense to serve a charred, over cooked, poorly sliced baby octopus COLD ceviche-style. Just very disappointing. In the end of the day though, it was good enough.","Every dish we had here was nearly perfect. Oozing deliciousness. The food was not-quite-familiar, seemingly influenced by many countries around the mediterranean, maybe with Italy dominating. It all felt like nostalgic home cooking--but from an alternate reality in which you grew up in Italy, Spain, and Portugal, and your mom was a brilliant chef. It's also just about the nicest space I've seen for a Brooklyn storefront restaurant. The dining area downstairs is especially inviting, with glowing light, a cool breeze, and the comfort of being surrounded by floor-to-ceiling wine on all sides.","What a beautiful and cozy place. It's feels like you are truly back in Italy. Everything is amazing, every single salad on the menu is amazing, every appetizer is amazing, every hot dish is amazing. You don't have to think too long, just take one of each and you will absolutely enjoy every bite of it. And when you will come again order other dishes and you enjoy even more then first time. No wonder this place was featured in New York magazine as one of the most popular places in Park Slope for past two decades.PS You must try their Braised artichokes and Octopus salad, but ask for less onion...lol","This is a ""mom and pop"" Italian restaurant with extensive wine selections. It had rustic charm, beautiful that lovely. Such a warm, romantic space for a perfect date! It is a rather small space, but they do have another room downstairs, which can be used for a private event. We had a few appetizers to share; Burrata con Pomodoro e Basilico, and Ravioli di Mele. Burrata dish was fresh and tasty, refreshing on a hot, steamy day. Ravioli had a nice sweetness to it, packed with flavor!We also had their infamous Carciofo alla Romana, which is a Braised Artichoke. It was unique and impressive. The heart was almost creamy, melt in your mouth. They had a few special of the day, and one of them was lasagna. We didn't order it, but we got a small sample, and it was soooooo good!  For main, I chose Spigola al Forno, a 'Whole' Mediterranean Sea Bass It came out beautiful! One of the owners, Michelle, filleted it for me right there. The first bite of the fish gave me such joy...it was absolutely delicious! We enjoyed this dish very much! My hubby went with Agnello in Crosta di Pistacchio, a Sicilian Pistachio Crusted Roasted Rack of Lamb. It had a great crunchy exterior with plump and juicy inside. Packed with flavor, tender and very satisfying. We ended with Tiramisù and Torta di Cioccolato. It was one of the best Tiramisù and flourless chocolate cake I've ever had! We had an amazing dinner here, I am so happy to have discovered this restaurant! Everything we had was superb, we enjoyed them all from the first bite to the last. Our main server, Valentine, took a great care of us. If you want to have some authentic, delicious food with family and friends, or have a very romantic date, this might be the perfect spot for you!",Convivium Osteria
606,"A cozy Italian restaurant that my friend wanted to visit for their wine selection. Seating is a bit uncomfortable, they pack their small space with too many tables so you're basically elbow-to-elbow with the other patrons on both sides of you. You can't even have conversation without everyone being able to hear every word. We weren't super hungry, so we split the calamari and octopus appetizers - both of which were prepared very well with quality seafood. Would be open to coming back at a different hour to try their traditional pasta dishes next time I'm in the area.","Pasta Pasta Pasta my absolute favorite! We ordered -- Tagliolini al Salmone e Piselli; Long thin cut pasta with smoked salmon & sweet peas in cream sauce. Tagliatelle al Ragu; Long thin cut pasta w/ traditional Bolognese style ragu.Both were very delicious but the salmon pasta was to die for.  The sauce was spectacular, warm, creamy and smooth.  I'd get this same dish everytime.","Service was fine, but food was pretty bad as way overpriced for what you get. Shame usually I'm not picky but really wanted to like it. Feel like I owe it people to let them know.","Il Passatore is a small, cozy Italian restaurant turning out traditional pastas and other dishes.We stumbled across this place somewhat after being turned away somewhere and needing to stay in the area for a party. We were lucky to get a seat around 8 on a Saturday, as diners after us faced a wait.Free, average bread was accompanied by above-average olive oil and balsamic. Scallops ($12) were simple and had a good sear. Our pastas were both solid but the cavatelli ($19) with mushrooms and thick gobs of goat cheese was the clear winner.Prices feel high, with pastas approaching $20, but maybe this nondescript stretch of East Williamsburg has been more upscaled than I thought. There are some good values for wine.Service is good. Atmosphere is homey and not particularly stylish, but the tin ceiling, exposed brick, and low lighting make this work for a casual date. I wouldn't be mad if this was my neighborhood Italian place. Nice choice if you're in the area.","After accompanying our friend to her tattoo appointment just down the block at Gristle, my friend and I were looking for somewhere to kill an hour or two and were drawn right into Il Passatore for brunch.Man, I really enjoyed the Cavolo e Zucca Hash (kale, diced butternut squash, onions, and shaved Parmesan with accompanying eggs + roasted potatoes) and she loved the Norwegian Benedict. Both were full of flavor but not ~too~ heavy for a hot, almost-summer day.I don't really have any other reason to return to this part of Bushwick but would consider doing so just to try their dinner menu. I can imagine they do right by pasta. PS. Not sure why Google says cash only, they definitely accept cards.","A bit disappointed. I chose this place based off the rating and the photos. Turns out there are better other places that are way better. The service was great which is their saving grace, but the food left a lot to be desired.My friend and I came here craving hearty pasta dishes, so she ordered the Bolognese and I ordered the lamb Ragu. Both came with absolutely way too much sauce. So much so that we had to scrape most of it off and put it to the side in order to get to the noodles. There were also not very many noodles to fill up a plate so (there was about a cup of noodles - cooked - with about 2 to 3 cups worth of meat sauce). It was a shame to waste all of that meat sauce but there was so much we couldn't even eat it with bread but they kept giving us. The lamb Ragu had a lot of really big chunks of tasty and tender lamb which I would've eaten if it had come with more noodles.TL;DR: too much sauce to pasta ratio. So unsatisfying that we made plans to get pasta somewhere else the next day.",Il Passatore
607,"Ok, now I feel bad about all the times I've walked passed this place!Came here for lunch and Julie was my waitress (she's bomb AF). I was in the mood for pizza so I opted into the Shroom pizza. I never had pizza with an egg on it so I was up for the challenge. I was going to get the 6 inch and Julie suggested the 12"". So happy I listened!First of all... The pizza was FIRE and I'm not talking about temperature. Everything about it was what I expected in a great pizza. Cheese was settled in mounted over the crust, mushrooms were seasoned to the point I was getting rotisserie chicken vibes, and the egg was an added complimenting touch.Let me tell y'all something. Food is good when you think about it as much as you think about your lover. I say that to say, hey lover! ;-)P.S. - I didn't get to get any beer but I WILL be back so no worries.","Very spacey modern-looking brewery with plenty of choices that should satisfy even the pickiest beer critic. Try to sit at the bar, which has super comfortable seats. Beer flights (4 beers) go for $16 ave are well worth the price. We also got their flourless chocolate cake, but were turned off by its microscopic size: for $8 you'd expect something bigger than a dessert of the size of a small plum... it felt like a scam. Overall, go for the beer, but forget about the food.","Came here on a Tuesday night around 9:30. Sat at the bar for ten minutes while I watched the bartender work. No one greeted me. At one point, she made eye contact with me and kept working. She then left the bar to deliver some drinks and walked right past me and didn't say ""hello"" or ""I'll be right with you."" I'm normally a bit shy to go out by myself, but when I do, it's usually the chats with the bartenders that make it worthwhile. I've never felt more invisible. Very disappointed. I heard the pizza was good and I wanted to try it.","We came here for a brunch the next day after an awesome New York wedding in August. We started out with a mimosa and Bloody Mary. (Mimosa was refreshing and needed for the recovery. Haha).I didn't get the chance to take a photo of the brunch table for the list of options that they were able to provide to us.  We had different pizzas served to our table and a brunch table that had french toast (and toppings) and the classic sausage, bacon, and egg breakfast.  All was honestly delicious and very filling!  In addition to the meals, we got to do a quick brewery tour by Drew.  He made it interesting and showed us his knowledge and passion for brewing this deliciousness! haha.  We also got to try some the wheat (? I think that's what it was... it's hard to remember after 2 months have pasted).  Anyways, it was a pretty good snack haha.  I didn't have room to drink any full glasses but I had a few sips here and there from my husband who tried out some of their beers.  Very good!  Overall, positive experience, friendly staff, and great knowledge on brewing (thanks Drew!).  A spot to check out in Brooklyn!","Came here on a Friday evening.We got a table immediately. The decor at this restaurant was something new that I had not seen before. The style can be described as Urban. Pipes and beans scatter the roof and walls , while the tables are a made from nice solid wood- making the whole place pop.They have a huge selection of beers and ciders. The restaurant brews their own beers on the premise. I tried a rose cider which was perfect for a fall night. The cider was a mixture between grapes and a cider base. It was delicious! The pizza menu was also pretty extensive. I am vegetarian and I had plenty of options to order. I ordered the Marinara Pizza. The pizza was pretty big, came up to about 6 slices. The pizza was divine- hot and cheese. I would highly recommend this place for a great night out.","Fantastic Brewery in the heart of Brooklyn. It's also a pizzeria that serves lots of yummy food, so you can eat, drink, and be merry. I came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was fairly empty. There was no wait for a table and the servers were very attentive. I started off with an avocado toast (as pictured) that was yummy and filling. I also got some of the focaccia and jam. I'm not entirely convinced I was eating focaccia since the texture was a little different than what I was used to, but the jam was still very good.I wanted to a try a lot of different drinks, so I went with the tasting size of the Summer Ale which wasn't bad, but I didn't love it. I then tried the Nutty Professor and the Banana Pancakes Porter. The Porter was definitely my favorite drink that I tried. The flavor was great and it wasn't too hoppy. The Nutty professor wasn't anything super unique, so it didn't stand out that much to me. Definitely want to try out their pizza the next time I come here. It looked really tasty!",Circa Brewing
608,"Worst place to eat at.  I'm a party of 5 and was seated at a table for 4. I ask the manager if my family could sit in one of the booth's but she told me that she couldn't because she needed it for a party of six. I told her that my table was too small and that the chair that they put at the end where lots of people kept bumping into us. We ordered drinks but was told we couldn't have it because the blender was broken. The waitress was mediocre.  Breadsticks was hard, salad dry, wasn't even offered water.She to focus more on the table next to us but never bothered to check my table to see if we needed anything but expects to get an awesome tip for horrible service. I asked the manager when our food was coming but was told the kitchen is backed up. What  a uneventful night.","First and foremost this restaurant is disgusting, you should just order take out if possible. Tables are sticky, plates are not washed properly, place smells, bathroom are extremely dirty, pee splashed every where in the men's bathroom, waitress and waiters look unhappy, are not attentive, food is ok but just knowing how bad the service and the place is kept, your hunger goes away quickly. Keep away!!!",This is terrible. Undercooked soup looking throw up supposed to be an appetizer. Waitress explained the reason it doesn't look like an appetizer is because the menu image is modified. I cannot believe I thought I was actually getting a meal. This makes McDonalds look gourmet!,"My family and I stopped here after a long flight, and were dismayed to see the long line to be seated. We sat at the bar in an effort to eat sooner, but as luck would have it the bar was packed too, with the bartender rushing to make drinks while also serving seated customers. We needn't have worried! Jamieka (Mieka) was amazing. She took our orders on the fly, made sure our drinks were always full, and checked in with us regularly. I noticed she did the same with every other diner at the bar. I wouldn't hesitate to return to your restaurant knowing what great service your staff provide.","We decided to do lunch here spur of the moment. They have a really good deal which was just a really good cheesy vegetable quesadilla type thing I forgot what it was called, and all you can eat salad and breadsticks for like eight dollars. The salad was really fresh and they were able to put the dressing on the side.The service was excellent and if you are a carb addict like me, don't even let them put the breadsticks on the table.They are hard to resist!","My recent visit to Olive Garden has given me reason to improve the initial rating I'd given. The wait time for my last visit on a Monday evening was only 30 minutes, probably less in reality. Our waiter, Casey, was very nice and attentive. Our food came on time and in order. The food from this chain location seems to have improved in terms of quality. Their pasta was not overcooked and everything wasn't as greasy as it usually is. The interior remains the same, a deep clean for the carpet might be helpful as there's a musty smell. Perhaps it's just the booths?Anyway, I'm glad this location looks to be improving through quality management both front and back of house. I recommend stopping by!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
609,"Good coffee, good pastries (the Almond croissant was to die for). Not too many chairs to hang but that shouldn't deter you from visiting this gem!","I went here due to the raving 5 star review it has gotten and I am so disappointed! I ordered the jerk chicken sandwich and it was so freaking overly spicy and so salty! I thought I was eating straight up salt. The only thing that was good was the refreshing watermelon lemonade! I would never go back here. The staff was really nice and welcoming, but the food, this one in particular was terrible. I threw it out after 3 bites. What a waste of $10! Someone didn't know how to make jerk chicken right. I felt like my blood pressure just shot up from all the salt.","Every time I come here the service is exceptional. The owner/manager and the employees are very nice and always smiling. I came here with my mother to have breakfast after a very exhausting trip. I was feeling nauseous and tired. My mother had asked for a bowl of fruits along with her food (by mistake, as it wasn't in the menu) and even though it wasn't part of the menu, the lady managed to find some fruits and to serve them to us! Needless to say, we felt instantaneously better after eating here. It made our day.","This is a fun and friendly spot to have brunch with friends. They had a vast menu of delicious pastries. I had French toast platter made the right (French) way. Scrambled eggs and nice Turkey bacon. As a former server myself, I have to say that the service was excellent! The waiters and owner were so attentive with us, and the décor was so nice and clean as well. If you want to have a good time come and visit this place. I would highly recommend it!","Ken is the sweetest! Professional, kind, gave excellent suggestions. Patient and accommodating. She is the best. Cute coffee shop with excellent , yummy, fresh ingredients with lots of options!",This place is great fresh food. The panini bread is nice and soft and has flavors so it is not the typical panini bread. It's a little small inside but on a gorgeous day it has these really nice large benches to use. The coffee is nice and strong and I am glad I came and definitely recommend.,Bushwick Grind
610,"I don't care about the atmosphere and beer selection, if common courtesy is in short supply as is in this place, especially when you'd simply like to unwind after a long day. The bartender on Wednesday night (a lady) gave me an attitude when I asked about the types of drinks I could have with aperol and made me feel like an ignorant for now knowing them. Would it hurt to do her job and just mention a few mixes she could make with aperol instead? All the while, acting like she was doing me a favor to serve me a simple Aperol Spritz and taking my money. Too much to ask for simple manners and customer service? Icing on the cake is complaining for not getting any tip! Drop the attitude, do your job, and everyone will be happy.Avoid this place.","My friends and I used to love coming here in the summer because the patio was dog friendly. Today, however, the bouncer came over to our table after we already had beers and told us dogs were not allowed. When we said both of our dogs were service dogs, he insisted on seeing an ID card. This is fine, but we did not have a card on us for one of our dogs because we are literally NEVER questioned when we say we have a service dog. We offered to show the manager our doctor's note to prove the service was needed, but the bouncer refused to call the manager and instead, condescendingly asked us if we saw the ""no dog signs"". I get that it's not easy to enforce rules, but he did so in a rude manner and failed to try and accommodate our situation or resolve it another way. Not going back here.","This place is good for groups, it's huge and they have a ton of picnic tables and some board games. Rotating beer list and it's right next toMccarren Park. Not sure why .. but the bouncer here is always either really mean to me or hitting on me, either way, not pleased with that.","Beer is good, sausage is FKING good and good atmosphere. Some good looking bartenders is a plus Try the veal and rabbit sausage - its awesome. The topping with coleslaw and chilly cheese is freaking awesome. Good selection of beers and cocktails, worth the penny. Mid range of price. I think its affordable. We order 3 sausage, 1 fries, 1 beer total: $45.","Had a casual going away party here, and it was a great venue for my event. Reserving a table was easy and done quickly via email (I reserved for a Sunday afternoon, maybe it would be more difficult on a Saturday or in the evening). The place was spacious with good vibes and great beer variety. Enjoyed the fries and dipping sauces a lot (curry chili ketchup my favorite), and the sausages and pretzels were also pretty good. Only drawback was that there was a big birthday party for a 4 year old child (a little bit of a weird venue for a kid's birthday if you ask me). That wouldn't ordinarily bother me but the kids were running wild the whole time -- including crawling on our table, yelling quite a bit, and riding a bike around the venue (!?!). I blame the parents but the staff could have said something.Regardless, I look forward to coming back and hosting group parties here in the future! Hard to find this kind of space in NY.","Loved this place, the vibe is amazing our bartender was super extremely nice. We had the estrella jalisco along with a shot and ordered duck sausage with jalapeño slaw and it was fantastic . This place is the bomb .. if you are by williamsburg you need to comeBy this place",Spritzenhaus 33
611,"delicious food. love coming here. stop using door dash. quoted at 45-50 minutes for delivery turned into 90 because door dash is garbage and sends the driver in the opposite direction of where i live. i get it they have other deliveries besides mine, but why dd makes them go in the opposite direction? cant wait to get cold food! seriously. stop using door dash.","Looking at the pictures of this place, i'm sad that i couldn't truly enjoy the cute ambiance... unfortunately we came here on one of those sweltering hot days, and there's no A/C, or if there is, they choose to open the windows and doors and turn on some fans, meaning that you just feel NYC humidity as you eat hot italian food. Don't get me wrong, this place definitely looked cute, and probably would have been lovely on a day that was only 60-70 degrees out, but on this particular day, i couldn't catch a break from the 110 degree subway platform, the walk in williamsburg and then dining somewhere without air conditioning. The food and service were lackluster, the artichokes in the Carciofi fritti were very crunchy and hard to swallow and i didn't find anything special about my Orata alla griglia.","The outdoor seating area is SO cute! We sat out here for dinner, but unfortunately, it started raining and the staff did an exceptional job moving everyone inside quickly and getting us situated. However, the food was not that great. The gnocchi was very bland and the pizza was soggy (almost tasted like a frozen pizza). Disappointed since we were really looking forward to trying this place!","Beautiful restaurant.  Sat at the bar for on Saturday for dinner.  Bartender was skilled and fast and pleasant.  Long Bar, saw a few couples sitting there.  Had the salmon was cooked perfect along with the spinach and crunch potatoes .  Will be back!","Fantastically cozy Italian spot. I dipped in on a Wednesday evening around nine. Faint jazz music played to the dimly lit, heart-of-the-home atmosphere. A jovial manager introduced me to the bar where my server gladly recommended me a pairing to my lasagne. There's a quiet hospitality here that matched the interior, which swaddled a scattered mixture of intimidate conversations and soft spoken gatherings of friends. It was a romantic dinner for one. I'll be back.","If you're looking for some amazing pasta dishes, look no further! Came here for a romantic dinner, had the caprese salad then gnocchi with a gorgonzola sauce, yum. The sage butter ravioli and last but not least, esspresso poured over ice cream. Everything was phenomenal! Can't wait to go back!",Fiore
612,"A couple years ago, I would eat at this place at least twice a week and now I'll probably only eat here once a year. Something happened to this place it used to be really good and one of one only places you can get a really good salad around here. I always get a salad from here its usually a Greek salad and a split pea soup. The food is usually good but always inconsistent whether it be to much feta in the salad or liquid in the salad. One time I got a salad and it was covered in liquid from the tomato and cucumbers. If you add falafel it's so hard and crunchy you could seriously chip a tooth (you can ask for another type of falafel just write it in the comments and it's wayyy softer). Sometime you get pickles and tahini some times you don't. With the split pea soup, some time it's water sometimes it's not. Still good though. And the best part is if you call and speak to one of the employees they're always nasty. I work in the service industry and it just unacceptable. I'll never order from this place again. The food is trash.",Great food with good flavor in a nice little spot near Barclays and Park Slope. This isn't meant to be prissy (I'm still giving 4 stars) but I found a hair in my falafel :(,Top quality and flavor from this humble falafel shop. Keep ordering the Red Hot Chili sandwich. It's fire and only 7$ damn!,Amazing food amd amazing service too !!!The platters are great and affordable! And the employees - so kind and friendly! It was a very hot day out one of the times i went there and they gave me a water bottle on my way out. Always the friendliest staff !,"Pita is now served warm! Loving the falafel sampler. Note they are smaller than the falafel in the salad. Their hummus is my absolute favorite - thick, chunky pieces and creamy. I love the texture and flavor. Overall, great portion size for the cost.","Falafel platter - this platter comes with 9 Falafels, hummus, cole slaw, purple cabbage, a tomato salad, pickles, 2 olives, hot green sauce and tahini. The falafels were very crispy on the outside, warm and flavorful on the inside. The spicy one was my favorite since I didn't expect it to be that spicy. Iron hummus - spinach and roasted pecan hummus. The spinach was just warmed but the roasted pecans gave it the kick. Omg hummus - super oily peppers, onions, and mushrooms with hummus. I guess the oil added some texture to the hummus. The hummus was creamy as usual. I'm still searching for chunky hummus. We received 3 pita breads and they were cold! Who eats hummus with cold pita?! They need to warm these up!",Chick P
613,Food is decent but service is absolutely horrible!Tried to enjoy a birthday lunch and my order was ruined. Dont understand how waitress got and attitude with me when she messed up the order.Not to mention my fish came out last then 10 mins later my pasta came and wrong and to wait another 10 mins is insane!,"This place has all the red sauce Italian you want to eat. You know what I'm talking about. The chicken parm. The lasagna bolognese. The spaghetti and meatballs. The baked ziti. The shrimp fra diavolo. It's all here in gigantic portions, served by a sweetheart of a lady who is essentially your mom for the evening. If for some reason you prefer your sauce lighter, the penne alla vodka is here for you. I suppose you could even go for the linguini and clams if you're really racist, but stay away from me. I don't like bigots.",It's been in neighborhood for a long time. My daughter needed some last minute catering and they came through.  They have such variety.  Not very expensive. I miss the red rise we usually would bounce between the 2  places.,"I LOVE this place. The food is top notch for the type of restaurant it is, in which food entrees are in chafing dishes semi prepared behind the counter. Everything I've had here has been excellent. The atmosphere is also exceptional in that it has some booths and then a large grouping of long tables where wait persons bring the delectable dishes to diners who sometimes eat together jovially at the same long tables. I love especially the Sicilian dishes here such as the Sicilian eggplant which is unforgettable and which I have a very hard time trying NOT to order to expand my experience! The vegetables as side dishes all excellent. The wait staff is so friendly so helpful and so engaging that all in all it makes Vinny's my go-to italian place in Carroll gardens for informal dining.I must add here that I am Italian and of Neapolitan descent but I adore this Sicilian gem!!","Mmmmmmmmmmmmm......mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm........mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...........Oh oh.... sorry I was just scraping my plate of all this deliciousness. I have no word but it's the bleeping best. If your in town stop by at vinny's and feast. I love the penne vodka with breaded chicken cutlet and the feel of a nice homey environment were they know your name and just real homemade authentic Italian food. Ok, now go get, what are you waiting on? Go fast and enjoy so much greatness that you go back the next day and the next day, and the next day.... well you get the picture.",Amazing and enough food for a family of 10 .. wonderful service and I would go back there over and over ....  food is simply old world Italian S I remember growing up ... simply a great place ....,Vinny's of Carroll Gardens

The front are very professional and they dont really engage much, but the servers are full of spunk and you feel generally that they want you to have a great experience dining there. If you need anything, they are already jumping to get it for you. I have never felt any apprehension of the servers. Plus they crack jokes sometimes too, which I like the interaction. I ordered the crab legs that my colleague recommended.  Those crab legs were serious and generous in proportion.  You can request full seasoning or seasoning on the side, which seems to be a cup of sauce flavored with old bay seasoning. I say a couple of people dipping happily into the sauce. I Also had the baked potato and they put whatever condiments that you like. I asked for butter and bacon.  The bacon were not small bits...They were chopped bacon generously put inside the baked potato.  I also had broccoli as a side to balance a vegetable.  I had a great experience especially with our server; he was a young guy who just was awesome taking care of us.",Lindenwood Diner & Restaurant
615,So the 1 star goes for the flamingos we got to keep for the flamingo cocktail. The cocktail was good. The service at the bar was shit. Took over 10 mins to try to get someone's attention for an order. ( 3 of us all tried several times without success at times) it wasn't super crowded either. We ordered the 3 tomahawk burgers. Wanted 2 mediums and 1 medium rare and was told they don't do temperatures. Burger was mediocre. Burger King has better burgers in my opinion. The side of onion rings were the frozen mushy kind. Not sure what was going on with the ac situation but we sweated thru our entire stay. No ac on a heatwave day was absolutely horrible. Really didn't even want to leave a tip but did my part as a customer and left the 20% unfortunately. Won't be back.,"Chunky bartender girl stood around, chatted with the barbacks, stood around some more.... then came over after 10 minutes to take my drink order. Then after I ordered she took another breather and came back 5 minutes later with my CANNED beverage. I know it's tough to walk to the cooler and back so I'll give you one extra star.",There is a bartender with a nose ring on the is so rude. They should have someone that has a much nicer personality especially if serving people drinks.,"Great tasting food! I got a good deal today with $5 off of my order between the hours of 2pm-6pm via Grubhub (Score) I took advantage to try out some foods that caught my interest. Dry rub wings, pulled pork and a double burger. I must say, it was all very good. I was not very happy with my side sauces but that's a minor complaint. The wings were perfect sauceless, I got the sauce on the side and I'm glad I did. The pulled pork with pineapple bbq side sauce was also good. Again, I'm glad I got the meat plain with sauce on the side. The double burger consist of small thick patties, juicy and well seasoned. I couldn't help but to be happy that they have poochie patties for your doggies! I love that they offer this and that they're pet friendly. Highly recommend! I will be dining in here soon.","This establishment is super legit. You can always have a good time here, whether it's watching a drag show or playing TouchTunes.The outside seating is plentiful, and their events cannot be beat, AND they are super dog friendly! To drink I personally recommend The Zombie (duh) and whatever the large flaming drink is as well.This is definitely the perfect place to chill for any occasion.","So happy I finally made it to Dromedary! Chic space with creative cocktails and snacks. Perfect for a post concert drink. Who doesn't love a Tiki Bar that can achieve the right balance of fun and quality drinks?

616,I ordered the kale caesar with egg and a glass of house red during brunch on a Sunday. The egg was extremely overcooked - it was like eating cardboard. You can see from the picture. The red wine was served warm. The interior is very nice but did not make up for the terrible meal.,I just spent nearly an hour waiting for a table after being told the wait was 15 minutes. There were plenty of staffers working but multiple tables sat waiting for empty plates to get bussed. My friends and I left after realizing we weren't a consideration (much less a priority).,"I've been on two separate occasions and each for day and night service.  Generally the wait staff is ambivalent about the menu. The brunch menu is underwhelming. I ordered  a reuben, requesting the sauerkraut on the side, come to find out it's pre-made, so no-can-do there. I sat at the bar, but the pre-made sandwich  and fry still took 30 minutes (??) Okay, I believe in second chances, so returned again (last night), some weeks later after my first visit for club soda (for me) and drinks (for my friend). After ordering 1 wine and 2 club sodas, the bartender then served us 2 wines and 2 club sodas, and we had to correct them and we later had to correct the bill charge of 2 wines and 2 club sodas. It was after midnight and this bar was nearly empty, so not sure where their focus was.",Chicken wings are really meatyCocktails are goodThe surrounding atmosphere is good for conversationDrink prices are good,"I came here for dinner with a friend while visiting NYC over Labor Day weekend. I'll start with the good. The atmosphere is quite lively and the decor is beautiful---I especially loved all of the plants! The service was cordial, honest (the waitress was quick to unrecommend a cocktail I was considering), and brisk. My friend enjoyed his beer, and my Moscow mule was serviceable (and surprisingly strong).Unfortunately, the food was, for lack of softer words, flat out not good. You can't really mess up sweet potato fries in terms of taste, but the plate of fries consisted of maybe 40% actual fries vs. 60% mini fry scraps. I ordered a burger, which was salty to the point that I only ended up eating half. My friend ordered a sausage dish with a slimy consistency that made me thankful for only sampling a small bite (he was a trooper and grudgingly ate most it despite voicing his displeasure multiple times). In the end, we each paid around $45 for a thoroughly below average meal. The next time I'm in Brooklyn, I wouldn't mind paying Sisters a visit for a quick cocktail, but I would definitely eat my dinner elsewhere.","I've made many aborted attempts to come to Sisters for drinks either before or after getting dinner at Emily, down the block. It's always packed in here though, so it's never come to be... I did, however, manage to come here for brunch this Sunday. It was a beautiful, sunny afternoon and on a visual level, this place really shined due to their massive skylight and abundant foliage. After spending half an hour wandering down Washington Ave and trying to find a brunch spot with no wait (which I do not advise anyone undertake, hanger will start to set in immediately), we called Sisters and were told the wait was 30 minutes. Decided to suck it up and walked over, and I guess we got lucky, because the hostess then told us the wait was only 5 minutes! We were sat pretty quickly, next to a really annoying table with a small dog (which, isn't that technically illegal in New York...?). Terrible clientele aside, I had no complaints about Sisters. Service was fast, and our waitress was fine. I got an iced cold brew and the huevos rancheros, and my boyfriend had the savory french toast with pulled pork. Both dishes were pleasant, although nothing really to write home about. The huevos rancheros had a nice spicy kick and came with a giant arugla salad on the side, although I wish that it had included some potatoes or something... I was hungry about two hours later (the savory french toast, on the other hand, was massive). When we were leaving, there were a ton of people waiting on the sidewalk, which was interesting, since there were also quite a few open tables in the back. Doesn't seem like they turn tables very quickly here.",Sisters
617,My boyfriend & I just moved to South Williamsburg and were so excited to try Loosie's. It looked adorable & had good reviews. To say this place was a disappointment doesn't even do it justice. I have lived in NYC for the past four years and have never been to a restaurant where we couldn't finish our food - to the extent of only eating two bites of the fish.We ordered a bottle of wine that the server had us try. I clearly did not like it but when I asked oh is it supposed to taste salty? His response was yeah.. so looks like we were stuck with it. I even ordered a different glass of wine & the waiter did not once offer to get us something else. On to the steak tartar that somehow tasted fishy? The combination of ingredients was bizarre & I love funky food.The Brussels were fine.. but drenched in oil. Fried chicken was also so greasy and the meat was gross. Our last item definitely didn't win us over - the fish entree. We literally ate two bites and couldn't have more. (Also might I mention that when I asked the waiter what type of fish it was he said the name.. I said oh I'm not sure what that is and he didn't even attempt to explain it) The worst part is that the waiter must have noticed we didn't enjoy the wine or food.. Super disappointed that a place with so much potential was so poorly executed.,"You WILL walk out disappointed guarenteed. Only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because the chicken was quite lovely. Other than that, me and my friend split two side dishes, a main course, two cocktails, and a bottle of wine that were drastically overpriced and bland. The cridité were gross undercooked veggies with a side of blue cheese, the crostini was just one slice of bread cut up into small pieces with olive oil, and the ""risotto"" was just rice with some bland veggies and hardly any cheese. Beware of this place.","Nothing you can't make at home and I'm super unhappy I wasted my dining out budget on this spot. Music was the only plus. Cons: burnt food, greasy. Pros: music. I had a shrimp ""burger""  it's just a burnt chopped shrimp sandwich that only had flavor in the middle. Companied with a overly bitter cocktail (no mention of such bitterness was listed). Tasted the grilled cheese and I could just feel the freeze murdering me. The sandwich tasted good there was just no need for them to grease up all three slices (yes there is a misterios third slice in the middle with the cheese......). Overall ascetically a cute place to lounge about and listen to music with a cup of joe or tea, craving anything el ese I say keep it moving.","Definitely a lot of areas in this establishment for cute pictures. The entryway alone is a wonderful experience. My table was late but we were seated anyway. My mimosa was delicious as well as my chicken and waffles. The chicken was super flavorful and perfectly crispy on the outside. My waffle was a bit too hard however but the chicken definitely makes up for it. The duck confit was also delicious. I really liked my server today. I wish I caught your name but you were super sweet and funny. Overall a great experience, my friends and I had a nice time here.",Came here for lunch randomly in a Sunday. Such a great ambiance. Not a huge place but I think that's what I like the most about it. Great place for coffee or brunch and cute seating arrangements. I tried the Brussel sprout salad and it was very good! My sister enjoyed her breakfast brisket which seemed to taste really good from the two fries I tried. Will definitely return!,"Although this looked like more of a fun brunch spot, we wanted to check it out for dinner. I ordered the fried Brussel sprouts and crispy duck salad and I have to say A++. Our waitress was super cool as well! I don't remember her name, but she was very friendly. I definitely recommend the vibe, although not as upbeat as one would think and the food was outstanding. Oh and by the way, we also shared the fried chicken, unbelievable dish!",Loosie's Kitchen & Cafe
618,"I'm so disappointed I got the buffalo and jerk mac. It was so unflavored, I added salt and that didn't even help. This is not the kind of mac and cheese I would recommend to anyone. I wish I could get a refund","I would give 0 stars if I could.  Apparently when you order the duck with caramelized onions you get just pasta, cheese and raw onions with no duck. When you call, the terrible people who answer the phone have zero customer service skills. One should put a manger on the phone but instead they put an angry chef on who has no idea how to speak to another human let alone a paying customer. When the errors were brought to the chef's attention, he became ridiculously aggressive as opposed to actually correcting his mistakes.  Trashy place and trashy people and it appears to have no management.","I hate having to do this....5 stars, ugh I gave in. It's not a bs 5 star rating because I believe 4 stars as being excellent. I just ordered the vegan north mac and it didn't disappoint.  It went so fast I barely remembered to snap a photo. You guys really locked up this mac n cheese race. Thanks.","I'm a sucker for mac and cheese, so I luckily stumbled upon Mac Shack. It's a small little shop serving mac and cheese heaven. You can build your own bowl, or you can select from one of their premade selections. You can even get a baby sized mac and cheese, but it's just the classic with one topping.I got the IN THE BUFF. It really was a lot of food. The buffalo chicken was done nicely. The flavors were great, and I thought the chips instead of typical breadcrumbs added a great flavor and texture. If I lived in Philly I'd be frequenting a lot more often!","9/28/19 I've been vegan for 6 years and so when a coworker first introduced me to Mac Shack in Bklyn (Fulton) I was excited. Now Im not saying that Im an expert on what vegan Mac should taste like..But I do feel a little knowledgeable on how veggies are suppose to taste...I was excited about the vegan options here & I have tried the Jerk Mack and the Classic Mac, they were really delicious. But I will definitely pass on the Bridge Mac & vegan veggie Mac which is what was my review is based only on. I wish someone would've gave me the heads up on this one as well...when you advertise veggies, please specify, ok my bad I should've asked...but I'm thinking some broccoli, maybe even some kale, spinach, corn or asparagus...Tomatoes, not tomatoes!!! Let's leave the hot tomatoes for pizza and Italian dishes where it makes sense. My taste buds were like WTF!!!! ‍ Tomatoes are acidic, the whole flavor of the mac n cheese was off, tomatoes are a (no, no), the mushrooms needed seasoning they were bland along with the shredded carrots... So here's the plus side,  is they do not skimp on the cheese, the gluten free options and the peas...I literally had to add garlic on the whole meal to make taste better. I'm annoyed I paid $15 for a small order of food that didn't taste good...I love mushrooms, but everyone knows mushrooms must be seasoned. If didn't know, now u do...My suggestions is drop the soup mix veggies and instead of making the beyond meat or vegan bacon as a add-on, just add it to menu. It will definitely would be a plus.. Fortunately for me I will order again, but as you can read above I will steer clear of those 2 Vegan Macs above.. 2 left to try Vegan Pesto Mac & Curry Mac.... I also ordered for my mom the salmon and Mac in which she truly enjoyed. So don't get me wrong the other food options are good..it's the just the vegan items that need work....1 star because I didn't enjoy my food, and 2 Stars from my mom who did..",Came in Friday for lunch. It was four of us and we had a rough morning. We needy comfort food. Placed our orders it didn't take too long. Mac and cheese was pretty good. Hot and nice crust on top. I had the baked wings (4) and it made the rest of the day at work better. Yummy!,Mac Shack
619,"$40 sushi omakase for 10 pieces. Best bang for the buck in Brooklyn. Every single piece was delicious. (The uni was my least favorite, I'm not sure if its because I personally don't care for uni or the uni was not fresh enough.) I loved how we can get the set to go. I know it's not the full on omakase experience, but it was nonetheless a big win for me.   Overall, I would definitely come back if I'm in the neighborhood or if I'm craving fancy ass sushi, but too cheap to splurge for a non-special occasion. I would not recommend the Ki Roll though. For $20, it taste like they put all the leftovers onto one roll. I rather get two toro scallion rolls. Not that the Ki roll wasn't good, I just don't think it's worth the money. It seems offensive to put all that in one roll. That's all. Definitely get the sushi omakase. Night.","I have very mixed feelings about this spot. I met a friend in Brooklyn for lunch​ and she, being more local than I am, suggest Ki. The service was great, our server was very attentive. The restaurant did have a bit of a fishy smell, which is typically not a good sign.We shared an omakase, with some shishito peppers and jalapeno yellowtail​ sashimi. Overall it was very good, but after eating at Sasabune Express in my hood, I can't rate it the same. Don't get me wrong, this is very good sushi, for Brooklyn.","Hadn't stopped in here for about a year; I had really raved about it then & recommended it to others in the neighborhood. Wow. Sorry friends, I have to take it back. Fish seemed to be not that fresh (certainly not ""melt on the tongue"" and ""wow, I have to sit & experience that piece for a bit"" like the last time I was there), service was so-so, and portions noticeably smaller than the last time I was here. And I was served a bowl of rice with a sashimi dinner?? WTF is that? That's a first. I'll be going elsewhere next time.I would assume my review is very much in the minority; the chefs at the bar spent most of their time cranking out order after order after order of delivery sushi (and no interaction with guests at the bar). I guess the quality is fine for take-out. But it's no longer the gem it was when it first opened.","Sat at the sushi bar and ordered the $55 omakase sashimi option. I am pretty new to the raw seafood game but I thought it was fresh and tasty. The oyster with truffle was a great touch. We also ordered the gyoza which was flavorful, with a great amount of filing and the wrapper was a perfect amount of crispy. They gave us complimentary edamame and shrimp shumai too (also good).The service was fantastic. The host, waiters and even the sushi chefs were attentive and engaging with us during our entire dinner. Great selection of sake too. One friend does not eat seafood and they had a good variety of options for her as well. The place was very clean and had a nice ambiance. I definitely recommend!","Came here on Saturday night around 6:20pm but the wait was really short! It's not our first time here so we decided to order something this time.We got the grilled miso salmon entree with salad, eel don with miso soup and plum wine. It was pretty good! The grilled salmon is really soft, delicious and fresh. The eel don tastes good too! And the portions were pretty big.","Been here for lunch and dinnerSushi is meh. Not that fresh. Service is good. Good value for the omakase but you really dont get the whole experience even when you sit at the sushi bar. We sat at the sushi bar and they served us half of the omakase set at a time. Omakase was ordinary.Yellowtail sashimi appetizer - good thick 6 slices, enjoyed it.Bottom line: not for omakase, ok for casual eating as pricing is decent",Ki Sushi
620,"Truthfully did not enjoy the food that much. Our family was also traveling on a budget and this restaurant will chase you and say you HAVE to leave tip in which we handed over our only money left that we were using as train fare and ended up walking a long way back to where we were staying. Inconsiderate, very uncomfortable situation just for some pizza.... The pizza was not that great and the prices were pretty high for just an average tasting pizza that had nothing special about it. Even the appetizer was not that amazing. But what type of employee chasing you for a tip? Not cool at all. Worst customer service i have ever experienced in my life. DO NOT GO HERE!! For your information i made the account with my location as New Jersey because this is where i stayed when i have visited from Guatemala! So think before you speak next time. I can't wait til people read your ignorant response coming at a customer and stop lying because we were stopped at the front being harassed to leave a tip and left the only money we had left for transportation.","I had the chickpea fritters and pizza -- Il Carciofino (vegan). It was tasty but not outstanding. The pizza crust was my favorite part. The potatoes on the pizza were cut so thin you didn't really taste them. The vegan ""cheese sauce"" was very creamy but not super flavorful. I'm not a huge eater and I ate the full pizza and wasn't full. Since it was pretty pricey, I probably won't go back but I enjoyed everything I had.","I usually don't leave bad reviews since I own a restaurant and hate getting bad reviews. Sometimes things can be unavoidable but this place has me upset right now. I drove here with my pregnant girlfriend and they're out of pizza. A pizza place with no pizza dough like really? Took us ten mins to find this out also which is annoying. That should be announced when you walk in. We were left with the menu and weren't told until we were placing our order. There's also one waitress/bartender working the entire place. Probably why all the vacant tables are left dirty until people choose to sit there.... To top it all off we ordered an appetizer and my Gf ordered Spaghetti. When we finished the appetizer the waitress bought the check over, completely forgot the Spaghetti order and never put it in. Unbelievable!!!","I've been meaning to check out Adelina's with my coworker for the past few months. Finally we planned a date and made reservations in advance. We commuted from Manhattan after work one rainy evening; and were alerted by the restaurant that there was no vegan cheese that evening (as there was a problem with their supplier). We decided to stay and try other vegan dishes that didn't require cheese. We were fortunate to find out that, since we were the first party to arrive for dinner, that there was probably enough cheese for one vegan cheese pie if we did want to try a vegan pizza. We jumped on that opportunity; and also ordered the Spaghetti alla Chitarra. We stuck to two dishes as the staff was generous enough to offer starters on the house for the inconvenience. That was not necessary but did demonstrate management's commitment to customer service and making our experience a pleasant one. We tried the Focaccia; the Tuscan beans; and the chickpea flour fritters. We agreed on the Tuscan beans as the clear favorite. I'm on the fence with the chickpea flour fritters because I think my only problem with that dish is the accompanying lemon & aioli sauce, which I didn't think was potent enough to bring out any flavor. The moist focaccia tasted great if you, like I did, ask for olive oil on the side for dipping. The pizza we ordered came out right after the starters. While the pizza was tasty, it was evident that cheese was scarce. Thankfully condiments are available to season as you desire. The spaghetti by default did not require cheese and came with with orange infused tomato sauce and capers which made it an extremely tasty dish and impressed us most. For dessert we had fried zeppoles with a vegan Nutella-like spread. The spread tasted more like chocolate (couldn't taste the hazelnut) but it still hit the spot. Service was excellent; couldn't be more grateful with the attention and generosity we received. Looking forward to going back and trying the other dishes.",Amazing food. And everyone's awesome! The only complaint was that we ate too much...Never write reviews. This is a great place even if you aren't vegetarian. And they serve delicious wine on tap.,"I have been to Adelina's a few times in the past and came back tonight a little sad. They don't have our favorite Tuscan beans anymore, the pizza has changed quite a bit and tasted very typical to any other pizzeria and not special, and the gnocchi seems to have changed quite a bit. They used to feel like very soft pillows and straight from grandmas kitchen. We ordered tonight and I couldn't even take another bite as it was over cooked and a very strange texture... definitely not worth $22 :/ I would love to see the changes go back to how they previously did things.. still love that there are vegan options though!",Adelina's
621,Nasty. The chicken doesn't taste like real chicken especially the chicken skewers. The drinks are good though. The pad Thai wasnt good either. Also the ambiance is at least nice,"No a/c in this wannabe restaurant. The popsicle sangria advertises popsicles, but surprise, this $52 pitcher offers a mediocre sangria with no popsicles. I hope the food surpasses the drinks.",not the best pad thai I have had. It had a funny taste to it. It was also vegetarian and had a plethora of different stuff. Half of the veggies I have never seen which was interesting. Delivery was also about 45 min late. Not the biggest fan of that since we gave them ample time to deliver. Not a great experience and hoping for better next time.,"We went for lunch on a Sunday in March. Best decision ever. This small Thai place is hard to miss, but a definite place to stop by. It was empty when we came, but filled up pretty quickly after that.We ordered the Potato Fries and Thai dumplings to start. Oh my. Those Potato Fries were kissed by the angels themselves. Perfectly crispy outside and soft inside, perfectly seasoned, and perfect sauce. You should definitely try the dumplings if you want to taste a perfect flavor combination. Granted, our apps took a while to come to our eager table, but the wait was very very worth it. Then, we ordered noodles and salmon. The noodles were the Asian version of al dente. Not mushy nor hard, these noodles were the perfect consistency. They held their sauce so graciously, it was truly like a ballet in my mouth: the noodles, the vegetables, and the spices creating the most beautiful piece of art. The salmon was perfectly cooked, crispy and seared but soft at the same time. The balance of flavors between the salmon and the vegetables was unmatched, but could have used a bit of freshness from some mint or lemon. Overall, this is a FANTASTIC place to eat Thai cuisine. You won't regret it. Believe me when I say that if I could eat here every day, I would.","I came here awhile ago and had the kindest and sweetest/loveliest person ever! Her name was Csai/Tsai. Excellent service! Such a beautiful person!Food was on point! everything was delicious. I had the spicy chicken wings and Bul Go Gi. Everything was flavorful! the chicken wings were perfectly crispy on the outside, just like they should be. I have been to some chicken joints(looking at you wings over Albany) their chicken looked RAW and dunked into sauce. It feels like youre chewing on raw chciken meat! the outside is white because its soo raw. If you wipe the sauce off the chicken, you can see the white raw chicken meat with its pockmarks!! yuckthis place knows how to make good chicken! they can sell their spicy chicken as an entree its so good!The place was neat and clean! the ambiance is comforting and serene.I would definetly recommend this place to anyone!","I came here because of their famous Thai iced tea and how you can construct the whole thing  yourself !! It's such a great idea that I'm surprised other places haven't caught up with it yet. The drink was delicious ! But I kind of got annoyed when the ice wasn't melting ! I wanted more ice tea hah We ordered the calamari basket, the spicy basil lo mein and the pad Thai. The calamari was pretty good nice and tender and crispy. But it was completely not seasoned! The only thing that added flavor was the overly sweet sauce on the side. At least add some salt and pepper guys ! The spicy nail lo mein was pretty good. Nice and flavorful, the spice creeps up on you the more you eat. And the pad Thai was mediocre. I felt my pad Thai was TOO sour. We think they added a little too much lime but it was overly sour and I had to continuously look for something to drink after each bite. Inside the establishment was clean and pretty simple in their design. Hints of Thai culture was scattered around and it was super nice sitting near the windows because of the amazing lighting.",Pinto Restaurant
622,"I went there before w my cousin,we found lemon pepper was a bit salty,doesn't effect the taste much tho,the crab actually want that fresh....",YUCK!! I wasn't hungry anymore after my crabcakes arrived. This was definitely my WORST crab cake experience EVER!! This cra..p is not suitable for human consumption!!Shrimps and lobster were overcooked and the check was similar to a good seafood restaurant. Never again!,"I got food poisoning from this place, holding back vomit as I type this review. I can't go to work I'm so sick, I'm missing out on money because I was poisoned here. Wondering if the wall of customers is actually a wall of dead people after eating here. Food poisoning is serious when dealing with seafood and I'm upset you all didn't take better care. I have never been so sick in my life","So I strolled into this place with my two hard to please family members, my four year old son who's partial to chicken nuggets and my elderly grandmother who almost always prefers home cooking and consistently complains at every restaurant we go to. BOTH WERE VERY PLEASED WITH THEIR MEALS.My grandmother had the fried fish with sweet potato fries. I tasted both. The fish was fresh and lightly seasoned and the sweet potatoes were sliced and flavorful. Neither was oily. No complaints from the Queen complainer. Price was awesome for these.My son had the fried shrimp and French fries. I didn't see any type of chicken nugget in the menu although there are wings. HE LOVED THE SHRIMP and the fries were pretty great. He sat happily eating these.I had the snow crab legs in garlic Parmesan and Old Bay seasoning. I've had this exact item from a popular restaurant closer to Barclays that I won't give you the name of because these are FAR BETTER. The flavor of the legs themselves was perfect which speaks to the quality of their items. I also had a side of gumbo. While this is not the New Orleans style Gumbo I expected it was still very good and the four year old actually enjoyed some of this too.The waiter was super nice and the place was quiet and clean when we were there. Will definitely be back soon!","I love this place. First boil spot in New York City, respect! The price is better than The Boil or any of those places in the city, and the seafood holds up in my opinion.The Blue Point and Japanese oysters are plump, fresh, and shucked well. A few drops of cocktail sauce and lemon juice are the only accompaniments I need.I always get a pound of crawfish and a pound of clams with the Whole Sha-Bang sauce (like garlic butter with a bit of sweetness), medium spice level. The juicy clams are like little soup bowls of flavor. I love eating them and then slurping up that mix of spicy, garlicky sauce and clam juice. The Whole Sha-Bang comes with corn and sliced sausage, all really tasty. You can add potatoes for $1.The stone crab is also good, full of sweet and tender crab meat, as are the snow crab and king crab legs. Don't ask for these pieces to be cut open, because whenever they split open the shell, the sauce ends up soaking through everything and overpowering the natural crab flavor.Boat Haus is always empty whenever I visit (although they get a lot of takeout orders), so I really hope it's not on its last legs. I need this low-key, conveniently located boil restaurant to stick around in my life.","Cute small seafood place. The service is good as well. I got the crab legs with the garlic butter sauce and it was really good and filling! The only thing is that they said it came with corn but there was only one very small piece of corn mixed in with the legs so if you want a side with it, order separately.",Boat Haus
623,YUMMM... the Fiocci de Parra!! How can you go wrong w/ cheese stuffed pasta in gorgonzola sauce! This place does great catering.,"I ordered delivery and while I appreciated the prompt service, I was disappointed in the thoroughly burnt pizza that I received. I have ordered from Graziella's in the past and have always enjoyed good service and great pizza, and I will continue to order from them, but this is disappointing.","I ordered delivery last night and my pizzas arrived cold. They also forgot the goat cheese in the goat cheese and beet salad i ordered. They were kind enough to re deliver promptly, and promised a desert for the inconvenience, which they then DID NOT end up including LOL. To top it off the the food was very underwhelming and disappointing. The cheese was soooo sparse on the margarita pizza and the salmon on my salad had a very strange and suspect taste.","Sometimes for work I have to order 20-30 pizzas for pick up so it is safe to say I am a trusted authority on the topic of pizza. This my friends, provides not only high quality food but also service. We ordered 20 pizzas and kind of needed them in a rush. Tall order, am I right? Anyway, Graziella's rose to the occasion and shattered expectations by making all of them in 30-40 minutes. These are high quality wood fire pies people! To make that many that fast and have them tasting better than any other slice in Brooklyn is nothing short of incredible. We also had some gluten free pizza as well which is not really my thing but now you can bring your gluten free tinder date here. To top it all off, the owner Vito greeted me and thanked me for the business. He even threw in a few cannolis as a thank you. It could not have been a more welcoming environment. The food was fantastic, the service was great and the pizza even tasted good the next day. That's right, I brought some home. Next time I'm in the area I will 100000% be going back. If you don't at least give this place a try you're blowing it","Came here for an impromptu dinner with two people. Highlights of the meal: We sat upstairs on the roof, the octopus appetizer was cooked perfectly and the cucumber spritz was very refreshing. The rest of the food was just okay. We ordered the  pasta special - the duck ragu, shrimp parmagiana and the orecchiette with broccoli rabe and sausage.  All three dishes were lacking in flavor and they took a long time to come out. Overall, the service was pretty slow.Skip having a meal here. I would only suggest sitting upstairs when the weather is nice and drinking a spritz.","Amazing, Graziella's is the closest you'll get to a place that has amazing pasta dishes, calamari & pizza.- Must try the Calamari, Rigatoni pasta, Raspberry Cheesecake (small, expensive but taste so good) & Meat pizza - Restaurant areas small from the outside but has seating for ~60 people with seating upstairs & downstairs - Tends to get crowded on weekends, late night or holidays - Staff is friendly & food is ALWAYS consistent - I usually order take out to avoid waiting for a reservation & the food is as good as when sit in Not that many good if any Italian restaurants in this neighborhood but if your looking for one. COME HERE, you will not regret it",Graziella's
624,Just had delivery from Gen. Totally underwhelmed. For $45 we got 2 avocado rolls and 8 pieces of Sushi. Sushi Deluxe is not so deluxe. Sushi was good (hence the 2nd star) but portion size and price are ridiculous.,"Seriously guys. Don't come here and I'll tell you why. It was accidentally my second time here. After the first time, years ago, we swore off the place but we stumbled into it again. We sat in the back for a party of 6 for my birthday. The floors were dirty. The kitchen staff kept walking in and out of the dirty curtains that separated the kitchen from the dining area. The waiter wasn't attentive to our needs and was no help at all when we asked for his opinions on things. The appetizers such as seaweed salad was under seasoned. It was basically seaweed on a plate. The Pork belly was even worse. Take a glob of fat, put some soysauce on it the put it on a piece of lettuce in a bowl. Almost vomit inducing. The sushi. It's what we came for right? The rice as still hot (weird, for sushi) and the avocados were already brown. What is that? Also, we've all had Japanese udon soup before right. We all had those weird cute pink and white swirly fish slices before right? Mostly it's made with seafood and usually an egg. This place. This place had almost zero ingredients in it. It had a tempura and pieces of dark meat chicken in there. Super. Gross. Will never go back. Trust me. My experience at a sushi restaurant has never been so repulsive.",Overprice sushi with mediocre quality.  Not very fresh.  Did not come to take our order until we flagged them down. Perhaps because we were a larger crew. Seem to cater better for smaller groups. 2 dollar for each cup of green tea when other restaurants serve them as part of meal.   Will not come back.,"Came here with friends! It's like a whole in a wall sort of place but there's also more seating in the back. When the day turned darker they turned down the lights and made it into a great romantic space. I really enjoyed everything here! We had sushi, udon, and soba noodles. Their seaweed salad is different from most Japanese sushi places I've been to but it had a tasty dressing (miso). The broth for both noodles were delicious! Their dragon sushi roll is my favorite especially if you like eel and avocado. Bringing friends back for more tasty adventures in the future. They appreciate cash but do accept credit!","We asked for a roll without avocado because we are allergic, but they missed that. No damage was done because we just removed the avocado and ate the rest. My wife and I are not fussy like that ;) I'm considering it an aberration caused by us being the first in the door on the day. They made one big mistake, but otherwise it was a good experience. What would have been a 4 is now a 3 star. The service was quick and easy. The outdoor space was particularly good, the wood slats (I think) keep it a few degrees cooler than outside which is a blessing on hot days. The presentation of the food was good. It is a good stop over point for brunch, on our way to the park.","I was brought here by a friend and I had the most amazing experience! We both had the sake and unfiltered sake combination. I drank the unfiltered sake and it was really good. We shared the edamame and the shrimp/vegetables tempura which were good, but the Kakuni ( Braised Pork ) was so delicious! It melts in your mouth. A true delicacy! Afterwards, we shared a plate of sushi, which included my favorites: Salmon, Tuna and Eel sushi among others. I had never tried Uni before and I was transported to the ocean while eating it, so good! lol. The Ikura was excellent, it's like eating liquid salmon, so tasty! I will definitely be coming back for more! :)",Gen
625,"Updated review: We recently went again to try the bacon chicken which we did not like. HOWEVER, we did like the buffalo chicken even tho it was really spicy and of course the regular Sicilian. We also tried the Hawaiian but did not like it too much. So the Sicilian wins!!Good location/ Fair Prices","I went here for a quick lunch slice on a Tuesday. It is indoor/outdoor counter service (all slices to go!) I got two white slices and my partner got a buffalo chicken slice, literally no complaints! Everything was great, quick and they do take card now. I will say the slices cooled down quick! I wish I ate mine right away instead of waiting until I walked the three blocks home. Overall, this may be my new go to pizza spot by work!","Not good sauce, and when that's the base it's hard to make up for no flavor there. Not buying again but not inedible.",So gooooodd I should of taken a picture. The texture of the Sicilian and the sauce on it was delicious. The crust- just right. Life is good in my tummy now  Just realized they don't have an emoji for Sicilian! I'm sure anything you get will be great. I truly want to come back tomorrow and live in the neighborhood just to come more..Not to forget to mention the staff.. Really nice people!,"So I know that my Barbie needs meBut finding good pizza ain't easySo I went to New YorkWith a knife and a forkAnd got a sexy slice from Luigi!I stopped at Luigi's Pizza and it was my only stop in Clinton Hill, but it was worth it AF.The girl serving here is really nice! Their excellent Margarita is crispy and delicious and exactly what you want from a Margarita pizza. Unlike my mother, who was exactly what I didn't want from a Margaret.However - It didn't stand up to the test of time and wasn't so good the next day but I still absolutely loved it in real time, when it was fresh and hot like my porn gf, so it gets 5. Kudos and congrats and recs for Real New York Pizza. And they love kids here I can tell. Babies were screaming in the doorway and they actually thought it was great. Good on them.",Good crispy thin crusted pizza. Courteous quick service. Fresh ingredients.  Quick service. Great for a quick bite. Stand if you want to dine in.,Luigi's Pizzeria
626,Just went in to get a cup of coffee and some pastries.  The tall skinny guy gave me such a bad attitude. He should not be in any sort of customer service job.  Never again. What an a-hole.,"L'imprimerie (which in french means fax machine), is a great place to stop for an amazing pastry. The coffee is a bit on the acidic side for me, but I know that style is all the rage these days. Don't miss the back yard!","I love here but they need to differentiate their chocolate croissant, ham and cheese croissant, jalapeno croissant look. I bought chocolate croissant because I wanted to eat it with coffee after my breakfast, I bite into it only to find out that its Ham and Cheese croissant. WHAT A BUMMER. this is the 3rd time they gave me a wrong croissant. Last time was the opposite. I order ham and cheese and turned out it was Jalapeno Chocolate and other time was also ham and cheese when i wanted chocolate croissant.It happened one too many times already. Please fix!!!",I love this place!The staff are always friendly and the food and coffee are always great. The chocolate and beets croissant that I had the first time I went in was one of the best things ever. I recommend trying everything!,"Awesome bakery in Bushwick!! It was actually my first time visiting the neighborhood and I had hit gold. I liked that L'imprimerie has variety of both pastries and rustic bread. I wish there are more non-sourdough bread though, because I don't enjoy sourdough that much.L'imprimerie is located under the train tracks but somehow it managed to keep out the sound of subway running. It has no AC but the breeze from the fan and iced coffee is enough to keep cool. Seating area is so comfortable that I stayed for nearly an hour with a book in my hand. I understand so much work was put into the bread but I still thought the bread was on the expensive side - I bought three pastries and iced coffee for $20 here while I was able to make the same purchase for $15 in LIC. With that in mind, I doubt I'll make another huge trek to Bushwick anytime soon. It would be great if any vendors closer to Manhattan sells any bread from L'imprimerie.","Stellar little bakery with an amazing patio in the back. I got a Ham&Cheese croissant, Salmon Avocado tartine (toast) and a drip coffee. I went for the seeded bread for my toast - absolutely delicious and freshly baked. Pro tip: they've got way more bread options baked exclusively on weekends. The view could be better (all you see is White Castle and busy Myrtle Ave out the windows) but hey, can't complain when the bread is that good",L'imprimerie
627,"I have an hour lunch, so My co worker and I chose to order through the Slice app, to get here wait for my order. To leave and notice he only gave us one calzone when we ordered two. Had to turn back around to be told he only made one....a whole hour wasted!!Edited review: for the owner Faried to have said he recognized me is hysterical because today was the first of two times having come in to this establishment once to say I was there to pick my order and the second to say that they didn't fulfill my order completely. Let alone to not even acknowledge that I didn't say the food was bad because it wasn't, but this feedback would probably atop me from returning. Oooo I should say the woman at the counter was so apologetic she gave me a free soda for their error but thanks to the owners review I'll leave my stars as is.","Not sure what the hype is. I decided to order the pepperoni pie due to the reviews. While ""good"" it's hardly a standout and I won't be going out of my way to buy it again.","Delivered hot, crispy and cheesy. Got the pepperoni pie. Classic NY slice. Chewy and not overwhelming with cheese and sauce. Was still hot and crispy when it arrived. Highly recommend.","On my fourth visit to Homeslice the 5 star rating dawned upon me. Before it was hitting at a 4 consistently. But that last visit I ordered a pepperoni slice... and the lady behind the counter said ""we don't have any pepperoni pies""I was confused. And about to get upset. So I asked ""when will you have one?""... the pizzas man from the back yells 6-7mins. I said ""ok""I got my slice (it's not cheap), added my seasonings, sat and began the grub. It was soooo good! Lol. But I already knew that. What I didn't realize is why. They make sure they make the pie they are selling, so it's fresh and cooked well. Instead of taking a plain slice and throwing pepperoni on it and heating it up. If they did that the cheese, sauce and pepperoni wouldn't marry properly... and I'd assume the pepperoni cups would curl they way they shouldThat's what the pros do and the pros deserve a 5 star rating. My other visits I had the pepperoni and ricotta slice, a pep and margarita slice. The white with pepperoni slice is my favorite. Soo creamy. It was a great blend of flavors.... also I like the seating area. There are about 4 tables that seat 2 ppl - I met my friend there for a slice a convo.",Pizza look very good...  Fresh...  Appeasing to the eye.   They have five seats in this spot.  Two of the five were occupied with folks that were sleeping. The other seats had folks eating.  I will never know if the pizza or food tastes good because the staff continued to ask me what my order was instead of finding out about the folks sleeping in your establishment. I didn't see a way to respond so I am editing my first post to respond to the owner.. I'm from the Bronx and am in Brooklyn for a training (I work for a NYC Agency)  I used yelp to decide on what to eat and found your spot.  And I've seen it a lot in my 47 years on this earth   but sleeping during the lunch rush hurts your business.  Yes your place is small which is helpful for staff to monitor the what is going on with those seats...  I gave you the one star because its an overall rating.   Not just the food I haven't tasted... Not just the inattentive staff... Not just to the sleeping patrons (??? I thought they were homeless).... Not just for the missed opportunity to grab a new customer...  But overall.  I may return as I will be back in 2 weeks.  And I hope to see a change.,"I feel torn. I don't care much for pizza nor do I know anything about the New York or Sicilian style pizza. My bf was dying for a slice so we stopped by after bar hopping (the things you do for love eh?). I got a slice of margarita and it was surprisingly flavorful, albeit VERY greasy. I think I used 20 napkins to soak up the oil, the tomatoes tasted pretty good though and the crust was very thin and delicate. The girl at the counter was pretty friendly.I'd probably stop by again if I'm in the area.",Brooklyn's Homeslice Pizzeria
628,"I order out all the time from various restaurants. I have never had a restaurant charge a Delivery Fee. Leave alone $5.00. That is ridiculous. Plus they automatically add the tip. A $20.00 order will cost you close to $35.00 after they add the delivery charge, tax and tip. Honestly the quality and quantity is not worth it. You would think that with all the competition they have nearby, they would be competitive.","Not only did we have to wait over an hour and a half for our food, but we were overcharged as well. The food was good, but the service was terrible. The owner was very rude. Also the silverware was not clean neither were the cups.","If I can give 0 stars I will because I don't believe they know what that means. I ordered two cold appetizers and one chicken kebab.

629,"Have a cocktail at the bar and an appetizer then go somewhere else for dinner. The drinks are better than the food. This place is kind of expensive for the neighborhood. The bartender was a snoot about the cocktails. When asked if a cocktail was not too sweet, he gave us a lecture about balance. Dude, you nearly killed our vibe. This was a few months back, haven't been back but may again and I'll probably still make sure what I'm ordering is not too sweet ;- |",It took 50 minutes to get a quesadilla and 2 tacos. And we had to cancel the guac and chips. I get the feeling that this place isn't known for their food.,"It's not the drinks that killed this place for me, nor is it the food.  Rather, it is the godawful attitudes of the staff and the accompanying service that is the killer.  Everything from the slower than slow waitress who made us wait for our drinks for - no joke - 30 minutes (never mind ordering food), to the bartender's ridiculous attitude on a subsequent visit.  There are plenty of other options not only in Brooklyn but in Kensington.  Rude, unengaged, incompetent staff that clearly couldn't care less about your drinking or dining experience.  And I'm not so hard to please.  Very disappointing.","I came here this past Saturday and this place is AMAZING!!

Obviously very bitter because of her little customers.","This is still a classic outdoor NYC food spot. The ballfield renovations have really hurt business, though, and selection, as a result. Just four trucks out there, and only El Olomega seemed to be getting any business. These people and their delicious foods deserve better.",Long lines. Plenty of hipster d-bags. Loads more of hipster d-bags on bikes. It's far. It's out of the way. Seating is limited.And I still give it 5 stars.,"The Red Hook Food Vendors are legit.Pupusas are delish! You'll recognize the truck by the long line out in front. It's like an 8-man operation in that truck and they are busy, busy, busy! The last time I was there, we grabbed delicious fresh fruit juices from the fruit and juice truck (Watermelon and Mango), a cup of grilled corn, and parked ourselves in the long line for pupusas. Ordered cheese and pork and cheese. So so good. Great spot to hang out and people watch. I'm lucky enough to live relatively close by, but it's worth a trek.","This has always been my favorite place for authentic Mexican, El Salvadorian, and Guatemalan food.  They're only open during the summer (May-October) in Red Hook.  My favorite truck is the El Olomega Pupusas truck.  The pupusas are made to order so they are hot and fresh.  I prefer the pork & cheese filling but the chorizo and cheese filling is good as well.  They come with a side of pickled cabbage and sour cream.  You can add hot sauce and pickled jalapenos on the side.  They also have freshly made plantain chips which are delicious as well.  You can see someone actually peeling the plantains fro the chips.  There's also Huarache King and aguas frescas truck.  Huarache King has good tacos and huaraches.  The aguas frescas truck has good horchata and watermelon drinks.  Since they're all street food trucks, it's no frills so all the food is served on styrofoam plates and cash only of course.  I will be back sometime in the summer.","The ball fields are so authentic, I expected a Spanish telenovela to be playing in the background.Really though, they have some quality trucks here. The day I went, there was good representation between different countries. We had Country Boys (Mexican tacos), Olomega (Salvadorian papusas), Vaquero's (juices and fruit), and a Colombian truck whose name escapes me at the moment.The lines were longest for Olomega and Country Boys, but definitely worth it (I had CB before, and actually waited for Olomega). If Vaquero's is there, get a fresh squeezed juice; you'll be amazed by how cheap it is!Sadly, no ceviche the day we went, but we'll be back!Bring a blanket, and sit on the grass and watch kids playing ball.Or sit on one of the many benches available. Great experience, and you can take the B61 bus there and/or back.",Red Hook Food Vendors
632,"The grilled pork banh mi here is nothing short of delectable. The pork is so flavorful and flavor is further brought out by the pickled vegetables, all on fresh baked bread.

When we finally sat down people were standing over us bc it's so tight.

She practically avoided us the entire time, gave us an attitude when we asked for water, gave us an attitude when we asked for plain chips for my friend's kid, and when we were paying for the bill and haven't left yet, she was taking away our dishes before we were ready to go. The only reason why I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the food and ambiance.

I did ... it was AWESOME !   Great appetizers, wine, salad, deserts ... would go back in a heartbeat !","Enjoyed a lovely Sunday date night at Bella Gioia. It was our first time dining here. We had early 5:00pm reservations. Found a parking spot pretty quickly just around the block. If you're looking for good Italian food this is the place to go. We started off with drinks. They have a nice selection of cocktails but of course I had the Aperol Spritz (so good). For appetizers we shared an order of Arancini and the meat and cheese board. Both were very good. Can't go wrong with meat and cheese with some good bread and olives. Next time I dine here I'm definitely ordering the fried burrata (just typing it is making me hungry). For the entrees I had the Gnocchi Rustica, which was just yummy cheesy goodness. My husband had the veal dish. I had a little piece, it was very tasty and fried to perfection. Lastly we ended our meal with the most cutest, tastiest limencello cheesecake. Which we didn't even want to eat it was so pretty!Overall we had an amazing dinner. The service is very friendly and attentive. Like I said earlier we are definitely coming back for sure. This wont be our last meal here.","I always pass by this place, but finally made it in because my date really had a craving for Italian food.We started out with the crostini platter - two pieces of three different types of crostini (mushroom, octopus, and pesto). The mushroom was my favorite!For mains, we split the lamb chops and cavatelli, and got a side of asparagus with an egg on top. The lamb chops were perfect, topped with a nice pistachio pesto. The cavatelli was nice and spicy with sausage and fennel. Actually ended up taking half of it to go and it made for a nice leftover lunch the next day!Of course, it's an Italian restaurant, so wine abounds. They have beer as well, but not the greatest selection. Check in with Yelp and you get a half price Aperol Spritz! I sure did.",Bella Gioia
636,"Horrendous customer service. I found a staple in my food after ordering in this afternoon and called in to let the restaurant itself know. I have ordered delivery from Tandoori Masala since I moved to New York in 2015, and unfortunately they lost a customer today due to the attitude I received while attempting to give feedback directly to the restaurant. Instead of assuring me that this would not happen again, the woman on the phone continued to tell me that it wasn't her problem. I'm sad to say I won't be ordering from them again.",Hood food good. LolIt wasn't the best but i ate it so i guess i can't complain too much.,"DO NOT EAT HERE!I recently ordered Bengan Bharta with rice and when it arrived it had an insect in the dish. I called the restaurant and they initially said they would give a refund. When a refund was not provided, I called a Seamless representative. They connected with the restaurant and told me that the owner flat out refused to give a refund. I called them again and they said that they could provide me with more food but not a refund. I know that it seems crazy to dispute $13, but the fact that a restaurant will not refund a person who finds a BUG in their food is beyond belief. I am irate and will not be ordering from this restaurant again.",I love this place and my friend that has sent a lot of time in India really enjoyed it as well...I do wish it was open a little later haha,"- tastes authentic- large portions- throughly enjoyed chicken makhni- mango lassi is thick, and tastes a lot like yogurt- good cucumber salad",Loved this place ! My brother and myself came here on a Friday evening (the place was EMPTY) lol literally one other patron. We sat wherever we wanted looking over the menu and enjoying the warmth and great smell of the restaurant. The waitress took our order .... I was basic and ordered the Chicken tikka misala and my brother ordered what I believe is called Lamb Korma we both added garlic naan to our order which came with a bowl of rice. The food came out piping hot and we dug in immediately. I loved every bite of my food and so did my brother. I will 100% be back here.,Tandoori Masala
637,Frozen crab cake appetizer tasteless shrimp canned clams in the linguine and clam sauce pretty awful I give two stars for the service,"They charge Manhattan prices in borough park Brooklyn. It doesn't make sense at all. The quality is eh, it's Italian food. You can get better for cheaper.",I was underwhelmed here. There was no lunch menu and the dishes were priced as a fine dinning environment. The food was average. It was ok. But at these prices I would have expected more. I have the bucatini and it was bland for Gavin so many ingredients. Also the sauced was very watery. I would say I lived the bread they served at the table. It might be a build up of expectation but I did not have a good experience.,"Lovely little Italian Restaurant with fantastic food!  The service and atmosphere made me feel as if was back in Italy eating with my Nono.  We started with grilled calamari and octopus, pear salad and lobster ravioli. All are outstanding!The Pollo alla Nina was incredible, chicken cutlets covered in this deliciously creamy sauce, peas, mushrooms and bacon!  My friends each had a fresh, well prepared fish dish for dinner. The portions are generous so we each took home the remainder of our entrees.  And the bread was so fresh and good one of my friends took that hime too. Mama Rao's is a must if you are in NYC, it is well worth the trip.","Nice and quiet restaurant, maybe it's early lunch time. I had a very nice waiter who was attentive. The tables are dressed with crisp tablecloth. There were two other tables each had two guests but their respective tables were filled with dishes. They seemed to enjoy their food and wine. I had Arugula salad and spaghetti vongolles. The salad was nicely flavored with lemon dressing. Very fresh. The spaghetti was good. I will come back.","I've lived in Brooklyn my whole life and this was the first tome at Mama Rao's. Excellent meal. The food was delicious, from the antipasto, chicken in cream sauce, stuffed rigatoni and  orrecheti with sausage and broccoli rabe (between three people we ordered)   Everything was A++. The service was very attentive without being overbearing. I can't believe I haven't visited here sooner. Definitely going to add to my rotation of restaurants.",Mama Rao Cucina Italiana
638,"I frequented this place for years. They recently moved locations and apparently forgot to take their competent and friendly staff with them. The place is inattentive, disorganized and staff is just plain rude. Three different servers attended to me (when they finally weren't looking at their phones), all charged me different prices for the same things, were unable to accommodate basic requests (like water) and created an all around uncomfortable place to be in. Spend your money elsewhere on Montague Street.","The Brooklyn Heights location just isn't very good in terms of quality of food. Service was great and the ambiance is nice for a group of 4 or less. But we ordered three of the pastas and they were all bland. I ordered an Alfredo pasta and the sauce was extremely heavy but bland. It tasted like the sauce was made from Parmesan from a can, instead of real Parmesan cheese from a block, and used unsalted instead of salted butter. Overall, I'm not a fan unless you're a health nut looking for flavorless Italian food.","We had made reservations about a week in advanced, and when I arrived the workers were sitting on the stairs. We tried to politely try walk around the workers to go inside, but the workers had told us that no one came to let them in the door and the restaurant just wasn't opening that day. Who just doesn't tell their workers that they aren't going to be opening that day? Who doesn't call and tell their reservation holders that they are not going to be open anymore? This is insane and was really inconvenient.","Decent little Italian place on Montague. We had a group of 6 and they accommodated us without any issues.My husband and I enjoyed everything we ordered. We started with the grilled octopus appetizer, which was my favorite dish of the evening. For our entrees he had the sausage and broccoli rabe Orechiette and I had the linguini and white clam sauce. He felt his dish needed more garlic. I think mine could have used more clams.My husband wanted dessert and ordered the apple tart, but they didn't have any left. There were a few things that were unavailable, but he was able to get the poached pear in Port. I had a cappuccino.Service was very good. We stayed and talked for quite a while and they didn't rush is out.All in all it was a nice evening.","We've been ordering from Buon Gusto for over a year and a half and really like the quality of food and quick delivery (on average 20 to 30 minutes later than the time stated). We have even been inside the restaurant and everybody was very friendly, both for dining at the bar and ordering takeout. This was at their old location. However, in recent weeks the quality, delivery time and customer service has gone down. They stopped including bread with entrees, and do not regularly answer the phone. Tonight, we had ordered a side of tortellini pasta with our meal and it was never delivered. This was an option that was through the app and even included in the receipt. When I called the restaurant the manager Mario said that they would be losing money if they offered tortellini with their salads. I explained to him that this should not be offered if they are unwilling to honor what the menu and order states. If I had known, I would have ordered more food. On September 3 we waited two hours and finally gave up since the food was never delivered and no one answered the phone. Seamless was also not able to get in touch with the restaurant. I just found out today that the restaurant was actually closed but somehow someone excepted the delivery order on their end. It is also less expensive to order through seamless delivery than to order pick up from the restaurant. 10 to 20% difference in fact. That makes no sense. I am sure they will change all of their prices and make it unreasonable to order delivery after taking note of all of my complains. I shared all of these recent issues with Mario the manager and he only came up with excuses as to why this is GrubHub / seamless's fault and never once offered an apology or a courtesy being that I have been a regular customer for over a year and a half. I finally said to him if he's not going to do the right thing then I'm going to hang up the phone because my dinner is getting cold and he continued to talk about how they would lose money if they honored what was on the actual order. This is not customer service. I am very disappointed.","Given the prices, I didn't expect to be floored by Cafe Buon Gusto, but I didn't expect to be gravely disappointed, either.I often wait for a second or even third visit before posting reviews, but since I will probably never go back unless I'm trying to get off the street and hide from an armed pursuer, this first one will have to suffice.Let's call it what it is.  It's an Italian restaurant with white tablecloths, where the tablecloths are covered with paper.  I could probably stop there.We started by ordering some mid-table bottle of Italian red, which they did not have.  Instead, we were offered a similarly priced $50 bottle of Chianti which didn't quite measure up to any of the currently available $4.99 bottles at Trader Joe's.  It was very ""fresh"", and might have paired well with the cruet of rosemary olive oil on the table and some sea salt to dress a plate of field greens.For appetizers, I ordered the stracciatella, and my partner chose an octopus salad over arugula with a light lemon dressing.  The salad was really the stand out of the meal, and was prepared genuinely well.  The soup was watery,  lacked seasoning, and was improved with the addition of aforementioned olive oil and the stingy bits of ice cold focaccia that came with the table.  Ice cold as in straight from a fridge.For entrees, I decided on the supposedly housemade crab ravioli with shrimp, in a cream sauce, and she ordered pan seared scallops with shrimp.  Here, the breakdown was compete.  The shrimp and scallops were deep fried, not pan fried, and though the scallops were cooked perfectly, all the shrimp were clearly dropped at the same time, and were cooked to leathery, inedible oblivion.  The ravioli may or may not have been, in fact, housemade - they had excellent flavor and the crab was prominent - but some of the pasta was excessively al dente, meaning undercooked, which tells me they had been frozen.  They were immersed in a distinctly not Italian bath of lobsterish-bisque which while delicious, was cloying.  That dish went largely untouched.Nobody asked how anything was, which would be basic courtesy when someone fails to eat their food.  So either they know, don't care, or both.So, that is the tale of the inappropriately named Cafe Buon Gusto.  It's a sad one, but blessedly brief, and not to be repeated.",Caffe Buon Gusto
639,Unfortunately this restaurant was bad on many levels.Pro'sThe hostess was nice...The decor is old school (my taste)The valet parking attendant was also nice Con'sThe waiter was very old (80's) and very rudeThe Waiter also had dirty fingernails (that made into all the plates...).  All our food was thrown in front of us and then the waiter just turned and walked away.....We Had to send back expired soda (how is that possible?!?). The food is very bland.I had high hopes but there's nothing to go back for.,"I wanted to like Bamonte's so much. I really did. I wasn't expecting a perfect experience, and wasn't expecting the best Italian food I had ever eaten. I know this place is supposed to be about the experience. But our experience was just so terrible between the service and the food. My wife and I made reservations for a Saturday and walked in to a full house. The hostess seated us quickly, but we had to wait about 10 minutes for menus. Whatever...not a huge deal. Our waiter finally came and took our drink order and gave us menus. He came back with the tiniest Manhattan ever, which was basically vermouth with a couple ice cubes and a cherry. Terrible. He took our orders and was pretty rude and dismissive of my wife when she asked a simple question about the salads. Our salad and soup came and they were pretty bland. My wife's soup was so thin it looked like it came out of a Campbell's can. I ordered some red wine since I didn't feel like having another shot glass of vermouth, and the waiter comes back with 2 glasses. When I explain that my wife didn't want a glass he waves us away. OK? Not sure if he's going to charge us for it or not, but the guy was extremely rude the entire evening. Our entrees came out, which were Chicken Cacciatore and Spaghetti with meat balls - two red sauce joint staples. They were two of the blandest dishes we have ever eaten. The spaghetti sauce was so thin and watery it looked like a jar of ragu with some ground beef thrown in. The meatballs were overcooked and dried out. The chicken cacciatore was covered in flavorless tomato paste. Again, I wasn't expecting fine dining, but good grief, shouldn't the sauce have a little flavor??We finished our entrees and my wife wanted dessert. The waiter asked if I wanted coffee, and my wife asked if we could see a dessert menu. The waiter literally ROLLED HIS EYES and huffed off. Excuse me!? I should have asked for the check right then and there. What a complete idiot. Anyway, we ordered the apple crumb pie and dipped ice cream ball, which were actually pretty decent. However, they were not enough to make up for the terrible food, drinks and atrocious service. Bottom line is there is absolutely no reason to come here unless you want to see a cheesy signed picture of some celebrities on the wall. The sauce tastes like it comes out of a can and the service is atrocious. The place is coasting off of its reputation at this point.","Was visiting NY/NJ and wanted some old school Italian. After lots of reviews I chose Bamonte's based on the history and the ambience. Unfortunately I left disappointed. First, it took 15 minutes before our server ever came over. When he did, he looked annoyed that he had a table to serve. It seemed like when we ordered he made a face. I don't know if that was just his face but geesh!!!The food was decent but not spectacular. No one ever asked if we needed more drinks. It was just disappointing. There's so many places we could have gone so Bamonte's, please work on your service....","Solid Italian food at an affordable price. You can tell this place has been around for a while. It's got a neighborhood/family vibe and the staff reflects that. If you're looking for a quiet dinner, this is definitely not for that but it's great for medium to large family style dinners. I'm a sucker for fried calamari and it was solid. Not spectacular but solid. Wish they were a bit crispier. I also got the seafood fradiavolo and was pleasantly surprised at the depth of flavor. Would return to try the other pastas. Service was great.","Bamonte's is consistently good/very good Italian food from what I was told. We were a large party of 16 tonight. Every dish was good to very good. And the service and decor were incredible given the mobbed dining room. Price was really fair, we ate like champions for ~$100 each which included:- hot antipasto (baked clams, stuffed mushrooms, eggplant rollatini) peppers, garlic bread- orders of mussels, very good sauce- a mozz spiedini of sorts- pasta course of rigatoni broccoli rape with sausage, lasagna and ravioli - sides of string beans and potatoes- for entrees we slowed down, about one main per three guys- I was all for fish. We had the monkfish, broiled flounder, branzino, and the stuffed bluefish special. All were good. Pork chops looked good to, my friend ordered and finished them all! The iced cappuccino was incredible, as was the cannoli cream slice of pie.","It was my work mom's birthday, and she wanted to have her luncheon here for a change since we usually do, well, the usual.  So we made reservations for our party of 12, and we were seated on the left just by the bathroom, by the wall.  The overall atmosphere was dimly lit, with a very old-school Italian restaurant vibe.  The floral wall paper, the chandeliers, and the big family style tables.  Expectations were pretty high.We all ordered, and had asked if we could get some hot and cold antipasto for the table so we could all share.  We were told it would be 20 minutes until that came out, since a large funeral party came in with about 30+ people before us.  Since we were on a tight lunch hour schedule, we declined and ordered our entrees instead.  Fast forward about 40 minutes.  We were all wondering about our food, but no one had asked, because we understood the kitchen was pumping out food for the huge party.  From outta no where, one of the waiters came over to our table, with a nasty look on his face and in a rude tone said, ""your food will come out when it's ready.""  I would hope so!  The comment was not called for, and we didn't make a fuss or anything.  Yes we were wondering, but don't be rude!  If you're having a bad day, keep it to yourself.  When the food finally did come out, I was happy with my stuffed veal with mushrooms and cheese.  It was a very generous portion, and was worth it in my opinion for the price.  Then, the sides came out family style such as green beans and potatoes.  The waiter then said that he could get the antipasto order out for us now.  We were like, um no - we're good because we waited this long, so we couldn't be bothered with the antipasto now.  You could tell he was trying to make up for the slow service and his rude behavior for the sake of his tip.  Too little, too late in my opinion.The food was good, but I can get this same kind of quality closer to home and without the nasty treatment.",Bamonte's
640,"Visited on Sunday just as they opened up, i was surprised that they had food to serve do thumbs up for that. the portion for the oxtail was smaller than what i was expecting but, filling nonetheless. The music was nice as always but the bartenders were not attentive at least, not to me and my friend they weren't. It started picking up around 7:30/8 o'clock but, it was a Sunday so i wasn't expecting it to be packed. I didn't like the fact they added the gratuity especially when i didn't feel like the bartenders deserved it. I had to call them over everytime i needed a drink, even when i placed my empty bottle or glass on the counter and it wasn't busy. Overall i like the place and the ambiance","Whelp I'll officially not come here again. Last time I came here the bouncer tried to charge me 20 bucks to go downstairs even though I had been downstairs before. I vowed not to come back again but ended up here because it was the only thing available that was close. We were met by a rude ass bartender he didn't smile or say anything to us. This was a Monday 6/3 @8pm and nobody was in the restaurant when we came in. Not sure why he was so angry. We then opened a WAY OVERPRICED MENU!! My God! 26 bucks for pasta? You would think it would be excellent when arrived nope!! Jerk chicken dry, pasta dry with old shrimp. Fries either half cooked and limp or dry. The bartender again had a complete attitude when my friend asked to return the horrible jerk chicken. WILL NOT BE HERE AGAIN! Don't waste your time here unless you like overpriced drinks and food and HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH TERRIBLE FOOD.","Whelp I'll officially not come here again.

Drinks on the pricey side but very strong ! the long islands from this place should be illegal LOL !,"I came here with a friend and was able to snatch 2 chairs at the bar. Upstairs was pretty calm but starting to get packed. You do get carded to enter the premises. I had my favorite gin and tonic. My original bartender made my drink and disappeared. It was a shame because her skills were better then my current bartender. We had about 3 drinks each and decided to head downstairs. Apparently,  when you spend $40 at the bar you can head downstairs free of charge. Downstairs is pretty small longer in length. They played a lot of caribbean music and the dj was pretty good. All in all I had a great time. I'll start utilizing this place as my late night drink spots.",Another place not to go twice enter the place on a Tuesday decent crowd not a go to place for atmosphere I'm a young thundercat and there was no eye candy but if your looking for a sugar daddy this is the place to go. So many old men and I mean 60-80 years old but hay they need love too.  Now please I'm not a chef or a food expert but I know when I've been served some of the nastiest macaroni n cheese  this hands down came a close second to my own mother's Mac n cheese and hers is bad  I also had cod fish cakes and they should change the name to cakes because that was not cod fish. I am Puerto Rican/ Costa Rican and I know what cod fish taste like and that was some form of imitation cod now the only good thing about this place and why I gave it 2 stars is because of the drinks good lord was it strong bartender is the bomb I had a drink called bend me over and yes when I tell you that drink was everything after 2 of those the old grandpas in there lost about 20 years off them ... my vision was blurry all In all drinks YES .. food ... hell to the nah to the nah nah nah,Sip N Chat Cocktail Lounge
641,"We were trying to get into Laojie/Timestamps, but the wait was an hour at 8pm on a Sunday. We decided to give Mister Hotpot a try since there was no wait (this should've been an indication) and they do AYCE too. It's $26 per person, which I didn't think was super worth it. They bring you out a bowl of soy sauce and a rack of other toppings like cilantro, green onion, minced garlic, sesame paste, peanut paste, BBQ sauce, and hot sauce. I have feelings about this. This is an EXTREMELY lacking sauce selection. Where's the hoisin sauce? The sesame oil? In addition, the peanut paste was not labeled in any way. This could potentially lead to disaster if it's used by someone who has an allergy. When you try to order more beef, they just bring you one order. I tried to place an order for 4 orders of beef, cause all I wanted was beef, and they brought over 1 order. The beef was super thin, which isn't necessarily a good thing here. The custard/fish roe fish ball was really, really odd. Not a fan. The food just didn't feel super fresh or high quality. They also charge $3 for a soda... and don't bring water unless asked. Service was the only redeeming factor. They kept refilling our pot with hot broth without asking.","This iconic hotpot has downgraded to all you can eat. Everything has also been downgraded.  Pork bone soup base is not the same,  there are no more pork feet in the soup.  Place is understaffed, we had to flag down service all night.  This place is nothing special anymore.  Perhaps same as 99 hot pot.. even worst. The sauce selection was very limited,  area was a mess.  Food selection is the same as other ayce, some basic items not even available.  They are similar to our Hotpots at home so what sets mr hotpot apart now? Among the fierce hotpot competition in Flushing now,  I don't think they can last too long. I guess if you can eat and drink like a fish then the extra $12 all you can drink would be worst it.","Once a premiere hot pot spot to average ""all you can eat"" store. I only came here with special occasion and more than willing to spend. If I wanted ""all you can eat"", i can find that down the block or two.  The food quality is down, and presentation is cheapened. They're out of fried tofu skin, no fish skin, no wine-chicken, and the crab paste came in a BOWL.  It's really disappointing. I usually spend $130 with 2 people, and $280 with 4. Last night we spent $125 with 4 people.   Not a special occasion place to bring your friends and family. I think they'll be going out of business soon because they don't differentiate themselves from other hotpot places. They don't have the space to compete either.  Their usuals (those willing to spend) don't come frequently and once they find out won't be returning. The ones that normally don't come since they know mr hotpot to be expensive won't come in here because they don't know they've cheapened nor do they want to wait.   Maybe it's better for everyone if they posted a giant sign ALL YOU CAN EAT. SO lastly, I want to point out they have NUVAN STRIPS hanging above the customers seating area. You guys can read on what that is on your own.  That's another reason I cannot go back.","This is our go to hot pot spot! It's open late and the servers are always attentive and kind. The menu has a wide variety. A few of our favorites are beef throat, rice cake, shrimp cheese balls, ALLLL of the mushrooms, fatty lamb, cuttle fish, fish skin, and lotus root. Hoping to try the fresh pig's brain next time we go.","The Good:The hostess here was very nice and friendly. She helped us put our name on the list since there was a wait for a private hotpot. She called us immediately when it was our turn.The ingredients (or most of them) are better than your normal AYCE hotpot quality. The beef and small clams especially (drools).There are a ton of options on here that aren't included on normal AYCE hotpot menus.The broth was refilled frequently.The seating allowed for tons of space between tables so you didn't feel like you were on top of other diners.The price is spot on.You can eat free on your birthday.The Not So Good:Service was spotty. We only received the first half of the items we selected and we had to remind multiple servers on multiple different occasions that we were missing items. It took forever to get someone's attention.Of the 3 blue crabs we ordered, only 2 were fresh. The third was almost rotten and ruined our broth. When we told our server, he didn't really flinch or offer to bring out a replacement.The sauces are brought over to you at the beginning of your meal so you can make a small bowl of your own concoction. Their sauce selection doesn't include hoisin and some other options that I've found at other hotpot places.No free dessert. Other places around here offer that so this place needs to step their game up.","The truth is the service is lacking we ordered so many times and they took a very long time to bring anything. It seems the servers are just moving slow, not anticipating what customers need. It was a hassle to fill the soup, get water, and just to get any meat plates. The quality of food wasn't bad, we went Thursday and tried thier ribeye special. It was tender and good quality, but thier fatty beef was better. Soup base is tasty, but they dont do individual pots. We had share one large pot for our group, which made it a free for all. Most likely I wouldn't reccomend it again, just was frustrating service and it wasn't too busy. We left there still hungry.",Mister Hotpot
642,"I came here Saturday night around 10pm to grab a beer after having dinner in the area. The place was empty, yet half the tables still had the dirty dishes and food remenants of whoever had last sat there. The bathrooms were also filthy. I'm sure the brunch crowd gets a little wild but by 10pm there's time to clean up... I have had brunch at other locations of theirs and thought the food and service was fine so maybe it's just a problem with this one",Sick chicken sandwich!! The vibes are very cool but the beer is way way over priced even for NYC,My wife and her girlfriends went there for her birthday and the sever Sara was very rude and didn't know her menu. Total bad vibe and ruined her birthday brunch,"Came by on a Sat afternoon and had a really pleasant time. I love pour your own places - my own personal gripe is that I didn't happen to like any of the beers available! And I tried about 5, but that's a personal failing. I really like that the shuffleboard is free, they have two water stations and some nice outdoor seating options. We ordered the waffle fries for a snack which are nicely seasoned and come with a spicy dipping sauce.",Great spot for beer tasting. They give you an electronic card to keep track of your tab with the self serve beer.The male bartender there is always super nice.,Came by on a Saturday night around 8:30pm. The concept is cool- you get a swipe card to go up to the different drafts yourself and get to chose as much or as little of the beer of your choice. This is good especially if you like to try new beers. And then the card gets charged for however many ounces you poor. My boyfriend first experienced this type of place in PA and saw that they had one in Williamsburg that we wanted to come try it. However... we were experiencing A LOT of foam being poured from a few of the drafts. This didn't happen when we were in PA. So we even asked a bartender to try and he even got a lot of foam. So it was definitely annoying because we were getting charged for all this foam!! It wasn't worth it to us then because we only had about 4 'half' beers each because of the foam and we still paid sixty something bucks.. It also got annoying because of course it's a Saturday night and people are hanging out but they are blocking the drafts for you to get to. They should try to have that area blocked off for the people wanting to pour to get to easier. Music was good though and employees were very friendly.,Randolph Beer
643,"Thank you yelpers for your recommendations! We lived all the selections, decent prices and more authentic than the other local Thai spots. It's a smaller space but the chef makes up for it with exquisite taste and presentation.","Came to this place and stood for 15 minutes unnoticed, while waiters studied the computer screen, and one of the tables was filled with dirty dishes that were waiting to be cleaned.  Two women came after us, and were immediately seated as if we were invisible.  When we came up to a man behind the bar, he gave us a table.  We did not feel welcomed.Ordered mackerel, which was too deep fried, and tom yum soup, which was ok.  Then also pad thai, and also tried green curry, which was served in a young coconut.  The service was super slow.  The waitress was dismissive. Not even once came up to ask if we were ok.We asked to take green curry home, but they took off the young coconut.Overall, I do not recommend this place.  The food is nothing special.","I placed an order in store paid for my food and asked for it to be delivered. The manager seemed to have no problem with delivery when I asked, I got home about 10 minutes from the place only to wait an hr before I decided to call and find out the ETA of my dinner. I called and explained to the manager that I had been waiting for about an hour and just wanted to know how far my food was only to be told his delivery man was not comfortable delivering to my neighborhood. Imagine my anger knowing that my food was sitting on the counter and no one had planned on letting me know they were not going to deliver it AFTER I HAD PAID!! I had to call for them to tell me I had to leave my house and walk back to the restaurant at 9pm after placing my initial order at 7:30, I am 5 months pregnant with a toddler who waited all night for dinner that never came. With that being said I believe this place needs sensitivity training because of the way they deal with certain communities, had I lived in Cobble Hill it would never have been an issue but because we are located in Red Hook which is less than 10min walking distance from the restaurant we were neglected. I denied the food and had a refund because no place like this will get any of my money EVER AGAIN!!","Amazing Thai food. I love Thai food and this place did not disappoint. I was in the Carroll Gardens area for work and decided to hit this place up. I loved it that i came back for lunch the next day. Lunch: I ordered the Green Curry. MUST!! It came with a veggie spring roll and a soup. I didn't like the soup but i'm not much of a soup guy so there's that. The decor of the place was really nice and had traditional art work from Thailand hung up everywhere. Cute place. If you're around the area, try em out!","Boran is definitely not your run-of-the-mill Thai restaurant!  Service here is outstanding and the fare is spicy, flavorful, and authentic.  You'll find some unique flavors and dishes that typically aren't featured at their more ""Americanized"" counterparts.  What's also great?  Well, you can tell that a lot of love went into the design and execution of this restaurant.  When you walk in the door, you immediately get the sense that the paintings and pictures that adorn the wall are deeply personal to the proprietor.  And, the chef's presentation skills are incredible!We began our meal with an appetizer from their rotating specials menu (I forgot the name of the dish, sorry!).  The beef was both tender and delicious - served alongside a tasty dipping sauce.  For our main course, we ordered the Nam Ngaew (noodle soup with spicy pork, herbs, vegetables) and the traditional Pad Thai dish that we all know and love.  The spicy pork noodle soup featured a generous portion of protein and the broth had a lot of depth, flavor, and heat!  That Pad Thai... the best we've ever tasted... and a unique presentation too (omelette anyone?)!Boran is officially in our top two Thai restaurants in the NYC area.","We came back and brought friends here on a Saturday for lunch. With more people joining we tried some new dishes from Boran. Let me begin with the conclusion, Boran is now everyone's favorite Thai restaurant in NYC!In addition to Khao Klook Gapi and Pad Thai that we have tried here before, we ordered Massaman curry and a fried fish with sweet sauce. As usual, the food was presented beautifully. My new favorite is that fried fish, the meat was deboned, yet I still ate the bones as crackers in the end - yes even the bones are that good! It has a strong fish sauce and tamarind taste, the chopped raw onions and limes gave a special kick in every bite. I would highly recommend this dish!",Boran
644,"I really wasnt impressed.The Good: the mussels were delicious and large, the crab cocktail was very flavorful but a small portion, blue crabs were very well seasoned, and the lobster was very delicate and absolutely delicious.  It was too cold to sit outside by the water but you still get a glimpse of the water and boats sitting inside.The Not So Good: the shrimp cocktail tasted awkward -- like medicine, the staff is not too friendly or accomodating, and it took too long for the food to come out.The Bad: the parking lot is extremely dark and the ground is very terrain so I needed to use a flashlight to walk back to the car to avoid stumbling over rocks, tree branches, and descending terrain.  More importantly, I really feel that its unsafe for anyone to walk alone in such darkness.","Solid 3 stars. The food is good, but not great. The service is good, but when we were confused about how to open the crab the server didn't really show it to us. I know you can look it up online, but restaurants always show how to open food someone is unfamiliar with. The prices are not cheap, so you are paying quite a lot for ""okay"" food. The servicers were very attentive otherwise. The bathroom plumbing does not work, and there weren't signs on the bathrooms about this issue. Our main pet peeve is the dark parking lot. Honestly, this is not something I ussually comment on, but it's really not safe for a woman to walk to her car alone at night on that parking lot.  First, the back of the parking lot has big rocks and you need your flashlight to see where you are going so you don't fall on your face. Second, my husband pulled up the car all freaked out saying how a woman should not walk there alone as there are too many dark spots. This place is right off of the highway exit, so as bad as it sounds it's really not a safe place to walk to your car. You have to see it for yourself to see what I am saying. Pitch  black towards the back of the lot near the highway exit. I might be back to sit outside in the summer, but there are better seafood spots for compatible prices.",The atmosphere and beer.garden were nice. I was a bit disappointed with the food. I ordeded the little necks and lobster and shrimp tacos. Clams a little chewy and tacos not good. Staff were very friendly and accommodating.,"Would have absolutelyBeen a five star, if it didn't take me an extra 15 minutes of driving in circles to find the location. Finally gave in and called. A very friendly young lady answered the phone and gave me direct directions to find it. For the future reference, when you pass cold stone turn right, then take that immediate left at the stop sign. Believe it or not, that's a street going to the left! Then another left and there it is!I was greeted by the same friendly lady that answered the phone, she recommended I sit out side and I'm so glad she did. Table was directly on the Marina and the sunset was amazing!My server Taylor was a joy, brought a delicious dirty martini, had to have two!She suggested the dungeoness legs verse the all you can eat maryland crabs. I was surprised that they were cheaper than what I paid for in Alaska!I did like the garlic butter sauce, but for the price, 3 claws would have been nicer! Order of calamari and order of oyster, $150 later and hungry by the time I got home! Go figure! But those martinis lolEven though the prices are bit pricy, I just loved sitting out on the deck, next time, one martini!","Food is okay. Great bar. Music is good. Nice crowd. The Service a little slow and the view spectacular! They need to be a little more consistent, but overall a fun place to hang out.",Great seafood place...only reason for not more stars is their customer service and staff are not the nicest and friendliest,Clemente's Maryland Crabhouse
645,This place is a gem. I went to La Slowteria for the first time recently and had no idea what I was getting myself into. My sense is that it's viewed as a good neighborhood Mexican. This is wrong. It merits consideration as a destination spot for serious Mexican food fans. The guacamole and the ceviche were especially memorable.,"I don't know why this restaurant has 4 stars , this place is over prices happy hour is not even worth the drive . Servers aren't even servers they dressed as if they are home . I kept getting asked if I wanted another drink or wanted the check talk about rude . I won't be back here and I don't recommend this place at all also the ""host"" is really rude and got mad when I didn't want to give her my order .","Went here a couple of times to finally write my review , while the margaritas are good the service is questionable . I would've thought the place would have a good vibe not to serious but the way they serve the expensive food they give you [small portion ] it's not worth the price how can you have all these rules like cleaning the crumbs of my table trying to have all the table look like ""fine dining "" WHEN MY SERVER HAS SWEATPANTS AND A SWEATY SHIRT ? And they could barely talk to me about the specials . Also there's to many people for a small place I have the host serving me which makes no sense where is the server ? And there's no need to have hose either I had a friend trial there and he said there is no a/c as well which is true and it sucks since the kitchen is right there exposing so much smoke and heat I don't think this place is worth the money your better of going some where else the food is not worth it either it's expensive for a small portion will not be back here no more and I do not recommend","La Slowteria really lived up to its name! Not in terms of all the hype surrounding this place, but in regard to the fact that it does indeed take a verrry long time to get your drinks and food.The tacos were all pretty tasty, but at $7-$8 per each taco, that's to be expected. I was very excited to try the squid taco, but unfortunately they they had run out for the night. Thankfully, they had the mindfulness to inform me of this 30+ minutes after I had already ordered one, mentioning it while they were dropping off the rest of my table's entrees. I would have ordered something else, but didn't feel like waiting for another half hour for my replacement taco. I should have known it was going to take a lot longer than that for the check anyway.Overall good food, but be prepared to wait an entire Lord of the Rings movie for your meal. And halfway through, you might find out Gandalf isn't showing up.",This has become my favorite spot for food. Everything is authentic and organic. The service is excellent with warm and friendly staff. An experience you won't regret.,"cute romantic spot. lovely decor. that's what captivated me. great customer service. they had on old films on the projector. tried to order something other than tacos. it took a long time to come out. possibly over 30 minutes. now i understand why it took so long, it's in the name! i enjoyed the ceviche. it had shrimp, squid, cherry tomatoes, cilantro and avocado. thesecond entree i got had chorizo, refried beans, rice, and stuffed pepper with corn and beans. it was overall an interesting experience.",La Slowteria
646,"What terrible service. There was no one in the restaurant and 2 wait staff. Our apps came out quick but then waited 30 minutes for our ramen. Not once did anyone come over and apologize for the wait or inform us why there was even a wait. We did see take out orders being pumped out though. And when there wasn't any take out orders being brought out, both wait staff were not present on the floor. Probably hiding because they know the kitchen was taking so long.Just doesn't make sense. Clearly don't have a staff that knows how to run a restaurant or have any clue about customer service.Ramen was eh. Won't be back.",Pros:CleanOpen kitchen Friendly staffLocationCons:Slightly overpriced for the quality and quantity Lacks specialty,"I guess this place is OK for the area. Maybe I shouldn't even review any more ramen restaurants because I'm sick of the whole genre. So why did I go there, you ask? It was close and we were hungry... so there you go.In any case, I don't have much to say. The ramen was decent. It tastes like every other ramen place we've been to recently. The service was decent as was the ambiance.A-OK, personified... err, restaurantified, I should say.","Wow! The best vegan ramen soup I've had in my life! They somehow managed to make it rich, creamy, full-bodied and almost frothy- much like a meat based broth. This is something I've never found in a vegan ramen broth before and I'm beyond impressed. Noodles were incredibly tasty as well and perfectly cooked. Overall the flavors of the entire meal were extremely well balanced and the food was obviously prepared with care and thoughtfulness. This goes for the service as well, attentive and caring. I ordered green tea that never came out and I was too hungry and then too mesmerized by the soup to even remember it but the waiter realized himself when we had just started eating. As he brought it over he apologized and said they obviously wouldn't charge me for it. A little thing like that can so easily become a reason to not want to revisit if the waiter is nonchalant. But in this case the service was so professional that his mistake ended up making me even more pleased with my visit than before he forgot about my tea :)I will DEFINITELY be back and would warmly recommend it to anyone and everyone.","When I was walking to Prospect Park, I stumbled onto this tiny nook on 7th ave. The decor was very minimalistic and inviting. Since there aren't many go-to spots for ramen in the Park Slope neighborhood, I thought I'd give it a try. The lunch set comes with one appetizer and one ramen bowl for $15. I got the Tenichi ramen, which had pork chashu, an egg, bok choy, and pork broth. Instead of the pork dumplings or buns, I went for the chicken wings in Teriyaki sauce. Have to say it's a steal for the price. The wings were crunchy, with the right about of sweet in the sauce. The ramen was served fresh and pipping hot. The broth complemented the flavors of the bok choy, and the pork chashu literally melted in my mouth. If you like your ramen on the spicey side, the place provides you with ample amounts of hot sauce. Overall, I would definitely go back for round #2. Amazing neighborhood find, no frills, and a bang for your bucks.",Nice ramen spot that has all different types of broths and proteins to choose from. I had the house ramen and the broth was very flavorful. We also orders a couple appetizers. The tempura shrimp is excellent. We also ordered the octopus app and it was so so. The hot sake was nice and reasonably priced. Definitely would come back,Ten-Ichi Ramen
647,Horrible. Horrible. Horrible.Started with guacamole that had no flavor. Finished with tacos that also had no flavor. Worst Mexican food I've ever had.,"A friend recommended this place, but I can't understand why. These were some of the worst tacos I've ever had. Plus some of the stalest tortilla chips ever (the free ones). The ""loaded"" nachos were equally as sad (it was just four nachos). I had three tacos and the only one that was remotely palatable was the shrimp.","So we came here because the reviews were pretty good and it was close by but unfortunately our experience was not great. I ordered the cheese enchiladas, you choose salsa roja or verde, I chose salsa roja and obviously they brought out verde. No big deal, I like salsa verde too so I didn't mention it. Then I went to drink my $10 margarita and it was vile, like drinking straight tequila through a straw. My boyfriend took a sip to see if it was really that bad and agreed. You shouldn't be allowed to call that a margarita, it simply wasn't. It almost put me off my meal but when the waitress came by I asked her to take the full glass away and explained why it was undrinkable and that I didn't want a new one. We finished our meal and when we got the receipt we saw she still charged us $10 for the margarita... Needless to say we won't be wasting our money here again.",Mexicans on a visit from Houston! We've been on the look out for delicious Mexican food since we got here! This place was close to our hotel and open late! There food was delicious and up to our expectations! There michelada we're as close to original as possibly and tasted great!,"Great service. Prices are a little high for mediocre Mexican food.  The sangria was not homemade. You can taste it. It wasn't sweet at all. The rice was bland, zero seasoning. The refried beans seem to come straight out of a can. The tortillas seem to come straight out of a bag also and they were cold. The guacamole was excellent. The Tostadas were good. The fish taco  was ok.  I don't see myself going back there. They have a lot of competition within a small area. They need to step up the quality on their menu.","I've been to Los Tacos a few times, this place never disappoint me. I came here again last week with a few friends, we had the veggie nachos, fish tacos, steak tacos, chicken quesadilla, guacamole and salsa - everything was fresh and tasty.Their micheladas are the best I ever had. The service is fast and everybody smiles at you. They have a t.v screen for big soccer games which is a plus. A nice bar and outdoor tables. Go try.",Los Tacos-Mcondo
648,"Extremely rude owner Asked us to wait 10 min and then took it back and said ""for you 30min""- yelling! since we were asking for him to move 2 tables together Not a way to treat your customers especially not those who come back weekly! Stupid guy! You just lost clients that will make lots of noise about your temper!","I don't understand all the good reviews. Ordered the lasagna for delivery. It arrived very quickly (less then 15min) which left me highly suspicious and ended up disappointed. Meat sauce was just bad and was way too tomato heavy to be a bolognese. and the noodles were way over cooked and just complete mush.  There was no bechamel sauce to speak of and just some melted mozzarella.   Also, it lists the soda as a 20oz bottle but was sent an 8oz bottle ...","The curse for this location has been broken! I've seen the last several restaurants in this location, seemingly under the same owner,  come and go within the past 5 or 6 years.  Stopped in for a dinner and the food and service are both impeccable. They haven't gotten their liquor license yet, so BYOB. Great with kids!","This restaurant was recommended to my husband after our Italian go to in the Slope started declining in quality. Man are we glad we did. This restaurant is small but has plenty of tables inside, as well as outdoors. The menu is amazing with a variety of classic Italian fare both with and without meat, which made me happy as a vegetarian. We decided on starting with the burrata appetizer (duh) and we split the paccheri e burrata pasta and the buffalo pizza. The burrata appetizer was outstanding. The veggies that came with it were fresh and delicious and truly wonderful. The burrata was a good portion and so flavorful. I feel like sometimes the burrata that comes in an appetizer can be really small and just not worth it. That was not the case here at all. The pasta and the pizza were show stopping. The house made pasta was cooked perfectly and the tomato sauce was perfection. The balance of flavor in it was exactly what you want in a sauce. God I am dreaming of it now! The pizza was the same. The dough was perfect and delicious and the sauce was excellent. The cheese fresh and tasty. This was an incredible meal and we were talking about coming back before we even finished. The best part of the whole experience was the incredibly friendly and welcoming husband and wife team who were running the restaurant. They were friendly, inviting, social, and warm. This meal and experience was wonderful. The atmosphere they have created here is home.","Thank goodness for Yelp. Seriously. I always assumed this was another iteration of the restaurant that changed its theme literally every six months, same owners, different format, never great. My husband convinced me to give it a try tonight because the reviews were good. I was tentative, but it was raining out and I agreed.  So happy to learn that Baciccia is not the same owners as the previous half dozen attempts at making this place stick.Anyway, on to the positives! Great service! Great menu! I had an excellent beef carpaccio on a bed of arugula, with shaved parmesan and truffle oil. (the raw mushrooms were not necessary and did not enhance the otherwise excellent dish). My husband had a salad. I ordered a brick oven pizza with buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, broccoli rabe  and jalapenos. The crust was excellent - both crispy and chewy. My husband had a fettucini bolognese which he said was great.Interesting selection of pizzas and pastas. I can't remember what the fish special was except it wasn't branzino (hooray!).Lovely service, interesting menu, sorry I assumed this was just more of the same old from the same old in the same old space.Can't wait to return. Thank you for a lovely meal!",For my wife's birthday we got her favorite thing in the world (besides me) - PASTA. We got the Tagliatelle Bolognese and a Vegetarian Pizza. Their home made chili oil goes very well with the pizza.,Baciccia Pizza e Cucina
649,"I was quite disappointed with the hot dogs here as I was expecting them to be amazingly delicious as they were supposedly one of the original Coney Island hot dog places. Unfortunately I didn't think it tasted much better than a hot dog from Costco, while also being a lot more expensive. The ranch fries were especially artery clogging and disgusting.","2019.08.18     ""Warriors come out and play!"",  here it is.  This is the hotdog stand.  OG 1916, if someone tells you it's a bad hotdog, educate them.  It is the hotdog that hotdogs are measured against.       You come here for the OG.  If you don't like it because it doesn't taste like what you used to, your measuring in reverse.  You come for hotdogs, corn dogs, fries and seafood.  Don't expect fancy.  These things only need mustard and sauerkraut.  Not cinnamon, bacons, lemon soda.       So it remains legendary, if you coming to Brooklyn in the summer, go to CI and get your Nathan's Hotdog fix.  Get some history on it.  Stay Brooklyn or get Brooklyn.",Don't take a trip to Coney Island just for Nathan's..You will be so disappointed. The lines were not too bad when we first arrived around 9pm but by 10pm they were crazy. Beware there is no indoor seating so be prepared to take your food to go or sit outdoors. The bathrooms are terrible so avoid them unless you have an emergency. The frog legs seem to be a hit for some but they were just ok. The hot dogs seem to be their best option. Just wasn't worth the hype,"THE ONE AND ONLY ORIGINAL NATHAN'S FAMOUS.If there is anything that represents New York, in terms of food, Nathan's Famous is at or close to the top of that list. Nothing says New York quite like a hot dog and not just any hot dog, but New York's own Nathan's Famous.OK, yeah you can find Nathan's in numerous places these days and the prices can be absurd for an original hot dog ($4.75) with nothing on it. In addition, honestly, the frozen ones you can buy at a market are just as good for a fraction of the price, but if you're into the experience of visiting the original location, then by all means go for it and make a day out of it at the boardwalk too.However, besides just hot dogs, Nathan's has a very wide menu of other items, like burgers, sandwiches, tenders, chicken wings, but who are you kidding? You're here for a dang hot dog .. and probably some of their famous crinkle cut fries! And if you don't want a plain hot dog, they have a collection of numerous Heinz condiments right outside, including your everyday ketchup, mustard, radish and mayo. In addition, they also sell cheese dogs, chili cheese dogs and corn dogs on a stick, if you're into any of them. And the same goes for your crinkle cut fries that can be topped with cheese, chili cheese or even bacon cheese.As for seating, there are outdoor tables shaded by umbrellas to the side of the institution. For first-timers, just be prepared for the waits, especially in the summer. However, during the rest of the year, especially in the fall and winter, the area tends to be relatively quiet, but then you wouldn't be getting the whole Coney Island experience.","Update: some time the service can be down right annoying. I waited 30 min in a line only to have a new line open and people him rushed and waited 10 seconds. I will say even though toasted lobster roll was a soggy mess, I liked it and will probably get everytime(I love lobster). Shrimp basket is now my go to instead of clam basket. More flavor. Had a dozen large raw clams for $15. Good, but I'd do the small neck next time. Obviously Nathan's is a staple of Coney Island. But there really is something special when you can see a heard of beach combers ordering and still be serviced within minutes. I love the clam basket. Shrimp are solid, chilli cheese dog on point(although I don't come here anymore for chilli dogs). I've always found a seat with shade, I always enjoy the fried food, and Goodness gracious a large beer is large as fuck. Win.","Obviously Nathan's is a staple of Coney Island.

I'm still going to come back to check our more of the menu, but was a bit underwhelmed with my first experience.","This place is bad where the coffee is concerned. The staff is very bad at producing the core product, the owner micro-manages everything and everyone, and most of the staff are completely unprofessional. I had to wait in line for five minutes while a cashier complained about her rent to a person who had already completed their transaction and was also trying to leave. Don't waste your hard-earned money in this place. There are way better options within a block radius.","The cold brew was light, practically iced tea. I didn't like their blend at all. Sandwhich took 30 minutes to make, which isnt communicated by the establishment. So if you value your time and want good coffee I'd steer clear of this place. Over-priced and disappointing.","Excellent espresso drinks, pastries and sandwiches made to order. Plenty for vegetarians and vegans. I especially recommend the beet humus wrap! They make the most out of a narrow space with tables for two, and there's a nice courtyard in the back (not accessible). Wear insect repellent!Gender neutral restroom. Friendly service, and pay cash if you can, though they don't make a fuss about cards.It's not the easiest area for parking, but there's excellent public transit!","I love roots! As a remote worker, I love dropping in to work. The WiFi is great. The sandwiches are also delicious. My only complaint is that I once ordered a sandwich and they substituted the ingredients and didn't tell me.","While I haven't tried their food yet, they make a good cold brew.

I ordered a veggie roti and the dark skin girl who was serving me was so rude! She got mad because I asked for tamarind and pepper sauce at the end and not in the beginning when I first ordered. She was rolling her eyes, shaking her head and mumbling. Then when she finished wrapping my order and basically threw my wrap towards the cashier to BAG IT.

Some of the servers can be rude but that's typical for a Caribbean restaurant.,First time purchasing food from here...lets just say it came up short. It was salty I realized by the first bite. Got a boneless chicken roti and a regular chicken. The channa or garbanzo beans were hard in both.,"Been here many times to try many items on their menu. It changes a little bit depending on the daily specials, which is very much appreciated to not get bored. I loved just about everything I tried here and will keep coming back.It's not a sit down place even though they've got counters by the window to eat. It's more of a take out place to stop by on the way home with hot food. They take all the credit cards, which makes payment convenient. There's a line 9 out of the 10 times I went so be ready to wait a little to order.A few things I found unique and special about this place.- Dumplings are big blocks. Reminds me of taro cake in shape and texture, but not taste.- They have bakes (which are a breakfast sammich if you're new to them like me), super tasty with their tamarind (I think) sauce.- Oxtail meat always falls off the bone  - Their paintings are charming.",Goat curry roti was bursting with flavor. They use bone in goat so super flavorful meat. Perfect for take out since no tables and chairs. Staff could try to be a little nicer.,"There is a feeling I get when I want Caribbean food. It is a craving that is often times unfulfilled. I was attempting to ignore this request, but succumbed to the need of cultural healing. Came here to get a boneless chicken roti. One thing to pay attention to. Know what you want and be ready to order. It was served quickly, the customer service is... I can't really say. There was no small talk. But there was also no need for it. Tell them what you want. let them wrap it up, bag it. pay and go. They used to have  a cash only policy but they seemed to accept card now ( $10.00 Minimum FYI)It was cool. Nothing big, nothing bad. Hence my rating. I was satisfied but nothing more. I feel like a recipe might have changed or the portions switched as well. The price went up but the quality didn't ( I've been dining here for years now on and off) I think the next time I'm craving Caribbean food, I might consider going to a different space.  Hopefully that real craving returns for here but for now it was just ok.",Bake and Things
652,"So I come to this place based on all the great yelp reviews...and where I can see why people liked this place...my experience was less than stellar.  I was exhausted after a long day of work and was excited to just pick up some good food and relax. Unfortunately, while the food looked and tasted good, I left confused and felt like I got ripped of. My problem with this place centers around one thing....transparency/confusing pricing! When I came in the door, I told then it was my first time and that I didnt know how everything worked there. In response all he said was it was by weight and he also the pointed a broad describing a vague description of a list of many items under the heading lunch special (mind you this was dinner time). So anyways, I have been to pay by weight places before like whole foods hot bar and figured it would be fine. The was a dumb assumption. There was no prices at all listed. I got some couscous, mushrooms and some steak. They then heated the food in the microwave and gave it to the cashier...I was so tired and not thinking...I just handed over my credit card and paid...when I sat down I looked at the receipt anld saw that this small, take out, microwaved meal cost me $18. See my picture.  Furthermore, it was not weighed at all. I am so confused on how this all came about. It was awkward to go back to the counter with half eaten food and I was already ehausted. I just didnt have the energy to go back up through the small line of people and question it. Again the food was good, but I left with a bad taste in my mouth (metaphorically).","Amazing homemade food! I'm obsessed with their meat grape leaves! They are made exactly how my Thata used to make them!! Yum! I'm also now obsessed with their large spinach pies! No milk, no butter in either! Omg! To die for!",This place can literally just take all my money. I'm serious. I'll work just to eat here everyday.,"What a gem. HOMEY food. You can really tell they make this food fresh and with LOVE!!I would say it's a nice fresh middle eastern style food. Lots of vegetarian varieties. But also Lamb at times, chix cutlets etc They also make awesome falafel sandwiches. Prices are middle to on the higher side. But you really are getting quality food. I try to get here 1-2 x every couple weeks. Friendly counter people they'll let you sample pretty much anything.","The Family Store is a Bay Ridge institution. They've been in the neighborhood for years and are one of my favorite spots in the area. They have sandwiches, lots of salads and prepared food, groceries, and drinks, and with the wide variety of options, there's something for everyone. While they do have a few seats, almost everyone takes the food to go.With the exception of a few sandwiches, every meal that I've gotten there probably breaks the $10 mark, but the quality of ingredients is good, and the dishes taste like they were made in a neighbor's kitchen. My favorite thing to get is the lunch bowl ($10.99), also a great thing to get if it's your first time there so you can try more things at once, since it includes a protein, grain, and vegetable. The combination I get most often is with turkey meatballs, mujaddara (lentils and rice), and chicory with caramelized onions, but all of the vegetable dishes and salads we've had have tasted healthy and delicious. I'm always discovering new things I like, such as the eggplant bruschetta and Irish sea moss smoothie from my last visit, both excellent. Can't wait to keep trying more things and finding new favorites!",I was at a doctors appointment and the wait was long and I was starving! Went on yelp searched nearby food and discovered this gem!! Authentic home made food. I come from a home that everything is home made so I could taste different food quality. Food quality is great. I'm vegetarian and the guy who worked there showed me all options ( plenty) I got a mix of different things. In reality I wanted to taste everything. It all looked so good. Glad I found this place.

653,"Not at all impressed with our meal here. Salads were fairly basic and over dressed.  The veal dishes we ordered lacked any depth of flavor and the meat was quite chewy.  Also be careful about making any substitutions. When I asked to switch out the mashed potatoes for the pasta that came with certain other dishes, I was told no problem and received a small portion of linguine on my plate. Surprisingly the bill showed an up charge of $4 without the waiter ever mentioning anything. Not a good business practice in my opinion.  Won't be coming back.","Top Italian in nyc. are you kidding me?Lamb chops medium rare means pink not dark brown so they went back and came out second time even browner. What did you do , throw them back in the oven and see if they would lighten up. 8 people 800 bucks but  for this price you expect the chocolate molten cake to have a little molten. No chance - not even a drizzle just a little cream in the middle. Not terrible but there are hundreds of better Italians in nyc.  Sadly Williamsburg still fails on the food front again.","This place should be renamed the Italian Daycare because of the amount of families who overload the restaurant with screaming children. If you're planning a date or a group of adults who actually want to enjoy your ambiance, stay out of here for dinner. Before you dismiss this as a stroke of bad luck -- I spoke to the hostess if it was always filled with so many families with young children & she said yes, but typically dies down after 9.  Well, whoopty-do. It's a shame because otherwise when you look at pictures, the interior looks like it should be a restaurant for couples. It's not. It caters to families.The food is average so the ridiculous distractions that were allowed to carry on by management will keep me from every coming back. There are simply too many Italian options to have dinner ruined.I ordered the lobster ravioli and just as I was impressed by the lobster chucks, the sauce left me majorly underwhelmed. My boyfriend ordered chicken and he thought it was just OK but there was no consistency with the tastes - so bites dry, some bites moist, some tasted overwhelmingly lemony others had no taste. Not sure how the kitchen accomplished this - maybe they were distracted by all the kids screaming in the dining room.My Pinot noir was terrible. Not a great wine selection. I always finish my wine and couldn't finish this one. Shame.","Came for dinner and drinks with my cousins and had a great time. Service was quick, warm, and polite. They made us great martinis - extra dirty with blue cheese olives, just like we like them! Highly recommend the burrata for an appetizer, the calamari was so-so - lots of breading, but if you like that then go for it.One of my cousins ordered the brown butter/sage gnocchi special and that was delicious - definitely order if they have it! Rich but the portion isn't too huge. I got the Cavatelli Bolognese and it was DELICIOUS - good meat to sauce ratio and I loved the whipped ricotta (rather than parmesan, etc.). It was a nice take on a tried and true classic. Not too expensive and great for a midsize, somewhat loud group like ours.",Beautiful Day Beautiful Restaurant! Citrus Arugula salad with fresh fried calamari plus chicken with artichokes in a lemon butter sauce.Aperol spritzer and your love sharing this amazing lunch with you..... Nothing in public gets better then this !!!!Go and enjoy ....,I've ordered delivery and been to the restaurant and both times the pasta was incredible. The best carbonara I've ever had. Decent lasagna but my favorite pasta of all time is the cavatelli bolognese. I tell everyone I know to go here because the pasta was so memorable for me. I have yet to try their other dishes though. Oh and the tiramisu was very good too.,La Nonna Ristorante & Bar
654,Really small portions. Significantly more expensive than Sakura. I'd only go back if I was in the area and absolutely starving and had no way of getting to another sushi spot!,"Went there with my wife for her birthday. We ordered sushi for 2 ($36), when it came it looked like sushi for 1. The flavors were ok but the amount of rice under each piece of fish was very VERY POOR, I have never been served sushi in portions so RIDICULOUSLY SMALL. Last time I checked, rice is the cheapest ingredient of sushi, it makes absolutely no sense to serve SO LITTLE.I don't know about most people but when I go out to eat I like to feel full by the time I leave, I don't care much about the price as long as the portions are generous, or at least normal size. We left Akaru feeling hungry!!!!I felt embarrassed for taking my wife there and I had to apologize to her.Also, the A/C was not doing much on a 90 F day, I was sweating!!!.Not a good experience, NOT COMING BACK! To the chef: dude! put twice as much rice under each cut of fish, and blast the A/C.","Sushi we're not so good, yeah ingredients are ok, but it was not so tasty and not big potions.","Akaru is my absolute favorite sushi place. It's local to my apartment, and I eat there at least once a week (whether it's delivery, pickup, or dine-in.)Their chefs are wonderful. The hostesses and waitresses are so thoughtful, vigilant, and accommodating. I like to come here by myself on a tough day and have some really good sushi. I usually go home feeling much happier. I also order here to celebrate things! It's good for every occasion.The food is delicious and affordable. I will always recommend this restaurant.",Wow the smallest maki rolls I have ever seen! My shrimp tempura roll was about 4 inches & cut into tiny like half inch pieces. What the hell! Usually a shrimp tempura roll is supposed to be a struggle to eat but not this one! Could pop in your mouth like popcorn! After 20 bucks I'm still hungry & now hangry. I didn't even order any combination specials I ordered each roll separate. --Minus one star because of the ridiculously small rolls--Minus another star bc the delivery guy just sat on his bike & didn't bother to even come up to my front door. --Minus another star because I'm still hungry The little sushi did taste good though! Just don't eat here if you are really hungry.,"Great sushi and sashimi combo! For $49 it has a lot of sush and sashimi and two rolls! The sashimi cut was very generous with the portion and fresh!  It also come with two miso soup and two salads.When we don't want to fo to Manhattan, this is Our go-to Sushi place in Ridgewood!",Akaru Sushi
655,My least favorite of the Patrizias so far. I heard rumors going on that this place isn't good. So I already had the negative mindset already and people were right. The food just isn't the same as it is at their Williamsburg location or their Staten Island location for that matter. Parking is absolutely disasterous over here. Skip this place and go to one of their other locations if you crave it. I felt also you got more in the family style at other places as well.,This is not like the other locations. We should have paid the toll and gone to Staten Island.  If you've been to any other locations you will be disappointed. The atmosphere and food are completely different.,I give them one star cause I have to ...this review is to their valet guy that stole my AirPods very nice of u to dig thru my glove box and find my AirPods and take them as part of your tip since the $5 I gave u wasn't enough ...just remember what goes around comes around ....,"Vero good food and very friendly people ,Highly reccomend.Real italian food !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Grazie Mario and all the staff!!!!!!",Absolutely outstanding meal .  Came here as a planed thing for weeks and it was nothing short of amazing.  Thank you to the entire staff for making the most amazing experience and wonderful food.Rvteddyp,"What a wonderful dining experience!  I was absolutely blown away by the quality of the food and the great service that was provided by this place. Let me break it down for everyone.The place was packed as we arrived.  This is definitely a great place for large groups.  Many of these groups were celebrating birthdays. Wonder how I know this?  Because every time there was a birthday being celebrated, the whole restaurant erupted in music and the whole wait staff came over to sing.  After the 6/7th time, it became a bit much, but still very funny. I was in a party of four, celebrating no special occasion, but I felt as if we were just as important to the wait staff as the other people who were dining.  We were immediately greeted and our drink orders were jotted down.  We didn't have to study the menu for too long because we all quickly agreed to go family style.  Course after course of deliciousness and all for $60 which included your choice of wine, sangria, or beer.  This deal is literally a steal! Here is a run down of every course:1) Italian Bread, Focaccia Bread, Bruschetta, Burrata, Eggplant Parmigiana, Artichoke Contadina - Each plate had more than enough for four people.  Highlight of this course was the Eggplant Parm.  Four huge slices of eggplant topped with mozzarella cheese and smothered in sauce. Again this was only the FIRST course.  2) Fried Calamari, Baked Clams & Grilled Baby Octopus - My rule of thumb is you can always judge an Italian restaurant by the fried calamari.  Theirs was on point.  Crispiness was perfect while the calamari was buttery and soft and not at all rubbery.  Baked clams were EXACTLY as they should be, small with the whole clam inside.  The baby octopus was tender and delicious.  3) Lobster, Mussels - If you were not satisfied with your first round of seafood (which I don't know why you wouldn't be), you will be with this.  Lobster, from the tail to the claws piled on a mound of mussels.  But wait...there is more!4) Homemade Pasta - Not quite tortellini, but mini pasta pouches with cheese smothered in a pink sauce.  This was probably my favorite course.  5) Skirt Steak & Lamb Chops - Skirt steak was a perfect medium.  Seasoned well and tender as anything.  The lamb chops stole the show as being super flavorful.6) Coffee & Dessert - As we completed the meal a dish of several desserts including tiramisu and several pastries.  At this point I was about to explode and could only take a bite of one pastry but it was worth it.  Again, all of these courses were presented family style.  I chose to pair my meal with Sangria which was very complimentary.  Throughout each course the wait staff was attentive and kept checking on us.  we were even offered to wrap things up as we couldn't finish  some of the meal. Finally all of this was for $60 a person!  How could you beat that?",Patrizia's Of Sheepshead Bay
656,"Do not go here. I have gotten horrible food poisoning from this place. I tried the seafood soup  and it had one of the worst experiences in my life (vomiting, diarrhea). The food wasn't even good. Sad excuse for Korean food. The so I also had the burger and it was overly charred.STAY AWAY",It was okay. I'm definitely not being rude but they sent us with a wrong order. My husband and I were looking forward to the Dol Sot Bowl. But ended up with the other one without the egg. Just kind of stinks because that's why we ordered.My chicken was so spicy too. My husbands was good even though it wasn't the right bowl. Oh well,"Tofu soup had cheap taste, a lot of tofu but very oily. The kimchi inside was nothing special. Ingredients haven't been cooked all together. I ate few spoons and left most of the soup. Chicken was ok but kinda salty but I guess it matches the taste of Americans. I had such better Korean fried chickens in Korea. I was disappointed.","I got the double Bulgogi burger with two big patties, egg, cheese and bacon Mmmmmm. It was a total blessing. I want to try more delicious things on the menu.","great prices and great food :) I've only ordered the bulbap burrito, but every time I've ordered it, it has been very tasty. The Korean-American fusion is great. The restaurant is nice and clean, has very interesting lighting. It's conveniently located near the G train so whenever I'm hungry and have to go home I hop on the G home. overall, the food is great. The environment is great and the location is also very great. However, the one bad side is that the food takes some time to be prepared. I have to wait 10-15 minutes for one burrito sometimes.","Amazing ambiance. The food was amazing and so was the service. I can't say how great the food was. We ordered the soy garlic wings with the dolsolt bibimbap and the galbi bibimbap. The wings were okay, my only tiny complaint was that the wings were not crispy enough. The two bibimbaps were amazing. Especially the hot stone one, I highly recommend it. And so did my date, who kept stealing bites.",Bulbap Grill
657,"I had by far on of the worst experiences here. As i enter the security guard asked me to button my shirt. I had a undershirt and a button down short sleeve dress shirt. I was completely covered and he still asked me to button my shirt, so i did. I expressed how unnecessary that was based off the environment and other people's attire, whose was actually revealing. As i walk away the security guards trips me purposefully. This is where it gets really bad.I speak to someone from the staff, and the staff person goes to record the surveillance camera on her phone brings it and says ""he didnt do it on purpose"". Him tripping me was intentional, childish, unprofessional and extremely hateful. When she saw that i was not going to allow her to Insinuate that it was ""an accident"" she yelled, ""Now IM, not gonna let you in, goodbye"" Disgusting, bigots, DONT GO HERE unless you like judgy atmospheres, to be mistreated by the security, and disgustingly rude staff. NEVER GO HERE, PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT HATEFUL/JUDGMENTAL BUSINESSES. Going here was one of the worst experiences of my life. The staff are clearly miserable and that must reflect in their food. DISGUSTING, DISGUSTING, DISGUSTING","Lets start by saying this place has so much potential for so much more. This restaurant gave me beauty and Essex vibez and I loved the decore. I came in on a Tuesday around 9pm and had to wait almost 30 mins for a seat (not a first good impression especially because I saw so many empty seats on the first floor)My party of 3 was brought upstairs to be seated. Lol I called it the party floor because downstairs was more mellow and upstairs the music was bumping and pretty good. Our menu.... very limited (one page but literally like 10 items to pick from and that's including appetizers, meals and sides. 2 appetizers were sold out (calamari one of them) I was so disappointed because this was seafood night. We ordered quite a few options (seafood fried rice, seafood Mac and cheese, seafood platter, oysters, jerk wings)So the Mac and cheese was HORRIBLE, how can you mess that up, the cheese tasted disgusting (like a cheap brand cheese). My favorite was the fried rice and jerk wings. The seafood platter was decent but the lobster tail was tough and chewy. We did get shandy, corona and a rum punch (the rum punch was good)Overall between the long wait to be seated and the horrible Mac and cheese I would only come for the photo oops and music (just for the vibez)","This place decor is nice but everything else was horrible!!!!!!!!!!!! Music was actually nice but my meal was salty which was the curry goat roti. It was 7 of us,The waiter brought out 5 people order and forgot about the last two of us,after the 5 was finish eating and asked for Togo containers is when the waiter asked if everything was ok,then we had to wait 20mins extra for the last two of us to get our meals which was a waste of wait bc the food wasn't tasting good. FYI the place was empty on a Tuesday night so I don't understand why they was so slow.even the drinks took a while to come. This is my first and last time coming here,I wouldn't return or recommend others to go there.","Friendly folks, fabulous food and drinks, excellent music and atmosphere. The staff was amazing. The greeter was extremely nice and welcoming. The bartender was the most helpful in my drink and food order. I sat at the bar for food and drinks.","Yummm!!The food here is delicious.  Drinks are sweet, so I would rather stay neat or on the rocks but that's just me.  Expect to pay a premium.Our staff was also very attentive and sweet.  There are no pics of the food because we gobbled it. But the curry is delish and the perfect type of spices added, the whole fish was omg and yeah I will be back!",Came here to meet up with some ladies. The place is very nice. They have alot of comfy booths to sit in. They have bathrooms upstairs and downstairs.  There was a dj playing Saturday night when I came. For drink I had the Haitian earth. It wasn't too bad. For food I had the honey garlic wings and the toastones. Both were good. I would def reccomend this place when in the area for some Caribbean food.,Caribbean Social
658,"This is the only vietnamese restaurant that only gives 1 slice pork chop for the pork chop pho $11, A little overpriced. Had the 8 pc (large ) spring roll to share and they only give 1 dish of sauce.",wtf is this? NOT GOOD!! dont waste your money. it is the worst meal in NY. Stay away unless.you want to throw away money.,"Do not go here. At the very least, don't think this is a Vietnamese restaurant if you do.I grew up eating Vietnamese food. My mom cooked everyday and we lived in San Jose, which if you're familiar with it, is all I need to say.I had the vermicelli bowl with lemongrass chicken (bún gà nng) and my friend ordered the shaking beef (bò lúc lc). My noodles were dry and crunchy (huh?), the chicken was chicken, sure, but not lemongrass, and the sauce lacked the appropriate ratio of fish sauce, sugar, and lime juice (key!). His steak was cubed, yes, but it wasn't seared properly and was drowning in a dark sauce that had no place in the dish (WTF?). The best part of the meal -- and I'm reaching here -- was the iced coffee (càfe sa đá). However, it too lacked the correct ratio of sweetened condense milk, coffee, and water. The worst part was how much I paid for the damn meal -- $24! after tip and tax. I gritted my teeth as I signed the receipt while reassuring myself that I wasn't here for the food, I was here to spend time with an old roommate I missed.This was my last lunch before heading to JFK, head shaking, disappointed and depressed.","The best vietnamese restaurant I've ever been.The location is very convenient, if you are coming by subway, its next to F train, by car, its not that hard to find a parking spot and mostly free street parking.Service was good and fast, the restaurant looks very clean and neat.Grilled pork and thai ice tea is a must try.","I have always been a big fan of Vietnamese food and I find this restaurant to be one of the best. Staff is extremely friendly, its great for children and the food is dynamite.The portions are pretty big, everything is done close to perfection.  My favorite dish is the grill pork on top of rice.  Yum!","I never thought I would actually end up enjoying legit Vietnamese food in Park Slope but I do with this place. The food is delicious and always fresh. Stand outs include the pork chop over rice, Vietnamese fried rice, spring rolls (Cha Gio), and their rice vermicelli topped with grilled pork and spring rolls. Oh and the Vietnamese iced coffee...very strong but still delightfully sweet!...not overpoweringly strong like in most Vietnamese restaurants. My only complaint with Ha Noi is the portions. They're a smidge on the small side for the prices that they're asking for. I guess I'm used to larger portions for cheaper at the Vietnamese restaurants in China Town so I suppose this is normal for Park Slope. The rent must be astronomical so I'll give them a pass on this one. Ambience is cozy with outdoor seating during the warmer months. Staff is friendlier than most mid range Asian places in the area. Definitely a welcomed gem in the neighborhood.",Ha Noi Vietnamese Kitchen
659,"I went there early this afternoon around 1PM. WORST PASTA I HAD EVER HAD! I ordered the fettuccine alfredo pasta, and it tasted like it was made 4 days ago. The pasta was extremely hard and I found just big chunks of garlic in the sauce. The food was ready in 4 minutes with smoke just booming out of it, as if it was microwaved. When I told the server the pasta was hard, he simply said ""the pasta is made fresh everyday"". Not wanting to cause a fuss, me and my fiancé simply paid and left. I wasted over $50 on two disgusting plates of pasta. I have no idea why their reviews are so high!","I really wanted to love this place, but I ordered the shrimp and lemon pasta dish and it was kind of disappointing. The shrimp is definitely frozen (including the breading) and the sauce was underwhelming, I could tell that it is some kind of pre-made sauce, I would bet that not even one real lemon was used. It has a cute homey feel, but the food was not up to par, unfortunately.","My husband and I decided to take our 3 friends who were visiting from Pittsburgh to Mama Maria's on Saturday night. When we got there, we wanted to confirm that we could order pizza from their restaurant Sal's next door. After much confusion from the waiter, we were told that we could. After giving us a few moments to decide, a young waitress approached the table for our order. It was 3 chicken parm dinners, a small pizza and a medium pizza. She told us that it would be a long time until we got our food because they made everything fresh. We asked how long and she replied 20 minutes, which in our minds was not long at all. The 1 chicken parm and both pizzas were brought out within 15 minutes. However, we were left waiting for the other 2 chicken parm dinners. When we asked, both the waitress and waiter seemed very confused. We found out that she had only ordered the table 1 chicken parm dinner. They asked begrudgingly if we would like to order them at that point. And since so much time has elapsed, we chose not to. They never once apologized or offered a free app or dessert. And when I told them that they hadn't even brought us the bread and olive spread that always accompanied dinners, he flippantly said sorry. They were extremely rude and out bill was over $70 for a dinner and two pizzas. Nothing was outstanding. And the service was abhorrent. We were embarrassed that we had brought guests there and I can promise that we will never go there again, nor would we ever recommend it to anyone else.","I'm a huge fan of kitchen nightmares and have been wanting to go here for a long time. Finally came with my girlfriend and it's come very far since. The dining room, while not very busy, made it definitely feel romantic with the low lighting. We started with the prosciutto e mozzarella appetizer, everything tasted fresh and delicious. For our main courses, she got the rigatoni alla vodka and I got the ricotta cavatelli. That might be one of the best Italian dishes I've ever had and we both grew up in places with great Italian cooking. Needless to say, next time I'm in Brooklyn, I am coming back to eat again. Job well done!!","I have to say, I was really let down by this restaurant.... I am always really hesitant to write negative yelp reviews because I know everyone needs to make a living, but the pasta I had here was just awful. I ordered the pasta special tonight which was squid ink fettuccine with calamari and clams. I was really looking forward to having a nice Italian meal, and the photos people have posted on here in the past as well as the 4 star rating made me believe this place was promising. However, I did not realize that most of the appetizing photos on here are from several years prior. The dishes here are somewhat expensive, and yet the quality of the food is not on par with the price point. All of the seafood in my pasta was obviously frozen, as it was rather chewy and smelled fishy. Additionally, my squid ink fettuccine was bland, flavorless, and even the texture was not tight. Squid ink pasta is one of my favorite dishes because of the richness of the pasta, and this fettuccine was nothing like any of the squid ink pastas I have had before. It's comparable to the squid ink spaghetti noodles you can buy at Trader Joe's. For those of you who have watched Kitchen Nightmares, it is obvious that this restaurant has reverted back to its poor practices of serving food that has been frozen. I could have cooked a much better meal myself, and I have only been cooking for about a year or so now. My friend and I had decided to treat ourselves to a nice pasta dinner because it was Friday and we both had long weeks. We were really looking forward to eating something yummy, and this experience was such a disappointment. Not only did we both have incredibly mediocre meals, but we also wasted a significant amount of money on them.I will say, the restaurant is very cute and they do have a great wait staff.","Great job keeping up with the quality of the food. The best part of the meal was the shredded cheese that melted on contact with the pasta, it was heavenly. The Waitress was nice and attentive to the customers . Gordon Ramsay would be proud !",Mama Maria's Restaurant
660,"Mixed grilled $100 was completely disaster,no taste, feel like half cooked cold raw meat. Please never waste your $100 to order mixed grill as it has no taste ,even not enough for 4 people.I suggest you to go for individual platters to enjoy more food range from  $10 to $18 mostly for each platter.  kumpir and chicken parmihiana was really good. And they add Grattuity $33 on the top of taxes. It was very bad experience as I told manager that Mixed grilled $100 was cold and uncooked but he didnot pay attention and charged us full amount.  When I ordered kampir than manager who take order ,he refused me to place order for kampir as it was soo much busy and he said kampir is finished, but later after 10 min, I saw kampir was served on girls tabel and than I told them how you can this to me,than manager apologize and place kampir order.It was very disappointed expereince.","Mixed grilled $100 was completely disaster,no taste.

They put no effort in. Tasted like someone took it out of the trash im very shocked with all the good reviews you would think they would some effort in to making the easiest dish. I would never complain but after taking one bite I had to throw it out. It wasn't even edible that's how bad. I ordered once before and the Mac and cheese looked and tasted like something out of a microwave. Never again ! Do not recommend.,"Came here for a brunch in a group of 6. We opted to sit by the windows because it was beautiful out, and the windows open all the way allowing fresh breeze, and a view of the water. Once we were seated, our waiter came over to take our drink order and provide us with fresh Turkish bread and white sauce. We had a few different waiters help us throughout our entire meal. We ended up staying for a total of 4 hours because of how is immaculate the service was! There's plenty to do besides eat. We chatted, smoked hookah, and enjoyed tea and dessert. We each ordered different foods. Brunch was still going on so a few of us ordered that. The salmon Benedict was a hit among our group. I opted for the Yengen, which I've never had before! It was delicious, with just the right amount of cheese, and it came with a generous helping of seasoned fries. We ordered a hookah to share among us after our meal. The waiters brought us fruit and tea to make us feel comfortable. The pricing is so reasonable considering the atmosphere, service, and food quality. Seyithan and Yeetz were amazing I cannot describe it enough. They are the main reason we will be back so soon, they truly make you feel like no one else is there, and their hospitality was above and beyond!!!!!!!",This is my favorite place best view best food best hookah And the most important thing that they have the best service The people work their they are always helpful and sweet specially specially Yasin ... he always help us a lot and if we have birthday he makes the whole place happy I really recommend this place,"Dining while black experience...It started off well. Atmosphere was great and food was tasty. Food came out in good timing. The server took our order in good timing. However, after the food came out the customer service seemed to go downhill from there. Here are some tips from what was lacking:  1. Check on your table to see how the food is meeting their satisfaction and anything in addition that they may want to add.  2. Once plates are taken away ask if they would like the dessert menu. 3. If no dessert bring the DAMN check!!!!   We stayed an additional 30-45 minutes while the server bounced table to table after we were done eating just waiting for him to come to our table. Then we asked some other staff walking by...No check!!!! Lastly, asked another who brought the check, quickly left and never came back with the change. We had to go find him to finally leave the restaurant. As nice and laid back as this establishment may be we will not be returning. No need to invest in an establishment that don't respect your time or business.",Rocca Cafe Lounge
661,"Overpriced is what I would describe this place. Food are basic yet the prices are high. Seriously, you're just capitalizing on kids that get hungry after playing at a nearby water park, sand park and playground. I don't mind paying but just serve the food that's equivalent to your price.",Pros:Nice viewsRooftopServiceAmbience (lively)Cons:Long wait for foodCrowded (but hey it's Summer),"Super disappointed in my second trip to Fornino. My boyfriend and I raved about this place in the past and decided to return with both our moms. We ordered inside, got a number, and grabbed a table outside. We waited. And waited. And continued to wait. No pizza. Meanwhile new patrons around us were receiving their food even though arriving much later than us. Eventually we went inside and asked what was going on. The staff had no idea what to do and seemed completely confused. Finally they found a manager who came over to our table. No apology. He just simply said, ""We looked for you upstairs."" We found this ridiculous considering we were told we could sit anywhere - up or down. Our pizza arrived five minutes later. And to make it all even better-2 of the 3 pizzas were ice cold, clearly having sat somewhere for quite awhile. They didn't have the courtesy to even warm them back up. And they didn't give us a discount on our bill. Terrible customer service.",Really loved this open air on top lookout to the beautiful skyline of NYC and the brooklyn bridge. The drinks were good. We ordered sangria for our table and two pizzas. They have long tables which is good for big groups. As wells as they have separate areas to order your food and drinks. The atmosphere encourages good conversation as well as the music playing in the background is not too loud. We were there on a friday night and the place was packed but we were still able to find seating for a group of six. Would definitely be back at this spot.,"So we came to Fornino with friends to hangout. It's very close to the pier 5 and thus seems like easily the best option.Positives 1. Seat yourself. Many large tables for big groups 2. The vibe is great - music, rooftop styleI think the pizza is abit salty and overpriced","Our favorite pizza place in Brooklyn. Whats not to like about it! Decent wood oven pizza (1-star) and a great outdoor dining with a view of Manhattan (1-star). We love taking our friends here who aren't from the neighborhood because its such a nice location to walk to on Pier 6 with the parks, water and sporting activities.This is a counter service location so you cant expect staff to engage with you too much. Its the interactions and brief conversations when ordering that I have rated their customer service with 3-stars. The bartenders are usually happy to have a quick chat and they are always happy to help. Plus they are quite efficient by taking your order when they are finishing off another customer drink. I love efficient hospitality workers! The floor staff are usually pretty helpful and are quick to clear tables (which can be in high demand). There is a separation between where you order the food and where the bar is which I think works really well for speed of service. While there is nothing amazing about the service to stand out, its pretty much spot on for what you need in a location like this. Its casual dining with a view at its best!One current negative is that their beer lines need to be cleaned or some kegs have turned because some of their beers currently taste like sour orange juice. I pointed this out and my beer was replaced. They were aware of this so personally, I would rather them take off the line than sell a bad product. But that's just my opinion having run bars in the past. Wont deduct and stars for this because this should be fixed soon. Fingers crossed it does.",Fornino
662,"This place is a last resort, for when there are literally no other restaurants and you're desperately craving Vietnamese food or a bubble tea. I had the grilled chicken vermicelli bowl. They give you a number and you have to pick up your food at the counter. You have to ask for water (served in a small paper cup) and bus your own tray, so why did I leave a tip? It's a red flag when an order comes out too quickly. I could tell that the food had been sitting around for a while: everything was dry, the chicken was full of gristle and cartilage (I was scared to bite into it), the lettuce was wilted, the meager cucumber slices were bitter. Perhaps if everything had been prepared fresh, it might have been a different story. This is no way to grow a fanbase. Service was disappointing, like the employees don't actually care about the customer at all. The table and seating area was also filthy, lots of bits of food, flies buzzing around. I came in with an open mind and left disappointed. I continue my search for a favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Park Slope.","Food was gross, nothing was fresh. I came in for lunch today and I regret everything. It should have been a dead giveaway that all the accolade stickers on the front window are years old, referencing outdated Zagat reviews and dubious TripAdvisor commendations. Perhaps this restaurant was good once. Certainly not any more. Another bad omen: the menu is very Americanized. Instead of using Vietnamese terminology, the subheadings are in English. I ordered a bowl of beef pho ($10.50) and hoped for the best. The food was quickly prepared. I requested extra jalapeño and cilantro, which I received, despite some bad service. Unfortunately, the jalapeño slices were dried out, the cilantro wilted and brown. Not very appetizing. The pho itself was less than mediocre. I've never seen red onions in a bowl of pho before; didn't fit the flavor profile. The broth, while inoffensive, was weak. The beef combination--I detected brisket, tripe, and rare steak--was okay. The green onions were old and off-putting. It's sad when the best part of a bowl of pho is the bean sprouts. The restaurant was dirty and the service was bad. I would not recommend this establishment to anybody.","The Bahn Mi varies depending on the day. Bread is hit or miss. Never a consistent experience at this location. The service is quick and they do seem organized however. With respect to customer service, the cashier in particular (young brunette), is incredibly rude. I've witnessed her strong body language on several occasions with customers, myself included. And don't DARE ask for an extra hot sauce. Literally rolls her eyes. I've stopped coming in because of this employee. Her attitude needs to go before this establishment  loses anymore business. I see there are several others here that have also experienced her unnecessary wrath. Date visited: Friday 5/3/19 @ 2:45pm","- Best Banh mi sandwich I've ever had (favorite is vegetarian chicken). Baguette is perfectly toasted, soft on the inside & crispy outside.- Best Bubble Tea I've ever had (favorite is Taro). Bubbles are just soft enough and sweet enough. The place is insane after school let's  out, because, if you haven't heard, this dark, dank space is the newest hang out for the teen set. It's the cruising main st of my suburban upbringing, it's the mall, the ...you get the idea. So unless you love teenagers or are an anthropologist or a pedophile, stay away between 3-5 PM on weekdays.The back 1/2 of the place is usually very dark, good for hiding.","Obviously I've been here so many times I must love it so much. Yes I do love their food. They're awesome. I'm giving three stars for cleanliness and lack of ventilation. The bathroom is full of disgusting graffiti I'm wondering how the owners could tolerate such?? The tables and overall area are rickety and old. I mean can you please make the seating area pleasant? As for ventilation, it gets so smoky it's hard to breathe sometimes. When we get out, the smell of food clings to every pore of our skin and clothes. Yuck! I hope management will address this mess.","I love me some Hancos. When it's hot, I want a bubble tea... taro, with milk. And a Vietnamese sandwich. When it's cold out, all I want is their pho, with extra cilantro and lime. Those are my go-to's when I'm in the mood for Vietnamese food on the go.I've had other dishes and they're also good - their vermicelli is super tasty. There are a couple of locations in Brooklyn - this one in particular has a decent amount of seating and there are a couple of window seats if you're lucky enough to snag one of them. So yes, if you're looking for a quick, solid, on the go meal, I'd highly recommend Hancos... and this location in particular. The staff is quick at placing your order and the location is a short distance from the F and G trains.",Hanco's
663,"THIS PLACE IS REPULSIVE.I went here with my sister & my guy friend. He paid for our drinks in cash as we were in the bathroom. There was $1 leftover from the total so we left it there as we had our drinks. We asked the bartender for a photo & he just immediately took it without us getting closer to lean in together for the picture. He couldn't care less & it was incredibly pathetic that he had that attitude. He obviously told his friend who was having a drink at the bar because as we got up to leave, (& my friend was adjusting himself to get more cash for an ACTUAL tip) a CUSTOMER at the bar held up his arms saying we can't leave a $1 tip on our bill (which he knew the exact total so you know the gross bartender told him). My friend had to tip more just so the guy would let us pass. Disgusting. I can't believe people are this bold & rude in 2019. Hope this place holds their customers up to higher standards or closes soon. Don't care either way because i'm never returning to this neighborhood bar & making sure no one I know does either. AVOID AT ALL COSTS IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOURSELF.",Incredibly rude staff. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait for a table and that we would be next to be seated. When an hour passed and I asked how much longer (in a very normal tone) I was told off in a very rude and passive aggressive way. We paid for our overpriced drinks at the bar and left.,"After going there for 2yrs, spending thousand dollars, the bartender demanded us (in a snobbish tone) to put away our laptops, despite it was a weekday afternoon and literally no other customer was there, except us. When we pointed this out, he shrugged and asked us to go somewhere else.","I was invited here for a meeting with some colleagues and we were joined by a local executive chef as well. I'm going to be honest, aside from the old fashioned that I ordered, I did not pick out any of the apps or entres for the table. When you're at a table with a very talented chef, my advice is to simply let him doing the ordering.. he did not disappoint. As we were eating, I even stated aloud ""I have no idea what I'm eating but everything is remarkable, thank you."" The service was outstanding, the vibe was cute and warm, and my drink was made perfectly. This is a great spot to catch up with some friends or even bring a special date. We were there late-ish (8pm) on a Thursday so the seating was pretty available however I can imagine it getting pretty packed after work or on a weekend, so plan accordingly.","Cute spot but underwhelming fare - at least, the burger certainly was. My colleague and I stopped by for dinner here after seeing the four-star rating on Yelp. We both were pretty hungry after a long train ride from DC, so we opted for burgers and some drinks. Drinks were good, but our burgers were so bland we left wishing we had held out our hunger a little longer to find another place to spend our money at. The bun was flimsy and felt as though it would fall to pieces at any moment, and the fries (additional $3 charge) were clearly overcooked. I'm sure the other menu offerings probably are better (hence the 4 stars), but they need to revamp their burger ASAP or take it off the menu.","I have to be honest - this place was a very big disappointment. My partner and I came here last night (Friday 8/15) around 8 PM and were seated promptly inside. We ordered our drinks quickly, but they didn't come to our table until about 8:20. This is usually fine, because I know what goes into a good cocktail and the drinks were good, BUT...We already knew what we wanted to order, but the servers were EXTREMELY inattentive and disappeared for very long periods of time. While it was fairly busy - it was mainly the bar, not the tables - and there were a lot of lulls. When we finally had the opportunity to order food (three appetizers, one ""entree"") - which occurred almost 40 minutes after we sat down - it then took ANOTHER 40 minutes to receive our mini plates. Now, mind you, there were MINI APPETIZERS we ordered. To be clear - we ordered mushroom toast (a small piece of bread with sauce and baby mushrooms on top), mini chorizo sausages (two pieces on a stick with a piece of pepper), and another piece of break with a slice of fresh, uncooked fish. Again - 40 minutes for three, quick made appetizers that weren't remotely satisfying. But, the drinks were good, so my partners decides he's still hungry and then ordered two more items - an eggplant/tomato/basil toast (which should NOT be priced at $17 - RIDICULOUS) and pimento fries. Guess how long that took? Another 30 minutes! And the waitress had to come over and ask ""Did you get your fries yet?"" Really? Are you paying attention?Now - the best part - we finish our food and ask for the bill. Guess how long that took? LESS THAN A MINUTE. Very poor service and very over-priced mediocre food. The only thing they have going is the drinks - at least the cocktails are delicious. A word of advice: Stick to just drinks at the bar.",Alameda
664,"DISGUSTING!!. The chicken quesadilla had no flavor whatsoever. The steak taco was awful zero taste n very fatty, the sauces were so watery, even the Guacamole was garbage - I won't be ordering from here again.","I made a seamless order from this place a few nights ago. I got a quesadilla without cheese. And was missing a order of guacamole .  When I called to let them know all the mistakes they said they would send out the missing items with a replacement quesadilla, but it never came. THEY LIED. The food we did get tasted of low quality and was WAY too salty. Could of ordered from one of those Asian run tex-mex places and got 5 times more food for the money and would of tasted better too..",2 stars for the coronas and vegan options. but there's no way i paid $11 for nachos and they only came with 5 chips. SMD!,First time trying this place. Its a few blocks away from my place. Food is delicious! Nice ambience.......,"Incredible food and spectacular service! Last night was my first time eating there and the server made me feel like I was a regular. I ordered a jalapeño margarita with a vegan quesadilla with soyrizo. Both were incredible!! I love that they offer such an amazing vegan menu! Excited to go back and try other items, but honestly that quesadilla was so delicious I might just have to order it again!","This place was AMAZING.. 7$ margaritas which were nice and strong!!

I get extra pesto and dunk the sandwich in that sweet Italian goodness. I would recommend going in person and not doing delivery.Knocked off a star for 3 dollar delivery fee which is aggressive and the fact that they are late sometimes.,"Drove all the way from jersey to se what the hype was all about. And let me tell you. I'll literally pay the 20$ in tolls, cross 3 bridges and spend gas to eat here everyday. I don't usually right reviews but this was worth it. Not only is food bangin but spoke to one of the worker (Miguel? I think it was...long hair) way she was running the business and made the experience personable with simple gesture of Shaking hands and offering an espresso while waiting for my large order. It's the little things. And they doin all of it. I'd give it 10 stars.

My sandwich was gooey on then inside and crispy toasted on the outside just like I like it. It was delicious and a great send off to my favorite city on the planet - New York..I will be doing a summer visit in August and I will once again hail my Uber back to JFK at the end of that trip from the curbside in front of Anthony & Sons Shoppe.","The FDNY hero hits the spot every time I come here. It is a delicious blend of breaded chicken and vodka sauce enveloped in melted cheese on freshly baked bread. I have yet to try the magnitude of other options, but am confident based on the FDNY that they will not disappoint.The items are fairly priced, and you can order via multiple apps.",It was my first time ordering food for this place I think I will do it again not bad at all. I got the healthlicious panini and a bacon cheeseburger with sweet potatoes fries. Prices are pretty affordable for the service. They closed at 10 pm m-f and 8pm on s-s..I try their bacon cheeseburger with Swiss cheese because I don't like American cheese and let me tell you I am very picky with my food! This was delicious definitely eating this again. Thanks Anthony,Anthony & Son Panini Shoppe

Food is decent, but I wouldn't make the trek to the area. And is Lavender Lake a euphemism for the Gowanus Canal?","Best burger I think I have ever had. Not kidding!  Absolutely delicious smash burger done to perfection.  Came with melted American cheese, caramelized onion, pickles. LL has the perfect setup and ambiance for a casual gathering, decent meal or hang out spot. There's a nice long zinc-type bar, tables for standing as well as sitting, expansive and pleasant outdoor patio with many picnic tables and seating options. There's even designated ""stroller parking"" and water bowls to accommodate  young families and dog owners. Very welcoming and inviting. It gets packed in here on weekends, wall to wall people, be forewarned.  But the food is great, (although a limited menu), the ambiance wonderful.","Absolutely horrible. I wish I can give this place no star!My friends and I came by a little before 8:00 PM and their outdoor area were already filled up with people - which is completely understandable. We came back in and had to seat ourselves. We were then given the menu with limited options - also fine because we were excited their happy hour menu is valid for the entire day (only Mondays).Before I talk about the drinks, I want to mention that once you place an order, they ask you for a credit card to hold. I am deeply confused by this... are they afraid customers will run out without paying the bill? This is completely unnecessary.Before I talk about the food, I want to talk about the way you order drinks. Alcoholic drinks AND soda must be ordered at the bar. I am not sure why soda needs to be ordered at the bar? It made no sense. They wouldn't even bring you the soda. We obviously did not order any drinks or soda.For food, we ordered (2) fish tacos, nacho with salsa, fried calamari, and fried chicken burger. First of all, please tell me why it takes FORTY-FIVE (45) MINUTES for the food to come out?! They weren't even that busy inside! Second of all, the food was completely disgusting and in the smallest portions EVER (see my pics). The nachos were not crunchy and they gave you so little salsa. The fish tacos came out to be extremely cold and the sauce was just gross. I couldn't finish it. The fried calamari was barely okay but again the portion was extremely tiny. The fried chicken burger wasn't fried... it was grilled. It was soggy and just tasteless.Onto the service... there is no service whatsoever. We interacted with the waiter ONCE (when we placed our order). He never came by to ask us how we're doing. This place can use some MAJORRR help from Bar Rescue. AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!",Love the vibe and environment. My dog loves coming here to meet other dogs and people. Drinks are a little pricey but worth it.,Lavender Lake
667,Randomly came across this place on yelp and couldn't believe all the reviews they had and all 5 stars?? (What what??) I decided to give it a try for brunch on a Saturday and boy were these reviews on point! The burger? BOMB! The truffle fries? BOMB!! The drinks?! BOMB!!,My go-to brunch spot in Queens! Service is always friendly here. I usually get the avocado toast because I'm boring but it never disappoints!I also love their margaritas/monitors. Really interesting flavors!,Ratings for this place has got to be rigged. Overall Rating: 2.75 Stars for average food and inexperienced staff.  Slightly odd and pretty underwhelming experience. Food: 3 StarsThere was nothing special about it.Service: 2.5 StarsGetting a table for 3 was a long wait because most of their tables are for couples and their largest table was held for a party of 5 or more.  Worst part is there's nowhere to wait besides in the heat outside or by the bar which is really reserved for drinking only.  We basically had nowhere to wait and saw a couple of empty tables around that they wouldn't seat us at.Atmosphere: 2.5 StarsIt was very cluttered and instead of using their  ACs on a hot summer day they had fans on resulting in unnecessary mugginess.  The servers would wiggle their way in between customers and often bumped into me instead of walking where there was more space.,"Lovely neighborhood restaurant with a late night kitchen. We will often show up close to midnight looking for dinner. The service has never faltered and the food has never disappointed in the past 3 years. We come in about 3 times a month. The staff are amazingly nice. We are often greeted with a ""hey guys!"" and a hand shake. The service is attentive and quick. The menu is simple, with lots of items to choose from: sandwiches, salads, burgers (yum!!), and nachos (my fav) just to name a few. I would describe the menu as wholesome, comfort food. The dishes are simple, without overly complex flavors and no fancy-shmancy sauces. BUT that does not mean the food isn't fantastic. It is very good, quality food with flavors that stand out. Also, they have a great tap list from local breweries and quality glasses of wine for under $10. We will continue to come here for our late night dinners.","September 2019 11/10! Thank you Jonathan and Geill? (sorry I misspelled your name) for this amazing meal! from ambiance to food, perfection! A restaurant with such good vibes are hard to come around and when it does, I have to keep telling people about it! The servers and customers there were so friendly in suggesting what's good in this tiny but cozy place in the hearty of Sunnyside, happy hours til 7pm. We had all the popular dishes like nachos, skirt steak lollipop, alcove burger with upgraded truffle fries, cuban sandwich, angus burger (when I actually meant to order alcove, either way, this is delicious as well), and the churros with mango sorbet. We also tried the margarita flight (included in HH!) with guava, passiofruit, pineapple and traditional flavors (shot glass sized), tamarind margarita, and blueberry beer! We all enjoyed our time there and I definitely would come back for more! Keep it up, The Alcove!","Our experience on Friday night was extraordinary! The 30 minute wait was more than worth it. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant, and looked around to see that the place was packed to the brim! All the other tables were taken along with all the seats at the bar. Usually in establishments where the owner is helping out it turns out to be a top notch place. Our waiter and our bartender were the owner's brothers, and we could clearly feel the passion behind their amazing service.To eat, we started with the patacones. As an avid meat eater, I loved that they added topped them with pork. To eat, I ordered the Chimichurri Truffle Fries. It sounds like a weird combination but it was actually very delicious. We also got the steak lollipops which were very well seasoned and tender.The grilled chicken tacos were a hit too. They have an amazing local beer selection, and offer margarita flights. After a long day of work there's nothing I wanted more than a margarita flight. The servings are small but definitely potent. I was also surprised to learn that it was my birthday that night. When I returned from the bathroom, the wait staff and the owner brought out warm churros and ice cream. They also belted out ""Happy Birthday"" in the best harmony I've ever heard. They were delicious and a great ending to our meal. The food was great and the hospitality was unforgettable. I can't wait to return!",The Alcove

Unfortunately I'm never in the neighborhood. However when I have my bi-yearly check ups, this will be the place I'll be stopping by.","I ordered the chipotle soup, guacamole, and cheese quesadilla. The delivery was timely and my order was correct. The soup was decent and so was the guacamole- minus the fact that it had a bit too much lime and citrus for my taste. The quesadilla however came with no lettuce or pico de gallo and was tasteless and cold when it arrived. It was to the point where I couldn't bring myself to eat it. Kind of sad to have wasted the money.",Im mexican and this is the worst burrito i have in my life and the quesadilla too i never buy again from this place again.Stop lying to all this gringos this is a mexican food.,Great tacos.Pretty basic menu and relatively fast service. I've always been here at off hours so I've been in and out quickly.Not super cheap but maybe that's New York.,So glad I found this place! It's your typical neighborhood tacqueria that you'd run to for a quick meal. They have a straightforward and pared down menu but they nail everything.The carnitas was cooked perfectly and went well with the green sauce. The chicken was also really good but the chorizo wasn't my favorite. Though all of them are objectively better than many overpriced tacos I've had in higher end restaurants. The highlight of the meal was the steak quesadillas. WOW. ORDER THIS. Huge portion and so satisfying. Priced well too! The steak was juicy and full of flavor and the quesadillas were stuffed to the brim with cheese. To die for - so so good with the sour cream and guac. Docking a star because the guacamole that comes with the chips is overpowered by the lime - it doesn't even taste like there was seasoning added. The salsa was also lacking flavor - it's watery and looks bland and tomato soup-y. Disappointing. Can't wait to come back though. Hope they relook at their chips and salsa special.,"I was treated here for a quick dinner on a Wednesday evening. Never heard of the place and actually didn't Yelp it until after we ate. I'm here to confirm that my fellow Yelpers were right... this place is legit, folks!I ordered the 3 taco special ($6.99). Went with steak because I was hungry and I love my beef. It was so good and had me reminiscing of my Cali days! I also got an aqua de pepino (cucumber juice). That was just okay.Really glad we found this spot. It's a tight squeeze inside, but clean with standard service. Good eats at a great price. What more can you ask for! I gotta come back.",Taqueria Santa Fe
669,"I've been ordering Turkish takeout food from Memo for many years. I've never considered them to be fine dining, but their food was usually hot and tasty and satisfying in a way that you would expect from a fast Turkish restaurant. A nice gyro sandwich, some kebabs, etc. However, I have to let the business owners know that for the past 2 years or so the quality of food has declined to such a poor extent that I can no longer order from this restaurant anymore. The prices aren't that cheap, so you would expect a better product, but Memo has been unable to deliver. My biggest complaint is the salad. It's not that the salad isn't fresh or not that good. It's that the produce is so bad that it actually tastes like poison. The cucumbers are bitter and metallic tasting and the tomatoes are mushy and white. Last night the rice was cooked in a damp way too. Their meat is still good so they get two stars. But overall it's been unacceptable and I hope someone reads this and does something about it.","Just ordered from this place and this happened to me ,bloody bandage in my food Most terrible experience i ever had Will never order again","So on my way home today I got two gyro pitas to go from Memo Shish Kebab on kings hwy.  When I got home and my husband and I went to open the pitas, it was the smallest thing I've ever seen and there was no meat except maybe 3 pieces at the very bottom (the meat was delicious I'll give them that). Absolutely pathetic to even serve something like this.  I miss Sahara.","PURCHASED: Lamb Gyro SandwichTOTAL: $7.95PROS:+ loaded lamb: They load up the lamb. It was full. The sauce that was put in was real good too (red and spicy). There was also a sort of Tzatziki that was so so so good. + clean location: The spot was clean and well lit. Windows covering the 2 sides (corner-front restaurant). CONS:n/a: can't say there was anything bad. However, I need more experience with Shish Kebab before rendering a fair judgement of this location. IMPRESSION:In my opinion, it was real good. The price is fair. They load up that lamb too. It's real good. I love lamb over beef, pork and chicken. I am certainly a fan.","I've been passing by this café for over 13 years, ever since moving in the area.

I have finally got an opportunity to visit and experience the hype one Thursday evening at 8pm.Very casual place--take out and quick dinning. Quick, simple, no frills service. Super casual atmosphere. We got the cheese filled phyllo dough cigars ($7.50)--my all-time favorite. Pretty well prepared here. Not the best I've ever had [could've used more cheese filling], but the interior was light and crunchy, and the overall taste was salty and satisfying.My bf got the lamb and chicken gyro on pita ($7) and I got the lamb gyro on homemade bread with +$1 for adding baba ghanoush inside my sandwich ($9.50). Both, the fresh pita and homemade bread was tasty and according to Turkish bread making standards. I don't eat bread, but these versions were worth the calories. The gyros themselves were not the best quality. The meat was not juicy nor tender nor fresh. Very dry sandwiches, just tomato and iceberg lettuce in addition to meat--definitely needed sauce. Not big portion. No sides included.We got the $5 kadayif to go. It was pretty dry, so wish we got the kunefe. Pretty wide variety of desserts to choose from, so this place makes for a good coffee/tee/dessert hangout spot. Paid $31.57 for the meal. Not the cheapest/best quality, so suggest coming to this place for dessert with Turkish tea/coffee.","First time over here dining in..... typical Turkish set up; you get to see the lamb & Chicken gyro meat spinning around; the kababs grilling right in front of you... also they have their raw variety of their kababs very nicely displayed for our viewing .....Also on the way to be seated you can't help to notice their desert display case which looked amazing.... I've been to many Turkish restaurants and they usually all have the same basic deserts but not here ...... amazing cake slices, these yummy looking roll up stuffed like cakes & some good looking puddings ..... ( sorry thought a took a picture, next time for sure.)Very nice comfortable dining room with big windows a lot of natural light; beautiful wall art ...The food which me & the wife both agreed was very fresh cooked perfectly & seasoned well.....Their table bread like puffed pita's are very good which we used them to eat their eggplant appetizer.Also ordered their falafel which were super moist inside & was fried perfectly....We both had a number 25, which was a combo with chicken kabab & chicken gyro meat served with shepherd salad topped with feta; we like our chicken gyro meat crispy & we asked our server to please make sure it's crispy need to say when the plates arrived the gyro chicken was not crispy ....Our server immediately took our orders back & tried that again.... came back a Lil crispy... our waitress apologized & said when the out going orders get busy & the dining room gets slammed this happens ... aha so we let that slide ...The over all service is a Lil slow but all can be overlooked because the food was delicious ...We will definitely return again, gotta try an order of their Chicken Chops looked awesome as well as try their deserts ...Thanks,Greg D & family",Memo Shish Kebab

Gentrified places like this annoy tf out of me with dumb stuff like this. I spare no money when it comes to my food, but this was a waste.","Usually I have great things to say about the places I choose to eat but not todayyyy This is a $9 salad that has lettuce (not fresh) and only croutons but is considered a Caesar salad  The price of this burger went up because each topping is served individually even so I had no problem paying for it. Although 3 burgers, 2 orders of fries and this bullshit salad was $76, not to mention the bread on the bottom is crunchy  This place used to be my go to place but not anymore. The burger itself is unseasoned and distasteful. I will no longer recommend this place to anyone. You're supposed to get what you pay for and this isn't $76 worth of greatness.","Came here as an alternative to another restaurant and I am oh so glad that we did. My partner and I both ordered the classic burger with cheese, bacon, and the lettuce. What I love about this place is they cater to all. In addition to a traditional burger, they have turkey burgers, veggie burgers, and an impossible burger. We tried the garlic parm fries and the onion rings. Now the only reason I am not giving this place five stars in because the fries were not that great because they were soggy and the garlic parm was not evenly distributed on the fries. They tasted kind of bland in my opinion. The onion rings were so good; they were crispy and have a nice flavor. I would definitely go with the onion rings instead of the fries when visiting.I was a little skeptical about the sage maple mayo BUT GO FOR IT! Oh my goodness! It was the perfect addition to my burger. My burger was juicy and have lots of flavor. I will definitely come back here to try something new. The burger is huge, so if you want to share with someone this is definitely the place.","Dutch Boy Burger has classic American bar food options. I personally like the restaurant for its vegan food options--the vegan nachos are amazing--and the outdoor space, Franklin Park. The restaurant has a good and vivacious crowd.The burgers are solid: beef, impossible, beyond. I personally like the impossible burger. And you have to get a [vegan] milkshake with the burger. The nachos are great for sharing.",I'll admit the first couple minutes I was a little annoyed by the FOH.. two girls standing behind the bar not doing anything or helping the main server.. he was definitely in the weeds. One girl was awesome I think she was a server assistant or busser.. so only thing front of house get rid of the people standing around texting ! Other than that FOOD WAS SO GOOOOOD one of the best burgers I've had in Brooklyn for sure I'll be back for the arcade and more food!!,Dutch Boy Burger
672,"So I have eaten here three or four times, and each time, I really enjoyed my meal and wonder why it took me so long to walk the whole 4 blocks to come back (mind you, they are long blocks). The place itself is super cute, but it's on a busy stretch of a Fourth Avenue, which can kind of destroy the vibe, especially when the doors were open; however, they have done some planting outside to soften things.  My experience has been that the food is consistently cooked well. It is not fancy French; it's bistro food.  The menu is small (no complaints there) and I don't think it's changed in the past three years.  There are always specials, but I also don't think those change that much either.  Prices are reasonable for the portion size.  Service is always very pleasant but also always slow, which is fine once you have placed an order and received some food, but can be frustrating while waiting to get started.  My biggest complaint is that they only take Amex, which I forget every time.  They do have an ATM inside, but I don't like using non-bank ATMs (identity theft hazard).","I really am giving this place a two star because of the mushroom soup that was delicious. Aside from that I would like to knock off a star for the rude waitress who had an attitude problem. I'd like to knock off another star for a very sad looking meal that was just very dry (roasted chicken) and lastly I would like to knock off a star for the time we had to wait for our meal when the places was completely empty on a Thursday night two weeks ago. Will not go back, I can do without the soup","1.5 stars. The charcuterie portions are really pathetic- it's $7 per item. For example we ordered Saucisson Sec and we got 7 small pieces. Of the cheeses, we got 2 thin slices, also $7 each. We asked about subbing mashed potatoes for fries- they would charge '3 or 4 dollars' and were told by the waitress that she isn't the boss so she doesn't make the rules... these two items cost the same as sides. So, that doesn't make sense. We also ordered escargot- something we order often. The texture was wrong. One person at our table ordered mussels- they were delish. Won't ever come back. Better to go to BrookVin.","In the passage of my travels I came here to pass time before going to the theater and for a cool down.  Weekend brunch appears popular to attract patrons.  I decided for one glass of Bellini $9 which was average.  Service is attentive.  The outdoor patio area was open as well as their window which the air conditioner was not in use.  I was hoping for a cool down evading the blazing sun and heat to be in the comfort of indoor air conditioning atmosphere.  Nevertheless, I was provided a glass of cold water with abundant ice.  The bill is handwritten on a old fashion ""guest check"" and not computerized.  Business cards are available for grabs.Note:  payment policy fine print on the bottom of their menu ""we accept only American Express $10 minimum, ATM available inside.""","Our absolute favorite French restaurant! From the food to amazing service!  The gem of the neighborhood, love coming back here as it never disappoints.","Lovely French place with good brunch food and great service! We ordered the steak and eggs and lamb sausage sandwich. The steak and eggs was cooked well and very reasonably priced at $16. I wish the sandwich came with a couple more sausage links, but it was flavorful and tasty nonetheless. The bread they toasted was really good. I also highly recommend getting the creme brûlée for dessert.It looks like they run daily deals such as $1 oysters or 3-course dinners which I'm very interested in coming back to try.",Olivier Bistro
673,This place is super close and convenient. We order once every 4 or 6 months and then are disappointed all over again...The gyros wrap had great flavor- solid 8. The falafel wrap was okay-  tasty veggies and but the falafel itself wasn't the best. Then there were the 'zucchini fries' which are flat triangle shaped soft oily zucchini mush. And likely pre-packaged and pre-frozen considering mine still had the PLASTIC ON IT (see image).  Too bad this place can't get it together.,"Check your bill. What they advertise on the menu and what I was charged was totally different, a 3.00 difference. That charge 1$ for extra sauce. The platter was 75% french fries and the rest was chicken. It also came with four pieces of bread. It has decent taste but nothing special. Definitely not going to come back here. It's definitely not worth the price.",Food  is starting  to taste not real  the gyro  sauce  fake meT is too much chemicalif dead to o night  you  have  a  ghost,"We ordered the trio dip combo, American burger, and Gyro Bifteki burger for pick up on Delivery.com. We got home and saw that the lettuce, tomato and onion were missing from the burgers. My husband called, the guy was very nice, offered to cover the next order or deliver the missing items. We opted for delivery, and ate the dip while waiting. We received what we expected as well as some complimentary rice pudding deserts. The burgers were cooked to a perfect medium rare and were well worth the wait. Excellent. Thank you!",Got the lunch special of the salad with chicken souvlakia drink and sauce was very good. Great price. The pita not the greatest but the chicken was delicious and for 10 bucks you can't beat it.,"They don't kid around with their namesake. This food comes fast! We have ordered via yelp for delivery and the food shows up 15-20 mins later. The portions of the platters are massive and tasty. Make sure you get the spicy feta dip, it's excellent.  I like the chicken souvlaki the best. Overall nothing to shout about but will keep coming back.",Greek Xpress
674,Yesterday we went there for the first time.Decent service and tasteful food presentation. Food arrived on time and it was very flavorful. We will be back to try more items from the extensive menu.,The worst restaurant ever. The manager is so freaking mean. We walked in and they gave us the crappiest table by the kitchen and when we said is there any other table the manager was like this the only table either you take it or leave. So unprofessional and racist. Just because we not Russians they treated us like crap. I will never recommend it to anyone.,"Great russian food, including presentation, taste and prices! Not so sure about it being authentic russian (tuna tartare is hardly russian), but that is not a minus. Make reservations ahead of time!","I love good food! My eyes rejoice when the presentation matches the taste. But then who doesn't?What I appreciate even more is consistency, because nobody and no body will tolerate unpleasant surprises.  In Sweetspot you know exactly what is coming to greet your empty, demanding stomach. This place is a sure thing be it a tuna tartare or potatos with chanterelle mushrooms or a chicken cutlet ""Pozharsky"" or a homemade medovik or any other item on the menu-- always as good as the last time you had it.  The places gets busy, and at times you feel that it's understaffed, but the servers compensate with  healthy humor and a good knowledge of the menu. It might get noisy and loud inside, so if you are craving a quiet atmosphere.....figure out your priorities, because good food outweighs it. :)","I had been meaning to try this place and finally did one day.  It's a Russian restaurant with a contemporary spin and it was packed.  You walk in and they great you with their standard spasiba and try take your order, but you have to retract a step back by telling them you don't speak the language.  They're pretty friendly and informative here. The waiter who took my order recommended the beef stroganoff.  The service was efficient, accommodating, and the food was excellent.  The portions are on the smaller end compared to other places, but the dish was packed with lots of flavor.  It was delicious and I won't hesitate to come back again.","We stopped by here for lunch and ordered a salad, mushroom julienne, soft shell crab (entree) and beef stroganoff (entree) and a chocolate mouse cake for dessert. The food was good, great prices, lots of different options.  The only thing that I would recommend is making the entree sizes a little bigger. Service was great. The place is relatively small and reservations for a weekend have to be made far in advance. It also looked like 14 people would be the largest sizeParty that they can realistically host. They serve liquor and seemed to have a full bar.",Sweetspot Cafe
675,Great service. The food was mediocre and very disappointing. My husband and I counted this dining experience as a loss. I just think the skill level does not match the ambition of the dishes.,"Food was okay. Service was fairly attentive. The steak tartare was over seasoned. You should not need to be given a steak knife for pork belly. And the grits that came with it were cold. Pasta with pork ragu was bland. Wine was expensive but not special. Overall, meh. Also weird, the power kept surging which made the lights dim sporadically.",Quality has become subpar since I first visited. The Tuesday burger was my absolute favorite but they recently replaced the buns with crusty potato buns... so sad.,"In the area, so stopped by for date night with my fiancé. The staff was so kind and accommodating. We ordered bone marrow, monk fish, and flatiron steak. Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection! We really wanted to try the homemade fettuccini, and they were so nice when we asked for a smaller portion with Bolognese sauce. Yum!!Definitely recommend and definitely will be back!",This is a secret gem of a restaurant in Bay Ridge. Went there after shooting pool nearby and truth be told we did not know what to expect. The welcome that we received was gracious and we were thrilled with the food. My chicken parm was the best I have had to date. And my boyfriend had a wonderful pasta dish fettuccini with shrimp in a delicious sauce. Topping it off was a lemon cake dessert that was memorable and clearly homemade. Excellent experience.,Intimate! Lovely staff! Better food (if that is even possible!) husband and I have been on a low carb lifestyle lately but we threw that all away on Valentine's Day to enjoy some wonderful eats!Started off with a delicious charcuterie plate while we waited for our entrees. I ordered the chicken stuffed with mozzarella fried over polenta. POLENTA WAS CREAMY AND FLAVORFUL. My husband ordered the pork bolognese. We ended up switching plates and I for sure ate 3/4 of his plate. I couldn't believe how good all of it was. I can't wait to go back!,Little Forno
676,"Solid go-to delivery spot. I always order their steak tortas and extra guacamole. The queso fresco on the tortas is divine. The grilled steak cubes are juicy and seasoned well. Every now and then you get a couple bites that are tougher to chew but for $9, this sandwich is hard to beat.","Based on delivery order.Grilled steak quesadilla:  Very tasty and flavorful.Hard taco carnitas:  Fairly moist carnitas.  The hard shell was a bit soggy, so definitely spring for the soft shell.I would order from here again.",The food is bland and underseasomed. The rice is always overcooked and mushy. I don't get the hype.,"I'm going to be here ALL THE TIME. I am so thrilled they have so many topics to choose from. The shop is very clean and the worker was very helpful. I got a salad bowl (you pick your own greens from a little pre packaged bowl in the refrigerated section, and then they pack it for you!). You get 1 meat, and 5 toppings I believe. I had a very hearty Chicken Salad (Spinach was my green of choice) Bowl with Black Beans, Bell Peppers, Brown Rice, and some other stuff! It's $7.50 before tax. I am so grateful to be conveniently stationed near this spot for a bit - I will definitely be back. Thanks, Mallenche.","Mallenche is one of those neighborhood spots that I wish I lived closer to but I'm happy I don't because the food is too delicious to not eat every other day. I walked in around 8:45pm with a friend (they close at 9:30pm) and I was a bit weary about being served the remaining scraps of the day but the reviews were too good to pass up on a chance to try their tacos. The gentleman at the window took our orders politely and quickly. In addition to the tacos, we also ordered a side of guacamole and two drinks (one cucumber limeade & one horchata). Our bill came our to $30 for everything (each taco was about $3, I think.)The atmosphere is clean and moderately sized. I can picture it being a bit packed during a lunch rush but for this time of day, it was barely full. For the most part, the food was hot, fresh and delicious. The goat, chipotle chicken, carnitas and al pastor are highly recommended. In combination with the spicy salsas, it was bite after bite of flavor-packed and fiery goodness. The guacamole was fresh and creamy and paired very well with the tacos. The fish taco, unfortunately was a bit underwhelming. I've had a much better fish tacos at other establishments. The guacamole lacked a little lime and heat. It also came with cold, store bought chips and while that isn't a deal breaker, it could have been a bit better. The service was great for a neighborhood establishment of its caliber. We stayed until about 9:30 and they were never rude about us staying until closing and they thanked us for our business as we thanked them for our food baby. Overall, you can't go wrong with this spot and it's definitely worth a try!","UPDATE:  Haven't ordered from here in about a year but there's no particular reason for it.  Any who got frustrated at being charged twice because of an error on Seamless' end.  The manager was kind and super helpful throughout it all. Based on delivery order.Everything was really fresh.  The sauces are tasty and have a great consistency. Spicy Shrimp Tostada:  The shell was still pretty crispy considering the delivery time.  The shrimp was spicy and very enjoyable.Grilled Steak Quesadilla:  Very tasty and flavorful.  Prefer to order with pico de gallo on the side only.Hard Taco Carnitas:  Fairly moist carnitas.  The hard shell was a bit soggy, so definitely spring for the soft shell.I would order from here again.",Mallenche Mexican Grill
677,"I'm standing in the store and had to update my review. The service is so slow it makes you want to walk out. If it wasn't for my mother's request for a veggie roti I would be out. 4 ppl behind the register and only 1 person serving. What in the name of everything that is holy? I am a Trini to the bone, but this is ridiculously sad!",Went into the restaurant on Utica today and the customer service was disgusting! The lady in front of me had an issue and the people treated her very poorly! I wasn't going to write a review about that incident because the incident didn't involve me and I know that's selfish of me but I chose to mention it in my review... I purchased a chicken Roti and two doubles I ate the roti at the shop and bought the doubles home came home heated them up was feeding my daughter one and went to bite into the other one and this is what I found! I am appalled at the fact that the worker did not discover this plastic while she was packing my food! What if I would have ate this... what if my infant child would have swollen this! They need to be more careful when handling food! Food handling education/certification is a must for everyone working in this establishment.,Why was my boneless chicken roti sweet?  Is that what where doing now?  I know the neighborhood is changing but please don't change the recipe.  Very stingy with the meat. I was not pleased the seasoning just threw me off.,"Service: Went on Sunday about 4:30. The line consisted of only a few people and it took about 5 minutes for us to be tended to. The customer service was fine as they did not have the attitude that the staff at many casual Caribbean eateries give (sad but true). Food:They were out of doubles, saheena, and aloo pies. We got two goat rotis which were amazing. Very good size (even as a person with a healthy appetite) and it was very flavorful. Thoroughly enjoyed and would highly recommend!Venue: Although the chairs were a little loose, the venue is a little more elegant than one would expect for the casual food and I appreciated that they even had so many tables and space that casual eateries like this dont usually have.Of note: Cash only. Wish the menu were posted on the wall for one to see and decide what you want vs having to look for pictures of the menu posted online from previous customers","I am officially done with Ali's Roti Shop. Upon entering the person at the register was running he cash register and serving food. Wtf! When I took off my head phones I finally hear a group of employees enjoying a conversation and laughing out loud with customers in the store. One actually looked out and continued the conversation. Of course my accent hits ""what foolishness is this? Allyah does put customers last until business shut down Stupppssss."" Of course no apology but the situation escalated when I asked for what I desired, a doubles with extra tamarind sauce. Her response, ""Ms we don't have doubles today"" my response, ""as of today I will no longer support allyah business and I promise to share my experience"" I walked out pissed and praying  they fire all the staff or sell their business to another person more capable of offering professional services. Btw doubles usually serve until after lunch. I'm sure if they weren't running their mouth so much they would have it available when requested. Yelpers don't do it!","I am a West Indian that loves curry and bussup shot. My family raised me on curry chicken, potato and chana and pumpkin. I am a fan of coupons and I was able to find one on restaurant.com that I could use towards my Ali Roti Shop order. I only had to buy $30 worth of food and get $15 off my order. Well I did get use my coupon, but when I made a small request for more than a 1/2 a spoon of pumpkin the server let me have it. Of course, I asked if that was part of customer service welcoming mate because I know I spent money and if I'm not mistaken I was not rude or loud. The short, Indian, loud mouth server was told to stop being rude by other customers on the long line, stop talking over peoples food and get people service. I had my two kids with me, but I made sure she understood I would not be spending another dime in their restaurant. The food was great, but the service needs to be taught customer service etiquette. I would have given them 4 stars, but the treatment and attitude was enough for me to give this shop 2 star. No wonder the other Ali - flatbush avene location closed down. SMH!Go at your own risk and brace yourself for a long line and stink attitude if you see the short indian girl.",Ali's Original Roti Shop
678,Staff is super nice. Came here for a restaurant week lunch. The ricotta salata shaved over arugula is to die for!,"If you sit at the bar from 4-7 M-F ask for the ""apertif"" menu which has pizzas the hot honey sheeps milk ricotta and areol sprits for all under 11$!",The food is small portions. However its fresh. The ambience is so trendy and serene..,"Have only been here for lunch and brunch. Food is always good (if on the small side), they are friendly, the restaurant looks like a power lunch place in SoHo from 1999. I cannot understand how they don't know how to manage their own restaurant? Their bar is sooooo sloooooow. Dishes and drinks go missing indefinitely. You might have 3-5 servers attending your table with little progress on any front. Empty plates and water glasses piling up now seem to be part of the experience. We came once for brunch, got a luscious banquet to ourselves. After 15-20 minutes, no server ever appeared. We left and ate at Reynard. A head scratcher, but a head scratcher with lots of potential, so I'm just hoping they continue to try a bit harder. I know they mean well.Extra points for the sleek open kitchen and the clean, private bathroom situation, as well as that spacious dining room, well-designed for the comfort of guests. If only their waitstaff could match the furniture.","Crusty pizza, subtle salads, pasta perfection and ohh such Tuscan country side style.We were lucky to try them for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Creative menu and lovely presentation adds to the unusual and delightful mix of flavorings in their dishes.Definitely a delightful spot for an intimate dish with your love.","I walk in and they're playing Fiona Apple 'Paper Bag'.Then they move onto Alicia Keys.A good sign. I quickly pick a drink off the cocktail menu called the 'Mama Ricco'. One of the best drinks I've had in a while (Rum, Vodka, St. Germain, Strega, and grapefruit). All ingredients that go well together. Cocktail is fiiire...Restaurant Week was going on and wow. Their RW Menu was legitimately one of the best one I've enjoyed in a very long time.Table seating is very comfortable and the bar seating is appealing as well.Doesn't hurt that this William Vale linked establishment is a great jump-off point before going to Westlight.A keep for sure.",Leuca
679,"I'm a bit surprised to see all of the raving reviews about the banh mis and bubble tea here. The food is proof that this is not an authentic Vietnamese operation and is only an imitation of one at best. We got grilled chicken and braised short rib banh mis and a Thai bubble tea. The banh mis were both lacking in meat and had a ton of shredded carrots and pickled daikon to make up for the missing meat. Every time I would take a bite of my sandwich, my teeth would get stuck on a thick, dry cilantro stem. A traditional banh mi would have cilantro more than its stem to give the sandwich a nice sour kick. The stem just doesn't cut it. The short ribs were mostly fat and the non-fatty parts were not very tender, therefore not having the full braised texture. The grilled chicken was marinated just fine but was extremely dry. Neither of the banh mis contained any jalapeños or chilis, which contributed to the lack of flavor. The bread was not a French baguette but instead an Italian hoagie roll, which again is why this banh mi cannot possibly be seen as the real deal.The Thai bubble tea was awful. First off, it had no sugar or condensed milk. This could have been okay if we asked for no sugar, but their original recipe seems to not call for either of those essential ingredients. The bobas were extremely mushy, which means that they were overcooked to the point they were blending with the flavor of tea. At times, I would swallow a boba without even tasting or chewing it!I was excited to try this place, but won't be coming back. Within a 15 minute distance, there are other banh mi spots that stay true to the ingredients of their dishes.","This place is ok. I prob won't go back. I got the pork bahn mi sandwich. The pork was precooked and then warmed up in the microwave which I think made it a little tough. They left all the stalks on the cilantro which was annoying and not pleasant to eat. The pork was a little fatty and chewy. The people were nice but if I'm comparing this place to some of the bahn mi sandwiches I've had in the  past, it was edible.","I ordered food tonight at 8:00. It's now 9:05, and it hasn't been delivered. I've called them and get a message that the voicemail box is full and they closed at 8:45. It seems that I'm not going to have dinner tonight, and I am very disappointed. I'll call tomorrow to find out how and why this happened, but for now, I'm hungry!","Banhmigos! A pun on bahn mi and amigos but there's nothing Mexican about the food. A quick lunch stop or delivery destination that's stolen my taste buds. Their traditional banh mi is made with Vietnamese ham and paté and it's delicious. It comes with a nice crisp bread that doesn't scratch the mouth and it's loaded with pickles carrots and Daikon that really adds the right amount of acid to each bite.Their spring rolls are a little heavy on the noodles but the duck and the shrimp options comes with a good amount of protein and enough peanut sauce to quadruple dip both rolls. The Thai ice tea is pretty standard.They only have four seats in the place and it's not the best atmosphere, but the food speaks for itself. I'll probably make this my premier spot when I want a quick grub hub meal.",Sigh... it's 2019 and yet here we are.When I ordered my food and got my change she put it on the counter. Everyone else that ordered - that wasn't as dark as me - she put their change in their hand. Lesson heard loud and clear. Won't be returning ever again.Also these aren't even real Bahn Mi. There a close substitute - I lived in SF for a while so I would know.,"Was in the area and stopped by. Its kind of off the main path and is a more of a neighbor hoody type of a spot. I got their Banhmi (7.75) with the Grilled Chicken, Kept it mild and also included a Match bubble tea (4.50). I would say for the area, its not super expensive like dekalb market but its not super cheap eats either. Their bubble tea isn't bad they have a nice selection, I liked that it wasn't crazy sweet and its brewed fresh for you. The Grilled chicken had a bunch of carrots, cucumbers with a mayo type based sauce. The chicken wasn't dry and had sweet bbq marinate. I would say overall they do the highlight was the bread, it was crunchy outside and fluffy inside. It held everything together and was able to absorb any sauce of juice. Overall if you're looking for a quick sandwich in the neighborhood it's the place to check out. There's also limited sitting so it's kind of a grab and go place.",Banhmigos
680,Both times I have been here I have been harassed by a long haired person who sits by the window and feels the need to talk to every person that makes the mistake of sitting next to them.  I won't be back as this person made my girlfriend and I feel very uncomfortable on both of our visits.,The coffee is just not good. If you're going to be a 50/50 butcher/Cafe the cafe section has to land just as well as the butcher. The butcher half is great and I recommend it but if you need a snack or coffee... find somewhere out.,Great food but step up your customer service ten fold. Never have I not been bothered by the apathy.,"Helpful, friendly staff that pointed me to all the right ingredients. I bought a quarter pound of guanciale for an amatriciana sauce and it was incredible--smoked and fatty and melted right in. Also grabbed a small piece of Parmesan in their cases and tinned whole ground New Jersey tomatoes. Hoping to get some pancetta next time I'm back (surely within the week).Also incredibly eager to pick up some of those sausages I've been hearing about. Lots to explore here.","Love their organic produce, meat and sausage selections.

681,"Ordered delivery on Yelp : I really had high hopes for the Hot potato house - heard so many good things but unfortunately, a disappointing order. I mean it wasn't an ""awful, going into the dumpster"" kind of disappointing but the ""not worth the $45 I just spent on this"" disappointing ... didn't like the okroshka (kefir with veggies and bologna isn't worth $8), the one at Stolovaya is significantly better. The Shepherd's pie and the draniki were just ok (if only a bit too salty) but nothing I'll be dreaming about; the lemony tasting eclair didn't make any of it better ... guess better luck next time",The foot is terrible. The fish was undone. One of my friends got food poisoning from the coffee. You have been warned!,"I was there yesterday with my family the service was excellent atmosphere was nice but the food was disgusting . I was there a year ago it was really good ,this time potatoes with mushrooms was  so oily .. stake  that my brother ordered had to be returned it was too salty to eat I didn't even get the right order, the fish had no flavor and dessert   Was spoiled. $350 in the garbage. Don't know what happened maybe the chef changed but I will not go back anytime soon .","Hot Potato House is a Eastern European restaurant in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, NY.  They serve more than just hot potatoes. The food is good, the dessert is better and the ambience is casual. My friend and I met for dinner during the week. It was after a rain storm and we welcomed a respite from the rain. A large family feasted and laughed in the main dining room. We were seated between the two dining areas. We ordered:Potato latkes with lox- this was delicious! Crispy potato pancakes with smoked lox and a fried egg. So many textures with the right amount of salinity. Crepes with salmon caviar- the crepes was smooth with slightly crisp edges. The caviar was good.Pork leg with sauerkraut and fried baby fingerling potatoes- The pork leg was massive! It was enough to feed 4-6 people. The pork was tender and juicy. The sauerkraut helped to cut into the rich fattiness of the pork. The potatoes added a welcome texture. Tiramisu- This was good typical Tiramisu. Tender ladyfingers soaked in espresso, layered with cream. Tart Tatten- this was a caramelized homemade apple tart with ice cream and topped with a rum sauce. It took a good 30 min to make. It was excellent! Buttered carmelized edges, sweetened apple with the creamy bitter rum sauce. You must eat it there! I loved it. Pro tip: do not take this dessert home. K and my friend found this dessert unpalatable after the textures have melded and the bitter sauce has soaked in. I would return if in the area! I would definitely order the latkes and lox and the tart tatten again!","Not much more to say, great food, great service, it's BYOB, prices are fair and I just checked in on Yelp and got a free desert!Had the beet salad, rack of lamb and the salmon steak. The food is always on par and even though I'm not Russian O believe the food is authentic.  They have some big parties that come in.  The also have live music on Friday nights. Parking is a little tough during the summer although they have valet parking. The only thing I don't like about most of the restaurants in Sheepshead Bay and Manhattan Beach is that they charge a 10% service charge. At least this restaurant has it in plain sight on the menu, most don't.  It's usually because they are afraid the customers they have won't tip. This is one of the only restaurants that charge a service charge I go to.I would highly recommend them ! I come here when I want something a little different from the regular choices. The food always is fresh and has awesome flavors.","Great place to sample Russian food. It has to be good because I was one of the only English speaking people. I went here a few times on a recommendation of a friend and found it to be very good. Greg who is either the owner or manager is always very nice and accommodating. Prices are very reasonable and the food is fresh and is very good. They offer all the traditional Russian dishes and have both family style dishes to share and a kids menu. You must try the beet salad, Potato  Latkes and the Salmon.The service is pretty good overall. They do not have a liquor license so it's BYOB and there is no corkage fee! That's a huge saving. The decor is average but nice and clean. They is offer valet  parking at a nominal fee as during the summer it's basically impossible to park in Manhattan Beach. I would definitely recommend you give them a try.",Hot Potato House
682,"$15 takeout special that includes an appetizer, main, rice, and naan.

The naan and paratha were the only redeeming qualities of the meal. I wouldn't recommend this place at all honestly, you can get MUCH better Indian food in NYC.","I do not know where they were hiding the ""Indian Spice"", but it was not in their food. Indian bland. I did not know it was possible to have Indian cuisine this flavorless. The Aloo Fried was soggy oily french fries with a little melted goo of cheese and splatter of some sauces. The lentil soup was lentils in a tasteful broth. The Chicken Tikka Masala looked just like Chicken Tikka Masala, but had no discerning flavor. The Lamb Vindaloo appeared to be a vindaloo and had some heat, but, again no actual flavor to speak of.","OMG. If you are reading this I know you want to find amazing food in the area. This is some of the best Indian food I've ever had. I came here during lunch and the food was sooo good I wanted to eat slower to make it last. Tasteful decor, and attentive service.You will be truly satisfied. The Navratan Kurma was the clear winner for my wife, father in law and I. Enjoy and spread the love if you enjoyed this place also.","I had a wonderful experience in this place.   In brief: Food came all on time and it was all really delicious as well. I've ordered saag naan which was my 1st time , I've never had this naan ever . 1st time experience was great in this place.   Food- full of flavors and spices were on point . Just loved it !         Would love to come back again.","We had lunch at this restaurant yesterday and liked it a lot.  The food is delicious, very well prepared and presented.  I had Salmon Tandoori and sweet and sour eggplant and my daughter had paneer.  All very good!  The service is attentive and efficient.  The prices quite reasonable.  I will be sure to be back, even though I live in Downtown Brooklyn.  I strongly recommend Indian Spice.",Indian Spice
683,"So my family and I always go out for Sunday brunch. I stopped by this place yesterday and an extremely nice bartender showed me the brunch menu and by his attitude and the variety on the menu I decided we would come to brunch here. So all 4 people at my table got the food they ordered, I told them to eat because I don't want any bodies food getting cold. About 10 minutes later my mom asked the waitress if my food was ready... she said...""yes they rang the bell but I haven't gone back yet"" are you serious?!? My whole table is eating but you don't think you should get my food when they ring the bell?! She brought it out and it was cold but whatever. At this point I just ate it. I don't send my food back at restaurants. Oh and they add tip to the bill. Which is funny bc I've been here plenty of time beforeFor dinner and they have never added the tip to my bill. (The bill has always been over $100) The waitress was not good at all. They need to rethink their service they have. Maybe if she would've apologized for the lack of her service, my review would've been different.","I don't recommend hamburgers in that place - we ordered midium and midium rare - both were well done , for one appetizer , 2 burgers and beers we paid 65$",I came here recently. Didn't like the atmosphere at all. Was very dirty and the service sucks.,"Nice little spot with good food n drinks, great friendly service, and good prices.Our bartender/server was Adam and he was great! He gave good suggestions, very friendly, and just the right amount of attentiveness.They have daily happy hour til 7 (or 8) I can't remember which. Food: Wings and quesadillas are part of happy hour for $8 each and they are really tasty. The truffle fries was also on the happy hour menu for $6 and the portion is pretty big. We also got the chicken nachos which were so bomb.Drinks: I got a pineapple Moscow mule (and yes it's in the copper mug!) $9 and a jalapeño margarita ($7 during happy hour). Both drinks were good! My friend had a bay breeze which she said was good too $9. First time here but definitely not my last. I'll be back! (Terminator voice lol)","Went here last night for apps and drinks after reading a few reviews. It's no BS, this place is super chill, great service and great food. The wings were incredible and the margaritas are nice and strong. $6-7 happy hour drinks, $6-$8 apps are a sweet deal. Our server was kind, accommodating and so we added a few extra dollars on the tip. My only request is that they move closer to where I live on Broadway and Halsey, we need places like this.","This is probably my favorite bar/restaurant in the area. The service is prompt! My waiter/bartender, Yaw, was able to give me some great guidance and was very helpful. Everything on the menu is tasty! Don't skip dessert! The tiramisu is to die for. 5/5 for me :)",The Factory Bar & Restaurant
684,"I've been coming here for many years, and it has traditionally always been a great experience.  However, the last 3 times I have been, I have become more and more underwhelmed.  The quality of the food is declining significantly, and the attitude from the servers is getting worse.  What's worse is that this place no longer seems to be focusing on Italian food, but rather some kind of European/polish angle.  Maybe their trying to work within the neighborhood, or they got a new chef, but either way, I've unfortunately had my last meal here.","My husband and I came to Le Fanfare hoping, based on the reviews, for a romantic date night in a wonderful ambiance. In fact, I can see from reading the reviews that the owner of the restaurant makes this a priority, and even commented on someone's post that they were being too loud and other customers had complained.However, upon getting to the restaurant, a man (clearly a regular based on the interaction with the bartender) walked into the bar. His volume was from the start completely out of control, it wasn't just that he was talking loudly (something I would never complain about), it was yelling and could be heard word for word from our dinner table. But more disturbing was the content of what he was saying. The man was shouting things like ""suck my coc!""and doing impressions of ""gay mexicans."" Needless to say, it was highly offensive and throughout our entire dinner- appetizers to entree- we had to sit there and here this guy discuss offensive comments about women or his shouting impressions of people. All of this was upsetting enough, and it was clear from other tables and ourselves that the staff should have been aware as to how disturbing this was. However, instead of telling him to lower his volume or to please leave, the bartender indulged him and was laughing at his jokes. When we finally confronted the bartender about it, I explained that this was not something anyone going to a nice dinner should have to sit through. Not just the volume, but the contents of what he was saying. No one should pay nearly 100 dollars for a date, and have to hear someone discussing how he ""fuc#s his GF...etc"" in a screaming volume. It was degrading and offensive to any female patrons, and should not have been tolerated. The handling of the situation was beyond poor- the bartender was defensive and said this was the first time he's been like this in 4 years... that doesn't really matter, because he was like it that night and should have at least been asked to lower his volume so we all didn't have to be privvy to him screaming. We were given our one glass of wine for free, but frankly we should not have had to pay for a meal where we rushed to eat just to get out of an environment where someone screamed offensive comments and mocked gay people the entire dinner. Deeply disappointing for a restaurant that encourages people to vote on their instagram and seems to pride itself on being an open, liberal institution to not have stepped up to the plate when there was a moment where women were made to feel uncomfortable in the restaurant, and had the courage to say something about it.","Ugh really upset with my brunch this morning! I have been here a few times and always love the atmosphere and decor! The cocktails are really fantastic so don't hesitate to enjoy their bar! We arrived at 11:20 and the restaurant had two people seated in the restaurant total. No problem for me and it's an early brunch time for a Sunday. We waiting for two other people to arrive and asked to be seated for four. The waitress asked if my other party was going to be arriving soon very intensely... Since the restaurant was completely empty besides two other patrons I didn't think being seated immediately would be an issue. The waitress hesitantly seated us on the communal table. I was starving and decided to order the buratta and drinks to tide me over before my friends arrived. Luckily it was very delicious. However... The table order 3 different brunch entrees 1. Zucchini pancakes with salmon and a poached eggs. It was super bland and just overall gave me a gross feeling... 2. Veggie frittata with potatoes. Very underwhelming and a very small egg portion. 3. Two orders of the ""flat bread"" it is like 3 crepes with very bland tomato sauce and over easy eggs on top. It was not only underwhelming, but very mushy and bland... Out waitress was really unfriendly and impatient! Our total bill for 4 people was $140 pre-tip and we all have terrible stomach aches. I'm really contemplating a phone call, but I'm not sure what I would accomplished with it.I definitely would NOT be back for the food or customer service.","What's that tasty squid ink pasta over yonder on the farrrr part of Manhattan Ave. in Greenpoint?And why is this establishment 80% full on a cold Monday night?Ambience.  Food.  Service.  We all know if you nail these 3 things, people come back. That's why. Any patrons from the nearby Box Hotel? Didn't look like it.  All denizens of Gpoint from within a 7 block radius.  Casual warm but somewhat minimalist rectangular space. Sincere smiles from all staff are delivered throughout your experience.  There are Booths and long communal tables. Nobody is bumping elbows (this is always key - only Spotted Pig gets away with this in recent memory) -- ample space and comfort.  Pasta noodles are almost all made in-house and that's part of the love present in these savory plates. Cannolis were delightfully crisp, sprinkled with pistachios and oozing with goodness not too sweet...I almost asked for another one.  The service was completely on point, gracious, attentive.   Take a stroll to the OTHER side of Greenpoint and check this place -- say hi to Paul Giamatti if you see him drinking merlot. Oh wait -- he doesn't do that right?!!","Overall opinion - The apps were better than the mains. Went here on a Friday night - group of 6. All of the apps we split were the best part of the meal. The bread they bring out before dinner is amazing too. Main dishes were hit or miss all around. I ordered the pork rib dish pictured and would not order again, although I did like the polenta . It was hard to eat around the little bones with there being a soupy texture to the rest of the meal. Everyone that got pasta was happier with their choice.Apps ordered:BurrataMussels - kind of fishy Roasted cauliflower (so good)The place itself is really cute. Long enough tables for a big group.","Very cute place. I only stopped in for happy hour right around 530pm; I'm sure coming here for dinner or brunch at peak times or even late on a Friday night for drinks is a drastically different experience, but I loved the low key nature of their happy hour and our bartender made great drinks so we left happy  Would definitely come back again.",Le Fanfare
685,"Good brunch spot in Bay Ridge! My mom and I came here on a weekday morning for brunch and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food.We tried the Three Poached Eggs in Tomato Onion and Pepper Stew and the Inside Out Truffle Bun. Both were really good, though I could've done without so much of the truffle aioli on top of the burger. I also ordered the Pistachio Latte, which was good but not the best latte I've had.My only complaint was that service was a little slow because there was only one waitress for 6 tables. Guess they didn't expect it to be so busy on a Thursday morning.","I'm not sure if my tastebuds weren't having it this morning, but I did not have a good experience at The Common. When you walk in, you are automatically standing on top of people eating. We were seated within 10 minutes & the table was wobbling, the latte came 23 minutes after we ordered it ( they only started making it after we mentioned it ) the food was mediocre and very salty. Don't waste your time with the truffle aioli, it's tomato sauce with zero truffle taste. The chef was arguing with the waitress, everything is upside down in there. I gave the 2 stars for the sausage , it was just okay. I also ordered the $4 cup of orange water. (aka their mango mint iced tea)","I recently dined here with my mom. We wanted to have brunch but we just missed it when we arrived so we stood for lunch. I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately it was an overall bad experience. First of all, we were not greeted properly when we walked in (they weren't busy either.) The waitress was okay just okay. The kitchen is right in the middle of the restaurant so you can see them cooking while you are there. That is the format of this place. The cooks gave me bad vibes and who needs that. I regret not leaving right then but oh well lesson learned!!I ordered the chicken sandwich which comes with fries. The ""fresh basil pesto""that comes on it was horrible! I don't know how they can serve this to people when it's so gross. The chicken was cheap as well low quality to top it off. I definitely don't recommend this. My mom ordered the pulled pork sandwich. I tried it & it was slightly better than what I ordered but my mom wasn't that happy with it either. The fries were like fast food french fries too not that good. The waitress asked us if everything was alright & my mom quickly & politely told her that I really wasn't happy with my meal. I agreed but I didn't push the issue because I didn't want to make her feel bad I don't know that's just how I am. We were definitely more than polite about this matter. She looked like she felt bad about it but she didn't do anything to rectify it. I'm just saying at least say something like-can I get you something else or maybe suggest something else that she can do about this but no she didn't do anything like this. This is a new place & I would think that they would want to make a good impression but obviously not. We paid $30 dollars for those two sandwiches that were not worth it plus we left hungry. Oh & the iced coffee was not good it was barely mediocre. My mom took one sip & left the rest behind. We will not be returning here that is for sure!*One last thing--be careful with the steps before you enter, if you choose to dine at this place, they are very steep.","Parking is tough in the area but I got lucky today. Arrived around 1pm on a Sunday and left my name with the hostess. Twas a bit of a wait - 45min on a 30min quote - but boy was it worth it. The wait was also comfortable as they have two benches in the shade on either side of the entrance. I took the time to walk over to Dunkin to use 1 of my 8 free drinks and to figure out what I wanted.The hostess did an amazing job keeping the waiting customers updated every time someone got called in, and even addressed everyone by name.I was flying solo and felt guilty that they gave me a table for 4 all to myself. Offered to have to have the last two people waiting join me but that didn't happen.I ordered the sausage skillet with avocado. While I'm a fun guy, I'm not a fan of mushrooms so I asked to hold the mushrooms. As a courtesy I was offered peppers instead which was a nice customer service touch. The food was banging! Hot, flavorful and well presented.If I had to nitpick, the potatoes in their own didn't have much flavor, but when eaten with every thing else, it was very well balanced. In the crazy expensive brunch game, it was surprisingly only $12.Def coming back here to try the other dishes!",Came on a Saturday with my girlfriends- place was petite and cozy.  Great friendly hostess/waitress.  Food was phenomenal! My only negative thing was .... wish the matcha powder in my latter could have dissolved...,"Been meaning to try this place since it opened and finally had a chance to. Definitely not disappointed. Came late afternoon on a Sunday and were seated right away. We got lucky because shortly after they told parties that walked in that they were backed up and won't be seating anyone for an hour, which I thought was very responsible, rather than seating people and having them wait a long time for food. Super clean space with an open kitchen.I had the breakfast in a boule and my boyfriend had the pastrami grilled cheese. We both really enjoyed our meals and drinks. The grilled cheese was pretty big and the fried egg comes on top. Wouldn't exactly call it your usually grilled cheese, but quite a bit sandwich. Really enjoyed the breakfast in a boule, like a creative scrambled egg dish.They don't have iced coffee on their menu but they offered an iced latte which was very good, the pear punch my boyfriend really enjoyed as well. Looking forward to coming back to try their lunch/dinner menu!",The Common
686,"Love the Mac and cheese here. However, last time I came here the waitress kept messing things up and we were super hungry so it was a little annoying. First she forgot our drinks, then they brought us someone else's order and when our orders came in it wasn't correct. We were there for about an hour and a half watching a game and she checked on us once. Good food but the service ruined it for me a bit.",im always coming for lunch now on my unemployed days. getting my regular salad and their plate is always consistent.  greens are always fresh. and service impeccable as always,"I asked for ketel one with soda and lime. She spelled it wrong. I spelled it correctly for her. She came back and told me they dnt have it. I told her that I can see it from here. She must have been working drunk. It's a top shelf Vodka home girl, get it together. And learnt to make your money. Not everyone drinks well drinks or beers.","BHP is my go to spot for a casual nights out, quicl drink, snack, meal or all of the above. The food selection is extensive, about 20 choices on tap, and a full bar. One of my favorite parts avout it is it's always poppin but rarely packed so they're always a spot.The food: My favorite things here are the wings, the tomato soup with cheese dippers and the shepherd's pie, im that order. While I am no expert, these are the best damn wings I've had. The food may take a bit longer to come out than I'd like but quality is worth waiting for. The portions are always just slightly more than you need.The drinks: Your standard alcoholic beverages. I haven't had anything that's not available anywhere else but all the drinks are consistently on point.The atmosphere: In the afternoon it's very chill. A great place for lunch. In fact my team does our offsite management training sessions here because it's close to the office. The music is kicking and doesn't just repeat Top 40. There are plenty of TVs playing all kinds of content, mostly sports, but I did catch NCIS here before. The place is good when flying solo or with a large group. If the weather is nice, catch the outdoor seating and watch the bustle of 5th avenue. The service: some of the friendliest bartenders around. I've gotten some protips in bartending from Maria which I put you good use for a July 4th party.","A no frills bar/pub that's good if you don't know what you want to eat. They have a pretty decent menu with lots to choose from. Please keep in mind this place is a bar so the music can get loud and the TV is always on so it can be distracting. The few times I've eaten here it was always with family so my kid is with us. During lunch and early dinner, you will see lots of family with kids eating here so it's kind of the norm here in south slope. The chicken fingers are always a hit with kids, nicely fried without drying out the chicken. The shrimp salad is ok. The nachos are delicious but don't get steak since it's probably a cheaper cut of meat and comes out too dry. Their fried calamaris are amazing and we get those every time we come here.",Been here a couple more times since my last review n I've really come to appreciate them. Outdoor seating is plentiful. Indoor seating is wide n spacious. I love all the tvs around. And their food is very good for a bar.  Drink selection could be better.,Black Horse Pub
687,"Really wanted to like this place. There's so much potential but the service was abysmal and food was ok. The young gentleman who was our server was either not trained properly or just doesn't care about his job. This is supposed to be a sit down place but I literally had to walk up to the kitchen to order food, otherwise we wouldn't have been served. There was a couple who sat next to us and waited patiently for probably 10min before leaving. To pay the bill, I literally got up and paid at the cashier as if I was at McDonald's. My other option was to sit there and wait for someone. What's shocking is the place wasn't super busy. To the owners: do NOT cheat customers by automatically tacking on a 10% service charge if it's non-existent. There was nothing on the menu that informed customers or any signage.","Wanted to go to an interesting place in Brighton Beach. There's many Russian and Uzbekistan places but this one seemed very unpretentious and inexpensive for lunch. Tried a variety of dishes. Kind of disappointing. The cabbage and vegetables with a red sauce was my favorite. Mildly spicy and tasted like an Italian caponata. Chicken wings had no taste. The meat filled dumplings were ok with sour cream (the sour cream was the best part!)  strange meat inside. Stuffed cabbage also didn't have too much taste. This place was a little too authentic. --- no coffee because they don't drink it in Uzbekistan, only tea. Went somewhere else for desert!  Biggest disappointment was the Turkish bread. It didn't taste fresh and was just not good. I love bread and sometimes never leave it over but between 3 people we left 3/4 of the round loaf!!Been there , done that, don't have to go back!",The food was just ok. The plover was a bit undercooked and the lamb was D-R-Y. You can tell they didn't even try to keep it moist. The kebabs were ok but was a bit wet. The meat crepes were buttery but to the point of glistening. They barely had any meat in them. I'll stick to my usual Uzbeki spot.,"The food here was amazing, an interesting blend of Korean, Russian and Uzbek food. I have never tasted anything like it. My daughter really loved the flat bread, and I ordered the egg dish for her and the Guk-Su for me. The server was efficient and very friendly. Also, I loved that you could look into the kitchen. The restaurant including the bathroom was very clean.","On this particular Friday night, I felt tired of eating my typical East Asian style cuisines so I decided to move up Asia a little bit and try Korean inspired Russian dishes! Located right by Brighton Beach, Cafe at Your Mother in Law really creates the atmosphere of warm home cooking. With very reasonable pricing, you have pretty much endless options of appetizers and entrees, ranging from shiitake mushroom salads, to samsas and noodle soups. I decided to order the Kuksu (hot), Lagman (hot) and Eggplant salad. The eggplant salad was DELICIOUS: flavorful with a punch of vinegar, perfect for a hot day. The large size is perfect for 2-3 people to share. As for the noodles, the kuksu was refreshing and light. The flavor reminded me of a Pad Thai in the sense that it wasn't heavy at all. i REALLY want to try the cold Kuksu because I think it would be very similar to a Bibimnaegmyun, a delicious cold Korean classic. NOW, the Lagman is a 180 degree turn from the Kuksu in that it is a HEAVY tomato based almost stew, if you will. Filled with carrots and beef, the Lagman delivers a hearty, salty alternative which would be perfect for cold, winter days. The Lagman is also smaller in size than the Kuksu, which I kind of prefer because of the heaviness. The only issue I had with the Lagman is that it is a bit too salty for my liking.Be aware that the receipt already charges 10% as a service charge. It was frustrating in that I had to do math to give the waitress a proper 18%, but I understand that they put this in place to protect their workers. In my opinion, if it was a 15% or 18%, it'd make things a lot easier.","This place is a hole in the wall and somewhat of a crap shoot, but you come for the food, period.  My babes did not like his dish, but what does he know, psht.  To reiterate, no frills, but who cares?  Certainly not me!For starters, we had the manti app.  I'm very familiar with this exact type of food.  Afghani people call it mantu.  Difference being between this Russian version versus the Afghani version (circa, when Russia went to war with Afghanistan, and lost, shamefully), the Russian variation has a much thicker dough and mixture of pungent overfilled coriander beef/lamb, making it inedible for some. The Afghan mantu has a thinner dough and one type of filling. The chicken kabob skewers were delicious and flavorful.  Moist and worth every bite.  Their Korean beef was more than deligthftul.  Everything was freshly made.  I most certainly enjoyed my first visit.  If in the hood, I shall seek it out.",Cafe At Your Mother-in-Law
688,"I've been here many times, and I'm always disappointed in the service. I think service is very dismissive and the servers always seem to come to a table, take 1 order and turn and run. I'm never comfortable when I come here and just think it should be addressed because I think the vibe is nice and the beverage program is decent.","I get it. Long nights when no one is in your bar sucks. It could make anyone a little short tempered. But pouring shots like this and charging full price just makes you an ass. Would like to come back and try again, but probably won't bother.","Loved this place til they double-charged my credit card, said they'd fix it, then stopped responding to my emails.  Can't call to address this! Very disappointing after spending a lot of time and money here!",10 stars! My boyfriend and I frequent here a lot because it has such a unique and cool vibe. The food and the drinks are delicious so when we got engaged we messaged Alla to ask if we could have our party here. She was very acclimating and made the planning a breeze. Big thanks to her and the team! The party was a blast as expected! Please check it out.Richie and Jill,"Amazing food. Amazing cocktails and drink menu. I don't even live on the east coast anymore, but when I come back to visit NY, this is a must-go-to stop.I think I've had nearly everything on the menu - wings, grilled caesar salad, coconut curry mussels, pickles, oysters - but my fave is the chicken liver bacon sandwich. I literally miss and crave this sandwich all the time.","Came to OTB during happy hour on Taco Tuesday and it was great! When I walked in, I was able to grab a seat at the bar with my friend. Their happy hour is great and has something for everyone. I grabbed one of their $8 negroni and later $9 margarita. The bartender was great and hospitable! I did not get a chance to grab food but will definitely next time.",OTB
689,"People of color beware! Shame on me for missing alllllll the signs... walked in was haphazardly greeted (noticed this b/c when everyone else arrived they received a very different greeting). Sign #2 we never got any bread or arancini but all the guest who arrived after us did (had to ask and only got stale bread). When we finally did get food he (hostess/ server) never checked on us (like his other guest). The racism was so blatantly obvious. When presented with the bill I left this tip and I quote ""Treat everyone equal pls!  It goes a long way... your tip would have been better""Didn't understand how a place that was bring your own wine (and hid it in case authorities come) with subpar food had the audacity to treat people this way in Brooklyn!The visit put a damper on my NY city visit but the other restaurants  (Brooklyn Bridge one to mention) lifted my spirit back up! Will never return here!","Manhattan prices, but the whole menus top notch. The owner John's a longtime neighbor so keep it up.","Came here last night just for dinner. I made reservations the day of  for two people with no problems. My boyfriend and I arrived on time, waited for about 2 minutes for someone to notice us, we sat down and then waited about 10 minutes to get a menu.... We saw the new Vietnamese place across the street so we were thinking about leaving and going there especially since one of the waitresses was SO rude. My menu was on the table as I was reading it, and she abruptly takes it away and said ""Move the menu."" Not only that, but she kept bumping my chair every time she walked by and bumping my boyfriend's arm with no apology until she made him spill his drink on himself.So rude. The male waiters, however that have been there for a whole are excellent.Except that rude waitress and waiting for a menu for so long, it was good.We ordered a mixed salad, I had penne Arrabiata, and he had the special black linguini with shrimp and scallops in red sauce.Very good food!!We paid, our total was $70 for that and 2 cappuccinos, we gave a $100 bill and literally waited 20 minutes for one of the waiters to come back with change!!!!",This is the perfect neighborhood restaurant in Brooklyn.

690,It's not authentic Korean food at all. The food sucks and it's expensive. Would not recommend not come back to this place,"AMERICANIZED HORRIBLE KBBQ.... this place looks like an American dining hall with KBBQ grills randomly placed inside.  The service started off well until I ordered the yaki mandu.   The server then tried to correct me and said its yache.  I'm like I don't care how you Americans spell it I'm korean and its yaki and she got mad and then proceeded with the worst service afterwards.  Not one single korean works here so there is no authenticity.  This is just a RIP off of a culture and trying to make a profit of off them ...bad food, bad service, save your money and time.Btw don tell a korean he is wrong about his own ethnicity and culture and then get pouty about it.","We had a reservation for 8 for eating in the dining area, and then karaoke afterward. They have a tiki style bar area that we waited at for rest of our party to show up, as they don't seat until you have your full party.After being seated and server came to take our order, a few subtle things started to happen. The server proceeded to walk away to attend to another table, halfway when we were making our order and deciding between items.We ordered their house soju and they gave us a bottle that was 3 quarters finished. We let them know and they didn't even realize and were confused why we wanted to return the bottle, and we had to point it out more clearly to them. Then a different server came by and asked whether there was a problem with the bottle. We were surprised that there was such a lack of communication between the staff, it's clear that it was already drank by a different group before us. We haven't even started eating or drinking yet.. The poor service continued as they gave us an order for a different table. We had to correct them again.In the end we tried to appreciate the food and drink, but their house made soju was actually disgusting. I'm not really sure what we expected, especially since it wasn't flavored soju or anything. The meat quality was mediocre. We soon realized that the only reason why people came to this establishment was that they probably live too far from ktown manhanttan - because the price was the same for subpar meat quality.I highly recommend against coming here if you are able to just go to ktown. This place also requires advanced reservation for weekend nights, I guess since it'd the only kbbq in the entire area.The karaoke was decent. They have an app you can use for song selection.Overall I would say if you live in bklyn it's probably an okay choice, but not worth trekking to if you're coming from Manhattan.","I planned a bachelorette party here (9 girls). I am so glad I did. Insa exceeded my expectations. The food was excellent! Every single dish that came out we couldn't believe how tasty. We ordered a bunch of sharables for the table. Insa chicken, pork buns, beef rice bowls, bbq short ribs, seafood scallion pancake ( a favorite) and fried pork dumplings. Everything was seriously delicious. While it may not be the most authentic Korean bbq, it was great food!The reason I didn't give 5 stars was because of the service. Our waiter could have been more attentive and friendly. I also noticed the wait staff talking and laughing together a lot which means they were not doing their jobs. That being said it was not terrible but could be improved. We ended the night with a private karaoke room which was such a blast! We had an amazing night at Insa and I totally recommend going with a group to celebrate!","Went here yesterday and was pleasantly surprised but not overly impressed. Finding authentic Korean food in Brooklyn is pretty difficult and after being disappointed by several places (which won't be named), I was hoping this could become a go-to.The food was decent but tasted very americanized. It seemed like the flavors were all a bit off, with the budae jjigae tasting too buttery and lacking the diverse range of flavors that a traditional korean budae jjigae offers. There was also supposed to be spam in it but didn't find any. The dubu kimchi was actually very good! There should be a slightly sweet element to the dish to balance out the spicy but overall, it was solid and I'd order this dish again. We got the yangyum galbi (shortrib) and while the meat was great, I found that there were several ingredients to a ""ssam"" that were missing. No scallion, the bean paste was more the consistency of a sauce than a paste, and we weren't given garlic or peppers to build out the wrap as most korean restaurants give. It's a solid 3/5 for the food as well. Service was great and appreciated how attentive the staff were. The overall decor was clean and minimal and I loved the skylight as it brought a lot of natural light into the restaurant. However, between the side ""speakeasy"" type bar, the karaoke, and the bbq grills, it seems like they're trying to offer/focus on too many things at once. As such, the overall experience seems to lack authenticity and grades overall at a solid 3/5.","RIP OFF. Wings are good thothey are charging $75/bottle for bottles that you'd expect to be 1L but are half the size and should be $30. it's a fun time, but not worth the premium.",Insa
691,Food was exceptional. Small casual place. Service was great.Pricing very reasonable.,Everything about our meal was great. But it becomes a bit off putting when you start of as the only table dining then upon other tables filling up you see a sample dish being offered to the 4 other tables but never make its way to yours. At first I thought it odd then it became - wait we are the only brown people in here - should I let that opinion sway me. At one point I stared at the waiter serving the dish with a questioning look on my face as to what is going on but then I looked at my waiter who came over and asked if we needed anything else. I said no I Was not about to ask for the sampling so I asked for My Check and left.This made me very uncomfortable.. SO FOR THIS I WON'T EVER GO BACK.,Had a horrible experience there..The service was terrible and I ordered orange juice and it's been 1 month and it hasn't arrived yet..The chef was rude to the only waitress available..People came after us and got food before us ..I guess they're  in no hurry to serve the only Black folks in there..I won't recommend that place if you're hungry or wants good service unless you're  WHITE..I am NOT mistaken it's the Correct place..Dont try to make it seem otherwise..Horrible horrible experience and I've heard that you guys dont like bad reviews and always make an excuse about it.Dont even try that..Anyways no love lost I just won't be recommending that place...,"Beets and Carrots is a secret Bay Ridge gem that people secretly whisper about. This is probably for the better, as my friend and I came on a Friday night and we were the only ones in the restaurant. I don't want to have to start fighting off hipsters or enduring an hour wait for dinner. As others have said, the restaurant is nothing to really look at. Though, it does feel like you're having dinner in someone's home using their family's fine china. The service mimics this too- the waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable. Beets and Carrot Hummus [$12]: The beets and carrots hummus was such a delightful appetizer. I'm usually turned off by hummus [see: Sabra hummus in the supermarket], but I love it here. Roasted chickpeas on top add a wonderful bit of crunch. Warm salty pita bread is served on the side. This is such a light dish, the flavors of the hummus were so refreshing, not acidic or overwhelming [see: Sabra hummus in the supermarket]. It's also the perfect size for sharing among two people, though I don't doubt my ability to eat it all by myself.Black Russian Bread [$3]: There's no actual bread service at Beets and Carrots but I did find black Russian bread on the menu. This brings me back to my days living in Sheepshead Bay/Brighton Beach. Black Russian bread, for comparison, tastes like pumpernickel bread. There were two thick pieces, salted and buttered. On the side was more butter and some orange marmalade. Outrageously delicious. Veal Cheeks [$29]: These veal cheeks man. These veal cheeks were fork tender. I did not even use my knife once. Incredible. The veal cheeks are braised in red wine and served with roasted vegetables. The vegetables were perfectly roasted and were delicious on its own. Overall, this dish may have been just a little bit too salty but it's still a winner. Mixed Berry Pavlova Cake [$8.50]: I think desserts may be the achilles heel of Beets and Carrots. I enjoyed the mixed berry pavlova cake but it just didn't wow me. The meringue was nice and the cherries underneath the cake were big and juicy. My friend had the beets and carrot cake with the beets and carrots ice cream [$8.50]. The cake was super moist but the ice cream tasted too much like beets but it also didn't really taste much of anything at all. Beets and Carrots is BYOB. There's a $10 cork fee which I think is fair, especially if you buy a $15-20 bottle of wine. Most bottles of wine cost minimum of $50-$60 depending where you go. The bill came out to $100 for two people after tax, before tip. Definitely not a bad deal considering the quality of food! Bay Ridge is definitely better off for having this restaurant around. And I am lucky that it is so close to where I live. Huzzah.","Hidden gem indeed.It's a small unassuming family run shop with a thoughtfully curated menu that changes seasonally with fresh farm to table ingredients.You can taste the quality and care that goes into each dish. Very healthy tasting as well, and reasonably priced. We enjoyed the veggie appetizers more than our entrees, but I would definitely love to come back and try more. Highly recommend-- don't come if you're in a rush as it's more a place to leisurely enjoy your meal. Solid 4.5 but will update in the future.","What an unexpected gem in Bay Ridge! The atmosphere is casual and relaxed, perfect for treating yourself on a week night. The menu is well balanced, and there are plenty of vegetarian and vegan options, but also a seafood menu. We had:-the beet and carrot salad with potato gnocchi and goat cheese. Simply delicious.- roasted summer squash (seasonal): nice and smoky, with goat cheese mousse- beet bucatini with mushrooms, almonds and Parmigiano: our absolute favorite. So much flavor!- fleur de del with homemade ice cream. When I hear ""homemade ice cream"" I can't resist, and I wasn't disappointed. The fleur the sel (a crumbly wafer) was nice and fragrant and the ice cream was delicious. We had salted caramel with rosemary and chocolate (I think with a hint of lavender).All the food is fresh and full of flavor, the vegetables are cooked perfectly, the staff is courteous and ready to give advice. FYI, the restaurant is BYOB, with a 10$ fee for cork service. There is a wine store nearby!",Beets and Carrots
692,"The food and atmosphere here are both A+.  The service however is unbelievably horrendous.  I'm not talking about anybody being rude or anything it's more than you have to wait 15 to 20 minutes before someone takes your order, can never hail anyone down for an extra napkin or drink refill.  The blonde lady behind the bar is pretty reliable but anyone else I've seen as a waiter or waitress should really be fired.  It is disappointing because I really enjoy eating there but when it takes two hours just to get a bowl of soup and a sandwich get the check and get out of there I really can't justify it anymore.","Always great, but particularly when Aoife is bartending! Tell her Jason sent ya. Or Ed. Or don't, she'll be friendly regardless.","Was here on a date a few years ago (with a white guy) and I was ignored by the waitress throughout the entire 2 hour meal. As in, her back was to me as she addressed him for our orders. Completely disgusted that folks still patronize this place, considering there are other reviews with claims similar to mine. Nothing special about the food or drinks. You can do better. And so can they.",Great place for food and drinks! Service is subpar and nice vibe. Nice Happy Hour too.,"3 stars is generous for my experience tonight. We came here upon the recommendation of a local bartender because the kitchen is open late and they apparently have ""really good food"". I realized I'd been here a few years ago, and although tonight was much less crowded, it was the same type of crowd. One of the bartenders had absolutely no interest in keeping an eye on customers/checking to see if new people came in. He was just focused on whatever inventory he was taking. This left us sitting at the bar waiting for someone to pay attention us for at least 7 minutes. Not a long time, but feels like an eternity when you want to order food and drink. And it was not crowded. Maybe 5 other people at the bar who all had a drink or food already. Finally another bartender came from the back and noticed us. Her name was Iffa(sp?), but she did not introduce herself. I found this out when asking after our mediocre experience. While she was bringing over both food and drink menus I asked her for two waters before she dropped them. She then somehow decided that I didn't need the food/bev menus, and started leaving with them after dropping the water. I said ""Oh no, I'll take those"" and she put them back down.  I ordered and Allagash white (which tasted really sour - did not finish it) and a catfish sandwich. My friend ordered one of the salads with shrimp. She didn't enjoy it and didn't care to take her leftovers. Which is weird to me, I feel like salad should be decent enough. I liked the fish that came with my order, the seasoning was great, but there was very little fish. Also...it didn't taste like, OR have the texture of catfish. Another similar fish maybe, texture-wise it reminded me of ""tilapia"". But the fries were decent. I asked the bartender about the catfish (whether it was actually catfish) and she said ""I've never had ANYONE ask about the catfish, this is the first time."" Okay, and...? I let her know that I've eaten a lot of catfish in my life and the texture/taste was quite different. ""I just had it last night. It's catfish. Maybe it's just a REALLY GOOD PIECE OF FISH""  I just gave her a look and said ""okay"". It was a very strange response, and she didn't seem to care that I was concerned about it being a fish that was mislabeled on their menu, if only for tonight. It was a huge turn off. Overall, would not return unless it was happy hour - I hear their food is worth the price during that time. Please get some more attentive bartenders for your late-night shifts.","Consistently great service. Go to spot for beers & apps - if you don't order the nachos, you're doing yourself a disservice.",Brooklyn Public House
693,I tried it twice the food was amazing and the prices are reasonable for the food portions. Veey low key but they need to work on their service skills...,"We order chicken and lamb, it was so dry, and they don't even have any sauces. They bring us water almost at the end of our meal.Everybody saying so many words about ""amazing"" complementary bread, but it's just Ok! And service is really very slow and not good, we were waiting 15 min to take order, and 15 min for the waiter to ask for a check...Definitely would never come again, sorry.",Worst chicken kebab I ever had.  Hot sauce is not hot.  Had much better kebabs from a truck.  Soup was good.  The king of falafel in Astoria blows the kebabs out of the water.  If the King opened one in Bayridge alot of places would be out of business.,"Do not be dissuaded from the appearance! The food here is phenomenal!!You just get their lamb haneeth. The meat literally falls off the bone. I cannot wait to eat it again! We also got the baba and hummus, both delicious, but the baba is what really blew my mind. It was so creamy that from the look, I thought it was hummus at first! But the taste is perfection. The meals come with a side salad (really not good but I didn't care because the main dish was so good, but they should update to fresh mixed greens or something) and soup! We also got the mixed grill kebabs which were also excellent. Out of curiosity I also ordered the fatah with honey -- it's basically sliced bread soaked with honey and baked and topped with a cream sauce. Doesn't look great, but taste is on point! Not too sweet! My only suggestion is for them to get better salad and more veggies.","This was my first time trying Yemeni cuisine, which I've discovered is tasty and quite hearty. My friend and I ordered a ridiculous amount of food, and before our waiter put the order in, he asked if it was just the two of us. When we said yes he said, ""Oh... I think you ordered too much."" We assured him that we knew and were already planning to pack up the leftovers.Holy mother of food, they give you a lot. To start with, you get a giant complimentary flatbread disc. Entrees come with a delicious lamb soup (which reminded me of the curry in roti canai), plus salad with pickled veggies and dressing. You also get hot sauce, which looks deceptively like salsa. Honestly, I could get full from eating all of these things alone.The fassolia (white kidney beans sauteed with onions and tomatoes) was our favorite item. The flavors were smoky and tomato-y and rustic, and the white beans added some carbiness without being too heavy.Both the chicken loubia and lamb haneeth were really tender and flavorful. The chicken shredded apart easily and was accompanied by a lot of veggies like potatoes and carrots. I really liked the vegetable sauce for the lamb. It had the slight thickness of okra without being overly slimy. I wish they'd given us more sauce though; we finished it halfway through the dish.The fahsah (tender slow-cooked lamb stew served bubbling hot in a clay bowl) was very, very thick and rich. It was tasty, but after a few bites the meat flavor was a bit overwhelming. We needed more veggies from the other dishes to balance it out.The waiters were nice, efficient, and happy to give us recommendations. But they also gave us space to relax, enjoy our food, and get deep into conversation without constant interruptions. Great service to go along with great food.","Great restaurant, the food is excellent.Lamb haneeth is excellent, cooked so tender and flavorfulThe baba ghanoush is great. The chicken zorbain is excellent and tasty. The rice is perfectly cooked and flavorful.The lamb soup and naan that comes with the meal is great. Great food and prices. Definitely going here again. One of my favorite restaurants.",Yemen Cafe & Restaurant
694,"Oh no.  Like so many other folks, I lunched here pretty much 5 days a week for years; it was a solid five stars for oh so many reasons.      But then things changed over this last winter, and the charm has gone, the friendliness has gone, but worst of all, the flavour and heartiness of the lunches has completely gone.  Alas poor Govinda.  I knew you well.","change in mgt and cooks has left this place not so good, really sorry to say since it filled a need with home cooked Indian food in a lovely atmosphere.  Now the atmosphere is different, there are no crowds, and the eggplant parmesan was inedible.","I got an allergic reaction from something I ate there and wrote them a message on Facebook politely asking for the ingredients to try to identify what the culprit could be as per my doctor's orders. UPDATE: They did get back to me.As for the review of the place/food itself - as everyone has noted its in the basement of a temple. Very plain and almost cafeteria / soup kitchen setting. There's a small section with the food that is served buffet style (CASH ONLY). Everything is vegan/vegetarian and the menu changes daily. Thursdays and Fridays are the most popular days because those are the days they serve eggplant parmesan.The food itself is affordable - $4 for one item, $6 for 2 items and $7 for one item with 3 sides. There's an $8 and $10 option as well and they give you a good amount of food. $4 for cake and $1 for cookiesIt was a little confusing though because given their menu I should've been able to get 2 eggplant parms for $6 but was told I would have to pay $8 if I did that. The wording of the menu did not make that clear at all.SERVICE:There's a woman there who was very friendly and pleasant, but there was also a guy there helping her who had a sourpuss face, unfriendly demeanor and nasty attitude. He made me feel uncomfortable every time I went up to look at the food (I got some food to go at the end of my meal) and made me not want to go back.While he was already in a sour mood before I had any interaction with him, I think the later bad vibes he sent my way stemmed from the fact that I handed him money over the counter and instead of him looking to see that there were quarters in my hand he simply dragged the money out of my hand, which resulted in some quarters ending up in the quinoa. He looked annoyed at me even though had he been paying attention he could have avoided that accident. (p.s. - he didn't change the quinoa container after picking the quarters out. EEK!)TIP #1: If you have t-mboile there's no internet connection in the basementTIP #2: CASH ONLY!TIP #3: Go on eggplant day (Thursday and Friday) but go early because it's their busiest day and they do sell outMajor gripes - very short operating hours, they do run out of the stuff you want, and the line can get really long",Love this place! food is so flavorful that makes me feel I can turn vegetarian..  and prices are very reasonable !!!!  it gets packed during lunch but the customer service is always excellent no matter the rush,"I was so hyped to come to Govindas because I heard it was so good. I have to give my disclaimer that I love a menu! I hate walking in blind as to what food options there are when I get to a place or I have to hover over others to see what the options are. I especially hate doing that when I can't identify what the food is. Alas, Govindas and I got off to a rough start. I came here especially for the eggplant parmigiana which was good. The slice is small- see picture. I also got some potato dish that possibly had curry or tumeric in it, cauliflower that had potatoes and other stuff -insert shoulder shrug- and a roti-like option they had. The portions are a bit small if you're on a traditional American standard diet. The eggplant Parmesan and roti thing I got were both dense so I had some of my sides to take home to compliment my dinner.I was told I could go on Facebook and see what being offered each day- no too helpful for a person that needs to see what it is. I think some labels on the glass would be helpful so patrons could know what it is. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but I would imagine that would be helpful so you don't order something that looked like it was ok for your diet and then it turns out it isn't. Also it would be helpful if the signs they have posted about the cost specifically states what was and was not included. Samosas NOT INCLUDED. Cupcake NOT INCLUDED. I don't know if I'll go back here with so many places in the area where I could spend $11 and know what I'm getting.","Very non greasy homecoming style food. Not sure about pricing but only few options available. I got tofu, eggplant, veggies with salad for $10. Cash only. It's very good, not restaurant style but super casual. If you choose to stay, you will also get a cup to get drinks.  I also got cupcake ($2), just fine (the topping isn't good). The cheesecake is super good! ($4 or $5) big slice with fresh prices of strawberry! The place is actually not far from Dekalb mall station or A/C train station. Recommendation - cheesecake",Govinda's Vegetarian
695,"This is overpriced average Thai food. They have great pricing power because there's not much competition in the area. The tofu pad Thai is ok. They DO NOT have pineapple fried rice.I rarely give two stars, but I called for delivery, which I won't do again, and I was left on hold for over 7 minutes without anybody returning to the line.","Review of Delivery:If I were eating here for the first time I would give it 3 stars, because that's about how good the food is.  What bothers me is that when this restaurant first opened they were serving beautiful, authentic Thai food (for isntance, a supremely piquant papaya salad garnished with crispy salty dried shrimp). But over the next few months they basically stopped trying, and all the food got gradually worse. Now it's just run of the mill ""Thai"" food, not particularly authentic.  They claimed they don't know how to make nam prik pla, the most common Thai condiment.  They use frozen vegetables in all dishes.  Their panang curry, listed on the menu as ""dry curry"" (which it's supposed to be), was a watery coconut milk soup.  When a restaurant gives up on itself this badly, it deserves to go out of business. Will not be ordering from here again.",the taste of the food is so so I dont know why I have to wait for the food delivery almost 3 hrs Jesus !! not order from here anymore,"The place looks very nice, comfortable for groups and the staff is very friendly.Papaya saladSo I'm not sure what happened here. Half of this salad were raw string beans, which were impossible to chew and I am not a fan of raw string beans, especially in my favorite papaya salad. It was also a little too spicy, it usually just mild Spivey for the flavor. Coconut chicken soup (Tom kha) It was good, but I felt like it was a diet version of the original soup. When you buy Tom khan you get a white creamy soup full of flavor. This one was watery and grayish(due to being watery, I am not saying it was weird color). Again, it felt like a dirt version, but it was good and I would order it again.Chicken skewersI usually don't order chicken screens because restaurant tend to burn them or over dry, but these were actually very good!Pumpkin flanMy first time trying it, and this was deff amazing! Such a delicious dessert to have any time of the year! Mango sticky riceThat's my favorite part of a meal in any Thai restaurant. The rice was a little too sweet though.Chicken wings I loved that they were still crispy even though were covered in mild spicy sauce.","I'm a huge huge huge South East Asian eater. I've been to Thailand and have experienced very good food.  I was very happy to see that we had a new Thai restaurant addition to our neighborhood. I had ordered the lunch special Chicken Pad Thai and added shrimp as extra.  I found the sauce to be to sweet for the dish.  There was barely any chicken in my dish and extra shrimp really meant 3.  There service was just ok. No one came up to me to refill my water after I finished it and was still eating.

696,"There are two halves, a restaurant and a pizza by the slice bit. Tried the pizza by the slice. It was fine. The guy behind the counter seemed stressed and talked us out of ordering the heros by telling us about a 15+ minute wait.","Absolutely the worst customer service. 3 hours wait on Friday night, multiple calls to restaurant with answers ""food is coming!"" and hanging up on me - never got the food and they canceled order at the end. Neither restaurant nor Eat24 reached out to fix situation. Shame, really, that they treat long standing customers who order from them weekly like throw away garbage. We ended up hungry, upset, and wasted at least an hour in phone calls instead of enjoying the evening.After all that, we just walked to Barboncino to get pizza. That what you should do, they have best pizza in the neighborhood anyway.","I'll first start off by saying, the food IS good. However, the service IS terrible as well and it's not worth going to this place to be VERBALLY ATTACKED by the bartender. I placed an order to go from the bartender with glasses. I'm not  sure what I did to him but, he placed my food on the table and proceeded to do whatever he was doing at the cash register. He didn't say ""here's your food,"" or anything. He just left my food on the table which was absolutely fine. As I picked up my food to leave he sarcastically yells at me ""You're welcome!"" I STILL said nothing to him and proceeded to leave. As I'm walking towards the door, he's talking OBVIOUSLY loud enough because he wanted me to hear him. He's talking to another patron saying about me ""She has a bad attitude!"" Again, I said not a word to the bartender the entire time... Is it my imagination that I'm supposed to please the bartender when I'm the paying customer? The people who work at Gino's are a reflection of the establishment. If it's ok for the bartender to bark at and talk poorly about one customer to another customer then fellow yelpers, please believe the bartender here one day might do it to you as well.Again, the food is good/ amazing but, it's not worth paying for AND getting cursed out by the bartender. :(","I have been doing business w/Marco for some time now for all my company events, and he is absolutely amazing.  There is nothing he cannot prepare.

Wow!! Only in NYC could I ask Yelp for a nearby Italian restaurant and have a lunch this excellent. Perfectly cooked salmon in lemon/garlic/etc sauce, to which the chef kindly added capers to make it my favorite. Very nice list of reds by the glass. Followed by yummy cannoli. Jose was as good as the food! Friendly and helpful in every way, including calling me a car for JFK. Highly recommended.","So I read some Reviews an saw that food is great which the food was really good but service was horrible due to a specific bartenders rude attitude I thought nothing of it an saw there pics of their food an decided to go there with my female friend to try it in which we also wanted to experience a new place together to make our favorite spot. We ordered to go and stood the whole time purchased our food was given the bag of food an signed receipt for debit card an of course 0 amount for tip because we ordered take out. After leaving my female friend wanted a specific sauce that she over heard the bartender offering another customer at the bar for their bread and she wanted to try it so I decided to go back an ask for the sauce that we had previously heard him tell the customer it was included when bread was ordered with food. He told me he will have to charge me an I freely said ""ok no problem at all"" and have him my card. I guess he thought that would bother me but then he decided to say ""well imma have to wait so he can attend to actual customers who pay him a tip"" in a very sarcastic rude way.. I was so in shock he said that ...I patiently waited just to tell him what was on my mind at the end. He took his time an slowly bagged 2 lil sauce containers an I told him it didn't need a bag an he said I recommend a bag so it don't leak I said ok. So after handing me the receipt again with charging me four dollars for two small containers of sauce he kept watching over my shoulder to see if I put a tip yet again I put 0 because all I asked was for sauce an that's it an plus with his attitude an rude customer service he surely didn't deserve one so I gave him the receipt an said to him next time when I dine in an he actually does work I will tip him an he said ""but didn't I bag ur food"" and said how I should google if a bartender should be paid if they bag ur food"" and I told him talking about google that he should google how to treat customers an also google how to call out of work or quit if he don't like his job if he wants to mix business an personal an be in his feelings telling customers the shit that he said about a tip...he tried his best to explain an I told him I have been in business work environments an run my own business for many many years an there's nothing he can tell me to justify him telling that he will attend to other customers first since they paid him a tip...and he ended the convo by tapping me on my shoulder saying ""u got it boss"" in a sarcastic way....*real talk this dude is a loser an I usually don't profile people but his actions an attitude he doesn't need to be working in a business rather picking up trash in a park or something.

697,The waiter said I had to get out the of the building because I was against trump. He also didn't give me a refund because I used trumps money. I said I was sorry but he said get the hell out of here. Also gave me a pizza but he gave it to me when it was burned with Obama's face on it. I said trumps wife only likes him because of his money. He instantly said that trump hated Hispanics referring to me as a Hispanic even though he was Hispanic. He ended the conversation with saying trump build a wall to keep you from moving.

I hate that you have to call to order as most of the time I order in a public setting as I'm on my way home so saying all my personal information out loud sucks also i rather just click a reorder button.

I've lost count of the savory slices that I have bitten into Sunday after Sunday after Sunday and more Sundays.While working in Brooklyn with youth for the summer, NY Pizza Sundays became a thing and you were our choice. Though you have an array of options, cheese and pepperoni were our go-tos without disappointment.The only true dissapointment was not being able to enjoy your cheesy goodness in time on the 4th of July. We entered too close to closing to be considered. All was forgiven, because we knew another Sunday would come. Thank you for making summer 2019 memorable. Eat here, people. Tony's is the real deal. NY baby.","Favorite pizza in NYC hands down! I've had so many great memories with Tony's over the years. I love seeing Tony's at The Taste of Bushwick year after year. Their buffet spread is DOPE every single time. I think the best part about them is definitely the staff. Everyone is SO nice, has a great personality, and is just really frikkin passionate about pizza. This past time I was in their location I was convinced to try 2 slices I'd never had before: the cheeseburger slice and their vodka pasta slice. The cheeseburger slice was literally beef, cheese, lettuce, tomato and like two pizza crusts with sesame seeds on top. It was so good. It even came with fries! One time I was having a party and ordered like 5 pizzas or so for delivery. When the order arrived we didn't even notice that one of our pies was supposed to be pepperoni instead of cheese. But they came back to give us an EXTRA pepperoni pizza without us even having to call!Anyways, definitely come and check them out. They deserve all the recognition in the world!","Living in ""deep"" Bushwick, I thought there wasn't any good places that would deliver. I don't know why but I yelped places (not for online delivery) and boom! This place is my new go to place for delivery from now on. Vegan options are legit and tasty. Crust is not too much with a nice softness to it. I ordered their chicken wings once, they came very crispy (almost panko crusted), very amazing!",Tony's Pizzeria & Restaurant

Not 5 stars ONLY because I'mNot a fan of their Bloody Mary and that's my go-to brunch drink ( they don't use vodka)... their mimosa is a good second  choice, no question. Check them out!","Excellent selection of beer. The food is well crafted.

The food is well crafted. The atmosphere lends itself to conversation and relaxation. A definite win for a ""loca"" l place.","I cant review the food, I don't eat there (although the food looks really good). I love the coffee. I go here 3-4x's per week for the past 4 years, so I think I have a pretty good idea of how things are run on average. I bring my friends for a beer when they are in town to visit.  I know they have a lot of repeat customers. The food prices are what you can expect around that area. With rising retail rents, it's what you can expect. Pros-The staff is always friendly-Clean and spacious -Good pastries (a little pricey)-Compared to establishments in the area, it has a good vibe-service is quick Cons-smells damp and mildew I think because of the brick structure and  darkness (it was not this way a few years ago so maybe a pipe broke) -gets a little loud but thats just the open acousticsOverall I think the place is decent. I read comments regarding people being ""ignored and no eye contact""I have never, ever experienced that at Local 61 and I go here very often. I would have given another star if it did not smell like mildew/damp. The coffee is really fantastic!",61 Local
699,"Um, I guess I was expecting top-of-the-top Southern cuisine and unfortunately, I didn't get that here.First off, the service definitely could've been bit better. When I had came in, I was quickly checking the menu and decided what I wanted. As soon as I was about to open my mouth, the staff took another order. I mean, I didn't know a person was standing behind me. I let that slide. As soon as I was about to open my mouth again, she was helping someone else. So in a nutshell, maybe the eatery should hire additional staff. I was waiting for about seven to ten minutes to place an order and it wasn't that busy.The quality of the food could've been better. I ordered salmon cakes with grits, candied yams and a corn muffin. My 17 bucks was not well-spent. The salmon cakes and grits were decent but I was not impressed with the yams and the very dry, deeply salty corn muffin. The yams was missing that ""yummmmm"" factor. Very blah-tasting. The corn muffin reminded me of the Jiffy corn mix box recipe from the supermarket. That was a total no.I do want to try other food dishes (like the chicken and waffles which is people's favorite) so all is not completely lost. I may give this place an additional visit.","I just called to explain how my food was not up to par that I ordered and the person who answered the phone ""young lady"" sounded like a Caribbean accent - her FIRST response was well why didn't you call sooner. That is an example of terrible customer service and I suggest someone else is responsible for answering the phone because she is not providing good customer service to those who paid for food they expect to taste good.",I left a review of this business speaking my opinion and the owner said I should die. This is totally unprofessional and inappropriate. I spent my money in this establishment and I have the right to my own opinion about food that I purchase. The main reasons for forums like these are for people state their honest opinions about businesses not for owners to say that people should die! I have posted the photo of the message that was sent to me. Dine here at your own risk. Leave a review of this business at your own risk as well. I know the difference between Kraft macaroni and cheese and GREAT macaroni and cheese dishes and that again was my right to have an opinion about something that I bought with my money. No one deserves to get death death wishes or nasty comments from an owner just because they don't agree with your idea of what great food tastes like. You can't be so sensitive when you're in the restaurant business. Everyone has a different pallet and desire for how they want their food to taste.,"Lordt. Where has this establishment been all my life?! Y'all let me tell you--I had some the BEST fried chicken here. I just really couldn't believe. The crunch was there, the flavor was there, the greasiness was not. There are so many options to choose from off their menu. I probably stares at that menu for 15 minutes before deciding to try the whole waffle with 4 wings. The waffle was buttery and sweet, and the red velvet was even better! I washed all of this down with their half and half. Some of the best half and half I've ever had--yes ma'am y'all read that correct. The service was really sweet--definitely a mom and pop establishment that's a staple in the neighborhood. There were locals in there that were super chummy with the staff. Highly recommend visiting this place! It's definitely my now new Sunday brunch spot.","I tried the chicken with red velvet waffles and let me say, the prices are AMAZING. It was $9 if I recall correctly for 2 wings with red velvet and it's $7 for two wings with plain waffles. Prices for chicken & waffles are usually upwards of $13. Although the prices are great, the flavor falls short. The chicken wings were rather skinny and lacked seasoning. The red velvet waffle was bland, like out of the box or something. It's not horrible thought I've had better chicken and red velvet waffles at Soco and Sweet Chick (when they had the Valentine's Day special).If you're looking for a quick and cheap meal, I would stop in. But if you're a chicken and waffle lover I'd say go elsewhere, even if it's a little pricier.",The food was decent but I definitely had better. I had the salmon cakes and grits and my daughter had the shrimp and grits. The grits was bland. The salmon cakes and shrimp was pretty tasty. My daughter also had a slice of the red velvet cheese cake and she said it was excellent. They do have a large selection of soul food on the menu so I will come back and try their lunch and dinner. This is definitely a no frills type of dining which I dont mind as long as the food is top notch. Too bad it wasn't.,Napoleon's Southern Cuisine & Bakery
700,"Ordered from here via caviar bc I was craving grilled chicken, I got the platter and my husband got the pita sandwich. Compared to oasis which is also closeby it was less flavorful, less meat. The platter literally had 4 tiny slices of pita, mostly rice and a few small pieces of chicken :( I guess the grilled tomato and onion piece was a nice bonus but eh. Ended up supplementing it with some food from our fridge because it was lackluster.","what a waste of $19. we ordered falafel sandwich specials which are supposed to be $13 total, but the lady who got my order said $15 over the phone. I asked twice and she said $15 for sure. thats why we tipped the delivery guy $3 tips even though my location is less than 5 blocks away from this location.It's our third time having issues and wanted to give them one more chance but not anymore.it's always the same lady who gets my order wrong and spending more than 5 mins to take easy orders (either 1 or 2 items). They ALWAYS messed up my orders and did not put either utensils or dips for fries.Their fries are extremely soggy or greasy. you should ask for less salt otherwise your tongue will shrink. disgusting.","After reading the reviews, I thought maybe we should definitely try this spot. I ordered through Caviar, we just received our food and are extremely disappointed and disgusted. We order one falafel sandwich and the falafel was broken into pieces as if someone ate the food. Is this just two pieces of falafel broken into small pieces to fill in the pita bread. What??? and the other order was a veggie sandwich for my husband which had a long blond hair in it. This is beyond disgusting! AVOID AT ALL COST!!!Attached are the pictures. I will never order from here again. I would give this ZERO STARS!!!!!","Truly the best falafel sandwhich in NYC (all five boroughs). Fight me Yelpers.There has no lunch break gone uncharted.. may it be still intoxicated.. may it be angry at the world.. I always come back to you, Kabob Shack.From the soup of the day always being the lingering question on my mind yet always being the same answer.. lentil soup. To the fliratious man child who always gives that extra 4 seconds of eye contact when handing over the greasy heavy bag of sweet, sweet satisfaction. I still quiver for you. You complete me. Thank you.","By all means stop by and get some food. Quick and friendly service, decent prices, and even better food. I'll for sure stop by again the next time I'm in the neighborhood.",The Kabob Shack is walking distance from me so it's definitely my spot.

701,This is my sister's fav brunch spot. Whenever we're around the area we always stop by here. So far we really havent had anything that we didnt like or can complain about. The staff is very attentive and stirs up conversations w u. Theres outdoor seating which we didnt get to see yet becos its always been cold or rainy when we go. Hopefully in the summer we'll get a chance to eat out there.,Ordered some things from here a little while back as a group and we all got sick from it! :( I had the Mac and cheese and it was ok but then it made me sick. Terrible experience. I wouldn't want to chance that happening again :(,"Food was good but not good enough to compensate for the poor service. We had to hunt down a server after waiting 15 min to ask for a coffee refill, and we waited at least 45 min for our food. (2 people, Steak and eggs, crepes and sausage).They seem to prioritize delivery orders over customers in the restaurant, even though the restaurant was not packed. Had to wait another 15-20 min for our check. Saw other customers also waiting a long time too. Probably won't go back unless it's just for cocktail (their mezcal Bloody Mary was quite good)","So good, The Egg Pesto Pizza and the French Toast breakfast .Sat in the back outdoor patio. The mood and atmosphere is pretty chill and is perfect for brunch or maybe an evening eat out.Would come back!","My wife and I have eaten here a few times, and have not been disappointed yet.From the Steak Frites, to the Rigatoni. The service is more than adequate and they have a backyard for those warm summer nights.","I recently helped host a bridal shower here and it went really well. We had a private back patio space (no extra cost) and we were able to decorate it how we wanted. There were 16 guests in attendance but you can definitely fit 10 more people if you needed to. My only two semi-complaints are that it rained the night before, so the floors were all wet (but they were able to mop it up), and there was scaffolding/construction going on, after we had already put down the deposit. Luckily, it wasn't too bad - it actually offered us a bit of shade so I don't think anyone was mad at that.We did the prix fixe menu for $35, which includes one alcoholic (or non-alcoholic), shared apps (guacamole, Nutella crepes, and lemon ricotta crepes), choice of entree (choose from about ten items), and dessert, which is tiramisu. The lemon ricotta crepes were nice and light. They made sure we were well fed with those apps because they just kept bringing them out. We were pretty much full after that but we still had the entree to go. I went with the chicken torta (grilled chicken, avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato, chipotle aioli). You really can't go wrong with that. It's a classic. Plus, it comes with fries. I was only able to finish about half.I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but it's a nice option if you are on a budget and need to host some kind of event.",Zona Sur Bar Bistro
702,"I ordered for pickup via Seamless yesterday. #5 turkey with mozz, red peppers, garlic mayo--YO for $11 [$9.75 + tax], I would expect the fucking panini to have more than 3 thin ass slices of turkey [see pic]. There was like no garlic mayo - certainly didn't taste like garlic. 2 small pieces of roasted red pepper. The bread was extra soggy.Sandwich wasn't worth the money. I'm extremely disappointed. Must be all the gentrifiers who are praising this place, bcuz IT AIN'T SHIT! oh, and when I went to pick up the sandwich - the dude at the counter was rude af, he acted like I was disrupting him.. ummm. C YA NEVER LULA BAGEL. #wack",How this place has four stars I don't know probably one of the worst bagels I had for such a highly rated place. I felt like I was eating a dense brick that was flattened with no taste.   Bagels were thinner than a salt and pepper shaker disgraceful.,"Bacon, egg, and cheese was BUSSSINNNN. On a toasted everything bagel, buttered, with hot sauce....BRUH. Thank you.","Lula Bagel, I'm not sure what I did to deserve you and that perfectly crispy, wonderfully smoky bacon you blessed me with this morning.I'm really at a loss for words to adequately describe how satisfying my bacon egg and cheese on an onion bagel was. All I know is that I am definitely going to be ordering from here again and trying other things on their menu, especially if they involve more of that bacon.","Alright fam, so my normal order is a cinn raisin bagel toasted with light butter. They were never amazing, but hey, beggars can't be choosers and the line at Bagel Pub on weekends is crazy.So, I get my bagel today, walk home, excitedly open it up, and what do I find. Legit the entire bagel had one raisin--one! Lowkey they also put so little cinnamon in their cinn raisin bagels that they honestly look and taste like a plain bagel. I say it's a bit of false advertising and they should probably change the name to ""one raisin bagls"" or something.To be fair, today I ordered two--one for my and one for my bro, and his had 3 raisins in it. So, I guess things aren't *that* bad???","I really enjoyed my egg salad bagel.  Their coffee was decent too.  My friend and I sat and enjoyed our bagel breakfast before setting off to the museum to see Frida.  While the bagels and vibe were nice (think spring and birds), the ordering experience wasn't the best.  The girl taking the order didn't seem to know exactly what she was doing.  The other girl behind the counter was clearly annoyed with someone or something, and the regulars behind us were in a hurry, and thus visibly annoyed with us taking too long to order.  There is also no bathroom for public use, even if you decide to sit and eat here.  So while I did enjoy my meal, I would probably look to try other places first before returning.",Lula Bagel
703,Food was horrible rice was like am having rice pudding however drinks was ok won't be going back,Ventured from Queens to Bklyn to try something new for a change. Waitress was friendly. Curry shrimp was curry but spicy if I didn't like spicy I definitely would've been annoyed. Peas and rice seems we got the bottom of the pot you know that burn burn crispy taste lucky for me that's the part I like. Music helped the vibe along with  the coconut crush. Oh and the big screen tv gives the right distraction.,"WOW! This place is excellent but not great. I've  visited a few times and food is on point and drinks  would come out slow and inconsistent. Now its opposite. Recently, my food was been ah. Lacklaster. But the bartender Vivian and drinks have been more in point recently!

704,"Ordered food from here at 9:15 PM. By 10:15 when it hadn't arrived someone at the restaurant said it would be to me in ten minutes. At 10:50 PM nothing had arrived, I was still starving to death and no one was answering the phone at the restaurant. A bit later I got an email that the order was cancelled. Really really terrible service. If they can't complete an order they should let the customer know before hours go by and it's to late for them to order anywhere else.",Meh. Not terrible but really not great. Once you mix the slaw in it all just tastes the same. I was famished and only ate 1/4 of it. Should've just grabbed a fruit.,4 vegan vegetarian stars.

Will try them next time.,Flavor bombs!! Best Korean tacos in NY!!!! And I've tried many.Huge tacos even if you ask for it on a corn tortilla it's still huge and stuffed. Sooooo much better than those dried out and skimpy overpriced Takumi mini Tacos.Great kimchi! I wish they'd add a beef Bulgogi (Korean style BBQ) taco because it's perfect for a taco. Go eat there now!,"Cute little spot but nothing spectacular.They use two thick tortillas which is really overwhelming and heavy. I ended up picking out the meats, which tasted good! The five spiced pork was my favorite, then chicken, then steak (too tough). The tacos get soggy QUICK, but I'd go with the recommended sauce and toppings. But for $2.50 a taco during happy hour, pretty unbeatable deal!!","6 stars.

705,"I came here on a whim after spending time at BBB. Figured since it was on the same floor, why not give it a try. Im picky at times when it comes to my burgers so when the person taking my order tells me ""Burgers are only cooked to Medium here"", I was a little taken back. I asked if it could at least be medium well and she said no. Now, last I checked, there was a whole problem going on as of late around the country with people eating food that isn't cooked properly or things that had salmonella etc, so the first thing that entered my mind was "" I dont wanna get sick"". In any case, I ordered 2, one for me and one for my wife with an order of fries. We sat down and I started to get the crave for Mac and Cheese which they were kinda featuring in the menu. So I went back and ordered the mac and cheese. We were given a number and sat down and waited.Food arrived, and I will say the food looked amazing. The burger was ok, the bread was completely soggy and broke apart after the 2nd bite. The french fries were magnificent, I have to be honest. However, with every bite of the burger, my desire to finish it became less and less. I dont know if it was that I can actually taste the difference between Medium and Medium well, or the texture of the burger was getting to me.Then the Mac n Cheese arrived. I was SO DISAPPOINTED. This has got to be the most blandest Mac n Cheese I have every had. I mean wow, it claims to have several cheeses, but you don't taste any of them. Or atleast, I didnt taste any of them, but then again, neither did my wife. We were barely able to eat half of the mac n cheese because it just didnt taste good. It didnt have a taste period. I see some people rave about this place, but sadly, not me, I am not a fan and will not be coming back either. But hey, I am just one person with an opinion. Many people like it here, so maybe the next set of people will too.","TLDR good food, bad customer service at nightThe burger was good, but the experience wasn't. My friends and I chose to go to Bay Market Kitchen because it was open til 8 on yelp.Little did I know they didn't bother to change it when they close at 7 on Fridays (according to management) The guy who looked like the manager told us kitchen closed at 7 when we arrived at 6:30. We told him we would order as soon as we read the menu. 2 mins sitting down and, he screamed ""hurry up and order"" from the counter. As each one of my 6 friends ordered, he screamed ""NEXT"" every time. Also called us kids when giving us food when we were all employed adults.  Yeah I wouldn't go back... looking at another dinner review... maybe they should put closing hour to 5:30 instead to prevent bad closing cx.","Sorry I dont think I've ever experienced worse tasting food. The burgers were bad the shake was worse. I had strawberry, and the lemonade was lack luster. Sorry only came to eat here because of the bed bath and beyond. Besides that eat before you get here. Trust me save the money for bed bath.","First I wasn't sure about the food because it's inside the shopping mall. I ordered double king cheese burger with blue cheese. I am pretty sure that's the best burger around Brooklyn. We have a lot of fancy burger at Park Slope, but this one blew my mind. I asked medium and it came medium. I will say the whole crew nice, smiley and attentive.Ps: one more thing who complained about price food ratio or $10.00 burger ' There is a Mc Donald's around the corner'","steadily 4stars. had the burger which was 6oz, pretty small. but cooked to order. i had it medium and it was juicy. there is a chipotle sauce on top that makes it even better. add jalapenos and it was money! my petty complaint was that if youre gonna have a small burger, make the bun a bit smaller so at least my first and last couple of bites isnt just plain bread. staff is always nice here. love the sunset by the window.","great for a relaxing meal. you order by the counter and they bring the food to you, nobody to pester you. i usually go during the weekday where it's quiet and there's nice seating by the window. food is pretty good. been having the cuban and the fried chicken sandwich. cole slaw on the sandwich is money. i will be back for HH 4-7.",Bay Market Kitchen

Anyways we ordered a whole chicken, tostados, and yuca it was the best. Nothing but great reviews for this place will be eating it again soon!!","Totally blew my expectations out of the water!

From the food to the amazing staff to the prices and portions - I'm so grateful I live so close. The good is 100 times better than the famous chain, and seriously everything is delicious every time we visit - even their rice and beans are amazingly flavorful.

707,"It must have been an off day when I visited. Out of the 18 flavors of ice cream on their menu, they only had 5. I was kind of upset because I wanted to finally try the 12 scoop palette.I ended up ordering the 5 scoop sampler for $10.95. The toppings that they placed on top of the ice cream were either stale or unappetizing.Thai Tea- Still my favorite flavor. It never disappoints.Mango- Delicious and refreshing. You really taste the mango flavor.Vanilla Bean- Good.Black Sesame Seaweed- Not very strong with the black sesame flavor, which I do prefer, but it was just okay to me.Roasted Thai Coconut- I wasn't particularly fond of the savory taste, it really overpowered the coconut flavor.Despite my complaints, the quality of the ice cream is always good. Next time, I'll call and ask how many flavors they have before visiting. I still want to try the 12 scoop palette.","This is only for the take out that we ordered.Usually we always sit down for a meal, but it's extremely tight and packed usually, so with a cranky toddler, decided to get a takeout as it was almost closing time.The server said that the kitchen would be closing in 30mins and we said okay, we will get pad Thai.When we got home, the food was anything but pad Thai. It was vermicelli noodles and no peanuts, of beans or any other things about pad Thai.And it was awful, like someone's leftover packed up, it was cold, chewy and rubbery.The servers should atleast take the time to check, or let us check before bagging up the food and getting rid of us.",Staff wasn't very nice and no one bothered to give any change back when you've never said they can keep everything as tip... A bit rude imo.,"A friend and I checked out SkyIce yesterday night before a Blink-182/Lil Wayne concert at Barclays, and wow we were totally blown away by everything we tried! Firstly, the staff here is lovely and very, very nice - so warm and welcoming! You feel very taken care of here, and they pay consistent attention to your table, even simple things like refilling your water multiple times. I mention this as some places I've been to seem allergic to refilling water and, y'know, paying attention to you lol. The Krapraw Gai Sub is a must if you like things on the spicier side; the chicken and veggies have a delicious, flavorful kick to them. I highly recommend ordering the ((extremely good, perfectly sweet)) Thai Ice Tea as a cold complement to the dish, so you can cool down the heat! My Massaman Curry had a very rich coconut milk base with a dialed-down amount of spice, so I recommend it for those who are fans of something a bit more mild. I ordered it with roti, which was exactly as chewy and toasted over as I'd hoped. You probably have seen a ton of pictures of their ice cream sampler, and for good reason: there are many interesting flavors to try! My friend and I enjoyed getting the 12-flavor sampler; it felt like an adventure finding the ones we liked best. We're both chocolate fans so we really liked the Belgian Chocolate Brownie flavor (sadly, the Banana Nutella one was sold out, really wanted to try that), as well as the Caramel Sea Salt. Green Tea was refreshing, as well as the scoop of Thai Ice Tea. We didn't really take to the Durian, Mangosteen (tasted like medicine/weird vegetable!!), and I wanted to try the Lychee Rose sorbet too but they had run out. Anyhow, SkyIce is an absolutely perfect place to stop by before a Barclays show, especially to catch up with your friends in a cute and cozy spot. We got there at 5:30 on a Friday night and it wasn't packed at all. Go and enjoy!","Had been meaning to try this for a while.  The palette offered the most variety, although only eleven flavors were available and thus I doubled up on the chocolate sorbet.  A few flavors were odd, such as the black sesame seaweed.  The cucumber and the mango were refreshing.  The top three for me were the thai tea, thai coffee, and caramel sea salt, with a possible tie for the latter two being best.  List of flavors from non-oblique angled picture - (Clockwise from bottom left) thai coffee, chocolate brownie, thai tea, raspberry cilantro (IIRC), chocolate sorbet, chocolate sorbet, mango, cucumber, black sesame seaweed, green tea, caramel sea salt, white miso almonds (IIRC)","This is a small mom and pop Thai restaurant that is known for the ice cream that they make in house. Thai food is definitely not in my wheelhouse of expertise, I suspect that 95% of my Thai food experience is Americanized take out Thai since I'm a spice weakling who can't handle fiery food. With that said, I did enjoy the food I had here, even if I could only get through half while downing my entire lovely thai iced coffee to neutralize the spiciness burning my tongue. Somtum: Papaya, Carrot, Tomato, String Beans, Peanut, Lettuce - This salad was a crisp way to clear our palate before starting on our spicy noodles. The ingredients were fresh and crunchy. This may be my own Thai food inexperience, but I was expecting ripe papaya - with the underripe tartness of the papaya, it actually went quite well with the other salad ingredientsPad Thai Woonsen: Clear Bean Thread Noodle, Egg, Peanuts, Bean Sprouts, Scallion, Turnip, Smoked Tofu and Sirloin beef - this is my own fault, in my head I thought pad thai was always made with a flat noodle which I was craving, but this was made with a thread noodle. Still quite delicious, and I have to make a point that the bean sprouts were actually fresh and crisp!My friend got a flat noodle with chicken which was absolutely delicious - I'm a total sucker for wide flat noodles.Of course we had to save room for the 12 scoop ice cream sampler! Tiny scoops of varying flavors (you get to choose) are plopped onto a platter for your enjoyment so you can decide which flavors you want to buy full pint sizes of to take home for later enjoyment. Some of the toppings are a little silly and do not compliment the flavors, but the ice cream itself is wonderful. * Thai Tea, Thai Coffee and Pea Flower Thai iced tea flavors - all delicious, but similar(but take that with a grain of salt since my tongue was still recovering from the spicy noodles)*Roasted Thai Coconut vs Belgian Chocolate Brownie - both had seriously buttery notes that makes me think they would be a dream on waffles*green tea, vanilla bean, caramel sea salt - all well done, but not striking*mango ice cream vs mango sorbet - Ah, I couldn't decide which I liked better, I think I need a pint of each to do some additional ""research""*lychee rose sorbet - one of my favorite flavor combinations in general, this was light, refreshing - and would be amazing mixed into an alcoholic cocktail*cucumber lime - sleeper surprise, at first I wasn't sure if I liked it since the sorbet is almost salty, but the more I ate this, the more I really enjoyed it (would also go great in a cocktail). The sorbets would really be great in an alcoholic sort of ice cream float!I'll have to pick a couple of Thai friends' brains now to school myself on traditional vs americanized thai food. But regardless, I'd definitely come back for the lovely food and service here. They have creative ice cream floats, and between the drinks, food and service, this really is a neighborhood gem.",SkyIce Sweet & Savory
708,"Wednesday morning rush wasn't too bad at this coffee shop. Moderate wait time allowed me to look over the menu off to the side - displaying many specials and even boasting about homemade scones.Wanted to get their homemade blueberry scone, but they didn't have any available yet. Instead, settled on the Cheddar Chive Scone ($3ish) and a Large Maple Latte ($4ish). Scone is okay, dulled flavor in such a big pastry (should have opted to add butter/jam). Maple latte has big maple-ish taste and provided a moderate kick.There was still some stool seating available - couldn't sit & wonder inside however. Overall an okay experience, would want to try their normal muffin+coffee next time.","This place has great food and coffee! Only problem is barista named Emma who is perhaps the most incompetent brat I've ever encountered...Will probably never be back,unfortunately, since my encounter with this person was so negative that it generally made Sit and Wonder not feel like a safe place for me to hang out at- a big shame!","My favorite place. In. The. Whole. Wide. World.If you don't like this place you are really, really, REALLY, stupid.Seriously. You are a stupid person. Seek help.Staff is amazing.",Great little coffee shop! This place was perfect for working because they had enough tables and it was much quieter than a Starbucks. The coffee and the scones were also delicious!,Cute and spacious place. Nice and informative staff. Had a cafe latte with almond milk. Almond milk tasted burnt. I guess they need to change their almond milk.,Sit & Wonder is a great stop for coffee if you're in the area and looking for a trendy place that has good beans (they use Stumptown). There are a fair amount of spots to sit and chat or a few tables in the back big enough to work on your laptop and they do have WiFi. There's also a small outdoor area to the back for when it's nice outside. Baked goods look great and made in-house.,Sit & Wonder
709,"How is it possible that a year later, I walk in here for dinner, and have the exact same experience!? That has never happened!After twenty long minutes of staring awkwardly at empty plates and glasses, no less than 9 servers and bussers begin immediately attending to our table, and an invisible switch gets flipped to turn things to supersonic speed. At that point, YOU GET YOUR ASS RUSHED. And we certainly weren't alone--unasked for checks were getting awkwardly dropped along our entire row of tables. Turn it over! Turn it over! On closer inspection the second time, with the smoked mirrors, and the faux marble walls (cheesy, painted) this place is looking to appeal to the New Jersey mall crowd that somehow got lost in Williamsburg and wants some pizza. Uy.The food, just like last time, is FINE. Pizzas are GOOD.You get murderous-looking SHEARS to cut your $25 pizza. Be prepared to cover your ears from the cheering from adjacent patrons: ""what???! I get to cut this myself!!!! YAY I'm half-drunk and I want nothing more than to messily start slicing through my own pizza splattering sauce on all my clothes!!!""A bro drunk on a cheap red wine loses a finger here nightly, I guarantee it. Pretentious, obnoxious, and foolhardy, the shears could get lost with nary a complaint. Not-terrible desserts are the size of a thimble, but Barano seems almost aghast at having you stay that long. You drop $150 on an experience that gets squeezed into 70 minutes. Just...why?! WHY. There. Are. So. Many. Better. Places.This is the know-nothing's version of an on-point Italian hotspot. However, they are friendly, and mean well: this place, graceless, trying too hard, and simultaneously lost in its confusing expectations, will never be for me.","We had dinner for six. Everyone raved about what they had, six different dishes. So you can't miss. Definitely get the cold board antipasta. We doubled up on that, so good.","High quality food. Went for brunch and it wasn't crowded. Recommend the smoked mozzarella, asparagus pizza, and pancakes. Great service too. No complaints.","Get by my buddy Jonny Alphabet's spot in Williamsburg for a weekend brunch.  You'll likely find him at the door. The kitchen doesn't require my endorsement, it speaks for itself. The feel of this spot though is what makes it one of my favorite spots in Brooklyn. It's unforced. Comfortable. Just a really cool place to spend a hour or two.","Very cute italian restaurant in Williamsburg. The interior was a combination of classic/rustic. Service was great from beginning to end. The waitress checked in on us frequently and our water glasses were always filled. My friend and I shares the meatballs and they were so moist and juicy. Just the right amount of sauce and cheese. On that note: I do not believe the restaurant serves complimentary bread which is a strike in my books cuz what kind of Italian restaurant doesn't offer bread for the table. I think there was an option to order a side of their house bread though. I had the grilled skirt steak as my entree and it was as tender as a skirt steak could be. Very well cooked and seasoned. It came with polenta fries which definitely missed the mark. It was beyond salty to the point of almost inedible. I had to drink a ton of water to wash down the taste. Really a shame since it was so well fried. Overall a nice dining experience, just some hits and misses along the way.","I try to get to Barano at least once every two months. In terms of Italian food, this may be my favorite most consistent restaurant in NYC. It's in an awesome area, the restaurant has a great vibe, the prices are reasonable, they have an extensive but focused wine menu, they constantly innovate their cocktail menu and they add new pastas and desserts every 2-3 months. That being said, unless I am with a group, I find myself ordering the Njuda pizza and the Saffron Gigli which have remained as staples in the menu.The Njuda pizza combines a sweet and spicy sausage which has more of a meat sauce texture to it with honey and the classic margarita pizza components. The crust is a Neapolitan style dough but it is a bit thinner and crispier. The Saffron Gigli is a bit more difficult to describe and it is confusing the first time you try it, but it reminds me of a comfort food with its sweet, salty, light tomato and of course saffron flavor. You may want to save your pizza crust to wipe the bowl clean. Their Bronzino is solid and their cavatelli is also awesome if you are looking to order more than who I order. I've also enjoyed nearly all of the dishes on their menu, but again, it is difficult for me to stray from my favorites. If you find time to get there for brunch, their faro bowl is awesome, the carbonara is one of the better carbonaras I have ever had(although I order it without the egg on top, just a personal preference) and the smoked salmon pizza makes me feel like smoked salmon belongs on a pizza and not a bagel. I will be back many more times.",Barano
710,"This place is a gem. My husband and I live in the neighborhood and we'd walked by a bunch of times. We finally stopped in today and it was lovely. Such friendly staff and delicious food. We had the brisket grilled cheese and the big bite. Probably one of the best sandwiches I'd ever had in my life. Solid Bloody Mary, (I'm a Bloody Mary expert) spicy but not shitty/tabasco hot sauce spicy (that's the worst, it's also lazy. I prefer horseradish spicy) this bloody didn't taste like it had any horseradish in it, but it had a wonderful depth of flavor and a sort of smoky heat that I really enjoyed, not heavy handed on the worchesire. Coconut cold brew was very cute with the toasted coconut rim presentation, but it doesn't taste like it's brewed with coconut water...like I've had at other places. But overall A+.","I loved this place so much , as you can see from my review from three years ago, but it has gone DOWNHILL. New ownerships, and terrible kitchen staff. The food made me gag today. We have been going here almost 4 times a month and more for coffee and it's just not worth it anymore. New ownership also made it look really urban outfitters, which wouldn't matter if the food was good. Such a sad day for the neighborhood but it's definitely not good anymore. (Also service has never been great, but I love the crew there.)",I ordered takeout recently. Food was okay but the portion for the price was laughable. I got the Guatemala traditional breakfast but it was a miss and still felt hungry afterwards. The plátanos were undercooked. The eggs were a sad omelet and not scrambled with a sprinkle of cold tomatoes. Will give it a shot next time I'm around the neighborhood but will make sure to dine in!,"After I endured the ""Red Eye"" from LAX to JFK last night I find myself in Brooklyn, tired as triathlete after a competition, hungry as a bear coming our of hibernation and in need of a caffeine fix. Enter my #2 son (out of 4) to take care of Dad!He takes me to this cute, small bar /  restaurant around the corner from him here in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn. The breakfast-lunch menu has a lot of Latin named and flavored dishes, and we settled for:*Huevos Divorciados - is a classic Mexican breakfast dish served with two freshly made Salsas, a bottom layer of potatoes and warm tortillas. This dish was really excellent and restored my faith in NY Latin cooking.*Guatemala Tradicional with chorizo guate - scrambled eggs tossed and turned with a really delicious chorizo and served with flour totrillas and a real hot Hot Sauce*Classic Burrito - not your Taco Bell or Chipotle fast food burritos. The C.Lo Cafe's had chops (not literally - Figuratively). My son consumed this wrap so fast, I didn't have time to ask for a bite - esh, and I was paying.The coffee they served was very good and not the rocket fuel served down the street at Variety Coffee. In most cases I go to Variety to get revved up for the day. At this stop I had coffee and a much needed nap afterwards which I was able to take.This Breakfast was Perfect!",This is my favorite easy brunch spot. Its so delicious and fresh. The atmosphere is quiet and chill which makes for a relaxing breakfast.I LOVE IT,"So, i've now been here twice and remembered from the first time that the food was good. It still is. The problem is that the service is mediocre. They care too much about keeping the place prepped that they sometimes forget about you the customer. There were 5 employees at the time working, and only about 6 customers The runner brought me someone elses dish, no big deal as I told them. My dish came out a few minutes later and the food was good. A huge pet peeve of mine is not getting water refills and having to ask for it, specially when the glasses are tiny like they are here. My glass was empty when the food came out and I didnt get more till I was done with my food, and I had to ask for it as no one checked in with me. I understand they had a lot of to-go orders, but i'm sitting at the counter. I really like your food, but I wont be back.",C.Lo Cafe
711,Spacious sports bar for Brooklyn. Impressive draft list and OK bar/pub-type food.  Nothing particularly special about the food and drinks but it will do for a day of watching games.Over the years the prices have gone up a lot and I'm not sure that this type of place warrants expensive food and drinks which is why I'm giving a lower review than normal. :/,"Went to go see the Pacquiao-Broner fight last night as it was advertised on their Instagram and website that it was a simple $10 entry to get in to watch it. Was really looking forward to just grabbing a beer and watching the game. Some idiot teenagers making a lot of noise and harassing the bouncer happened to be in front of me. It's one thing to have some dumb-ass kids making a ruckus in front of your bar. I get that. It's annoying. But you as the owner of the establishment have the right to refuse people entry in to the place and you should have done so right away, instead of fighting with them, as if that would solve the problem.Instead of handling these kids in a professional manner, the security bouncers, a man and the woman behind the glass door continued to handle these teens' behavior in a ridiculous manner, not only NOT giving entry to the other potential patrons who were GROWN and acting like adults, but then not even giving information about when people would be able to enter the establishment. Why didn't they just tell the kids to go home? Somehow, bickering with children and yanking on the door and threatening each other seemed to be a better option for security and management at Brooklyn Tap House.This nonsense carried on for a good 20 minutes if not more, leaving a lot of folks out in the LITERAL cold as it was raining as well.I will never come back to this place and if you're looking for a place to go for fight night, seriously there are better options and I will be heading elsewhere.","Quality has declined greatly in the past several years. The beers rotate less frequently, have gotten sick eating here, and remarkably slow service. Such wasted potential","Visited Brooklyn Tap House with a group of friends for wing night. Every Monday wings are 50 cent , must order a minimum of ten wings to participate. 10 wings for 5 dollars , not bad at all. downsize is that you can only have one sauce. I ordered the garlic Parmesan wings , wings were well done as requested however the wings were missing a little flavor. But overall tasty. My friend ordered the hot wings and the other two had grand Pete and sweet and sour. I didn't try the sweet and sour but the grand Pete flavored wings were ok. The best in my opinion were the hot wings. To my surprise the bar wasn't packed. Also on wing night, water is not free. You have to purchase water. Overall our dining experience went well. Was stuck bt providing a rating of 3-4, because our waitress was rude. Can't stand rude people , because of her poor service we only left her a four dollar tip. In my opinion 4 dollars is better than no dollars. On Tuesday's the food menu is 50 % off.","Wings fatter than a Trump tax cut for the 1%. Friendly and effecient service, even when the place is packed with denizens watching a championship fight. More beers on tap than I can drink in a month. Nice, cavernous spot for sports with plenty of TVs.","Ok.  Soooo where do I begin.   This place.  I have been here about 10 times. Every time not the moat friendly place.  At all. Bartenders are kinda rude. The women especially.  Never not one time have they said hello or offered me another beer. Not once. Always have to ask. Which is funny due to the fact that i am tipping and spending money.   The guys have been very friendly. The first night i came here i spent 97 dollars...i was alone.  I ate and drank, etc. I am from New Orleans so i have been spoiled with hospitality.  And frankly expect it when i spend my hard earned fucking money. Anywho. So the girl gave me my check. And i left 20 on the check. On 97.  Well. It pending on my account was 97 for 4 days. Once it cleared it was 140. I was like wtf. Well once i looked at the receipt i realized they added 20% on there own. Nothing wrong except the bartender did this and said nothing. I blame myself..... i am a very trusting person and I didn't read the receipt. I usually leave 20% so that is what i did.  Fact is the bartender should have said, ""hey, i added 20 goddam dollars on my own"". Shady to say the least. Shady af.  I called to talk to the owner 8 times over 7 days. No return call. I had to come here to talk to him and even then I didn't....i finally talked to him. He gave me a 20 credit which was cool.   But the way the bartenders treat me it is almost as if i am not welcome. I am white. Not saying that but it seems that way. I like the atmosphere and it is close. Well it is not coincidence. I get treated this way every time.  No hello. Not even are you hungry tonight.    Advice.  They could care less for your business and the owner doesn't really care either.  Dood is good if i could order some. Long long story short. Leave this place to die.  It is never busy and i am sure they wonder why.",Brooklyn Tap House
