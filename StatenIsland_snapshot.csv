0,"Update on September 7 2019 - Stay away from this place. I had initially given this place five stars due to the quality of some of the food but brought it down to 3 stars due to owner aggression and I liked going there. I also liked buying deals to go there which were available. The last time I went there before today I met an obnoxious man who was aggressive, whose behavior was inappropriate and went way over the line in terms of professionality. I mistakenly thought that the obnoxious man who went over the line just worked there, he looked like a maniac with a white baseball cap on and  was strangely aggressive. What do I mean by that? I went ahead and kept the review I put below  which describes a creep who actually came up behind me when I took my phone out and violated my space. He was craning his neck to see what I was looking at on my cell phone. No joke he behaved as if he felt that since I was on his turf that is the restaurant, he had the right to violate my space and see what I was looking at. What if I had been looking at nude pictures of my husband? He would have seen it like an obnoxious adolescent. It was really violating my space and I was shocked but that was just the tip of the iceberg with this arrogant disrespectful man. when my son had gone up to show him the Local Flavor coupon he actually had my phone in his hand and  started swiping right to see the other screens on my phone. My son said he did that when he thought he wasn't looking. When my son caught him, he said the creep quickly swiped back to the coupon page.  I was definately angry about his aggression and violating my phone and space so rather than give a five star review I should have actually given it a One star review but I thought the creepy guy was a worker. There is no identifying picture on my Yelp account and my kids liked the food, so we returned today. Before I could even take out my phone, the creep approached my table again. He said that he did not appreciate my ""bad"" review on Yelp  I said ""I gave you 3 stars because you tried to look at my phone and actually swiped the screen when you were supposed to be copying the coupon code""  How did he know I gave him that review? the picture on my Yelp account is me at 2 years old. He knew it was me because he recognized what he did when he read my Yelp review that is how. He said I am the owner, in your review you said a man who worked here, the other man is just a worker, I am the owner and I did not like the ""bad "" review. I said 3 stars is not a bad review one star is a bad review. I told the truth that your behavior was inappropriate and aggressive. He then said he would not honor any coupons from Local flavor and that he received zero money from Local flavor and refused to honor any coupons because he pretty much told me by giving him 3 stars as my yelp review, he could not honor any coupons again. I told him i wanted to leave and my two kids and I left. He is an aggressive, inappropriate ""owner"" because now I have witnessed this incident along with my two kids one of whom is an adult and we intend to tell Local Flavor how obnoxious he is and demand our money back for the unused coupon cause we are NEVER returning to this hole in the wall place ever again. Below I left the original review just so people reading this can see what a creep the owner really is parading around trying to look at people's phones when they are sitting at a table in ""his"" restaurant. Stay Away!*Original 3 star Review:Delicious food everytime. The owner is friendly and I really like going there. I do not like the man that works there and his nosiness. I took my phone out and he came up behind me to see what I was looking at I don't know the man's name but when my son went up to him with my phone so he could get the discount code for our coupon, he actually got the number then back paged it and looked at my other coupons when he thought my son wasn't looking. I didn't know how to yell at him but I was shocked at how he then asked me to write a Yelp review or google review.","The worst restaurant i've ever ordered from grubhub . Firstly i ordered mild , the food was so spicy that i couldn't eat . I ordered take out as there was only nearby indian restaurant , i ordered a chicken biryani and literally there was just two small chicken pieces of chicken. What a shame to see a formerly great place fail on so many levels. But we thought sometimes mistake happens and then next day we went there for dine in ....................HORRIFIED EXPERIENCE! They cooked out Tandoori and still messed it up!!! We both me and my wife ordered medium rare but got well done and grey, then raw and medium well. We gave up on the 3rd time and ate what we could. My wife had 3 different temps in one tandoori and i had 1/3 perfect and 1/3 charrded hokey puck. They gave it to us on the house but I feel like a indian house should be able to cook tandoori lol. Manager was rude wearing a cap ! Also waiter was rude, inattentive and unapologetic. If i was a boss i would have kick both of them . And I have sent a message  2 weeks ago and no one has responded. Poor customer service on their website as well! I never use to complain any restaurant but , i felt like doing it so i created an account and did it. I saw the owner's comment how he is reacting to other's comment and that was rude too. Guy thinks he is an american lol !!! Racist and pooorr service that he can provide to us as an Sl... .....","Awful is an understatement!Ordered take-out, the food was pathetic. The rice was SO stale, never in my life have I had rice that bad. As for the entrees, each dish was a container filled with sauce with exactly, 5 small peices of meat. As if they counted how many peices of meat to add. Over the phone I asked for extra chutney sauce for each order. He said he'll put extra chutney and tamarind for each. When I picked up my order, he had only put one of each. I went back in to ask for extra sauce since I had 5 orders! He gave me one more of each. This stingy attitude is terrible. God knows how else the owner cuts corners. All the dishes, like the chicken Tikka masala were watered down and flavorless. Only the curry had flavor. Needless to say will never be going back.","So usually me and my boyfriend order take out here but today he decided to bring me to the actual location. The second we stepped in our server greeted us and asked if we need help ordering. I was shocked because usually servers don't really give a damn but this guy, he cared. Now 51 on the menu ( chicken chettinad) was one of the best dishes I've ever had. The flavor was amazing and even though we ordered spicy the coconut in the dish balanced it out perfectly.","Excellent Indian food. The best ever. Everything was freshly cooked with fresh ingredients, every item we ordered came out better than the next. We had Curry Chicken and Samosas and they were fantastic. We really intend to return at least once a month as we had been waiting for a good Indian place in Staten Island for a long time.","You can't beat their Chana palak! The samosa are on the spicy side (not a complaint) and truly delicious. Really friendly and vegan / vegetarian friendly owners, too. They deliver everywhere so I hope folks will try them since their location is a little less than ideal. I'd hate to see them close up shop like lots of businesses in that shopping center do.",Thali Bar Baar
1,"I've been working in the area for 3 weeks and eat here a couple of times a week. I've had steak,pasta, seafood & pork chops all consistently good. I'm obsessed with the lemon sorbet. Staff is attentive but not intrusive.","Overpriced place, I ordered the pork chops if they where any smaller you would need glasses too see them on the plate .. Plates are over priced food was  average ........","The quality of the steaks at this place have never disappointed. Price matches flavor, especially if you're a meat perfectionist. The accompanying garnishes (veggies etc.) pale in comparison to main course prep but it's a small detail and still puts together a quality dish. Parking is tough when it's crowded so get there early !","Wow this place was straight up out of a movie. Classic steakhouse in Staten Island. I was blown away by the service. The accents were tickling me, I couldn't get enough of it. The steak I had was one of the best I can remember. The sides were fantastic! I had no idea you could get such good creamed spinach and Steak on Staten Island. I was just passing through, very glad I stopped. There was plenty of parking, they were so fast with service as it was lunch time. I was so pleasantly surprised at this small steakhouse, I would say the people that live in this small town are very lucky to have it.","If I could give this place and these fine artists with food more than 5 stars I'd do it.I've now eaten here 3 times. The quality of the meat is exceptional, tender and properly cooked. The salads are fresh with a really smooth home recipe horseradish dressing - all optional - of course. They listened to me say that I didn't like girly sweet drinks and suggested the smoky old fashioned-- and shared a bit of the recipe. The pie!!! WOW!! who'd have thunk that pecan pie could be this good north of Richmond. But- its still called PEE-CAN ""we're south of you, but we're not in the south"" they said. And, ambience in the room is just right. Clean, calm, light enough to eat and see the colors of the great meat.... but still dark and relaxing after a long work day.... Wooden bar and decor  is calming. Staff is smart, well versed in the menu and listens to what you want. If you have a chance to eat here and don't, you're a damned fool.","Love the atmosphere, the location. Great food. Remind me of being back in real Italy. Service was excellent and courteous. Definitely recommend to anyone in the area to come here. A real gem!!",West Shore Inn Steakhouse
2,"The food, atmosphere, drinks are awesome! It's a little bit of an odd menu(Pizza/Sushi/burgers, Etc) but it works.My one complaint is the service. The hostesses and wait staff are just not good. Every time I've been here, the service has been bad. If the service could improve, this place would be amazing!On a side note- get the tavern dip, it's delicious!","Stef & I have stopped in here a few times for lunch,The food was Good,The service was good,The atmosphere was Nice.",The food here is delicious but the service is terrible. By the time they ask what you want you could have had 3 drinks already. But when we finally did order the waitress came with my drink but not my husbands. Then we ordered a second drink and it came after we were finished with our meal. Horrible.  But the food is fantastic. No matter what we order in Tommy's tavern it is fantastic. You should go there to experience the food but the service sucks!!!!!,"Great bar space with plenty of games on.  Food was fair to good. Great spot to watch a game with friends and order some appetizers. Restaurant was crowded w family's and it is a bit loud, but it's still pretty good.","Some of the dishes at Tommy's are extremely good.  Surprising entries in this category are the poké bowls, mussels, and Brussel sprouts.  What's rough is the attempt to be all things to all people.  For example, if you want to step it up with your menu, please execute the basics well.  The most disappointing menu items are those which seem to be staples: burgers, etc. If you manage to find very good dishes on the menu (eg poke and mussels per a live), you'll have to contend with the ridiculously high volume and wait times.  And that's when Tommy's loses points for certain.The bar is a crowded swirl or noise and what seems like 347 televisions.  While the crowd noise competes with myriad televisions, do your best to get the attention of the helpful and overstretched bartenders as they navigate the sea of customers.  The only thing worst is when someone decides the entire restaurant wants to watch the same channel and the place is transformed into what seems to be a state-run one channel option mess hall.Bottom line - recommended at times and mostly good, but avoid what may seem to be basics and have something new.","I really dont get the hype about this place. I came on a sunday afternoon for lunch and there was a short wait. We gave our phone number and when we received the text that our table was ready, we went right up to the host and were seated. However, we continued to receive both texts and calls about our available table and even a text that said they were giving away our table since we didnt answer. Not a big deal but not competent. Anyhow - we started off with the pretzel to share which was good. Its made in a coal oven and the taste definitely proved it! Our cheese that came with the pretzel had some kind of black thing inside so we didn't use it... but strange. My boyfriend ordered the mahi sandwich but we were informed they had no more of it. He quickly switched to a grilled chicken sandwich and I ordered a standard cheeseburger.According to my boyfriend, the sandwich was bland and you couldn't taste anything but the grilled chicken (he did say the chicken was good - just that the other flavors in the sandwich were overpowered and the seasoning was lacking.)My cheeseburger was okay. They made it rare as requested but my bun was greasy (what is with restaurants and slathering butter on EVERYTHING!) But once again, lacking flavors and seasoning. It tasted like ground beef unseasoned. I would have given this place maybe another star if the service had been better. We waited a solid 20 minutes for our waitress to bring us our check. When we searched for her, we spotted her by the kitchen eating. Listen, of course she deserves a break to eat. But shouldn't you at least finish with your tables first or pass them off to another employee? We went a long time without any one checking on us. Mind you, this was after we received boxes to wrap our food up. Clearly we were trying to leave and pay our bill. Our spaces were cleared and it was frustrating trying to find someone to get the check.It was super busy in here and lively but if you're not a sports fan, then I can't see why you would choose to spend money here.",Tommy's Tavern + Tap
3,What a disappointment!! I was so excited to try this restaurant after hearing good things.  The decor and view is great but the food was mediocre and the service was terrible.  We waited at the table for a long time before any waiter approached us. Was never offered more water. I can go on and on.  I will not be coming back.,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed an early dinner last Friday at the Richmond. The staff was attentive and hospitable. The restaurant is well decorated and the ambiance is intimate and warm. The food was delicious but, not as good as the sister restaurant Vinium across the street. I ordered the lamb Osso Bucco which was flavorful and cooked well,  9 out of 10. My boyfriend opted for the bouillabaisse. It was good but not great. We will most definitely be back.","Didn't love the food at all, drinks were weak . Atmosphere was nice , but def wasent one of my favorites. Kinda expensive","Sam, the General Manager is amazing. When it comes to managing a restaurant, he's the guy. He's owned restaurants here too and knows his stuff. Makes you feel welcome. I appreciated his table touch. Great conversation.Dana, my server is an absolute delight. Been here many times and always look out for her. Sit in her section on your next visit. She's attentive, funny and fast.For brunch and dinner, this is a new must check out on Staten Island. Make a reservation. This place fills up fast on the weekends.","We spotted The Richmond on our way out of Vinium (excellent place) a few weeks ago and decided to make it the next stop on our quest for good Island eats. As always, we were hopeful but guarded. Jackpot! In what has to be one of the prettiest restaurants I've seen anywhere, we had an amazing meal and a truly wonderful experience. We started out with oysters, smaller sized but pleasantly briny and delicious. Hubby ordered the duck breast special in a fig/balsamic reduction that was absolutely gorgeous and I had the grilled octopus over potato, asparagus and pickled red onion. Perfectly cooked octopus was tender, and both dishes were seasoned to perfection. We each enjoyed a Spiked Lemonade signature cocktail that was heaven. We ordered a carrot cake to share, not expecting it to be homemade....possibly the best carrot cake I've ever had. The staff is attentive without being overbearing, warm and easy to talk to, and brought us complimentary limoncellos after our meal. Can't recommend this place enough. Go now. Go often...and if you like, brunch is served on Saturday and Sunday.  Go then, too.","I can't think of any other fresh oyster spots on the island, and $1 per piece (at the bar)?! House wines were great, and the grilled octopus we ordered was spot on too. Met the owner and general manager, really made us feel welcomed and I can't wait to come back for brunch!",The Richmond
4,"It's very sad that this place has so many negatives because the interior is so beautiful. Went here for a family meal and my mother ordered the cacio de Pepe and she complained to me that it had too much pepper. I thought she was being dramatic until I tasted it and it was not edible. When the manager came over, this young full of himself guy, instead of apologizing, he told my mother ""this is how it's made in Rome"". As if the guy had ever been there and as if he has no taste buds. Apparently that dish is made there in large quantities even though it's such a simple dish and they cannot remake it with less pepper which is absurd. The overall food experience was sub par and all of the sides were super vinegary. The worst part of the experience was the obnoxious manager and his inability to rectify the issue and blame it on the customer.I wish I could recommend this place but I cannot.","So the place is in a nice location decorated nicely but that's where it ends. The bartenders are not attentive the seltzer was flat and drinks were weak. So we had a 9pm reservation for 8 for a birthday celebration. We sat down at about 10:30pm. There was no concessions for being super late. We sat down and two of the chairs at the table were broken. So we ordered the tuna tartar, pulpo and tuna belly. Pulpo was over cooked but the salad underneath was good. The tartar was gross and didn't eat it. The Tuna belly was good. For dinner we both had the Bronzino it was OK. One of our group order the seafood pasta it was so spicy no one could eat it. The waiter was rude when my wife said she had t ordered yet. He said yes you did the pen doesn't lie. I wanted to smack him. One appetizer was missed and was never received. The manager Came out and tried to make up for it with shots of tequila. To little to late. We ordered a piece of cake for the birthday bash so we could sing. They didn't have any cake and Cosme out with a piece of biscotti. In short this place failed on every level. Drinks service and food. The bill was almost $800. Totally screwed.","Horrible music , way to loud . Horrible food . Our waiter was amazing . Very friendly , kind and helpful. The manager was extremely helpful . They have a great staff, but they need to step up their game on their food. 3rd time there , keep trying but realizing it's not happening for this place . The mussels had no flavor in the juice , the pasta was dry, the chicken was just awful ,, came with 6 people all were unhappy . Get it together Barca","Great spot!!! We have been here multiple times as couples and the food, service and drinks are always great. The staff is extremely friendly and it has a city like vibe with great views of the city/water. The manger John is awesome remembers guest and always makes sure things come out properly and fast. All in all 5 star and a great date night if you live local in Staten Island. Thank you for the great hospitality we'll definitely be back. Don't think about it just go!","An incredible fine dining experience!Tastefully decorated, airy dining room.  It was a beautiful night, and they had the glass doors facing the water open, allowing for a lovely summer breeze throughout the room.Dutiful, attentive staff.  The maitre'd came around and chatted with us.  Anytime someone got up from the table, the server would immediately re-fold their napkin before they sat back down.The strawberry jalapeno cocktail was delicious and artfully presented. As for the food...  The mussel appetizer was perfection.  Perhaps the best mussel dish I've ever eaten.  I opted for a non-seafood entree and had the Mafaldine Bolognese.  It was without a doubt a perfect plate of freshly made pasta.  Well worth every dollar.  I would highly suggest Barca.","Went there the other night to celebrate my sister's birthday. Place is beautiful but that is where it ends. This place is toting itself as a high-end Manhattan style restaurant but comes NOWHERE near. I must say it will satisfy the tastes and standards of most Staten Islanders. Spent $322 plus a $64 tip and it was not worth it. Here's the breakdown:1. Maine oysters were excellent, but I can thank the people of Maine for that.2. We were asked to order our appetizers and entrees at the same time.  I explained to our waiter that we would be ordering different appetizers and sides, and entrees as our taste and appetite and taste allowed. This was NOT ACCEPTABLE which caused much tension that I had to press him to get the owner or manager over - no one came. At that point I wanted to leave. 3: Drinks: martinis came in a champagne coupe and half full - so they were technically half-martinis. My sister ordered two drinks and there was so much ice. Basically a three sip drink. 4. Pasta: my sister's fresh pasta was over cooked - fresh pasta should NEVER be overcooked. My fresh pasta of Cacio e Pepe was extremely al dente and overpowered with black pepper. And, I told my sister in advance that I had a feeling they would prepare the dish while the pasta was piping hot so that the cheese will clump up. I was right. I had to wait a bit, till it cooled a little, stirred it until the cheese melted like a cream. I did the chef's job.4. Desserts were good.There's more but it's not worth it. Basically the food and forced ordering made for a bad experience. The seafood is no different than any other place on Staten Island. This restaurant is doing well because it's clientele don't get off the island much.",Barca
5,The workers here are rude and dont care about customer satisfaction. They are easy to get angry from simply asking questions. Do not expect a refund on food you didnt eat or have a problem with. Tofu tastes about 6 years old. Will not be eating here again.,"Came for Pho as take out. Typically eat Pho in Manhattan and have had in Washington D.C. This pho was extremely lacking in comparison. Bland broth, overpowering onions, tough brisket, I couldnt eat it. 2 stars for ample portions. I have had better pho from Costco add water to ""cup of pho""  than here. Very disappointed. Won't be back.",Only 2 truly vegetarian dishes on whole menu. Enjoyed spicy tofu and veggies but wished for more options.,Amazing The food is always good and they serve large portions for reasonable prices. Staff is very polite as well. Parking can be a challenge but the food is worth it.,Pho Mac has Amazing Food Awesome Service and Great Prices My personal favorite is the Curry Chicken it's considered a appetizer but I eat it as a meal comes with Chicken wings and potato's in a delish curry. They serve it with hot bread or you can substitute for rice. I personally like to get both. Dipping that hot bread in the curry is AMAZING.,"Food: Beef stew is so good but only good if it's super fresh and hot. I microwaved it and it was a different taste the baguette it comes with is Soo soft and hot gotta eat it right away!The stew is sweet and delicious. The beef is a bit too big and chunky to eat so I prefer them to cut it smaller (or I can cut it)We got the #4 pho noodle soup and it's pretty bomb and very generous with the portions amount of meat. Love this on a cold winter day and any day. Broth makes it lit.Price: Those two orders total were around $17 but can probably feed around $3 since we're not big portion eaters. Service is quick for pick up, I called and 15 min later we got our food hot and fresh. They also have upstairs seating which is nice and spaciousTheir boba tea was pretty tasty too!It's the best pho place on the island if not only haha",Pho Mac Vietnamese Restaurant
6,"10x better than Red Lobster. Fresh seafood, but limited menu. It's not a place you'd expect to find in Bar Harbor Maine but man is it close!",After having bad seafood here almost half a year ago I tried it out today. This time having their seafood it was very fresh and the shrimp was mushy anymore. I would diff. come back.,Hi Anthony the restaurant have to make sure all seafoods are fresh and give more sause with no water together,"This place really delivers on the seafood front! They were running a special which was a seafood bag with a lobster tail, crab legs  shrimp, mussels, with corn and potatoes for like $35. We added Crawfish & chose their special sauce which is a blend of all the sauces on their menu and it was DELICIOUS! So flavorful, and everything comes out cooked perfectly. This was the best Lobster tail we've ever had. We also got fried Catfish for our appetizer and it was delicious. Our waiter Darrell was such a pleasure and super helpful with suggestions, he even taught us how to open a crawfish since it was our first time. We can't wait to return with the whole family. There is a new location opening on Forest Avenue and I can't wait to try them out!","Whenever I don't feel like driving to Joe's Lobster House I go here. The menu is quite limited and aside from their bakes, there is just several other things on the menu, from Po Boys to fried fish and sides. All of it is good and always fresh. The Fried shrimp is battered perfectly, crunchy and nice jumbo shrimp, about 8 of them for only $12 or so. Their french fries are excellent and I think they're the best fries I can get anywhere. They are crispy and seasoned perfectly with cajun all spice. Another staple is their fried catfish sliders. For $12 you get 3 huge sliders and the catfish is always fresh and flaky. Last but not least, the bakes! I usually get shrimp and mollusks, and they're always fresh. The shrimp is so fresh its almost crunchy. I think they sometimes get out of hand with oil in the clam bakes so I usually order them dry with Old Bay seasoning only.","Have been coming here for a while now, loved the place at first but every time I came here since it has been going down the hill and going down fast. First they changed up the menu and increased their prices-understandable, now they always have specials that they push which actually come out to be more expensive than the regular menu-not understandable. Walked In first customer of the day ordered the special food came in 5 minutes-happy because I was hungry but started wondering if it was just sitting around already cooked waiting just for me. Surprise surprise it was all way over cooked, couldn't even get the crab meat out of its shell because it was super rubbery and stuck to its shell for dear life. When paying I asked about the 10% off the bill as advertised on yelp-I was told I couldn't do that because I ordered the overpriced special. Oh well!!! This place was one of the first to do this style of food, but now there are a lot of better options!!! Maybe not on the island but if you can go to Brooklyn or NYC. Eat well, live well.P.S Review #2 As I mentioned before I have been to this place many a time, and every time they seemed to get worse and worse. Anyways, I was craving some seafood and something spicy and saw that there is a new hook and real opening up on Forrest ave, man did that put a smile on my face, only to find out that it's coming soon, bummer. Still hungry, and against my better judgement I decided to go back to the Hylan blvd location. I was prepared for the worst. To my surprise it was actually pretty good, the food was very tasty. Therefore I have added one more star to this review and will visit it one more time to make sure the changes are for real. After that, I will rate it for real one more time. Potatoes were a bit undercooked, and I didn't like it when the owner/manager kept on standing over each table hawkeyeing everyone. I need some space to do what I do to that seafood, but I guess that's how you get the quality up (hawkeyeing) Be back soon Eat well, yeah yeah",Hook & Reel
7,"The restaurant has sodas from the gun and they charge per glass. I don't mind paying for getting a coca cola, but when I do have to pay for it they should serve you the can or glass bottle so you always have the good quality expected. Charging per glass of soda from the gun is ridiculous. Any restaurant who does that should receive a 1 star as default. I'm writing this review and haven't even tasted the food yet. I'm already crossing this place of the list.The Soda issue was very well corrected by the staff later in the dinner, apparently they do have bottles (not glass though, unfortunately). I ordered the Rigatoni Bolognese and it was OK, nothing compared to the homemade sauce i get back in Brazil, but it had flavor to it.",Bus boy dropped macaroni sauce all over my shorts and sneakers no apology or cared that he did. I will never return to this restaurant again even though i was a frequent customer and loved their food. I've told many about this restaurant and I'm so upset i did. I thought it was so my go to place i guess not.,"Went here tonight for the first time- the food, service, decor, everything was phenomenal. My only complaint is when you walk in it's a bit hectic because the hostess is nowhere to be found. The owner,Dom, stopped by every table after the meal and introduced himself. Everything was delicious but we almost didn't even eat there because we got so annoyed at the 7 minute wait to be seated(or even see a hostess)Regardless, will definitely be back because the food and wait staff were phenomenal.","The food was delicious here at this stylish, Mediterranean restaurant.      The tenderness of the lamb shank was beyond this world and the saffron risotto is jam packed with flavor.     If you want good food with exceptional service, come to Taverna on the Bay.","Sometimes when I see a business w/ such good reviews, I worry they are not all real. But after eating here and talking w/ the owner, I realize why it has such a high rating. The owner is very sweet and is really passionate about his business and food. Lots of stuff is yummy here but honestly, get yourself there to eat the pizza. $12 for a large pie. Soooo yummy! I wish I ordered extras to take home. The prices are reasonable, they are generous, the food is fresh. The fried calamari is so good. Their marinara sauce is so delicious. When you sit down you're given fresh parmesan blocks off of a giant wheel, the most delicious olives, warm bread and butter. Dip your bread in the oil from olives. I wanted to drink it. And they'll bring you more bread w/o an extra charge. You will need it to sop up the tasty sauces and things.The red sangria is made there and aged by the owner. When you order a glass ($10), its full of ice, but a huge wine glass and strong. If you order by the bottle ($30) they give you a bottle and then glasses w/ ice. They have white too but didn't try it. A table near us asked for extra ice and they gave them a cute little ice bucket. The grilled octopus special ($21) is tender and a generous portion. The baked clams were good but not our favorite. I think it was 9 clams total. I didn't taste it but my husband had goat cheese app and it was 2 generous pieces of fried goat cheese that he gobbled up and cleaned his plate. The waiter was very nice but coughing a little. I wished he was covering his mouth. And the service was great until the place filled up and the poor guy was serving everyone by himself and he forgot a few things and it was hard to get his attention. There is valet parking and street parking but Sunday wasn't hard to find parking on the street. There is a patio -  I think you can smoke there. A party room. Really clean ladies room- means a clean kitchen! It's a little dark inside. I wish it was brighter.","On that day I went with a friend, we took one of the most important exam we had to take for our career and we passed the exam. However we felt shitty due to the stress we had to go through to study and take exam. We thought why not celebrate the passing score and to de stress with PIZZA. We walked over from the testing center to this pizza place. It is the only location that's open before noon and so thankful we stumbled into this place. The friend I was with, loves the food from this place. We decided to order a pie of pizza, fresh tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and eggplant toppings. We split the pie and ate it. I have not eaten pizza for a year or two due to Keto food plan I am on. Lemme tell you. The crust is perfect. Not thin or thick. Just right. The toppings are delicious. I was over the moon with the pizza and I was happy. It's definitely worth my cheat meal!Half of the pie eaten with club soda and vodka. The drinks were made weak. I'll come back any day for their pizza.",Taverna On The Bay
8,"We went to a birthday celebration, had a few drinks and really enjoyed the food. The music was loud, but it's a bar, if you're not expecting loud music, you're a moron? The staff were nice and the prices were reasonable. I highly recommend the lobster ravioli with vodka sauce (as crazy as it sounds) it was insanity. They had cheap apps for happy hour too. It was a chill atmosphere.","I haven't eaten here, just came a couple of times because of good local bands. Here's my criticism..bartenders are young and the both times I've been there, the crowd is a bit older. We got a drink initially,  but no one came back to see if we wanted anything else or even made eye contact, and we tried to engage them. Probably wont be back, you lost us","This place is odd.  It's listed as having a happy hour but they didn't answer the phone last Friday when we called!  They should at the very least have an answering machine!!  Don't know what to make of that, but needless to say we did not go. I like to give new businesses a try, but not sure we'll bother unless I see less discriminatory behavior from the restaurant in the yelp reviews.","Stef and I stopped in last Friday, it was the afternoon before the recent Heat Wave, and it was already getting hot outside.Luckily we had the day off, and were in the mood for a little Day Drinking.The barmaid was charming and  served us up a few very refreshing Vodka & Tonics.We ordered the Brussels Sprout Skewers along with an order of Guacamole, a weird combo I admit, but it worked for us.The music played pleasantly in the background.It was a Good Day.","Last Saturday night my Girl & I meet another couple at the GOAT for Dinner & Drinks.We were told that have an acoustic band would be starting soon, which is great because SI needs more music venues.The Service was friendly,The Drinks were good.We enjoyed our appetizers.However, the band turned out to use Amps that were apparently stuck on Eleven!The sound was so loud that we left before eating our entries.",Yo I'm sorry and all but by all means why was the bouncer standing over our drinks?Protect us?  Looks more like they're supplying,The G.O.A.T
9,Tried to write on Instagram but it got deleted. This place has inattentive staff and mediocre food.,"Angelina is a cheap, money hungry selfish bitch. We have gone to Angelina's plenty of times. After all she adds on extra items to your bill with big parties thinking you don't notice, TWICE this happened to me. Alsoooo she has the staff tell you AFTER you eat ""cash only OR IF you use credit card it's 3.375% charge fee for using a credit card. The staff said this is new and it's on the menu , yup we saw it afterwards in SMALL FONT ON the BOTTOM. Very unprofessional ; my salad had no flavor, the pizza was cold. don't give her service .","Small portions, high prices, salmon didn't taste fresh and bread could break a tooth.","Very nice atmosphere, friendly staff.Food and drinks were good however we found it to be a little overpriced; so just to give you an idea we ordered a sangria jar, no appetizer, and two chicken plates for the main dish. Well the bill came out to 110 dollars including the tip. Overall, we had a good experience. We will be back  to try their pizzas.","Cool place to check out, but is it worth the price...Once you walk in you are greeetd by some lovely staff members. Most looked young, and very happy.  I thought it was strange, you don't normally get a nice welcome when you go to a busy place, and by young kids. I have to commend the staff here; they do a great job of making your stay very pleasant and enjoyable.Second thing you notice is the decor. It is decorated with some unique fixtures, and it makes you feel like you're in an Italian restaurant. They have a pretty big dining area, and a good size bar with high-top seating.What really got to me was the menu and pricing. The menu is not huge, but it has all the offerings you need for a nice Italian meal. Their specialty is their unique pizzas. Different pizzas that hit different aspects of your taste buds.To make a long story short, I had:-Homemade courtesy bread with a side of ricotta with honey for dipping - It was nice and enjoyable, but not fresh made.-Fried calamari appetizer - Did not like at all.It was a long strand of fried calamari which made me question if it's real or fake. The pics on Yelp show the normal oval shaped calamari with the tentacles. ALSO, it came with fried vegetables. The menu did not say it comes with that. PLUS, that takes away from the quantity of the fried calamari. So I'm paying for half fried calamari and half fried vegetables!-Arugula salad with grilled chicken - Decent, nothing spectacular.-Bee Sting Pizza with mushrooms (extra $) - Nothing to brag about.It has a spicy kick from the sopresata, and the sweetness of the honey. The dough and sauce were bland.I added the mushrooms thinking it would offset the spiciness, BUT where were the mushrooms?!?!?!  I paid extra money on top of the expensive pizza, and I feel cheated again.-Bacio Gelato - Pretty good Italian gelato. Probably the best thing of the meal.A salad with grilled chicken, fried calamari & vegetable appetizer, a pizza pie and gelato costed a total of $75!!! No drinks by the way. On top of the expensive menu, this business charges an EXTRA 3.75% on your bill if you use a debit/credit card.Overall, this business knows how to take your money. I wish the food was something to brag about for the money you're shelling out. The staff is superb, and they all need raises. In fact I did tip nicely ($20) even though I felt the bill was too high.",Excellent service and menu!Very nice atmosphere Come by and check it out !See you there on Thursdays,Angelina's Kitchen
10,"The food is pretty decent but they didn't have gluten-free pizza for my mother, we ordered again from this place but the second time they don't even have cauliflower dough instead or anything, the guy that does the live music there is way too loud, for a place that doesn't get a lot of customers, I couldn't even hear myself think with how loud the music was","Their bogo was not a real bargain. If you compare the prices from the regular menu to the buy one get one. You're better off with the regular menu. They jacked up the prices on the buy one get one free. So you're not really saving. I ordered the margarita pie & hubby got the penne vodka entree. The next morning, i got sick from the pizza. You must check your bill before you pay them bc the waiter over charged us for an extra glass of wine. Also, they charged us an extra fee for using a credit card. Now, i know why, the dining room was empty and why they advertise so much in the paper. Desperate for customers!!","Ok, this place is around the block from me so every once and a while I will give it a shot since my really bad encounter. First of all we had the Sicilian pie about a month ago, not a fan at all. Also tried the Grandpa's pie which was actually very good and would get again. So the reason for this review is I had a coupon for a pie for $6.99, and hate just buying a coupon item so I got chicken roll ( which my daughter said was good, asked would get again and got a hey (which meant 3 stars) ) . Ok, so placed my order which I picked up and they gave me a high price, but I was looking at the internet prices which are usually wrong and I know they add tax. Well long story short they over charged me a lot, and yes I figured out the taxes and they still over charged me. So is the check out kid pocketing money or is it an extra tax on the coupon? Don't like it either way. Please charge what the coupon says or give me a receipt with a final total.Otherwise Pizza isn't bad, 3 stars, for the price minus the extra dollar they charge 3.5.","I was in uncharted territory than where I normally am being that I live in Westchester County but when there's good food there's no stopping to how far it has to take me. Mimmo's is that type of restaurant worth driving over bridges and highways to enjoy. Domenico, the owner has such an exceptional, outstanding yet WARM and genuine personality makes you feel like family. I can tell in a simple linguine w/pesto and crab dish someone from Italy was putting this together. Sure enough - come to find out he had someone from Italy Chef it up for this restaurant and I just can't wait to come back to try more of True Italian cuisine !!! Well done","This is a review for the Italian restaurant connected to the pizza place. It has tons of potential and I look forward to seeing it blossom into something really special one day. It would be nice little touch, for instance, if they put some kind of olive oil on the tables instead of margarine. We went on a Saturday evening when other places were filled to capacity. There were only three tables occupied.The service was friendly but took a long time. It seems they don't have a dedicated person for the restaurant.The shrimp oreganata entre looked hilariously like an appetizer with exactly 5 tiny shrimp. Each shrimp had a teaspoon of bland bread crumb mush on top of it. The eggplant Florentine was surprisingly bland too. The American cheesecake was fantastic though, much better than Richmond Republic's Junior brand offering in comparison.Again, I look forward to seeing this place grow and approve. It has lots of space and potential for better Italian food and could handle the overflow from nearby Piccolino's and Villa Paradicio.","Quite unassuming from the outside and when walking into the pizza parlor but don't be turned away there is some really great food being served, the dining area is tastefully decorated. The service was great as were everything we ordered.  The rice  ball pizza and chicken Romano are fabulous and the fried calamari rivaled many of my favorite spots (deninos).  Very friendly server who happily brought out extra fresh baked in house bread.  Only cons was the guitar player, who was very good, was a bit to loud  and the entrees came out in intervals.  Other than that great food, great service and can't wait to return.  Update.  Another great dinner !!!!",Mimmo's Brick Oven Pizza and Trattoria
11,First time I was here I was impressed with everything...it was when they first opened.  It is a little overpriced but the portions are great. Today I came for lunch. I ordered a burger....the cowboy burger. It had a very strange seasoning that overpowered the taste and distorted the flavor of a burger. It was absolutely terrible to bite into. Of course I tried to eat without complaining..which my husband always says I do..but it was that bad. I will being the leftovers to my son! Lol. He loves burgers. I'll let him tell me whether or not he liked. If not I guess my dog will have a good dinner...or maybe not. Sorry. Not sorry.,"Brisket was dry and flavorless. The burgers were great (my kids enjoyed them) but the fries were horrendous. As was the mash potatoes and cole slaw sides. Our waitress was very kind and good, but there seems to be a quality control issue with bussing of the tables. Our table was sticky and dirty (and wobbly) and the condiments were all empty. When we asked for new condiments, we were given more empty condiments containers. There was no silverware or place settings on our table, even when are food arrived. Maybe there's some sort of management issue?The worst part was the stifling heat. It was unbearable. I'm not sure what the issue was...we saw only a small window AC that could not cool the dining room. We had to cut this visit short, as my family was sweating all over the seats and the kids were getting dizzy. Granted it was 100 degrees outside...and maybe they were having central air problems? But no one told us what was going on. The inside of the restaurant was so hot and muggy. We really felt bad for our waitress to have to work in that environment (it was definitely a risk for heatstroke just sitting in that dining room, much less working in it). My wife's draft beer was warm as well.I don't think we will be returning. I did give this 3 stars because my kids love burgers and they were very good. I'd avoid the brisket however. The bar area was a little sketchy too, but there's no avoiding it.","Came here with my family for dinner.   We were seated immediately but didn't get serve until 10 minutes later.   We ordered the full house which includes half rack of ribs, brisket, pulled pork, smoked sausage, chicken, and three sides.    The pork ribs and beef short ribs were delicious.  The smoked sausage was full of flavorful seasoning.  The chicken was moist.   The pulled pork was a bit disappointing,  it was lack of flavor and dry.  We barely got service cause there was a big party on the other side.   No refills of water and waited another 10 minutes for the check.","So yesterday my neighbor was cooking up a mean steak and other BBQ related foods right outside my window, which I found highly offensive. The smell began to invade my nostrils and so my jealous stomach immediately activated and I had to eat something BBQ.  Heard about a newer spot in Grant City corner house BBQ, and so I ventured out to see if they could cure my hunger. The inside was very gastro-pub meets roadhouse and that's just my type of joint. I got a pretty tasty IPA and ordered the beef brisket with Mac n Cheese and fries. The food came out fast, like within 5 minutes fast, which was impressive.  Now I'm not ordinarily a brisket man, I'm more of a baby back pork ribs or wings and steak guy but this place is apparently known for brisket so I went with that and my god was that a winner. The brisket was so tender it was sliced easily with a butter knife.  The BBQ sauce complemented the meat to the core and the Mac and Cheese was absolutely perfect. To top it off there are cool bartenders and a few really cute girls working here; I know people like to pretend that doesn't matter, but it does!  Everyone was nice and service was stellar. Got a lovely buzz from that IPA and a full satisfied belly. I will be returning here very soon with my fiancé before she kills me for going without her.",First time I was here I was impressed with everything...it was when they first opened.  It is a little overpriced but the portions are great. French onion soup is amazing!! Today I came for lunch. I ordered a burger....the cowboy burger. It had a very strange seasoning that overpowered the taste and distorted the flavor of a burger. It was absolutely terrible to bite into. Of course I tried to eat without complaining..which my husband always says I do..but it was that bad. I will being the leftovers to my son! Lol. He loves burgers. I'll let him tell me whether or not he liked. If not I guess my dog will have a good dinner...or maybe not. Sorry. Not sorry. Oh. Wait. They also forgot the bacon!! Wtf. Never again. That did it for me. In their defense after asking...there is a new cook. He needs to be better trained. I had my money refunded which made me happy but I probably won't be returning anytime soon.,"This is in regards to the service. The food wasn't incredible and I don't see myself returning after the combination of events that happened. Extremely slow and waited a while for someone to take our order. Found a waitress that this wasn't her table to serve but whichever waiter had our table didn't acknowledge the fact we were sitting for a good 15 mins. The waitress that did serve us was the only good thing about our experience. Besides that we waited a long time for our burgers and which tasted only ok. The French fries were seasoned weird, I wasn't a fan of the fries.",Corner House BBQ
12,"Don't get the high reviews at all. I ordered delivery through yelp on a Thursday evening. I ordered a chicken teriyaki bento and a dragon roll. The chicken was so dry. It tasted like it had been sitting there for a few days and then reheated in a microwave. The sushi came warm because of the way it was packaged. I ended up eating a few bites and throwing out the rest. Maybe it's different dining in??? But take out was terrible.There was also a mishap with the yelp app when I ordered. Two orders were processed instead of one. I called the app right away but they told me that the restaurant refused to cancel my order, so there was nothing they could do. Mind you, I called right away to cancel when I realized the double charge. About 20 minutes later, the restaurant calls me and says that Yelp JUST called them and that if I had only called them earlier, they would have cancelled. That was lie, because I called yelp like I was supposed to as soon as it happened. I really dislike businesses that are dishonest and shady so I won't be eating here because of that in addition to the bad food.",Pinapples were sour. Inattentive waiter. Owner passed by to ask how everything was and didn't wait fot a reply. Males do very little. Women there were way more attentive.,"-FoodUhh, I'm not sure why this place is rated so high. I got the duck pad Thai and my mom got shrimp taking udon. Both were mediocre. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good. For duck pad Thai, the duck was good. Very well seasoned and cooked properly. The noodle, however, was too dry and I'm not sure whether it's actually Thai seasoning. I would go back if someone wants to go here but not voluntarily. There was nothing special about this place, in my opinion. -PriceAgain, I'm confused on why it's rated so well. I think it's a little overpriced based on the quantity and quality of its food. It's more on the expensive side compared to other restaurants on the island. -Overall I wouldn't really recommend this place. In my opinion, it's okay. Worth a shot but nothing too special.",Very friendly service with good recommendations. Food was great.The Scallop with X.O. Sauce and red snapper dishes were amazing additions to eat with rice.,Subpar.... to say the least.... the waitress was more worried about the infant baby (maybe grand child or whatever) then caring to our table.. it was so dead I thought it was closed so there is no reason for me to have to beg you to come over and fill my glass with water or beg for another beer or saki.. the service is in the sea as my husband said... NOW LET ME START MY REVIEW.....THE STARTERS:We ordered pork bun which was not at all what we expected it was more of undercooked sticky bun with a piece of pork belly in a taco form ..the pork was flavorful but just didn't hit the mark .Pork goyza had a nice taste but they didn't taste fresh it was kinda chewy like it was microwaved when it got to the table it wasn't hot it was warm. Disappointing because they actually tasted good.Beef negimaki was good just needed a little more sauce.We then ordered tuna rolls and Philadelphia rolls. The sushi was actually good . The saki wasn't great either .. this place is just ok nothing to rave about.. Dessert :We ordered fried bananas and tempura cheesecake definitely not worth it .Again the service here is nonexistent and the Asian cover of American songs is annoying . I would Ofer sushi to go next time I definitely wouldn't sit and eat here,Fresh sushi in Staten Island! Came here for dinner with the family and ordered a bunch of different items. My son loved the chicken katsu. The fried soft shell crab was yummy and good portioned. They have different fresh fishes of the day. Overall it was reasonably priced and service was good. We would definitely be going back for dinner again.,Miyabi Asian Fusion
13,"Food was phenomenal. Decent portion size. I ordered the shrimp tostones for appetizer and seafood paella for entree. As for customer service, they were okay. At times, the waitress would keep coming over and asking if we're done. They weren't even closing the store yet smh. So i did feel rushed. By the way, for two people they had an automatic 18% tip added to the bill. I would come back lunch time to give it a try. FYI- there's only street parking.","I've been eating Peruvian food all mah life from many different joints... a typical fried rice with chicken or beef would never be around 18 dollars.. usually it's about 12 or even 13 beans.  The chicken fried rice is not even fresh made chicken, it tastes like re-fried/grilled salad chicken added to the fried rice portion. The Beef fried rice were giant pieces of chicken.  The food is okay taste wise, however the pricing is outrageous.   U need to ask for pricing upon getting told the specials via iPad.  Sneaky character..","On July 3rd we made a reservation for 10 people on OpenTable for 7 PM. We got to the restaurant and found it closed. A staff member who was doing renovations told us that the restaurant was closed today, despite the confirmation from OT. It was 10 of us coming in from Manhattan to this restaurant on Staten Island that a co-worker previously had great experiences at, so suffice to say, this was extremely disappointing. And there was no update on their website or on Google about their sudden closure on Tuesday. Heads-up to future diners; call ahead and don't be the group of 10 left out in the heat.",This is my favorite Peruvian restaurant to go to. I have tried others and nothing compares to this one. They put so much love in their food. I am so happy I came across this place. I cannot stop talking about the tastefulness is the food. These guys are awesome!!!!!,"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. Made reservations on a Friday night for a party of 4. My family and I shared the tostones with shrimp for our appetizer. It was okay for me. My parents seemed to have enjoyed it a lot more than I did. I definitely should have tried the crab cakes. For drinks, we ordered a pitcher of mango sangria which was okay as well. It wasn't at all terrible. In fact i had a few glasses. Its enough to share between 2-3 people. My entree was the lamb with shrimp and it was delicious. I was very pleased with my meal. My dad ordered seafood paella and he was very happy with his meal as well. I forgot what my mom and brother ordered but overall, we thought our entrees were delicious. The portions are on the bigger end. For dessert we ordered flan and tres leches. I highly recommend the flan. The tres leches could have been better texture wise. The staff sang Happy Birthday to my mom and even put a cake sparkler w/ the flan when our dessert came in. Overall the staff were attentive and they always made sure to check on us. They were welcoming and provided great service. When the check came, I had to double check everything because I didn't expect everything to be on the pricier end. A tip for future customers - ask the pricing on the items they show you on the ipad. The food is delicious. However, we never asked for the prices and I feel like the items are on the pricier side. What made me probably not want to come back is that they had automatically put a 20% tip for a group of 4. Now, i dont think i read ANYWHERE on their menu that shows gratuity will automatically be added to a party of 4 or more. Seems like other yelp reviewers had the same experience (with sometimes only having a party of 2) I thought that was a bit ridiculous. If we were a group of 6 id understand. Needless to say, i was going to add 22% tip because we were pleased with the service and food overall but when i saw the 20% tip get added automatically, it kind of made me not want to add what I originally wanted to put down. Overall, this place has its positives but it also has some negatives. The food and the service were great. The pricing is more on the pricey end and it seems like it doesn't matter how many people are in your group... they will automatically add a specific gratuity on your check which is a no no for me.","Since Peruvian food is one of my favorite cuisines, I was excited to try this place. My friend and I went here for dinner on a Tuesday night. We were greeted warmly and seated right away. The place was small, but with a cozy feel, and we didn't feel crowded or cramped. Our server was friendly and outgoing. The menu had a nice variety of offerings, with appetizing photos, which was nice. We ordered the crab cake appetizer, and two entrees--the Peruvian style fried rice with chicken, and Peruvian style linguini with steak and onions. The crab cakes were delicious; made with fresh lump crab meat--they were the highlight of the meal. The Peruvian linguini and steak dish was very good, but the steak was a little tough. Despite that, it was quite tasty. The fried rice was good, but too salty. I could tell by the coloring of the rice that it was going to be that way. I would not order that again.Overall, the food, service and atmosphere was good, although the music that was playing was loud house/club tunes, not appropriate for the dining experience. They should have stuck with the Latin vibes that were playing earlier. Here is why this review is a three star rating:Our bill came out to a whopping $83.00 for two people; we ordered an appetizer, two entrees, and a soda. While the food and service were good, it wasn't good enough to justify that price for a casual dinner experience. The deal breaker--and why we will not return to this place--is that they added an 18% gratuity to our bill. This was completely offensive to me in principal...to automatically add the tip to a bill for two people, is in my opinion, a little arrogant. The common practice is for larger parties, not two people. The irony is, we usually tip a little more, but since the tip was forced upon us, we left it at that. Inca's had some nice points going for it, but unfortunately, the cons far outweigh the pros in this case.",Incas Grill Peruvian kitchen
14,"Really wanted to like this place but what a let down. Came in when it was not busy at all, only two other tables were occupied. We got our dim sum at a reasonable time, they did forget one but then waited over a half hour for our main dish. Meanwhile customers came after us and got their orders. One family even came, ordered, ate and left and we were still waiting. It seems that 'certain' customers were getting special treatment.  We were so agitated that we asked the waiter to pack the food so we can take it to go. He still ends up bringing the food to the table so I asked again to pack it up. When I got home,I noticed that one of the orders were missing which I clearly saw the waiter bring to the table before I sent it back to be packed up. I was even charged for it. Definitely not going back!","I'm not sure where to begin but the customer service at this place is absolutely atrocious. You basically have to speak Cantonese or you will not be served (or you will get scolded at in our case). I am Chinese myself and I came here with my husband who is Irish American and our two kids and we spoke English. One time we checked on one of the dishes we ordered separately (it was not available from one of those pushing carts), the waiter literally yelled at my husband and shrugged his shoulders. He raised his voice and yet we didn't understand him because he refused to speak English. However his gesture demonstrated the hostility. I'm having a hard time understand why customer service in many Chinese restaurants is so far below the industry standard. Needless to say, we will not return to this place ever again.","The worst experience in my life. If you are not asian, expect a different treatment. I am not even sure where to start:1. The waiters completely ignored us.2.  Water or drinks orders were not taken for 30 minutes.3. Asian customers were getting a special menu and some extras (e.g peanuts).4. Half of the appetizers were not available and the waiters told me to read a sign on the front door about dim sums though i was not ordering dim sum.5. One of appetizers never came out and what came out was of a poor quality and definitely of the reduce size. Fried wontons were ripped and all stick together. Spareribs were all bones...with no meat to be found. 6.  Let me add one more time rudeness of the waiters.","This is my second time ordering and it is absolutely fantastic! I have my whole family in love! These are some of the items we ordered -- The wonton soup - the broth is clear & not salty which is important for me because I am on a low sodium diet. The wontons are paper thin & as fresh as could be with flavorful pork inside. The sliced pork with the green onions adds perfect touch! Sautéed Garlic Bok Choy - crunchy, buttery & fresh! Nice size portion.Vegetable Fried Rice - an assortment of broccoli, bell peppers, peas, & onions with egg. Light & not oily!Sesame Beef - tender & savory, melts in your mouth. Very nice portion! Sliced Honey Roast Pork - a sweet & tangy honey glaze over thinly sliced pork.Shumai - fresh shrimp & pork dim sum, very moistTraditional Pot Stickers - minced pork exploding with flavor!Precious Island will now be our go to traditional Chinese restaurant!",As a native Chinese I would say this place is fantastic for native Chinese food. They are quite creative in their dishes. There were some that I've never had before. It was definitely very well done.The one minor thing I don't like about this place is the smell. It smells too much like cleaner when you walked in. Definitely not an appetiting smell when you walk in. The black custard bun was delicious. I'm not a dessert person but couldn't resist this treat.,Review for take out only. Picked up. Didn't do delivery.Supposedly you can order on Grubhub and seamless but they both told me restaurants were closed or weren't taking orders right now. I ordered through their website. They texted me that that got my order but didn't email me my order. You're not charged til you pick up. But the menu online is not their full menu. This is Hong Kong style Chinese. A little different than most Chinese take out. I think it's better. The menu is very big. They have dim sum but also bigger plates. The food is very good. But very very salty. The portions are generous. But they didn't give us any sauces for any of the dim sum and only gave us like 1 duck sauce 1 soy sauce 1 mustard and 1 hot sauce per bag. We had 2 bags of food. We got 11 items. No extras like fried won tons or fortune cookies. They messed up 1 of the things - was supposed to be fried dumpling and got steamed. And they almost gave us someone else's bag of food. The orange chicken was different than most Chinese takeout. It wasn't very orangey or spicy at all even though menu says it is. It is sweet. And very good. Could taste fresh ginger. The shrimp balls were really delicious. It's like a shrimp dumpling wrapped in almost like a ramen noodle nest and fried. It's crispy and yummy. The fried calamari was really tender. Chicken w walnuts was ok. Pretty plain. Walnuts were yummy. Almost candied. But not many of them. And broccoli was crispy. Just a brown sauce. Beef w vegetables was ok. Also a basic brown sauce. The vegetables in it weren't very exciting. Some snow peas and peppers and onions. A little bit of carrots. Fried rice was basicShrimp dumplings in chili oil got soggy and the chili oil was kind of bland for its name. Not spicy. I'd go back and eat there. I'm sure it's better piping hot and fresh from the kitchen and this way I'd be sure to get sauces for dim sum.  And can order from whole menu. Ordering online the menu is smaller.,Precious Island Dim Sum
15,"Was excited to try but not impressed at all. Food was average at best and very pricey. Service was very slow. Hostess when you walk in was so rude I think he forgets he is working at a bar restaurant, and not the four seasons. Place is nice on the inside but definitely not worth the price. Food is very blah. Not worth it. Definitely will not return.","Ordered a burger with no lettuce, was given an uncooked patty on bread. Disgusting. $20 burger went straight to the trash!!! I added the American cheese myself.",One word: TERRIBLE! My family ordered take out tonight and spent $100 on a meal that wasn't good at all. We ordered the Asian BBQ wings where after 1 bite they went to the trash. The sauce was so disgusting we couldn't even handle the smell. The salmon was overly dressed and had a very strong odor and taste of miso glaze. The broccoli that it came with was burnt. The garlic mashed potatoes were good until I took a bite into something that almost broke my tooth (see attached picture). The cake was enormous and had an overwhelming smell of cinnamon. The frosting tasted nothing like cream cheese. The only thing that was ok were the steak tacos. Definitely will not be eating from here again.,"Very nice place! Came here with family. We had mac and cheese, nachos and the giant pretzels for appetizers. Everything was tasty and delicious. We were honestly all pretty full from the appetizers but we still had entrees: mostly different kinds of burgers and shrimp and chicken tacos. We were all satisified. I ordered a regular cheeseburger, rare. I just had to send it back for them to add cheese but they fixed it without a problem and it was perfect. Plenty of places ask you what temp you want your burger at and then cook it any way they want. Not here! It was rare, just as I asked. What a pleasure. Atmosphere is comfortable and beautiful (however, the chairs are uncomfortable for long periods of time).  We stayed a little later after eating and paying the bill but soon decided we did want to have coffee. We were given espressos on the house which was so considerate and kind. Definitely makes me want to come back and dine here!","I had heard very polarizing opinions of this place.Some people said it was amazing. Some awful.So I was definitely excited to see what I wound think. Really nice place. (Parking does seem like it could be an issue though if very busy)Staff was great. Bartenders really outstanding and friendly. Excellent quality of beer selection.Food is good , not great.Overall I'd definitely say this is a thumbs up from me. Nice place. Nice staff. Great beer.","Love going here with my group of friends. The place is huge! The bar, sprawling. It's a great place to meet up and hang out with friends. Cozy in the winter, too. My only thing with this place: the portions are MASSIVE. You will not starve. But sometimes the burger/sandwich is just stacked so extra that I have to commit the sin of dismantling it in order to eat it. At least it is tasty.The fried pickles are my go-to, and they offer great specials as well. Large selection of beer and craft beer. Would always recommend this place.",Richmond Republic
16,Ordered the southwest salad and asked waitress if there was meat on it. She said no. It came out with bacon and I asked the person who gave it to us to take it back because I don't eat bacon. They brought back the same salad which had been partially scraped out - bacon remnants still there. Nope.,"If I could give 0 stars that is what this place deserves but I am subject to 1 being the worst option. Firstly, The menu does not describe the ingredients and what is in each dish/burger/salad making it very hard to order. The pork egg roll appetizer were dry like sand paper. The restaurant was out of corn for the southwest salad, so they could not make it. Upon ordering the bacon burger they do not give an option for American cheese. I ordered it medium it came out well done and had absolutely no flavor at all. Absolute terrible food and would never return. The service was also very mediocre. Worst place on Staten Island!!! Save your money!!!Anyone who gave this place 5 stars must not of being in a sober state.",Ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken was dry and cold in the middle worst chicken and waffles I had there in awhile. Friend ordered blues burger medium rare and it came out well and chartered to heck on one side of the burger. Then we got garlic fries which were mad oily and disgusting with no flavor. I've been a regular in this place for a while now and it seems like the kitchen is going through some changes rrcb,"I've been to Craft House many times since it opened although not as often as I'd like since I just can't really afford it. It's not expensive for what it is and for the quality of the food. I'm just poor. So I've had the ribs, brisket, pulled pork, fried chicken and most if not all of the sides and appetizers. Almost everything has been consistently very good or excellent. Their two BBQ sauces are both delicious too.  The ribs and pulled pork and brisket are always tender and juicy. The corn bread is delicious. The wings (all three flavors) and sliders are exceptional. The mac and cheese is delicious and doesn't taste like it's made with velveeta. The only things on the menu I don't love are the fried chicken which always seems a bit too dark (over cooked) for my taste but still good just not as good as everything else and there was some corn dip(?) kind of appetizer that is just OK.  My only other complaint is that I think the portions could be a bit bigger for the prices but again maybe that's just cause I'm broke. The service is always very friendly too. And they have Killsboro beers brewed on Staten Island!",The beauty of this place is that it hits every single criteria to be great. Food is Amazing. Staff is super friendly and helpfulService is impeccibleDecor is niceThey have outside seating!The barbecue is perfectly done and smoked like you are down south!  The drinks are expertly crafted.  They have a huge selection of their own house made beers and a very thoughtful selection of outside beer. I have been here multiple times and never even a slight disappointment. Definitely a keeper!,"Love going to craft house in the summer time! They have a really brilliant outdoor patio with a wonderfully hip mural. I almost always order their Cobb Salad (no dressing and no onions). One of my favorite salads and it's also super filling. I've also had their chicken and waffles- good choice any time!Their beer list regularly rotates with guest taps- one of my favorites was a tiramisu stout. On the weekends, they have a DJ that's spins some cool tunes and it can get a little loud. Something to keep mindful of just in case you're looking for a place that is a bit more quiet.",Craft House
17,They have a really good shrimp appetizer. The food came quickly. The food is good but not great. For the price it should've been great. I'm a brooklyn guy so I'd say for Staten Island they're aaaaright. But I won't be going back.,Had a reservation tonight for 8:30 and got there at 8:08 expecting to be seated shortly. Little did I know they would continue seating people with later reservations before me. I went to say something to the hostess and I was told that she took my name off the reservation list because she called me at 5pm and I didn't pick up. I work until 7:30 and she didn't even leave a message!! So now apparently we cancel peoples reservations after a phone call from a number that isn't even the number of the restaurant!!!!! I was livid and walked out and my explanation was that was a table for 4 when every table was a table for 4 or more!!! Thanks a lot for a horrible night!,,"Great atmosphere, great staff (patient too!), The food is excellent and not too expensive either.  We order the  shrimp, salmon and I had the tilapia (which was amazing!)","The service left much to be desired. Once taking our order for the main entree, first they brought the wrong entree for my daughter. Then about 30 minutes later my trio kebab meal came. They finally brought the right meal for my daughter 10 minutes later, but she was already eating the meal served to her. To get a refill on a glass of way, too about 40 minutes, too. When I asked why I was served last from everyone at my table, they told me chicken takes longer to cook. My friend ordered appetizers & they tasted delicious.It also took forever to get the check & pay it.Think they need more on the front end of the restaurant & get the food orders right the first time.Besides asking if a customer has gluten free diet when the dishes don't state that there's bread in the dish.As you can guess I didn't even rate my meal because it came too late.","For 45 years I have looked for this. Clean, hospitable, big delicious appetizing menu. Owner Alan is a hands on gentleman. I had Fatouch, kufta kabab, Borak, falafel, and then we were treated to a brand new item( stuffed eggplant with minced meat and deliciousness. It was then topped of with their signature kunafa. Just WOW.This is a real find. Will be back Inshallah",Laila
18,"2 problems with this place. Food is awful, service is terrible (although that may have been the one water). Food is the main issue.I have been to more then 20 bbq spots all over America and this is by far the worst.Ordered and appetizer which was cubes of bacon and it was dry with very little flavor. Needed far more sauce.Myself and my girlfriend ordered ribs, pulled pork, and bbq chicken. Impressively all were awful. The ribs were fall off the bone but absolutely no flavor, seemed like there was no seasoning at all. The only seasoning that was visible was some dry rub. Just terriblePulled pork tasted like it was marinated overnight in vinegar. Disgusting.The bbq chicken was extremely dry. Very little to no flavor. No clue how they messed up chicken. The marinated onion on the side tastes like a bowling shoe. Corn bread was good on the other hand. Mac and cheese tasted like it was out of the box. Overall would never return just because food is so awful. Decor was nice and plenty of seating.","Delicious , but portions are very small. Food was tender and flavorful ,I will be back soon","A must go to spot on Staten Island!  It's a city that hasn't had good BBQ for as long as I remember.  We had slabs of Bacon (A+), Brisket (A+), pulled pork, chicken and turkey (delicious).People have been complaining about running out of food but those things happen when it's good and made from scratch.  If something's out try something different you won't go wrong.Be prepared to wait, but that's a good thing because people like it.","The meats are 5 star. We had a bunch of things and shared. My favorite was the prime rib. I got this during my second time here and didn't think anything could beat their brisket but oh my did it win. Literally the best tasting meat I've had in my life. The brisket was also the best brisket I've had, and have had my share of good brisket. The burger was another great surprise- so juicy and full of flavor. Even the chicken was good- usually I'm not big on chicken but it was definitely full of flavor. The drinks are 5 star We had that large fish bowl like drink. It was sooo good and so fun. Also the milkshakes are a must have!! The service is 5 star Everyone is super friendly and very attentive So why only the 4 stars? The sides!!! Sooo we don't eat Pork so we were really limited to the Mac and cheese and corn bread. The corn bread was ok- nothing special though. Cornbread is like my favorite thing ever at BBQ places but I'm just not a fan of theirs. The first time we went it was plain cornbread and the second time it had some kind of vegetable in it- better than the first one but still didn't like it. The Mac and cheese....who doesn't love Mac and cheese? I've never really had a bad mac and cheese at a restaurant until here- I had it both times to make sure it just wasn't a bad day. Both days it was yuck. It was disappointing :(I wish there were more good tasting side options for people who don't eat pork! I'm kinda left eating a whole lotta meat when I go there (not that that's a bad thing- but who doesn't love some delicious sides?!)","I ordered a Mac and Cheese from the Menu. Not the kids version, the 7-8$ side version . It was the size of a sauce ""cup"" I cant even say a cup because it was so small. I paid for a 8 dollar mac and cheese that was the size of a kids meal item. I'm not sure there was much to say aside from that make of it what you will but kinda blew my mind how the pricing was decided. In comparison with hometown BBQ in Brooklyn , or anywhere in matter of fact I can order a mac and cheese and get a huge bowl and eat till im sick of it for the same price. ( even panera serves more)So...I had high hopes expecting yay i wouldn't have to drive all the way to brooklyn or anywhere else off the island for a decent BBQ but. With all the hype and the ""great reviews"". I think people might just be rating this high based on the fact that there is barely anything opening new on the island aside from Banks and another god damn pizza place that anyplace new is like the best thing in the world .I'd give this a meh, maybe if they fix the pricing and isn't as expensive for what it is and quality. I don't care about service since every new place struggles to get their stuff together and its hectic so I'm not giving a low rating for that. Just the food and the prices ( yea yea i get it it takes money to run a business, thats why i gave a comparison to all the other places and their price ranges ).And i went late at night closer to closing maybe like 9pm ish ? But they ran out of brisket and the candy bites .Might be just me but...I felt like it was similar to going to a McDonald and they told me they ran out of fries and nuggets and burgers and all I could order was the Fish Filet lol. Overall.....for those who travel out of the island and eat different foods I would say its a pass and I would still go to Hometown BBQ , Dinosaur BBQ or places like that.For those who don't like the travel far and don't ever get off the island for anything..I guess great a new place that isnt another Bank or Pizza place.Side note : The Decor was nice.oh, Parking is horrible. I don't think they have a lot, and if it does it was on the side of the place and it fits like 5 cars or something. Meaning you have to park down the road around the corner somewhere dingy and dark and walk over.And also when you visit the entrance is in the back for some reason. You go to the front you see a sign (lol entrance not here ). You go to the side of the place where the cars are parked ( lol entrance not here too on a sign). And then you go to the back to get in, which I found kind of weird but just a minor thing.Hopefully it gets better???? But glad people enjoy it but I'd say normally most places put their best foot forward and then after a while the quality goes down. I think rarely places go upwards in quality vs when they launch. So...I guess time will tell","Finally another bbq restaurant on SI. Decided to check it out after work around 5ish. We were a party of 6. Plenty of outdoor seating, waited only 5 mins sat outside. The parking was a bit of challenge but we eventually found a spot one block away. I ordered a pitcher of sangria while waiting for the rest of our group. Our waitress was very friendly. While enjoying our sangria we started off with an order of BBQ wings and brisket poutine. I enjoyed the poutine especially the brisket. We shared the sample (pulled pork, brisket, beef links, ribs) with 4 sides. The sample was a perfect size although I felt the portion on the sides were a little on the small side.Overall experience was a good one. We would definitely come back especially for lunch.",Juicy Lucy BBQ
19,"Waiting over an hour for food. WTF! St. Patty's night. One waitress no food. No booze. There's a band. Every tables full, no food for anyone. Really!!!Wound up waiting 2 hours for food and the table behind us 2 1/2 hours. Horrible service.",Most disrespectful bar in the neighborhood. They blast music at all hours of the day/night so loudly that I can hear it perfectly clear in my daughter's bedroom with the air conditioner and sound machine on. Have spoken to the manager several times but they don't care. No other bars in the neighborhood give us this problem. Horrible for the community.,"Cockroaches, watered downed drinks, just downright nasty. Went to see my favorite band and was told they couldnt pay them so they left. Stay home or go elsewhere.","Princess Trivia Night is amazing ! Harder then expected ; definitely re-watching some Disney Movies! They have tables with your name and cute Disney Princess hats as well as Customized Disney Drinks! Super cute ! Nachos were perfect to share, thank you Madison for the recommendation, definitely for a group or 4 people to finish together. There's a backyard too which is perfect for the summer weather! Also ask for the $2 green tea shots they are addicting!","This place rocks! (Literally, there was a live band playing while we were eating.) Me and the boys chilled here, definitely a cool spot to chill and drink! It's a bit hot in here but the foods amazing and I bet the drinks are better. Amazing service too! Will come again someday.","Great experience at Liberty Tavern. A friend and I were looking for a place to have a snack and some drinks, mostly drinks because the kids were at home. Great happy hour specials and beer selection. We sat down and Robin warmly, promptly greeted us. We said we wanted salads but something a little fattening as an appetizer. She made some smart suggestions, all of which we LOVED! The wings and bacon bombs were soooo delicious - I could have eaten 9 plates of them!As it got busier inside, the service stayed attentive and professional. We had a couple more rounds - the drinks she made were all perfect. Not sure if she was the owner but she was really awesome and set such a welcoming vibe. We'll definitely be back to hang out with Robin and the the bacon bombs!",Liberty Tavern
20,"I can't help but laugh while writing this review, my experience was comical to say the least. I went here for a family party, we used the private room in the back. Upon entry you are greeted with what I can only describe as the oh so familiar ""porta potty smell"". Once in the room, we noticed a giant hole in the ceiling that had been patched up with tape and loose pieces of plastic. There's no changing table in either bathroom so that's fun with a baby. My FAVORITE part is how horrendously dirty the floor was (picture provided). My white shoes were black from this carpet, like truck stop dirty! The food was mediocre at best. I gave them 2 stars because the staff was quick and attentive but probably because they didn't want to be on the carpet for too long. I would never go back, not unless I need my dye anything black.","Went there last night for the first time to place an order for takeout and the customer service was TERRIBLE. They messed up our order not once but twice. I guess that's what happens when you got a guy who apparently does not understand English taking orders. I'll just stick to ordering pizza from ""Ti Amo"".","Great, fresh food marred by poor service, high prices, noisy second floor neighbors, and horrible bathrooms. The Sunday dinner is the best value for your money. The bread basket is nice, but the salads lack finesse because it comes drenched in dressing.","This has become one of my go-to place for Italian food due to the friendly service and delicious food.I'm writing this review after especially great service. My family rented out a room here after a funeral and while it was obviously not a great day, their service made it so that we had one less thing to worry about.  The food was seemingly endless and delicious, and they got everyone exactly what they needed without much wait. I already enjoyed coming here, but after my last experience car, I'll be sure to come back for any event or celebration.",I hosted a 55th birthday luncheon for one of my individuals that I work with. It was absolutely amazing. The fresh breads were delicious and the service was impeccable! The penne vodka was delicious and the Entrees. The service was great. All the waiters were attentive. Everyone enjoyed ! Great place!,"What a huge surprise!!  We drove up from Tampa and stayed at a nearby hotel and googled neighborhood Italian restaurants. The place was nearly full & we sat at the bar. What was the big draw on a Monday night?  Karaoke!!  People were having so much fun, the music was great. The vibe was fun and friendly!!  Dominick, the owner, talked to us while we drank our wine. And then the food.....was fabulous!  My husband had veal Marsala with a side of rigatoni and I had chicken Sorrentino with linguine with olive oil & garlic. The bread basket and 3 toppings were so varied and delicious, we could have made a meal on that alone, plus the salad with homemade Italian dressing.  Take a look at the photo!  Who is going to eat all this food??!!!  Couldn't even think of dessert!  We did what we could and took the rest with us. It was 9:00 & we have to get on the road early tomorrow. As we were walking out, someone even asked us, ""Where are you going?  We're just getting started!"" I'm Italian from Rochester, NY and I have to say, We hated to leave. It felt like we were home!  I hardly ever write reviews, let alone one this detailed, but I just had to--tonight was a treasure!",Casanova
21,"Came here because of all the 5 star reviews. I was not satisfied at all and even had food poisoning afterwards. I made an account just to talk about my experience because of how bad it was. After investigating the reviews because of how unsatisfied I was, I realized most of the 5 star reviews are paid by this establishment. First of all, some of the yelpers posting reviews come from far away places like deep in Brooklyn or Manhattan, so it doesn't even make sense for them to travel to this place to get sushi because it is in an isolated place. That is just a suspicion. What makes me certain that these reviews are fake and paid for is that some of the 5 star reviews talk about how good their omakase is. Funny thing is, they do not have omakase. I ordered the dragon roll. On the menu, it says there is caviar on the dragon roll, but it is just regular roe. DON'T PUT THAT ON THE MENU IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PUT THE ACTUAL THING ON THE FOOD!!!The prices are outrageous for what you are getting. They charge $$$ prices for mediocre AYCE quality sushi. Service is horrible and owner is quite rude if you read his replies to other yelpers. All in all, I think the 5 star reviews is not trustworthy at all, and the 1 star reviews are much more realistic and reflect the actual quality of this restaurant. I would never come here again.","Raymond (Manager) called the same night to review all issues posted on review. We will give Shishito another try soon - Found bones in two separate eel rolls.Regular rolls $4.75, with less fish then we have ever seen. The dinner time wait time for pick up was 50 mins. Special rolls $14.95, not worth the buzz. Tried the hot mama roll - nothing special. Still looking for a good sushi place on SI. Ignore the Yelp prices.","I prefer not to write negative reviews when there is a chance the restaurant just had a bad day or I ordered the wrong thing.  Given that, my dinner at Shishito was not great, at least my entree was not.  My wife and I shared the Brussels Sprouts appetizer which was plentiful and very good.  For our main course, m wife had a bowl of Ramen which, although was not as good as some recent experiences at Japanese Village in Brooklyn, was good-enough.  I chose the Sushi Dinner which I really did not care for at all.  It is difficult to explain why some sushi is delicious and some, not so, but this was clearly no better than pedestrian Chinese Buffet-level sushi at a lot higher cost.  The $25 or so would have bee fine had the sushi been at least average, but it simply was not.  I know there have been a lot of great reviews, and perhaps my experience was the exception, but I doubt I would go back.",I went there yesterday for the first time and everything was perfect for me. The service was very nice and the food was incredibly good! A must have ist the Australian Wagyu wich were so soft and tender!! Thank you,"Pathetic portions, overpriced, and unable to take responsibility.Just received my delivery order and wow, what a disappointment. I had ordered once last year and remember being disappointed about the portion sizes since they are pricier than some other nearby places. But they have good reviews, so quality over quantity right?Actually, no. The only good part of my order was the Thai iced tea. The Kani salad was a complete joke at $8, consisting of maybe 4 bites. I actually went back to check the menu to make sure there weren't two different sizes.Moreover, the rock shrimp were bland and as I was eating, I felt a grainy sand substance in my mouth. Upon further investigation, NONE of the shrimp had been cleaned and deveined. What?! Seriously?! A sushi place that doesn't know how to clean shrimp? What a joke.After calling the restaurant to let them know, I was told ""we order them premade from a vendor and all we do is fry them....but we'll let our vendor know."" ..... No wonder nothing tasted fresh.I was offered a credit to my next order not a refund, which is useless since I won't be coming back. Thankfully GrubHub was able to get me a refund for the rock shrimp, and I will promptly reorder the same dinner from one of the clean and more appropriately-priced sushi places on the island. So sad that this place didn't work out for me.","If you haven't been here, you need to re-evaluate your life.Shishito is a tiny, hole in the wall, unassuming sushi spot. It's in the middle of nowhere, it's not a prime location, and if you walk by, you'd never even think to walk in. On the bright side, there's always parking out front.It really boggles my mind that it's not in Manhattan, but I guess that's what keeps the prices down. I'd never be able to ""go in"" the way I do here... I'd rack up a $500 tab anywhere else.If you're coming here, come when Raymond is there, the owner/chef. Call ahead if you must.He truly is something else. You can see how passionate he is about his food. It's not money that drives him. He just really genuinely loves seeing people's minds blown by his creations.They have a menu, and you should definitely order a few things from it, but most of the menu isn't on the menu. Ask Ray what you want to order. He knows better than you do.Must try's from menu:- Burned Snow White Roll- Brussel Sprouts (A++)- Seared Salmon Belly (MUST have)- Live Scallop (if any are left)- Wings (Not your regular wings... these are battered in tempura, fried, and tossed in like a light sweet chili mayo. So crispy, so juicy, so damn good)- Uni- King Salmon- Lamb Chops (A+++)Honestly, you can close your eyes and throw darts at the menu and you'll still be blown away.I don't know how he does it, but he gets the absolute freshest and uniquest fish. Still, some of his best stuff isn't even seafood. Don't be afraid to try things from the kitchen.If you ask Ray to come up with something, you will not be disappointed.Ray's secret creations not on the menu:- Seared Uni + Foie Gras Sushi (literally melts in your mouth)- Seared Wagyu with Toro and Caviar sushi (words cannot describe this flavor)- 45-Day Dry Aged Ribeye (Rivals Peter Luger)- Monster Roll (Try this)- Any of his special fish that dayI can go on and on about this place, but you have to come here to try it for yourself. It's a hidden gem. Don't be afraid to venture outside your comfort zone when you come here. You're in good hands with Ray.",Shishito
22,"Update: have since had it again (several times) and what a difference it has been. We decided to try it again because the first time we had it, it was delish and we LOVED it. I'm really happy we decided to give it a another chance because it was good again (so good). Additionally, the food was delivered much quicker than when I wrote that bad review. Would NEVER order take out from this place again. The food was cold. I live 7 minutes away and it took FOREVER to get the food, i could have walked quicker. The pad Thai was a giant clum of cold noodles and the mango and sticky rice was a clump of rice, gross. In addition, the delivery man was VERY rude. When I asked why it took so long, he replied, ""do you want your food or not?""","Would NEVER order take out from this place again. The food was cold.

I ordered the following:Spicy green noodles with beef: the noodles were cooked well but the beef was very tough and thinly cut. The sauce was very salty too.Fresh ginger with shrimp: there was only about 4 pieces of shrimp and the vegetables in the dish were mediocre. It was served with a side of rice but its hard to eat when there is HAIR in the rice.Again, i really wanted to like this place but couldn't for the OBVIOUS reasons...","This is the only place that has some good tasting chicken pad Thai. I usually order it without peanuts. They're clean and the food arrives hot if you're ordering for delivery. It's 15$ per meal. They're lunch menu is pretty cheap 12.50 meal, appetizer and drink. I love me some Thai food.","I have been here multiple times since and So far they have been very consistent on delivering really good thai dishes. So I just wanted to update my review with a mini review:Atmosphere: This didnt change, same cozy place. =)Wait Staff: Still super friendly and accommodating. Each person that interacted with us, kept asking if everything was alright, they kept our water topped off and cleared plates very promptly from the table. I couldnt be more happier.Drink: Thai Iced Tea is super delicious as always. The black tea blend is very prominent, but the condensed milk takes out the bite just right.Appetizer: Tom Yum Chicken Soup - This had a really good and pungent sour/lemongrass flavor that has just the right spice level. Not sure why other places really water down their Tom Yum soup for the masses?Tom Yum Shrimp Soup - Also has the same perfect pungent flavor of the chicken, except using shrimp as the protein. Entrees: Like all my Thai reviews, I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai as the staple to compare all Thai restaurants. I ordered it extra spicy. The waiter said no problem. When it arrived, I saw the reddish hue in the noodles, I knew it was gonna be spicy! It was really spicy. I was glad I didnt order it Thai Spicy, as it would have been really difficult to eat. =) Now here is a difference I noticed from many Thai restaurants I have been to. The chicken pieces were cut into bite size portions. Next, the chicken is cooked with the noodles. how can i tell? Look at the color of the chicken piece. Its not white. it matches the noodles. The flavor was all over that piece of protein.  Most places appear to either quickly stir fry the chicken separately and mix it at the end right before plating, or they steam the chicken and combine before plating, which inn my opinion leaves it bland.Naked Tilapia with Basil - We go this medium spicy. The sauce was amazing. had a good kick even with medium and i love the basil flavor in their savory sauce.  Overall: Yet another consistently good meal here. I cant believe this is a small chain. Its one of my favorite Thai places if I'm in the area.If you like food cooked with lots of bold flavors, then you can't really go wrong here. Plus they will make it to your spice level. Just be warned. Spicy is decently hot and Extra Spicy is definitely not for the faint of heart. Just know your spice level and start low just in case and next time you go, you can keep upping it. =)Good luck, good eats, and Bon Appetite.","After we finished helping out a friend on Staten Island, we were going to head into Brooklyn to grab some Dinner. We found a Noodlefan in Staten Island and was thrilled because the Noodlefan we tried in Monroe Township, NJ was very good. So here is what we found at this small chain.Atmosphere:This was a very cozy, chic & modern type decor. The walls were dark walnut with some good definition. Floors were bright and the table tops were dark to match the walls. The back wall had a about a 2 foot high backsplash using small random horizontal colored glass that ran from left to right.  The space was pretty quiet albeit a little small.They didnt have bar per se, so all their drinks are behind the cashiers counter, which was also a to-go/delivery stationWaitstaff: The waiter is very polite, kind and attentive. He is very helpful with any question we asked him. Food:Appetizer: Spicy Thai Wings - This was very good. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Coated with Thai chili sauce that was a little sweet and slight spice to it. I really couldn't complain even though it wasn't really spicy.We also had Oxtail soup and Tom Yum Shrimp soup. The Tom Yum soup was good. It had a good kick and good 'sourness' to it. Its better than many places that I have eaten at lately. The star was the OX tail soup. The soup had that 5 spice flavor that was not watered down. It tasted like the soup was simmering all day. Even though I wish the Oxtail could have been a bit more tender, it was really tasty with the broth. I took most of it home and cooked heated up the next day and it was absolutely perfect.  Entrée: Again, I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, like I always do at any new Thai place I go to so that I can compare it to all the rest i've tried.Let me tell you, it was done perfectly. it had the great flavor from the fish and tamarind sauce. Although I did order it extra spicy, it came out as medium. I think next time, I will have to ask for ""Thai Spicy"". I was very happy they were very consistent with their food from the other location.Drink: Of course I had to order a Thai Ice Tea and it was delicious! The concoction was freshly made and not from a powder, like some places. At $2 a cup, its a steal!! I always order an extra one to take with me on road after i am done eating! Price: The price is very attractive for those on a relative budget that wants to enjoy some really good food. Chicken Pad Thai was $10, Shrimp Pad Thai is approximately $12. Overall: I totally enjoyed all the food here. I don't think you will be disappointed in the robust flavors from these dishes. Very authentic Thai cuisine from a very unassuming Thai/Asian bistro chain. I absolutely recommend this place. Thanks for reading my review and trusting my taste buds. Until next time, Bon Appetite!!",Noodlefan
23,"The food and drink at Beso is 5 Star.  The service, and how you're treated, is entirely different.  First, when you walk in, you are told the wait is longer than it is, and the hostess immediately tries to push you to go to their sister restaurant, Blue, which doesn't serve the same type of food, and is a 10-15 minute drive.  She even goes so far as to call Blue, and tells you they can take you immediately.  This has happened on more than one occasion, where I was told a wait was an hour, yet somehow, miraculously, I was seated within 15 mins.  If you don't want business, or want to be selective, be open about it.  Don't treat/talk to me like I am an idiot.  It can lose you a LOT of business.  You must be making $$ hand over fist if you treat people as you do, and they keep coming back.  But some day, the lack of respect will catch up.","A group of 9 and I came to Beso on a Sunday at 4:00pm. When we arrived, we were told all tables were taken for later reservations but we could gladly sit at the bar. The restaurant as a whole was empty for the exception of two tables and the bar had a couple seated so we all decided to sit at the bar. We came because we had a show at the St. George theater at 7:00pm. Immediately the male bartender was extremely irritated. The attitude we received was unbelievable. He told us that this is too much for him (the 10 people we were with plus couple at the bar) and sorry. We proceeded to order drinks and he sent a waiter to take our tapas order because it was ""too much"" for him. I was sitting at the edge of the bar near the computer and busboy station area. The entire time we were there, this bartender was going off. I have never seen anything so unprofessional in my life. He was slamming glasses into a bucket, screaming at the waitstaff and bus staff, and even yelled at my elderly family member. He told the busboy that he ""f***ing hates everyone in this restaurant"". He also kept slamming his fingers against the restaurant's computer screaming ""f***, f***, f***!"" We wanted to order second drinks and were honestly afraid. So we'd order them through the amazing waiter, Sylvester. After speaking privately with the manager, we realized he just makes excuses for this pathetic employee. The hostess also spoke with us privately and said he abuses her too but she doesn't want to snitch on him. Honestly this is no way to treat workers or customers. I will never be back because of this. The owner should be ashamed. Two stars because the food was fine but probably spit in.","Not happy.  I give one star for the empanadas which were delicious as was the guacamole and chips.  The disappointment. The sangria was extremely weak, my Beso chicken was like rubber and my fiancé's meal, chicken stuffed with chorizos and spinach was dry, chewy and inedible.Have been looking forward to going here for some time and figured since the same people own Blue and Bayou, which are terrific, it would be a no brainer.  We had a 75th birthday party there and aside from great company with family, left feeling  disappointed, unsatisfied and annoyed.",Short review - just go there for Latin inspired tapas.Service - greatPrice - $$ average Value - very good foodAmbience- romantic low light dinnerFood - perfection,"Immediately when you walk in there's the smell of garlic, oil, rice cooking. This place has flair, décor, and great food to tie it together, but unfortunately in some areas it just fell a little short.I want to start with the sangria, as it is, just where the meal began. The sangria was bold, flavorful, just smooth and light, very good sangria that I don't believe you would find in most places. We should have ordered tapas, but we just weren't in the mood for appetizers so we went straight for the entrees. That being said, the entrees took quite a little bit to come out, but staff were sure to keep attending to us and apologizing for the wait.While the food was hot, there was a different issue with the entrees. My wife's paella was huge for her alone, and my churrasco steak was very petit. Luckily, we were able to broker a deal where she would get some tomato salad and I would get about a third of paella plus all of the mussels (there were clams, but they had not meat, most likely cooked out). Either way, without rice the meal comes off very small for someone who may not have someone they can get paella from, as the rice and beans on the side was very small and lackluster in taste.This place is so close, so close to being a great spot, just need to revisit some of the portions and tweak recipes OR encourage guests to order tapas with deals or whatever the case may be.Thank you.","Was shopping In the area to checkout the new empire outlets and decided to come here to enjoy an early dinner. This place is such a cute little gem. We arrived around 4pm so it was nice and early, it does get busy so if you want to come later I suggest calling for reservations. Online reservations is not available.Service was very friendly. We ordered a bunch of tapas and sipped on some sangria and modelo. We had a great time. I noticed the place getting packed. Didn't feel rushed. If ever by the ferry definitely check out Beso.",Beso
24,"It's Deninos. It's world famous pizza. What else is there to say?Great staff, cozy atmosphere","Denino's is a no-frills full-service restaurant that serves incredible pizza at a fast-paced speed. It's laidback and casual and they don't take credit cards. Parking is atrocious and you won't be given the friendliest of greetings but don't let that deter you. The pizza is 100% worth the setbacks. Not a huge fan of the cracker-like end-crust, but the ""pizza portion"" of the pie is insane. Bursting with fresh flavors. It's hard to describe how tasty the pizza is. So, you really need to go try for yourself. I wouldn't lie to you. If they're in competition with other pizza joints, I'm sure they're ahead of the game. Go get it. You need it.",Pizza is good but overrated. Service is questionable. Bartender serves you your drink with a look of discomfort. Unless you're Italian of course.,"Old fashioned thin pizza pie, typical for Staten Island Style. Yummy for sure!I believe this is the first location that I was exposed to Staten Island Thin pizzas and I was not disappointed. My parents and I are from Brooklyn, we are used to medium thick pizza pie, not thin or thick. It is a adjustment for us when we moved to Staten Island a few years ago.If you never visit here, it is a must!For someone who is not from Staten Island, it is a must to visit here and go to Ralph's that is across the street.","It is always great going out to dinner with great friends. Denino's came highly recommended so why not. I was expecting a great experience so maybe the raves led to some of my disappointment. We decided on pizza and fried calamari and fried shrimp. The calamari was very good. It was crispy, not oily and cooked perfectly. Not turning them into rubber bands is not easy but they were perfect. The shrimp was good too. What did not live up to the hype was the pizza.I must bevery picky about my pizza but for me it was just ok. I felt it really lacked in the flavor department. The sauce was just ok and the crust was a little bit too thin for me.I enjoyed the dinner but I really to get all the over the top raves.","Favorite pizza in SI! Actually in NYC period.Enjoyed among two adults and two children1. Garbage pie-Classic with all meats and mushrooms and onions2. Sautéed spinach3. Calamari- just rings which is good for those that don't like tentacles 4. Chicken tenders and fries - huge order with 4 people pieces- big enough for two kidsParking is difficult but doable.  Pay in cash if you want to avoid service charge with credit card.If you can, save room for Ralph's ices.",Denino's Pizzeria Tavern
25,what i can tell you about this place is that they serve the beverages in a mason jar. its a savy place.,"DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY FROM THIS ""BUSINESS"". I ordered via Grub Hub and they sent me the wrong order. Because they could not get another driver from Grub Hub without a new order being submitted, they had no way to fix the situation and I never got my food. This is no way to deal with customers. Terrible way to deal with their mistake. If the owner had an idea of how to run a business, especially a food establishment, he would have made sure someone, anyone, from his restaurant jumped in their car and drove me the correct order. Especially for almost $50 and especially since it's a 5 minute drive.Still waiting on a refund, and if it's not a full refund including the tip I left for food I never received, I will need to discuss it in person with the owner. Or, I can go on an on line campaign to make sure I impact the business and everyone on SI knows how they treat their customers. How many other customers get screwed for deliveries they never get or get incorrectly? Hop Shoppe...you need a plan b for when YOU make an error.Disgusting",Had the thai chili wings they were good crunchy ahould have had some extra dipping sauce but didn't. We also had skirt steak tacos andwe were  both disappointed. Three taco's were filled with a mistake an unidentifiable mess with no discernable taste. I wanted a do over I started to wish i ordered the burger. Wrong they should not have that horrible item on the menu. Two lunches forty four dollars and it wasn't good,"Service: very good. Both our waitress & the person who brought the food out were pleasant, friendly & kind to the 2-year olds we had with us. Food: was good! Buffalo cauliflower & the portabello burger were delicious as was the Mac & cheese (as determined by full bellies of the kids). The holy grail & the stuffed burger were also very good as were the waffle sweet potato fries.Drinks: the poloma was good as was the mule & the rum drink. For some reason, the overall tab seemed rather high, but it's a solid 4/5 place in my book",I usually order for pick up or order in advance to eat in. Service is sometimes slow. Food is always delicious and prices are reasonable. Wish they had  lunch specials.,"My boyfriend & I think we found our new go-to bar. The food is good. The general tsos cauliflower was sooo good! The beer list is extensive, which we like b/c we're not big beer drinkers, and actually taste good. The prices are also very reasonable.",The Hop Shoppe
26,"Have to admit food was tasty, but very heavy. Service wasn't good cause of the language barrier. She hardly spoke English and was very hard to order our meals.","Came here because pho Mac ( restaurant next door) is closed on mondays . We got there about an hour before closing . There was no one else inside and the waiter seemed uninterested in seating us. We got the appetizer platter and a lamprias dish. The appetizers were all exactly the same and tasted like they pretty much had the same stuffing and fried it 4 different ways. The lamprias came wrapped in a banana leaf , the flavor was lacking and the chicken dry . The eggplant was mushy . And the service was terrible , didn't come check on us or can to refill our water when we ran out . Wouldn't come back.","Decent food, terrible service. There was only one person to wait on 5 tables on a Saturday night. If I happen to have another craving, it will most definitely be for pick-up.","I liked their hospitality,  food, and the surrounding .    Server who welcomed me and my boyfriend was really sweet. Most likely , I've been here for three times. And all these time, I had a wonderful experience . They have been nice towards us. Starting from service, environment, and food. They were all great. Devilled chicken, hoppers, and fried rice has been my favorite since day one. Every time , I come here I order these 3 items. They're all vey delicious     I'll certainly keep coming and will recommend you peeps. They got both Indian and sri-lankan food.","It's actually very coincidental since I searched up Asian Staten Island the other day on Youtube and a bunch of videos on the large Sri Lankan population in Staten Island popped up. Very cool to try and experience the culture through food.  Today on Sunday it was the first time my family and I tried this Sri Lankan and Indian buffet for only $14.95! The atmosphere is nice and quiet with ethnic music playing in the background. The buffet is upstairs. There's a small dessert section with delish mango mousse, flan, fresh cut fruits like cantaloupe, watermelon, small oranges and pineapple, and curd and honey. Carbs are in one section including coconut with rice, biriyani, and veggie noodles. Then all the entrees like shrimp stir fried with tomatoes, peppers and onions - so delicious, one of the best dishes, dark brown chicken curry, egg curry which my mom rlly liked, stir fried jack fruit, lentils, mango dish, coconut sombol, salad, and some thin chips called papadum which were sooo good almost like chinese shrimp chips. Would totally recommend. It's right next to Pho Mac! I really like how Staten Island has more Asian ethnic food and a diverse variety! Randiwa has been here around for 5 ish yrs and first time trying! Very nice :)","Excellent Food. Excellent Service. Exotic Dishes.We were warmly greeted.  The dishes were explained to us patiently.The food was delicious. We got an appetizer that allowed us to sample several typical dishes and then we ate their Vegetarian Hopper with coconut milk and these crispy  rice cakes and fish Lamprie, which consists of Rice, Eggplant, Potatoes, fish, fish patty, fried onion and it came wrapped in a Banana Leaf.Can't recommend enough.",Randiwa
27,Our second home on staten Island.We have never been anything less than over the moon when we come to Blue.,"Well my husband and I decided to go out on a Wednesday night date. We decided to go to Blue. We were seated immediately.  When we were presented the menu we noticed the menu had changed and were very limited. For appetizers we ordered clams which I thought were going to be sauteed in a broth or sauce but when they reached our table they were essentially baked clams...very disappointed.  We also ordered a beetsalad with goat cheese. Now I would expect some greens on the plate but instead it was sliced beets with some basil and a blob of goat cheese in the middle. Now you know how pungent the goat cheese is and I feel it should be used sparingly. For my entree I ordered a lamb burger. Which was very gamey. Lamb should be well seasoned with garlic ,black pepper, thyme. Red wine and worchester sauce. All n all a very disappointing menu. On the bright side the waiter was fantastic!We use to come here regularly but sadly we need to move on.",The place has nice view and atmosphere. We went twice this month for prefix brunch and dinner.  Unfortunately the quality of food was so so. You get what u pay for.Unripe tomatoes  hardly any basil on a salad  and yucky  blueberrie pudding.  Nevertheless we had good time and enjoyed the view. I don't think it's worth returning.,"Visiting Staten Island, we found this great restaurant with an amazing view, and a very well selected Mediterranean cuisine Menu.We ordered a Pinot Grigio, and started with Portuguese Octopus.The delicious Pumpkin soup and the Meze made a perfect light lunch as we wanted before going to explore the SnugHarbor Botanical Garden.The service is extraordinary, and they are attentive to every single detail.Having lunch outdoors while enjoying the calming water view and spotted the water iron giants is a pleasure that has no price.I encourage you to visit Blue restaurant when you have a chance.","I've eaten at Bayou, which is one of my Favs, Beso and now Blue, all owned by the same owner. All three have a very different ambiance. Bayou is sweet, quaint and with a more subtle and romantic feel. Beso is more trendy, but garners the feeling of an old world pub to a degree. Blue is completely different from both with a more modern, elegant and charming appeal. Housed on the outskirts of the water, you have the choice of eating inside or on the veranda where you can enjoy the view of the city or boats in the harbor. Its a nice place to kick back and relax in the spring or on a hot summer day.The food was good, but the appetizers are better. The wings were excellent along with the calamari and salad with feta cheese. I also had some of the seafood selections which was ok, not city island but tasty. A big pricy and they could add a little more seafood but it was good.I'd go again, but my choice leans towards appetizers.","Beautiful night so we wanted some place we could sit outside. Nice outdoor seating, makes you feel like you aren't even on Staten Island. Staff was very attentive, worked as a team well. It was our first visit we decided to try the pre-fixe menu and get to sample a few items (plus $10 unlimited Sangria add on was very appealing) Started with fresh Mozz & tomato basil plate and then salad of the day which was a Caesar. The mozzarella was really delicious, well seasoned and the balsamic drizzle was wonderful. The Caesar salad was nothing to be excited about -- they could of put some homemade croutons and fresh shaved Parmesan cheese to make it more enjoyable. Next course we chose the fried calamari and rice ball duo. The calamari was delicious. I saw someone getting served the Thai calamari that's on the regular menu. That wasn't a choice for the pre fixe but the waitress was nice enough to put the Thai sauce on the side for me and that was perfect because it did have a nice kick to it but the flavors were really nice. I'm not sure how I would like it poured all over anyway, so just to dip it was perfect. Now the rice balls were outrageous. There was a buffalo one not really spicy, had a nice sauce with it. The other was a more traditional but packed with flavor. Outside perfectly crunchy. I would def order these again. Best rice balls I've had in awhile. For our main dishes my husband chose some chicken dish as he doesn't eat seafood. I forgot the name but it had these delicious earthy mushrooms, and a tasty sauce. The chicken was rolled with a prosciutto I believe. He got a side of orzo with peas that was light and delicious. I opted for the Shrimp Parmesan over spaghetti.  A simple dish I was in the mood for, nothing outrageous. Next time I would like to try something more seafood focused but it was perfect for the pre fix and the portion size was just right. The dessert choices are only a chocolate cake with cannoli cream on top. Simple, tasted more like a brownie than a cake. And a tartufo. Again simple but good for a sweet endingAll in all for the price you can't beat it. Everything was good and the exceptional service, paired with the perfect weather and outdoor seating gave for a wonderful experience and I will return and try the regular menu next time.",Blue
28,"The sangria was really good, besides that the family style portions lacked the size. I would say instead of being a family size plate it's more of an average plate size/portion. I left hungry.","My family loves this place, so we made a reservation for Saturday to celebrate my mother's birthday. I personally didn't have strong feelings towards Patrizia's, the food is usually fine but overpriced, whatever.The reason I'm taking some time out of my day to give them a 1-star review is due to a large few strands of hair in our salad. It was thick, disgusting hair embedded in the salad. At first, my mother brought it to our server's attention and he had the audacity to suggest it may have been her's. EVEN IF IT WAS (WHICH IT WASN'T), to even suggest that is horrible customer service. Most of us lost our appetite after that.Management took the salad off the check and offered free dessert/espresso but this was still a horrible experience. Everyone else's food was fine; not bad, but not great either.",First the place is a nice place and the food was good what I was able to taste. The problem I had was there wasn't enough for Everton at the table. It was family style with extremely small portions which were about bite size. I'd like to say my first experience wasn't all that great. I may try them again and update if the experience is different. We will see when I have time someday.,"My favorite restaurant on Staten Island. I've tried everything off their menu. Real, authentic Italian food. I had my daughters christening here and her 2nd birthday party. The owner is very nice and helpful. Always making sure we are full and happy. Appetizers : wings, mussels and buratta a must try. Love their pizza. The crust is so soft. And it's a nice cheesy slice. All their seafood that I've had is always fresh and has so much flavor. For dessert. EVERYTHING ON THE MENU IS GOOD. Noisy, but fun. It's always a party at Patrizias.",came here today to DJ for a bridal shower. the staff first of all are super friendly esp the head server in the gray shirt w/ the beard (sorry if I didnt catch your name). every food served to use was GREAT. i was waiting for something mediocre. that is not the case! here is what we had..... ... coming back to eat with my DJ partner & also bring my family.,"My Family and I have been coming to Patrizia's for years now. I've never been with a group less than 10 - this place can accommodate groups of any size as it is quite large. We always order one of the pre-fix menus; I've never actually ordered off the regular menu either. The food is delicious and never disappoints. They bring out what seem to be endless courses and each one gets better and better. There are so many appetizers you can barely move by the time the pasta and meat are brought out. It's also a BYOB which is a major plus. You have to understand that when you come here, the experience is going to be loud, active, and in my opinion, very fun. It's always packed so reservations are a must. The music is loud and every time there is a birthday, they play a loud birthday song and everyone swings their napkins in the air while they bring out desserts with sparklers. Waiters are running around like chickens with their head cut off. It is truly an experience dining here. If you are looking for a quiet, low-key restaurant, this isn't the place for you. But if you have an open mind and are looking for great food with a fun atmosphere, give it a go. The only issue I have is that the parking lot is WAY too small. Get there early so you have ample time to find a spot. They do offer valet service for when you are in a pinch but parking is always a headache.",Patrizia's of Brooklyn - Staten Island
29,It's getting two stars because the owner switched to cash only. Went last night and had a $150 dinner bill and needed to run to the owner's cash machine next door. I'm not coming back. And I've noticed both spots are not as busy as they were prior to the change.,Place has gone down hill. Seems the owner is only concerned with the Bier Hall next door. People still come and love it but that is not surprising since Staten Island has such a low standard for a lot of the things.,Worst Place Ever Most taps aren't workingBathroom toilet full with paper and urine and no hot water to wash while waitress looks at herself in mirror Bartender was cleaning bar mats on bar as we ate Oh and the reason you are really reading this The food sucked Dry potato pancakesPork cutlets taste as if they were cooked in dirty oil Pork loin over cooked   This is my first review EVER Bartender was very nice why I even gave a star,"I have been coming here for years, but wanted to give it a proper review, because if you live on the north shore of SI, you gotta come here!The place is super quaint and very traditional with the decor. Even the wait staff wears traditional German outfits!The food though is the star. I got a sampler of all their sausages while my dad got the goulash. Both were AMAZING, but personally I think those sausages are the reason why people should come! Order those and a beer and you are good to go!","I base this review on a recent lunch. I had a good goulash soup to start- not great, but acceptable. I'm Hungarian so I'm picky.The sauerbraten was tender, plentiful, and tasty and the dumpling was first rate. Lovely atmosphere. I need to bring my half German girlfriend here.","What a lovely place! We found ourselves in Staten Island for the winter lantern festival and decided we should take the opportunity and eat locally. Nurnberger is actually split up into 2 establishments - a beer hall with a bar, sometimes live music, some tables/chairs and a limited menu. This is where we hung out and played darts while waiting for a table at the restaurant next door. The staff in the restaurant came to the beer hall to look for us. The restaurant is quite charming, the staff are all dressed in traditional attire.It's on the smaller side so not the best for large groups. There were only 2 of us so we split the potato pancakes to start. We ordered the sausage sampler platter and the schnitzel with the mushroom sauce. The portions were generous and we were happy to bring home leftovers. The service was efficient and the food was very tasty. I'd definitely come back should we find ourselves jn the area again.",Nurnberger Bierhaus
30,"I usually don't give such low ratings but I literally had the worst experience here. It's unfortunate because I was really looking forward to coming too. Our reservation was for 5:45 PM and we got seated in the back in some tent that they set up. It wasn't horrible looking but...it was a tent. The temperature the entire night kept fluctuating it was either disgustingly hot or freezing cold. Another couple was sitting next to us and came in later than us and also complained of the cold. We ordered our drinks (Baby you're driving and a vodka drink with pomegranate and lemon) which were fantastic and decided that we would make the best of the seating arrangement. 1.5 HOURS PASS and we haven't gotten our 1ST COURSE yet. I went to complain because at this point we were starving and freezing. The couple next to us were on their entree and they were there after us! The owner was nice enough to comp the dinner for us but by that time I was already tired and sick of being there. We didn't even eat our entree, packed it to go and went home. In terms of food, it was just 'okay' I've been to less expensive Italian restaurants that were so much more flavorful than what we had here. The lobster bisque was okay, gargenelli was alright, everything else BLAND. I hate doing this because I try to look for the best in every restaurant experience I have but I don't think I would recommend or go back here again. What a way to put a damper on a special valentines dinner.The 1 star is for comping dinner and the drinks. Never coming back.","One of our go to restaurants on Staten Island.   We have been to bin 5 over two dozen times and never had anything other than an exceptional Meal.  Danny is a gracious host and always accommodating to the dietary restrictions of his clients, He also makes a mean ""old fashion"".  And a (review) for the people who think it cool or rad or your obligation to society to trash any business in an attempt to hurt them.

Since there was one seat open at the bar, my husband offered me the chair while he stood. We live remotely from each other since I attend LSU veterinary school (Louisiana State University) while he's stationed here. As a second time visitor to Staten Island, I love being here with him. The restaurants and atmosphere have been wonderful. This was my most troubling experience in New York. I was very shocked when upon sitting for a short period of time I get a message from my husband that the owner pulled him aside  ""I (just me not him) need to leave, or the cops will be called on me"" We didn't ask questions. We left.It was very hurtful, and I'm not sure how things went from 0-100 in seemingly no time. I also don't understand why I couldn't directly be approached as to what trouble I caused. I only spoke directly with him (my husband).  I'm left to think a number of things like maybe I was speaking loudly to my husband about the calamari I wanted; maybe I wasn't wearing the right shoes (flip flops); or maybe it was because we are an interracial couple (I'm Asian American while he is Caucasian) and the owner didn't realize we were married.I didn't exchange any conversation with anyone other than my husband. If I was unintentionally shouting, couldn't I be asked to speak softer? If I was wearing the wrong shoes, why did he let me sit in the first place? If he thought something was wrong with me to begin with, I don't understand why I was even politely greeted and had a seemingly great experience just to have an embarrassing statement made about me. I'm confused/embarrassed/hurt. I'm sorry I had that experience. I'm sorry that my husband had that experience. I thought the atmosphere was wonderful. The drink was superb.

You will love it. Try the seafood risotto - fantastic.,"I have been to Bin 5 a few times, both during the week and on the weekend. I HIGHLY recommend going during the week! On the weekends it's way too loud and you might be waiting for a table for some time. Personally, I felt that my dining experience was totally different during the week compared to the weekend because the waiter was able to be more attentive. The staff is friendly, but when it's busy they are running all over the place and you might have to wait for them to circle back to you. The food does take a while to come but, but it's worth it! I have had the tasting menu and regular entrees and both were delicious. For either option, the best dish is the short ribs with gnocchi, which comes in the tasting menu and can be a full entree. AMAZING, best short ribs, fluffy gnocchi, and a touch of truffle.The tasting menu is $35, which is an amazing price for 5 courses! If you want, you can also add wine for $15, which I highly recommend as each wine paired super nicely which the dishes. However, the star of the show are the cocktails! This bartender is by far one of the best! There are so many different types and each is so unique.Overall it's a great place, but depending on when you go you'll have a totally different experience.","Nice place , very friendly and responsive to requests.Good vibes. I went with my friends for sat night diner. Not  manhattan  pricey, but food almost just as good.

I don't mind leaving extra money for good service but looking at my bill and not knowing why I was charged extra is frustrating. the Hookah wasn't even that great. I got SOME flavor but no clouds, ice hose was ok, Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place. It's way overpriced for the quality of the hookah. They use one cheap round charcoal per hookah and it was constantly BURNING OUT. Just had to sit there forever and wait for someone to finally change it out",this place assumes gender identity this place is not for lgbtq people today they asked a guy to put a shirt over tank top because they assumed he's male but he identifies as female never come here again .,"This place was way over priced for what you got.

After my first try, I felt like I was riding on a giant fluffy cloud while listening to Starboy by the Weeknd. It was a magical experience.",The place is nice. Hooke is good. Service is mediocre.  Food was actually very tasty. however they are not cheap. Hooka on a fresh head cost $25 Wich is a bit over market price ($16-20) but thats not the main  issue. They charged $10 service charge this is  irrelevant to the tax and gratitude. Just an additional charge. Another issue that I personally had a problem with is the fact they use the self-lighting  chemicalized charcoal which makes the  hooka have a bad taste rather than the natural coal. Ok standards for Staten Island. But I would cross over to Brooklyn for better and cheaper alternates.,The cutest hookah spot I've ever seen! I love the middle eastern decor/vibes.

The food was ok. But the sangria has no taste and the fruit in the sangria tastes old. I ordered a cappuccino and it was all milk. I told them and they brought me more coffee which was bitter. I tried to mix them together myself and it made a huge mess. They should have remade it. I should have asked for it to be taken off the bill.","Bad ,bad ,bad.what a horrible and tasteless  food.Colombian food is delicious and this restaurant doesnt make justice to it.the sweet plantain were raw.the chicharron hard and reheatedand there was no seasoning in the chicken and the shrimpcomplete waste of money.","Very disappointed the food was disgusting, unbeatable Spend $50 on cold  beef, felt chewy like I was frozen and heated up on the microwave.","Absolutely loved the food here. I will be back for a visit. Rice was cook perfectly, nothing will overly seasoned (too salty). The pork skins are truly amazing. They have little chunks of meat on it. Haven't tried their dessert, but I'm sure it's good also. If you're ever on the Island or on Forest Ave be sure to check them out you won't regret it","Again, never disappointed! Went for lunch.  If you go, please order the appetizer, plaintains w/guacamole and shrimp!  Delicious!  Husband had the Shrimp in garlic sauce and Had the steak w/onions.  Tastes like home!  The atmosphere is relaxed and the service is great.  Before you leave, get some of their bread deserts.  Really good with a cup of coffee.  If you decide to have dessert there, you can't go wrong with all they offer.  Highly recommend this restaurant!",Never disappointed!  Food is delicious and the staff is wonderful. Not overpriced and the best Sangria yet!,Rinconcito Paisa
34,"Awful Overpriced garbage with a horrible staffWhen I questioned the price of the drinks they wanted to argue...then admitted they were wrong-then changed it to be --- still overpriced/wrongThe portions were dry and bland-Everything a la cartThe bald manager dismissed me - made a huff and waved his hand at me while I was asking why I was so overchargedNever again!!!Oh-the 'server is new' excuse goes so far-she quoted us the wrong prices, dropped the food at the table and never returned and then when I flagged her down for the check, she dropped it on the table and watched us open it -knowing she overcharged! Staff laughed when I questionedI am appalled Also-asked why the prices are different online and was told 'it's not our fault'-it's on your website!!!Again-so many places to go - don't go here","There is a hell of a lot of Mexicans on this Island, and you would figure they should have a good place to eat. This joint fits the bill.....nice vibe too.  Will have to have a beer next time to truly get the full experience.......cheers!","If you are looking for good tacos, skip this place. Meat was under seasoned, guac was under seasoned, no heat in the meat, shrimp tacos were funky and all meat was over cooked. Not sure what the other people see in this place but the tacos are definitely not it.","Very fresh. Not fast food, foodie food. Good service. Very good menu choices. Had heard it was very good, was not disappointed.Good desserts as well. Good drinks. Real heart goes into prep and taste. Small location, intimate.We will return.","Absolutely adored this place! Food was fresh and authentic, it was my first time going, and it was the day before cinco de mayo so they were a little busy, but the staff is super attentive, and friendly. The food is delicious, we cleaned our plates!!! I wish I had room for dessert, because I saw other people with the flan and churros and was intrigued. Definitely will be back many more times (and after pregnancy to try the delicious looking margaritas)","My husband and I ate the other night after hearing some fantastic reviews from our friends . Have to say the place is really cozy and cute, menu is authentic, staff was friendly and accommodating. I really enjoyed my mango margarita (i could actually test the tequila which is a plus) the drink was filled with lots of flavor. The food was delicious and a wonderful sized portion. Everything was simply delightful.",Cantina Mexicana
35,If you want to gag on your food and have the runs for days this place is for you . For those of you who step foot in mezcals say your prayers and for those of you who step foot in the bathroom also say your prayers.,"On 11/5 I went to Mezcals for a quick takeout order- ordering Guacamole and chips and two side orders of rice and beans. The bill came out to no more than $18 even maybe less. I used my credit card put either a one or two dollar tip on it, i don't remember,and a few days later I look at my checking account and they charged me $28 and change. I was furious but I had thrown out my receipt and didn't have the proof to go in the store with.  I called twice And asked for a manager just to tell them what I thought- not to ask for money back because again I have no proof I just knew what happened , but there was never anybody to talk to. I know better now.",Mezcals is a great hall in the wall with very good food and nice staff. Very empty at lunch time so you can always get a table. Parking is horrendous and if you park in the lot chances are someone is going to block you in. The chorizo nachos are really good. My only bad experience was when I stupidly order fajitas and nachos to go. Those are 2 things that don't travel ever from anywhere. So that's my own fault. A little more expensive then your average Mexican joint but as long as your eating there and not take out it's totally worth it!,"Amazing restaurant! My family loves this places and goes all of the time. They've taken me twice and I've loved it every time! Their margaritas are good. The food is always tasty and fresh. The prices are alright. I've been with three people and a large group of 9; no problems either time. If you go for a birthday, they sing and do candles! I'll be back here for sure.","I had pork in Adobe sauce with a Margarita. The pork was overdone and got cold before I could finish chewing it. The margarita was OK, packed a punch and had a very pretty glass but wasn't refreshing.$30 for one person.. It was okay but I wouldn't go again.Also the parking situation is FUBAR.. I was asked to move my car, twice, during my stay. At first I was going to get takeout, because I was blocking someone in. Then I was persuaded to move my car so I could sit and enjoy myself, which sounded good.. Except I blocked in another person who asked me to move in the middle of my meal.If they reserved the inside row for staff only maybe that would help? Idk.","Delicious, cozy & casual I always get the enchiladas w green sauce. Fantastic ! Guacamole there is always fire too! Wash it down with a nice strong margarita & you can't go wrong",Mezcals Mexican Restaurant
36,"I came specifically for the clam pie and to see what's the hype about. I was very disappointed, nothing like a real clam pie from Lombardi's. We also had garlic bread with cheese which was disgusting, it was plain Italian bread with cheese on top and put in the oven.",Three words... White Clam PieBest in Staten Island. This place is a Staten Island Monument! Can't go to Staten Island and not get me some white clam pie. Fugedaboutit,This is one of if not the best pizza places in Staten Island. It's up there with Denino's in my opinion. Service is fast and friendly so no complaints on that end. It is cash only so that's a bit annoying though not a deal breaker by any means.,Best pizza on staten island ! Never leave here disappointed.Great and quick service,"after doing trail cleanup nearby in crazy hot and humid conditions, you better believe we needed a refuel and FAST.garlic bread with mozzarella and fried calamari in a spicy buffalo sauce (bruh, you can get marinara anywhere, level up IN THE BUFF) are great appetizers.half pie of clams with white sauce, half pie of chicken and hot peppers. thin crust, not soggy at all, just crispy enough to be structurally sound. clams on pizza may sound odd but trust this goomba, you'll love it.a solid beer selection to drink away your worries while waiting for the rain to subside.gimme a HELL YEAH.somewhat harried but still friendly service (only one waiter on a strangely busy Saturday afternoon). we didn't wait that long. and everything came out piping hot and fresh.cash only, but that's perfectly fine, cause THIS IS AMERICA, land of the free and home of the Whopper.","Nice honey feel. Family friendly pub/restaurant. Everyone was welcoming. The place was clean. The pizza, salad, and pasta we had were good and well priced. Con: only take cash",Lee's Tavern
37,"The food was ok ,but the service was horrific if I think I waited at least 15 to get a waitress and when she came she never got me my drink if you want a good service don't come here.","I'm sad I'm unable to give this restaurant a higher rating. Although the restaurant is small, it is very intimate and presents well. We were immediately greeted, escorted to the dining area, where we were given the opportunity to choose our seating. The waiters and waitresses were very friendly and attentive. My boyfriend and I each ordered a pasta dish. I enjoyed mine (only complaint was that it was too hot - not a real complaint!) however my boyfriend's dish wasn't as great. When we returned home, he got sick! Terrible stomach pains and everything to follow. I have nothing but great things to say about the staff and the atmosphere, but something in the dishes unfortunately upset our stomachs.","Me and my family have been coming here for seven years and it's the only Italian restaurant we still go to on the island. Pasta is made fresh, pappardelle with goat cheese, carbonara pasta, risotto is the usual dishes we get and they are always amazing.Restaurant is an old hotel inn, that really takes you to a whole different place. You won't believe you are in Staten Island.Must try Italian restaurant if you are nearby","We dined here for Father's day with my dad. We were seated right away for our 1:00 reservation. Our table had a cute reserved sign on it.Food was outstanding and the servers were attentive but not overbearing. They were all personable as was the owner, Maurice.. Our water glasses were filled promptly.  Even though we live in New Jersey, we will be back.Five stars for food and service!","We stopped in a couple of times late at night, honestly just prior to closing when all of the staff was getting ready to leave, but the service was great both times and one occasion I didn't care for the dish and they made sure to comp it and take care of me. Being the only patrons in the restaurant, it was quiet, comfortable, and we weren't meant to feel rushed. The other dishes we had were extremely good, and it wasn't for finding my 'go to' Italian spot on Staten Island, I'd definitely be returning.","Ciao Bella- this is the closest taste of Italy without driving to JFK to catch an Alitalia flight to the homeland! The dining room is separate from the bar area which has additional tables. There is also a patio area for dining  ala fresco, take advantage of the summer months, before they close for winter. Make a reservation or arrive at 5:30 PM when they open to be first one seated. Large parties break bread here for a delicious meal with vino and leave room for dessert. Great menu with fresh pasta made on premise and a daily special menu with traditional Italian dishes as well the dessert of the day (mentioned twice) so please make sure to taste homemade decadence. Lovely wait staff and management is around for any concerns. Most importantly, the whole restaurant staff is genuinely glad you came and happy to serve !                     MANGIAMO!!",Basilio Inn
38,"Such a shame, the second floor party space has gone downhill.  The walls could use fresh paint, the carpet is dirty.  They need to spruce up the place because the building from the outside is nice.  Waiters have no personality at all.","my husband and i been eating there since they opened... the food is excellent up to now.... back a month ago i had take out (happy family) 14.00.. full of vegetables and hardly any of the meat combinations... called the mgr and was told the next time he would put extra as i order the same thing all the time... we were there last night and it was terrible... soup noodles were steal, our drinks we order all the time they could not make because they ran out of something,  my happy family food was terrible... they used my husbands egg foo young sauce on it which is not the right sauce and to top it off the mgr present did nothing about my take out order in which he or another mgr would do when i ate there... i will eat there again but not on monday nor will i order that food again..... this is not the way to keep steady customers.","We decided to have our Dad's 90th birthday at oriental plaza because he loves Chinese food. So sorry we decided to have it there. The restaurant was over booked and our guests waited 2 hours for food. We ate noodles for 2 hours. The top food package we ordered was so skimpy. One egg roll, one spare rib and shrimp toast, so small they were bite size. The main course was also inadequate for the amount of people. The service was ok and that was because the staff is so overworked from the restaurant being overbooked. I would never have a dinner party there again.","Love this place!!! My girlfriend had my 30th birthday party here. Place is amazing, friendly, and the quality of the food is top notch.",I have this place five stars because it's a really great space for parties of over 20 and they have 3 rooms you can use for it. The owners will work with you to tailor your experience. Chinese food is classically prepared and they can make authentic Chinese food like you would find in Chinatown in NY. Visit if your in the area!,"This is a great Chinese Restaurant! We often order from Oriental and sometimes eat at their Restaurant that is not your typical Chinese venue. The place is big and very comfortable and the service is second to none. This people know how to make you feel welcome and that's why you see entire families with children over there. Also, very cheap guys!!!It's really hard to pinpoint a favorite dish because they are all amazing but I am crazy for the sesame chicken, pepper steak and shrimp on garlic sauce. The only thing I wish they should improve is to make more spicy options. Every time I ask them to put some pepper on it still not enough. But this does not stop me to eat their food at least once a week - - - the kids love iwhich makes things much easier. Highly recommend this venue.",Oriental Plaza Chinese & Japanese Restaurant
39,"I go here for lunch. Spectacular wraps, and ALL other food!  I'm totally hooked on the Buffalo Wraps. Plus, lunch comes with tasty bread,  faccacia, salad and ice tea, seltzer or lemonade. What a deal!!!!",Hello food happens to be delicious but Staff is very unprofessional I work for the Hospital called an order in on JULY 02 the first gentleman was very nice ..I asked him how long the delivery would be because last week we ordered and the food took 2 hours to come. My co worker called 45 min to see if it was sent out and some girl who claimed to be the manager told him I was very nasty so I called back and she told me I was a liar and that the food never took 2 hours and told us to have a nice day and that we should find somewhere else to order from...not nice. And by the way the hospital spends alot of money  ordering from cucina fresca and I will spread the word to the other dept to look for other places to order from what a shame on your manager. She needs a class on phone skills,They've been consistently polite and the food deserves the 4 stars. Call ahead for specials if taking out.,"Let me tell you, this place is officially the Rao's of Staten Island for me. We've being trying to get a reservation a while but since they only have 6 tables, it's tough on a Friday or Saturday night. As luck would have it, we needed a lunch place so got lucky on a Saturday. We made reservations about 3-4 days in advance.The service, entirely family-run, was phenomenal and they welcome you as though you're a part of the family, too!For the food, we ordered their recommendations:Appetizer - fried calamari Entrees:1 - monkfish 2 - salmon3 - penne pomodore4 - pesto pasta with shrimpDessert - chocolate mousse cake and salted caramel skillet cookieDrinks - lemonade and iced teaAll of the food was delicious! The sauces and accompaniments were perfectly blended with the dish. The cognac sauce with the salmon specifically was superb.They are a BYOB place, which is great, and there is a liquor store around the corner which is typically open at the times they are. It's amazing and convenient. The complimentary bread and grandma slices are a great way to kick off the meal, too, but be careful not to get too full, as their portions are a generous size.Their prices are also quite fair for the quality you're getting. For 4 people, with entrees, apps, and desserts, our bill came out to $218.Overall, it's a huge win for me and I will certainly be back for dinner!",Delish. Food great service. I loved it tonight was the first time there  I give.  It a10 star  it's a must  to try  !!,Food is amazing! One of the best Italian places in the area. The service is really good too. You must check it out for yourself.,Cucina Fresca
40,Really wanted to go again. They couldn't squeeze in my party of three even with a day's notice.  I guess that speaks well of the quality of the food but I was disappointed that they didn't respond to my reservation request and let me know that I wouldn't have gone their for no reason.,"This place is shockingly disappointing. After reading the many outstanding articles and seeing the viral video about this place, I was really excited to try some ""nonna"" cooking. Sadly, the food is pre-made and underwhelming.I went with a friend and we shared three dishes. The night we went, the Italian grandma was there (a constant) and the Venezuelan grandma (a rotation). We tried food from both. From the Italian, we tried the veal entree (with veggies and mozzarella rolled up inside). The mozzarella wasn't fresh and the veggies were flavorless. The veal was very dry and rubbery. It was accompanied by bitter broccoli rabe (as it should be) and two slices of potato that was part hard and part cold.  We also had the zucchini which was served like a lasagna (layered with mozzarella and Parmesan). It tasted dry and reheated. When we asked, the waiter conceded that these dishes are ""pre-prepared"". This was very disappointing as we expected fresh grandma home cooking. From the Venezuelan, we had the shrimp arenas. They did taste fresh and delicious. However, the serving was 3 very small arenas with tiny shrimp inside for $18. Totally not worth it even though it was the only thing that tasted good.I was also offered an ""Italian sparking soda"" about which I was excited until I saw them pouring it from a can (and then serving it in a glass as though it's local). Just call it what it is, canned Pelligrino soda. This place is a 10 minute uphill walk from the ferry in the middle of a neighborhood that hasn't quite yet been revitalized. It's a long trek out to nowhere for food that is not worth it at prices that are absurd. They pride themselves on ""local"" and ""fresh"" and ""farm to table"" but, in reality, it's all pre-made. I was very disappointed especially after shelling out over $100 in cash for the dinner.","Humble opinion here:No disrespect to the elderly but unless you go through life growing psychologically, the same emotional baggage gets dragged around for a lifetime.Ate there and could not believe the psychological abuse spewed out by one of the ""nonnas"" on one of the ""interns"" serving their ""free"" apprenticeship. How kind and thoughtful they are at Enoteca, giving back to society like that.Learn how to cook and it's on us.Deception translated, it just means free prep help/labor, without any intent of teaching and any chance of learning blocked by the insecure, abusive nonnas or owners.A hidden gimmick in the guises of giving back, sure...It's the equivalent of being whacked by an imaginary rolling pin, with the aftermath of psychological damage being most real.That intern was in shock, with a face of disappointment , discouragement, expressive devastation and hurt.Shameful.The food is bland, inconsistent and highly overrated which pairs perfectly well with the attitudes.Nothing is worth what took place.Forget stars, apologies to the abused is more like it.A good grandma wouldn't have it any other way.","I'm in love with this place. I wish the grammas would adopt me and cook for me every day. The vibe is warm and welcoming, eclectic and quirky. The staff is both friendly and funny, so you feel like you are at someone's home. The food was outstanding.  Special app with sausage and phyllo dough. If the white lasagna is on the menu (with bechamel sauce) - make sure you get it!!My hubby got the Egyptian tangine which was flavorful and unique. One of the best meals I've had on SI. They helped me surprise and celebrate my husband's birthday with a song and dessert with a candle.","All of the food here was outstanding. We shared a mix of the standard Italian menu items, as well as a few of the special items from the Egyptian Nonna of the night. It was all so good, that I have to admit that these grandmas are better cooks than my own grandma.I'm so sorry, grandma Shirley. But also, step up your game SON.","My friends and I heard about Nonnas of the World when we were researching restaurants to try. We're so glad we found this spot; the service was superb, very welcoming, and the food was delicious, made with the freshest ingredients. Our hostess was very patient in helping us understand the menu and which nonna would be cooking for us that day.My party was pleasantly surprised with a Turkish menu. Between the three of us, we ordered the Turkish meatballs (kofte) and a plate of linguine from the regular menu. The side salad was made with fresh lettuce, cucumber, and cherry tomatoes; the meatball was oozing with flavor and drenched in a refreshing tomato dressing; the pasta was cooked al dente and evenly coated with a light olive oil dressing--a very satisfying meal indeed.We scheduled a reservation a few days in advance. Although we didn't know what to expect, a quick call the morning of allowed us to confirm the menu of the day and address any allergies that needed to be brought up. The restaurant staff are all very helpful and welcoming. I would highly recommend checking this restaurant out for their Nonnas of the World menu, or stopping by for delicious Italian food before taking a ferry back to NYC from Staten Island.",Enoteca Maria
41,"It was sunday afternoon, when we went there to eat--about 3pm.I wanted the falafel sandwhich and they told me they don't do sandwiches on the weekend...which I found to be ridiculous because it's on the menu.  We ordered the Kibbe (nothing special) for an appetizer and the falafel combo for entre.  They served it with rice or hummus and we chose the hummus.  It came out and it was just ok.  Pretty boring meal.  No wonder the place was empty.  You shouldn't have a menu with items that your not willing to make, especially when it's around lunch time.  Well, it was the first time we tried it...probably won't go back.  It was just ok.","A hard pass. I would never go back. A total waste of money and ridiculously priced. The worst food I've had. Hockey puck like falafel. Just awful, my friend's lamb was hideous looking and full of fat, they couldn't even eat it. This was a Saturday night, the service was chaotic and lacking attention and there were 3 people in the whole place. They draw crowds in with their belly dancer which we did not stay to watch.",If there was more stars i would give it to the staff at Marmar I have never had such a great experience. Not only the awesome food cook to perfection. The people at Marmar make you feel like family. I could go on forever. They go above and beyond,"Always a wonderful time to have a great dinner at Marmar! Had a friend from Middle East come to visit and instead eating vegetarian food per usual, we went over to Marmar as their food is halal. He had: mixed grillI had: spicy shish kabob (it was spicy) Our meal was capped off with Turkish coffee and we shared a kunefe, which is a sort of sweet, crunchy cheese pastry with pistachio ice cream on top.","With tip, tax, and delivery fee, this little thing came out to $32 and some change. Not to mention that the steak was not cooked to temperature I asked for (except for ONE piece). There were uncooked bits of chicken, the rice was good, but then on my delivery directions I said ""please don't ring the doorbell, call me and wait for me to come out"" because I live on the third floor of a house. The delivery person had their kid go up and start knocking on the door, waking up my neighbors. Not ok. Definitely not ordering from this place again. I'm Middle Eastern and this place was just not good. I don't know if it was because of the hour I ordered or what but this was way below subpar.",Food was super fresh and they were very accommodating to vegetarians! Strongly recommend the babaganoj and pumpkin - spinach kibbeh,Marmar
42,Get ready to be transported to another place in time.  The weekend buffet is a must and their desserts are to die for.  One of my favorite restaurants on Staten Island.,"I really liked the concept and the intensity brought to the Sri Lankan Culture. The hosts were friendly and the food was good. I went with a group of people who did say that the food wasn't flavorful enough but to me it did taste great.The ambience was intense and more or less of a museum feel to it. Now the downside is that I felt that there was too many things on the table making the table narrow for the food to be on it, and the chairs were too close to the other tables. I literally had to ask the person next to me to get up so I could go and access the food, I felt that they were being rudely interrupted while eating every time I had to go get something from the buffet.But other than the lack of space I liked the feel and intensity it brought to the clients.",Tooo hypedLoved the decor but food  is expansive snd small portionTastewise it goes more with bland than hot and spiceyEnjoyed the surroundings but not the food,"LOVE THIS SPOT!!! Yes I drove out to Staten Island to eat here and would do it again. Their lunch buffet is soooo affordable even on the weekend for $15 per person. All-you-can-eat, self-serve buffets. To be honest I have not had Sri Lankan food before coming here, and I am blown away by its deliciousness. Sri Lankan cuisine feels somewhat like a cross between Indian and Southeast Asian cuisine, but is its own entity. The egg curry is mild but very delicious. I am a huge fan of eggplant so I loved the roasted smoky eggplant. The beef curry was sooo good, resembling beef rendang but less coconuts and more smoky/savory. The pineapple curry is interesting with sweet/savory touch. The veggies are fresh and delicious. For dessert buffet they have gooseberry pudding, which has a really tart and fresh taste. Soo good. And the decor here is just beautiful, highlighting a mystical ambiance. I love how the bathroom is beautiful as well and full of Buddhist quotes. Leaves you feeling zen while taking care of business, a truly cathartic experience ;P","Overall it was a good experience and I would go back.If I could give 4.5 stars I would. Service: 5 out of 5 the staff were friendly and attentive. We were promptly seated on arrival and they took our order as soon as we were ready. They checked in with us just enough and not too much. Ambiance: 5 out of 5 the decor was interesting in a good way. There was a lot going on, but the elements worked well together. I also enjoyed the fact that they didn't have music blasting and I was able to have a conversation with my dining partner without screaming across the table.Food: 4 out of 5. The food was too salty for my taste. I had the assorted Sri Lankan appetizer and the kottu Roti curry lamb. I found both of these to be too salty. The Godamba Roti Lamb curry that my boyfriend ordered was better in terms of the salt level. Hope this helps. I'll post more pics and an updated review when I do revisit this place and try a different dish.","Came with a group of 6 for the buffet on Saturday afternoon. Was told they also have buffet for dinner. $15 includes dessert (different ice creams). VERY REASONABLE. They didn't charge us for the baby who barely ate anything so that was fair.The restaurant is lovely. It is decorated with unique and art and vibrant colors. The service was SUPER nice and they didn't complain we had a kid with a stroller or a larg-ish group in their small place where everyone wants a table. 5 stars for the service!5 stars for BYOB!!! Love love love they also loaned us a cork screw.All of the meat options had bones so be mindful of that. I stop to only the vegetarian items but all of I enjoyed. By the end, I was too full for dessert but everyone who had the ice cream loved it.I'll def be back and not just if I'm in the area. I would go out of my way to come back.",Lakruwana
43,"Despite living nearby for 15 yrs, I only started visiting there recently. I was suprised at how busy this ""out of the way"" place always seems to be..Best BBQ chicken and Ribs were falling of the bone....menu also has grilled steak and broiled tilapia.  Fried chicken  seems to be their mainstay...very professional and accomodating over the phoneOnly downside is ac couldnt keep up with heatwave in waiting area. I think they deliver islandwide.","The ribs and chicken are great, they don't skip you on either. The only reason i didnt give five stars is because the fish is frozen from shop rite and the mac and cheese is horrible","Ordered last week for the first time and it definitely will not be the last. I ordered the BBQ chicken, it was flavorful, tender and juicy and not the least bit greasy. It had that real BBQ taste and aroma. My son ordered the chicken fingers and got fries with them and they were excellent. My wife ordered the roast chicken and it was delicious.!this will now be our go  to take out chicken place. As far as some criticism about the deliveries we told it would be between 45 to 60 minutes and it was there within 50 minutes. To those that complained about the delivery time I suggest you get a new battery for your watch.","I've been ordering here for many years and never had a bad meal. Aside from their fresh made to order chicken, their BBQ ribs are tangy and fall off the bone fresh. Although I mostly have it delivered, I have picked up my food a few times and found the place to be clean and welcoming. I will be moving up the block within the next few months and will probably be picking up my food more often now. Every time I've called over the years, I always recognize the owners voice. This tells me that he takes pride in his product and business.  Keep up the great work.","After hearing that this place has the best fried chicken in Staten Island, I had to place an order. I knew that delivery would take long after realizing how far they were. But I didn't think it would be over two hours, but hey for good fried chicken I was willing to wait it out. The food did arrive hot, but honestly the chicken was just ok, I've had way better, and there wasn't anything special about it. I'm a huge macaroni & cheese person, and there's is the worst I think I've had. We were both very disappointed with the sides. I read that everything is fresh, but it didn't taste that way to me. I was disappointed because i really wanted a good soul food meal, they definitely didn't live up to the hype or my expectations.","Take it from a jewish guy who grew up in Brooklyn, this is the best fried chicken I have ever eaten. Consistently mouth watering. I always make the few minute drive to pick up so I can't comment on delivery time. We always get a few extra fried breasts which are juicy and fantastic. Order always ready when I get there. Place not much to look at but they get the chicken job doneSo having said that we ONLY order the chicken. I have never found a side dish, appetizer or main dish I found appealing. Mash Potatoes  naw Mac and cheese  naw  cornbread nope  Ribs nope. Sorry guys as far as I am concerned you can take all of that off the menu and save money. We usually make a side dish or something at home to go with it.Fried chicken is amazing  Pick some up and try it you will agree.",494 Chicken
44,"The service is literally terrible!! Took the server 30 minutes to bring us a drink and menu. I ordered a BLT, the menu said it comes with an avocado spread.. instead the cook put sliced avocado. My BLT literally had 1 piece of lettuce , couple slices of tomato and 2 pieces of bacon on ITALIAN BREAD. Never coming here ever again. Update: the server just gave me my second drink in a smaller glass.. this place is a joke",I had brunch here on sept 28th our waitress was patricia not only was our food ridiculously delayed the place wasn't crowded.  I love the food here however the service was horrible.  My friend didn't like her drink & ordered something else & patricia grabbed the nearly full drink from across the table & nearly spilled it on me.  The only time she was nice was when we asked her name & she gave us the bill.  We asked for the 2nd round of drinks & waited 20 min for it.  We were given water & in one of the glasses had 2 bugs in it I will never return here again worse service ever!!! Such a shame I enjoyed coming here in the past after this treatment we all refuse!,"I went there excited to enjoy a nice Sunday brunch... so not the case . Cute place , nicely set up tables but that's about it. Menu had nice brunch items too bad took wayyyy too long to come and then missing stuff. I ordered Belgian waffles with fruit on side. I asked for powdered sugar on it. I got a dry waffle , no powdered sugar , no butter no syrup . That came about 35 mins later and coffee I had to ask for 3 times. No way going back once was enough. Frustrating to say the least","Amazing experience Food was creative, good quality and big portions with a decent price.Service was friendly and polite.Dana (Dayna?) was extraordinarily professional and courteous with her menu suggestions yet not overbearing. Wonderful experience in Staten Island. Will recommend","I went home for the weekend to see a show with my daughter.  She planned a brunch to celebrate her dad's retirement the day before.  She was so excited, she'd been here before and said the food was amazing...service not so much.Well the food was not amazing!  There were five of us in our party and I believe out of all the order, only the burger came out ok...truth be told he was hungover and would have eaten the cow if they put it in front of him!  I digress...four of our party did the brunch special which included a few typical brunchy beverages...mimosa, bloody, etc.  Well sangria, was an option as well.  Now mind you several of our party are in the industry and they were flummoxed when their sangria drinks came out!!!  They watered them down with SELTZER!!!  My daughter went to the bartender and he said he was told by the ""manager"" to top them off with the seltzer.  My daughter wasn't having it!!!  Her degree is in Hospitality!!!  So they attempted better sangria's but still fell short because the wine was subpar.  Our waiter was devoid of any personality, but the waitress who was on duty tried her best to make the experience a little more palatable.    All said and done, I do not believe any of us will be back.  It seems they've run the course.","This is a hard review to write because the Phunky Elephant is down the block from our house and it's a place we could walk to, I can enjoy a cocktail and there are items on the menu that our 3 year old can eat (who's palette is currently going through the chicken fingers & fries phase). It's also hard because I don't want to hurt the local economy but I don't want to be dishonest for the sake of either.This was my second (the mrs. went to a function there that was hosted by a local celeb named Lola who I believe hosts drag queen bingo), our first time at the restaurant we had to have our main courses taken off our bill. They were (I believe) panko crusted chicken cordon bleu but they were frozen, and dropped into a deep fryer and because of the thickness of the roll the centers were raw and pink. the server, a lovely gentleman apologized profusely explained the frozen situation and took them off our bill.It's been 8 months since our first visit and we decided to give it another go because it was a decent night and we wanted to eat outside and support a local business. Their backyard eating area is nice. well decorated with a mural going around the area and a makeshift herb garden that could use a little TLC. The issue with the outside area is the noise. The A/C unit was so loud that it really kills a relaxing mood. Our server was a young man who was attentive, sweet and treated our 3 year old like a little sister. the staff at the Phunky Elephant is truly top notch and professional. The server was on his game and asked if we wanted the little ones food brought out first, so kudos for being professional. From that point on, everything starts to nose dive. The chicken tenders came out and our daughter balked at the chicken for being slimey. turns out the batter wasn't cooked though and still a bit wet. Her fries she enjoyed, but they served it with a spicy ketchup. I had to get up go inside and request plain ketchup. not the end of the world. When the fried pickles arrived (look at the pic) we immediately questioned what we were getting. last time they were chips, the server explained that they started cutting things lengthwise. this was a bad bad move. not only did it look unappealing, but because of the amount of meat inside the batter it takes longer to cook through and the batter was overdone and pickles inside were a soggy sloppy over cooked mess. Our cocktails were a jameson ginger based drink (the mrs thought too much jameson's not enough ginger) and mine was a jack daniels concoction that I thought was great. nice balance with all the flavors.For our main course my wife had the crab cake sandwich which she said was ok, and I ordered the Rosebank sandwich which was a mess. Filled with flank steak, broccoli rabe, cheese, hot cherry peppers and some sort of aoli, the flavor profile was all cherry pepper. It was pointless for them to put anything but cherry peppers on the sandwich because that was all i could taste. The flank steak was unseasoned and again I had to go inside for condiments.... overall it was a disappointment. The Phunky Elephant needs to ditch their deep fryers and hire real cooks that can create a menu worthy of return business. Our bill was $102 with a 15% tip.  We won't be returning for a third time. I wish them the best but I can not recommend them for their",The Phunky Elephant
45,"What you were supposed to see here is 2 orders of avocado seafood salad, alligator bites, alligator tail, crawfish nachos, and bayou country chicken wings and that was just the apps.  We couldn't resist!!!  Another great meal at Bayou.",We wanted to take a picture of all the delicious food food but we couldn't resist.  Maybe next time.,I tried this place and this is something GOOD that I will never forget. Can't describe how great was everything. And can not imagine someone who is not satisfied with this place,"If you blink, you'll miss this hidden gem on Bay St.! Immediately as I walked in, I took note of the colorful and vibrant layout of the restaurant. Super welcoming and inviting! We had great starting appetizers: Alligator Bites and Crawfish Nachos. They didn't stand a chance against the party of 3.My entree was Byron's Tuna. The fried calamari that came with it was lightly fried, much to my surprise. I can't wait to come back here and try more dishes!","We were celebrating a friend's birthday and she chose the restaurant. It looks unassuming from outside, but has great atmosphere. We went on a Thursday, so the mid-week price fix 4 course menu was offered. It's $25, with an option to add $10 per person for unlimited wine or sangria for 90 minutes. Our waiter Ronnie was attentive and friendly. The birthday girl asked for a couple of tweaks to dishes and they were accommodated. Two people had salads, I had the chicken gumbo and really enjoyed it. We got 2 zucchini boats, filled with crawfish and melted cheese and 1 meatball dish as our appetizers. My sister chose the Seafood Gone Wild as her entree. She enjoyed it, it wasn't a large portion but she said it was good. My friend got a roast pork special and liked it. I got the jambalaya. I asked for rice instead of the pasta listed. Delicious! I took half home. For dessert we got a banana bread pudding, special crepes and fried ice cream. All delicious. We sat and chatted for a long time. The waiter checked on us, but didn't rush us. We are already planning another night out!","A hidden gem of SI--literally. The unassuming entrance is located on a bare block in the middle of nowhere in SI. You'd never know there was a busy restaurant behind that dim door if not for Yelp and Google Maps. Once you enter--whoaaaa! Such vibrant spot bustling with energy! We didn't have a reservation but got very lucky that a couple decided to move to a bar and we got their corner table. Suggest making a reservation, especially for a busy time like weekend night.The place is small--doesn't fit more than 40-50 people, so seating will always be tight. The biggest table on the premise seats around 6-8, so this isn't a place for huge group gatherings. The ambiance is a better fit for more intimate conversations and dates. The theme surrounds New Orleans, Mardi Gras, and all warm and fatty things related to American comfort food. Jazz and American Southern classics are playing on air, creating a cozy, lazy, relaxing and cheeky vibe. Mardi Gras beads, masks, décor and memorabilia are donning the surroundings. Fancy chandelier in the center of the room. Very dark, muted lighting, a big bar at the entrance, where you can dine if there are no seats in the main sitting room. Surprising choice of theme for a restaurant in the middle of nowhere in SI, so definitely a great local find that's worth frequenting.The service is great but expect a slow paced experience. The place is bustling with activity, and there's only one waitress coming around, with a few bus boys running back and forth, so relax and enjoy your meal without rush. The waitress is genuine, amiable, and helpful. Attended to us well, bringing us seconds of bread and butter multiple times. Now about the food. My bf and I were starving when we arrived around 8pm on a Saturday, so we devoured everything gratefully and with gusto. You'll be asking for seconds and thirds [like we did] of the complimentary bread and butter. The bread is pippin' hot from the stove--crunchy shell and soft and fluffy insides. I don't eat bread or butter, but I thoroughly pigged out during this visit.The menu includes favorite American comfort classics like seafood jambalaya and chicken gumbo. Not a lot of options--a much more extensive drink menu, but the food that's available is spot on. For appetizers, we got the French onion soup ($7.95) which was hearty and satisfying. Sweet and flavorful. My only wish was that there was something more on top than just a tiny piece of bread with cheese. A cheese crusting on top would've been in order. The crooked chandelier ($13.95) is a quiche with crawfish and a drizzle of shrimp bisque. Small piece of quiche that was divine. My bf was complaining how small the portion was because it was so delicious. The quiche was buttery, fluffy, and light--the most perfect consistency I've ever tasted. The seafood notes and the rich bisque sauce added a great punch of flavor. Could've ate this as an entrée--if they served an entire quiche pie!My bf got ($32) seafood jambalaya, except he's weird, so he asked to substitute rice for pasta. The chefs did not disappoint--the custom creation has hit the spot! A humongous plate of linguine, shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari, and sausage that we both shared. The broth was the bomb. My bf's first time trying something like this so he was on seventh heaven, and I have to agree that for a great reason. The flavor was through the roof--so rich and pronounced. Definitely get this! Just prepare to drink tons of water afterwards, as there's tons of salt and spices in all the food that you'll consume here.I got the daily special ($35) of lobster ravioli, which I thoroughly enjoyed despite not being a pasta lover. The portion was on a smaller side, perfect for someone trying to savor and not stuff themselves. The ravioli were orange and heart shaped--probably left over from Valentine's Day. Nonetheless, the dish was perfectly balanced and delicious. Tender, fresh tasting ravioli. A lobster tail and a few lobster chunks floated amid the ravioli stuffed with mozzarella in creamy, white sauce. Calmer, heavier taste as compared to the bold, right in your face flavors of my bf's deconstructed linguini jambalaya. We didn't have space for dessert, which I assume would've been spot on as well. Definitely will be back to try more of the delicious dishes and relax in this cool ambiance. Recommend for anyone in SI!",Bayou

Staff is arrogant. Food has become sub par. I used to come a lot and this is why.,"I think this is my favorite Italian restaurant on Staten Island. They start you off with an eggplant bread and a bread basket that includes pizza bread. We ordered the antipasti which included eggplant, fried calamari, and clams. All were delicious! They also give a sorbet in between courses which is a nice touch. My favorite part of this restaurant is the friend polenta squares they bring with the main course. I can eat these all day long. I got the ziti with eggplant which is also delicious! Portions are good size as well with reasonable prices.","Piccolino is one of those places I pass all the time and always regret not frequenting more often.The team is always helpful and efficient. The food is always very good, no matter what you choose. And the atmosphere, while basic, is always welcoming.I've yet to try or have anyone I know try I dish with which they were not very happy. Pastas are fresh and thoughtfully prepared.  The selection of appetizers and  sides are complimentary to the main courses.  Do yourself a favor and make a trip to Piccolino.   Just allow yourself some extra time to navigate the crowded lot.",No complaints service is very nice and friendly I have a 3 yr old..

Limited Hours",Food was just very basic. My sister recommended it but I thought it was nothing special. I guess it's a good location and family owned. Would have preferred a diner.,,"The food was excellent and reasonably priced. The  cafe was immaculately clean and the staff was very attentive and courteous. My experience there, showed me many examples of humanity at its best! I can't say enough positive things about the Harvest Cafe. You need to experience it yourself! You'll be very happy you did!","What a beautiful place! Spotless, open, handmade art by the persons being trained on the walls. Service was excellent. I had the banana walnut challah French toast and my husband had 2 eggs over easy with the HarvestCafe potatoes ( includes both white and sweet potatoes) and sausage.

However,  I can't wait to go back and try other dishes from the lunch and dinner menuMy husband and I went back and this time I ordered the frittata that was supposed to have sausage, cheese, and jalapeño peppers. Not a jalapeño to be found, there were red peppers instead. When I asked the waitress what happened, she came back from the kitchen and said they had no jalapeños but never told her. She made an effort to make up for it by offering that we could have an additional item but we didn't need any more food. My husband's dish was ok but I can't remember what he had. I love the whole concept but I'm not really interested in going back any more. I think the cooking could be better","What a beautiful place!

Very unappetizing!",This place was horrible. Lunch service on a Friday was so sad. Table of three only two of us got our food. Waitress couldn't care less. She offered to have our food delievered to us after waitiing 40 minutes. That was after I asked her to take it to go. It still wasn't ready. It was the worst ever.,Great food. 12 of us had just about everything on the menu. Calamari salty but addictive. Discrepancies with the check.

49,I'm genuinely perplexed by all the good reviews. Did I order the wrong dish or kitchen just having a bad day? $14 chicken and waffle came out to be chicken tender and frozen waffles ( legit tastes like Eggo). $22 steak also tastes like low quality meat. Very disappointing.,We were treated horribly at this place. We went to see a friends band. We had a front table. While we were ordering codfee we were told we had to get up and go to the back because a party of 6 needed the table and they waited an hour. So did we. The manager came over and was a total azz. This man did not know the meaning of public relations . The second guy saw we were ready to just leave and offered us drinks. The band was delayed because they needed space but the managent insisted the 6 had to sit there. After we left the people stood in our apace and heard the band. Like most places on Staten Island its who you know. I will never go back to this place. Too much stress for mediocre food.,"First time here and  Came here for the cotto vs canelo fight and I must say  this bar is on point. ...the crowd is cool, the barmaid are sharp with the drinks, especially Erin L...if you're in staten island and in need of a drink I highly recommend this pub",They have the best Irish eggrolls and crab cakes are excellent wide variety of menu great service excellent corn beef the only thing I can say is the appetizers are a little pricey for the portion we got the potato skins and they were very tiny for $12 but very tasty and the Irish eggrolls are very good but again little pricey but 10 stars across-the-board,"Seriously? Where have you been all my life?! This place is terrific! We stopped in on a whim and were so happy with our experience and food! Our waitress was great, got our food out quickly and made sure everything was the way we asked. Everything we ordered was delicious- especially the sweet potato fries- soooo good! The chicken marsala was excellent, we also had the Irish egg rolls and cream of broccoli soup (soup was a special) which were fantastic! I also really liked that the booths in the bar area also had their own tv's in addition to all of the tv's over the bar and in the restaurant area showing various games/fights. They are easily located right on Forest Ave. and have their own parking lot. Definitely try this place out if you are in the area. The menu looked excellent with many more things on it I'd like to try.",I went to O'neills for the first time the other day. Let me start by saying I can't wait to go back. The food was absolutely amazing. So many choices I had a hard time deciding but that just means I get to keep going back.

50,I went here to get dim sum since we go to Brooklyn normally we were very disappointed and the place was very crowded why I don't know and the service was terrible I also ordered some sushi not more than a half an hour later I got so sick I barely made it home without getting deathly ill in my car I never get like this so I know it was something that I ate PS I will never return back here again not only for the fact that I got sick but for the service as well,I went here to get dim sum since we go to Brooklyn normally we were very disappointed and the place was very crowded why I don't know and the service was terrible I also ordered some sushi not more than a half an hour later I got so sick I barely made it home without getting deathly ill in my car I never get like this so I know it was something that I ate PS I will never return back here again not only for the fact that I got sick but for the service as well,Definitely wouldn't recommend or order again I got chicken teriyaki it was grey chicken with more raw vegetables then chicken couldn't eat it because I didn't want to get sick waste of my time and money,"Great location right at the mall.  Easy to get to with plenty of parking.  Service was good.  Great variety of foods from dim sum to sushi.  To be on the safe side, stick with Cantonese dishes when ordering.  Anything outside the boundary is mediocre.  I've tried almost everything in the menu.  This restaurant has been here for quite sometime.","This use to be a great restaurant not anymore, We always ordered the walnut chicken, I haven't been back for a very long timeso I decided to have the walnut chicken.  The chicken was breaded in a thick coating the walnuts weren't The candied ones that use to be used, the sauce had no flavor what so ever.  The pineapple fried rice tasted like it was made with dish water.So I spent $30.00 dollars for two dishes just to thro it in garbage, never ever go back againoh by the way this was take out, never will I go back","Super convenient inside the Staten Island mall. The prices are very inexpensive and cooked well. My family came in for New Year's Day and were seated right away at 6. The restaurant was almost filled up and has a great dinner atmosphere. Staff was very informative and gave insightful recommendations. Their weekly specials ($9.95) are very extensive. We ordered the steamed fish (carp) with black bean sauce. The fish was very tender and fresh. The waiter told us that there was a special of 2 lobsters for $27.95 and however we wanted it to be cooked. We asked for the Cantonese styled batter fried lobster. The batter was yummy and cooked well. Lobster was not rubbery. We also ordered roasted pigeons which is Cantonese styled (2 pigeons cut into about 6 pieces) which was good and comes with fried chips. We also ordered Cantonese pan fried noodles with shredded meat which is also a staple and tasted good (though personally I think they could add a little bit more veggies since they gave a lot of chicken). As for veggies, we ordered garlic stir fry water crest which comes in a large plate and was good. Overall, good authentic Chinese restaurant (though I did see they have Thai and Japanese food but didn't really care for that since this is a Chinese restaurant ).",East Pacific Restaurant
51,"Just encountered the most unpleasant cashier, who apparently does not know how to operate the cash register!!!There is a NO air conditioner!There are NO Oxtails being served today, which is unheard of when you've just opened the restaurant for the day...LOL!!",Okay I first found this place on Ubereats and yea that's about it! Every time I ordered everything was fresh and up to par with the previous options I selected. This time I went to the beast itself and they did not and I don't think they ever will disappoint!,"The food was good, mac and cheese was kind of bland. Too over priced!! They also raised prices by $1 without telling anyone before hand. I'm sorry but after leaving this place I will never come back I saw quarter size roaches by the refrigerator and garbage can. I held in my screams and just left out!! I ate there, and after throwing my food away and seeing that made me nauseous I wanted to puke! They need to clean the area up more, the place looks dirty...","I was a little nervous to cheat on my normal lunch spot for jerk chicken but I said hey let me give it a try && I must say that it was worth it! The jerk chicken was full of flavor and wasn't too ""jerked."" They have this special honey jerk sauce and its to die for! Its the perfect blend of seasonings and adds some moisture to your food. I had jerked chicken with the rice & peas and mac & cheese; the mac was good, but the rice was a bit bland, the honey jerk sauce helped saved the day. My colleague had an order of the southern fried chicken with french fries and the honey jerk sauce on the side. The chicken was fried perfectly, it wasn't over cooked so it was still juicy; I wish we were able to get more honey jerk sauce on the side.The actual space is small and intimate, there's plenty room for seating. The staff was welcoming and the family environment can definitely be felt when you enter. Outside there is very limited parking, i would say that's my one con.I would recommend this place and try other things on the menu.",I had the opportunity to visit this restaurant once again and the food was delicious! However the cashier/server (Carlena) can use more training in customer service.The last visit before this the customer service was outstanding and I'm sorry I didnt get her name.But If you want good food with a Caribbean flare Blended Flavors is the place.Try the Rasta Pasta and make sure you get a couple of sides.,the food was good  a little too much sauce when i can to pick up the food there was sauce all over the bag  mac and cheese was okay i've had better but the collard greens was great.  i'd probably come again to try the jerk chicken rolls,Blended Flavors
52,This was our 3rd time at Vinum and this was by far our worse experience. We ordered the beet salad which was completely unseasoned and lacked any flavor. Short rib drowned in an overpowering sauce. Pork chop coated in an overpowering seasoning. We then asked for thr check and were presented with desert menus. After the we received the check we waited 20 min to have it picked up only to have to walk to the bar to ask the bartender to charge us. The service was extremely poor.  The positives were the bartender who was beyond professional and nice and the drinks.,"Excited to come here for a quiet birthday dinner on a Friday night and we were seated in the back room which was a nice intimate space. That didn't last long. A loud and rowdy group of people were seated right next to us and I could barely hear myself think or move.When we asked if we could move to another table we were met with hesitation and told we would have to leave by 8 as the other table was reserved for that time.Finally we were moved to a table over and the loud group started cheering and almost harassing us. In fact, the group was bragging about another group that they pushed out in the front by the bar. Management did absolutely nothing about it. Food was good and wine was good but because of my very uncomfortable almost disturbing experience I don't know if I will be returning.","Not sure how reservation times are misunderstood. Owner was obnoxious to our party. Extremely condescending to our wives, while we stood in the center of the restaurant patiently waiting. Get ready for you clothes to smell of garlic, kitchen is almost in the area where you eat , 4 feet away. Never again.If I could give less than 1 star , i would have, his manners are atrocious, he made everyone feel uncomfortable, his tone is disgusting to his patrons, hopefully he realizes that people not only remember the food, they remember how they were treated. Out reservation time was not what they proclaim, it wasnt  even the problem, his nasty demeanor Sent us on our way. His lengthy comment and obnoxious apology is testament as people will leave or at the very least not return.   Bedside manners, learn them.",Fantastic spot. The menu has a ton of choices. Service is good and the food is delicious. Love the intimate vibe here. A lot of places on this island should take notes. Bravo.,"Went with friends last night to this restaurant and had high hopes . Cute place but small but had a very nice table in back room in the corner . Appetizers were very good , we got a cheese board   , cured meat board with olives , tripe and sausage and broccoli rabe. All tasty . My husband loved his clam sauce but my duck left much to be desired it was tough and tasteless . Our friends liked their entrees and we were having a nice time .... until my girlfriend gasped at a HUGE spider on the table by our drinks !! I jumped up as did she and my husband and hers were trying to kill it as it scrambled on table . I'm not talking a tiny spider I'm talking about 1 1/2 inches . Well they got it . Disgusting ! Busboy looking at us like we had 3 heads proceeded to do nothing ! Waiter comes over and sarcastically says "" was it a tarantula "" ?? To say we were pissed is putting it mildly! Not looking for a free dinner , not those kind of people.  But someone , anyone should have come over and atleast apologized and or offered us at least coffee on the house . NOTHING!!  It was handled horribly and for that I'll never go back nor recommend it .","Stopped in for a drink by recommendation from another bar we were at earlier in the day. This was our first time over to Staten Island, so just checking out the scene. It was a holiday weekend, so lots of people were out of town and it was pretty much just my wife and I for the hour or so we sat at the bar and drank some wine. I definitely want to come back for dinner - love how small it is, and love the patio they have out back. Most importantly, we had such a great time hanging out with Cindy at the bar - she made our experience 4-star worthy after only being there for 2 glasses of wine and a taste of the veal meatballs (pictured - which were amazing btw!).

53,"This restaurant had decent service, a good selection, but the food especially (the fish was overcooked) for the price. I was looking for to my lobster tail but ended up not eating it because it was so hard. Everything needed salt and was fairly bland. I would definitely not recommend this place.","We both had the Portuguese shell steak with fried egg and potatoes, it was tough, full of fat and lacked flavor.  Bread was served cold.  Waitress never came back to check on us. Ambience was not great and the lights were way too bright.  Maybe it was just an off day.","OK, so I wasn't impressed. I ordered the pork chops (febras) and while the food was plenty, it lacked flavor. For dessert I had a chocolate mousse which was good. Overall lunch cost me $33 with main course, dessert and drink which was too expensive for a meal lacking in flavor",One of the best Little Portuguese places in NJA real local gem. Chicken and ribs are incredible. A+,"I'll give this place a solid 3.5/ 5 (Half a star off because of the prices but the quality of food was good)We stopped here for dinner after a day of shopping at the nearby mall and it was my first time trying Portuguese food. This was very much a spontaneous ""treat yourself"" dinner but since I don't live near many Portuguese restaurants I wanted to try something new. My sister and I both ordered seafood soups and my mother ordered fish and rice. Let me tell you, the seafood soup is enough for two people and it's served in a very rustic way because it comes to your table in a small pot (we joked how it looks like our rice pot from home). Overall the food was fresh, the flavors were mild but tasted home-cooked and it was a good first impression for my first time trying this kind of food. I would say give it a try if you're in the area and really in the mood for a fancier dinner because the prices were moderate.","Cute restaurant in a working class neighborhood. Fish soup had a very nice broth. The seafood soup/chowder had shrimp, rice and Monk Fish. Portion large enough for two. Nice bread and olives brought out as appetizer.Very close to Newark airport.",Verde Minho
54,"We went to Trattoria Romana yesterday afternoon.  This was our second visit, after we experienced a near epiphany about their cooking last December.  Alas, the food was a very mixed bag this time.  The cold antipasto and pasta faggioli were delicious, but the stracciatella florentina lacked flavor.  My pasta puttanesca was excellent, but the veal marsala was horrible.  For $28, it tasted like it had been quickly defrosted in a microwave and cooked.  It had no texture and no flavor and was accompanied by a very small plate of a few carrots and peas -- no broccoli, no roast potatoes, nothing. The restaurant was very crowded yesterday and the kitchen may have been stressed.  To his credit, our waiter comped us on the tiramisu dessert, which was very good.We are undecided whether to return for a third visit, but concerned that the quality can fluctuate so much from one visit to the next.","Me and my family are Italian and we went here for dinner it was seriously not worth the price. For what we ordered we could've got twice as much service and food elsewhere. The dishes are overly priced and the taste of most items is not authentic most likely frozen food heated up. Also they also have no lunch or dinner specials that include beverage, wine, appetizer, dessert, coffee, etc. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! You get free bread and bruschetta with toasted bread but seriously not work going or trying although the bar was empty and fully stocked.","Horrible!!! Food poisoning!! I know a good amount of people like this place,However I will never go back. Went there for diner 5/11/19. First off the place is very small for the amount of people they attempt to accommodate. We got sat at a table in a walkway where the servers pass by very frequently. The walk way was very narrow it was about 20"" wide between our table and another. After the first 5 minutes There I was bumped about 10 times by the servers as they passed by. I had finally had enough when I received a crotch on my shoulder from a server passing by that I kindly requested another table. I watched as the server asked whom I would guess was the manager/owner rolled his eyes and looked at our table in disgust. We were moved to another table which again had very little room but at least I wasn't getting bumped or getting any unwanted crotches on my shoulder. When we finally ordered the apps and dinner, everything took long to come out. I ordered the Carbonara along with 2 other people in my party. I am now sick to my stomach vomiting and leaking from both ends. Looking back Very fishy that I was sitting on the end and was given my plate of carbon first before the 2 other people further from me. I will never go here again. Message to ownership:Make sure you are serving food that isn't spoiled to people, And if you or your employees are spiking people's food because they complained about you cramped restaurant you should be closed down amongst other things. I will never go here again. Needless to say even the carbonara was horrible. *Update* Board Of Health contacted me due to this post. Complaint and illness recorded and documented. Again stay away.",Haven't been here in many years. Time for a return trip. Started with a cold antipasto which had a bit of an unusual selection of stuff. Also had a peach salad - great for a hot day. Was ok. Nothing amazing My main was eggplant parmigiana with a side of pasta. Both delicious. Very cheesy. Great sauce. Friends had striped bass special with broccoli rabe side and the other entree was rigatoni alla vodka. They scored them at a 7 out of 10 which I guess means good. Good cappuccino to finish off. Glad I went back but the place didn't knock my socks off. There's a lot of places to try.,"This restaurant has been a neighborhood staple since forever.  I have always remembered this place from driving down Hylan Blvd however I have never stopped by.  Luckily a friend of mine had recommend the place to have dinner and catch up.When you walk in you can tell its an old school spot.  Decor is a bit long in the tooth but it also gives the place its traditional feel.The starters were okay, I wasn't blown away.  I did like the fried polenta chunks but that was about it.  Our waiter was miserable, we were not sure if he was having a bad day or he just did not want to be there anymore but he would be the opposite of a helpful waiter.  I have never been to the restaurant and he did not recommend any specials or even mention there is a board on the wall with other dishes NOT listed on the menu.  It was only after I had ordered my food did I notice there were more things to be had and things I would have preferred over what I had ordered.I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara, it was alright, nothing to write home about.  Did not get much bacon so it was lacking in the protein department.  Also, when I go out for Italian I would expect fresh pasta, my pasta was clearly not fresh pasta, which is why I probably got a HUGE plate.I would go back but hopefully I get a different server.Pro-tip, there is a board on the wall with other dishes, not sure if they are specials or the place just did not want to put it in the menu.  Make sure you take a look at that as well as the menu before ordering.","Great spot! The atmosphere and service and specials are what really make this place a four or borderline five star place. The decor and service are very traditional. Waiters are attentive and take their time in telling you what dishes are best suited for your palate. The specials border has lots of variety. Pretty cool to see chef demonstrations in person. There's a robust event schedule that includes dishes from specific Italian regions or cooking courses. The chicken Parm was thin, but not paper thin. The layer of cheese was just right. The other dishes had great home made pastas that were perfectly cooked al dente. Parking isn't great but hey it's Staten Island! Street parking is available. Check it out!",Trattoria Romana
55,Everything about Lacey's hits 5 stars minus the draft beer. The lines are either never cleaned or the kegs are very far from the tap. The beer always taste bitter and flat. Other than this the food is excellent and reasonably priced.,Not good re cooked chicken seafood was fishy n grimy fried zucchini was great I'm not going back,"Last time I was there the service was HORRENDOUS!!!!!!  The food is always good but the service was so bad I was so aggravated that I couldn't even enjoy the food. I had to get up twice and go find my waitress in order to get drinks and find out where our food was. I got nothing but excuses that were unexceptionable. I figured after the first time I tracked sown my waitress she would have going the hint that her service SUCKED, but she didn't had to track her down again. After all that they didn't even try to make it up by giving free dessert or even drinks. It was so bad I haven't been back since and it has been like 3 months.","We had a party of 6, and we left stuffed and happy! There was a separate menu with other specials so there was plenty of variety! We ordered the hot anti-pas for the appetizer, and it was plenty for 6 people. It was delicious! We also ordered the fried calamari, wasn't something to rave home about, the sauce that came with it was a little weird, can tasting if you will.For the mains, we ordered the chicken Gabriella, and mussels with linguini and red sauce. Highly recommend both! Both were very flavorful and fresh. And there was plenty to go around. We even took home left overs.For dessert we had waffles with ice cream, and a s'mores platter. It was literally the best ice cream I've ever had.. and it was HUGE! I highly recommend this place if you want to feed a big party with delicious quality food. Service was great and quick. Our waitress was constantly checking up on us. Will definitely return!","Quarterly get together...Finally led  us to Staten Island. You know how this works. 3 childhood friends catch up on family matters and a evening out. One buddy has been talking up Lacey's Bridge Tavern since our last gathering.It's definitely the oldest eatery that we've ever dined at since starting this little tradition several years ago. Here's the deal. Portions are served family style here. Thankfully you can order half platters, which we definitely took advantage of.For our single appetizer an order of hot Antipasto. More than enough to get out night started with a round of drinks. Everything that was ordered ( up until dessert) was off the daily specials menu. You can add on or take off items from your order.Two entrees that we shared were Stuffed Rigatoni & a Chicken/ Shrimp francese. Both dishes were perfectly seasoned. Our server was great, letting us catch up on all things family.Do try to save room for dessert. One piece of carrot cake was more than enough to cap off our evening amongst the fellas. And on a side note, does this neighborhood bring back memories. Even though I've never dined here before, my old high school is right down the street.Cost per person after tip, around $65.00 each. Good for groups and come hungry. Parking is pretty easy during the week. You can always use that lot for Cichon Post a half block away.","I went to Lacey's Bridge Tavern for the first time about a month ago after a friend recommended it. At first glance, it seemed like a well-established, homey neighborhood restaurant and therefore I expected that both the food and service, were probably going to be good. I was wrong about the food, but the service was fine, on that day. After returning to the restaurant two more times in the following weeks, I concluded that not only was the food tasteless, so was the service. It seems to me that the waitstaff's idea of good service is asking both you and your guest, over and over again if you are finished with your meal while you're still eating and drinking. The last time I ate there four servers were working the floor, and each and every one of them came by my table minutes apart from each other asking the same question, ""are you done yet""? It was actually comical. I will never eat there again. That's the service you get for overtipping.",Lacey's Bridge Tavern
56,"Disgusting! Adam, the owner, was unfortunately picking his nose right in front of me and my son, while sitting  in the main dining area, right near customers as we were forced to watch this!  GROSS!Also, The waitress was very pushy and downright rude, beyond acceptable.  They let us in just before 9 pm, And  rushed us all along the way and this made dinner quite uncomfortable.  They should Just say, ""Folks, we are sorry, we are closing in 15 minutes - please come back at another time.""No.   They invited us in to spend $115 and decided they were going to make us feel uncomfortable all through the meal.  My advice?   Don't go here.  The food isn't anything to brag about anyway.  And the treatment was unacceptable.  I repaid the waitress for her rudeness with a 10 % tip.   One of the more intelligent people there realised that I was not happy and decided to offer us a free after-dinner drink - but at this point I declined but I thought that was kind of classy because he knew I was not happy.  Spencer","Food was good. We came with a large party after a funeral. The only complaint is the wait staff. Although they are very prompt and attentive, the staff was very stiff, but maybe it's an SI thing.",The food is really good. The only problem is that there is no room in the front room to eat a slice. They have a restaurant in the back but will not allow you to sit there and have pizza just food from the menu.,"I have been going to this restaurant with my family since it was Bella Vita off of Richmond Avenue.  The food is flavorful, and the portions are very generous.  It is my favorite place to get Italian food on an island where this type of food is very popular.  The appetizers are delicious (especially the mozzarella carrozza and the fried calamari) and the dinner options make it so hard to choose. I almost always end up getting the Black Ink Spaghetti with fish. The portion is huge and it's just incredible. I've never left disappointed!","Haven't been there in awhile.  Decided to stop in for dinner.  Started with Eggplant Rollatini-Very Good.  Main Course was Veal Parmigiana and Penne-Good/Very Good.  Dessert was Ice Cream with Espresso. My wife ordered the Mussels as appetizer, and Chicken Marsala as entree with Chocolate Parfait as dessert-Good/Very Good.  Overall, Rating is between a 3 and a 4, closer to a 4 for this trip.  Service was Very Good and pricing was reasonable.","We were a party of 4. We all ordered the price fixed dinner. I ordered the Mushroom appetizer-Good/Very Good, followed by a House Salad-Good, followed by Veal Parmigiana, sauce not quite as rich as I remember-Good/Very Good. Parfait for dessert, not as flavorful as My last trip-Good. The rating overall was somewhere between a 3 and a 4.  The others agreed. I'll give it a 4. For this review, I will assume it was just an off day. We all have them.",Casa Verde
57,"I have to say I'm totally shocked with the high ratings for Nino's!  The only thing I'm guessing is people may be rating high because of the large portions at a reasonable price!?  I ordered the spiedini for appetizer, and the weird part was the waiter tried to talk me out of ordering it!  I told him I love spiedini , and order it at various restaurants quite frequently.  I should of listened to the waiter because the spiedini was HORRIBLE!  Never in my entire life have I ever ate spiedini that  I didn't like!  Something was totally off with the anchovies!  They stunk, and it they tasted like they weren't fresh!  The spiedini was over saturated in them, and the brown sauce was absolutely disgusting!  I had to send it back!  I then ordered the Italian egg roll which was filled with risotto and shrimp.  That appetizer wasn't good either!  It was burnt at the edges and the tiny pieces of shrimp they put inside smelled!  I would not recommend ordering anything with seafood here!  The sauce it came with didn't taste good either.  For entree I ordered the eggplant Parmesan, and it was a huge portion.  The eggplant Parmesan was good, but the side of linguini it came with didn't come with enough sauce.    I asked my waiter to bring out more sauce for the linguini.  Another disappointing thing here is the pasta here isn't made in house, and it tastes like it came right out of a box.  After dinner the waiter brought out the dessert menu, and I told him I wanted the carrot cake.  The waiter told me to be honest the carrot cake isn't  good!  I said this time I'll trust you, and I'll just pass on dessert.  I have over 270 reviews, and this is the first Italian restaurant I ever rated 2 stars!  That should tell you how bad I thought the food was here!  When I came home I had an upset stomach the entire night which never happens!  I highly recommend not dining here!",Everything we had was delicious as usual.  Asked for more bread no problem asked for more eggplant appetizer no problem. More butter no problem. They go above and beyond to please. The chicken sorrentino was so tasty. The filet franchese my wife had was delicious as well.  My daughter got the gnocchi and was great too. I highly suggest trying the spiedini all's Romano.  I get it every time I go.  It is sort of a mozzarella encarozza with a brown lemon and anchovie flavored sauce on it.,"Horrible service, mediocre food, drinks watered down. I came here for a family function,oh my goodness what a mess. I asked for a fork and knife as I did not have a place setting, well let me say I needed to use my husband's to eat. The waiter never came back! 30 min later he brings me and my husband meat entre we are vegetarians and ordered a vegetarian dinner . He didn't apologize he just took our plates and placed them in the next table ! Dessert hour came and many more waiters came into the room.but they were almost throwing the plates atnus just rushing us out. Never ever ever again.","My boyfriend and I LOVE Nino's. In my opinion, some of the best Italian food on the Island. Additionally, the service is amazing. We like to go here when we are looking for a nice, enjoyable, relaxing dinner. We are usually there for 2-3 hours, and not because the service is slow (its not) but because we take our time between courses, enjoy a few drinks, and never feel rushed. The staff and owner are also really good at remembering a familiar face and once in a while you even get a dessert drink on the house. It can get busy on weekend nights and louder towards the end of the evening. Just something to keep in mind.","We had 7:30 dinner reservations Saturday night for six.  We were looking forward to catching up with friends we hadn't seen in some time, so we were grateful for the round table seating knowing that this is more conducive to having conversation.  Unfortunately, the excellent service, mediocre-good food, and complimentary after dinner drinks, didn't outshine the harmfully high noise level (an 89 rating on a decibel App!)  Bring your earplugs.  (From the App: Normal conversation is about 60 dB, a lawn mower is about 90 dB, and a loud rock concert is about 120 dB. In general, sounds above 85 are harmful, depending on how long and how often you are exposed to them and whether you wear hearing protection, such as earplugs or earmuffs).","Got the urge to go to NIno's. Always greeted warmly by Agim and the team. Started off with Eggplant Rollatini-Very Good and my wife had the Vegetable Soup. For the entree, I ordered the Veal Marsala. The Veal Marsala is cut wih a fork tender and has a delicious Marsala flavor-Excellent. I also ordered a side order of Penne Vodka-Very Good. My wife ordered the Salmon which is her favorite-Excellent. I had Espresso and Tortoni for dessert, and my wife had Tea and Tortoni. Service is always Very Good/Excellent. A delicious summer meal.",Nino's Restaurant
58,"I have been eating at Jade Island Chinese Restaurant since 1989 & the food is always good.Tonight I went to their restaurant & I ordered (2) combination plates to go.  One was chicken chow mein w/fried rice & an egg roll & my boyfriend had pepper steak w/fried rice & an egg roll as well.  I asked the cashier if the chef could add extra onions to my chow mein. She said no the chef is too busy.  That was the most horrible customer service a restaurant can give you.  Upon biting the egg roll, it smelled funky.  It had a sour & rancid smell.  I threw the egg roll out.  The chow mein was swimming in water & they had the nerve to charge me an extra $0.50 for white meat chicken.  I will never go back there again because of the awful customer service they gave me & rancid egg rolls.  They totally lost me as a customer.  Don't go there.  They are horrible & nasty.   The men who host at the front, have been nasty & short w/me before. They also have attitudes",I'm 41 years old beenEating Jade Island since 1984 food is delicious and consistent no one compares,"I went here for a Xmas dinner with a bunch of my girlfriends . The service was terrible , the food was disgusting and the waiter was downright mean . I think it's time for this place to shit it's doors. It needs a facelift ! Or needs to close!",I love this place. When you walk in you feel like you stepped back in time and into an Elvis movie from the early 1960's . It is a charming place with pleasant staff. Their Pu Pu Platter is excellent and you get a generous serving. It is a fun place to go sit down and enjoy some good food. This is my young daughters favorite place and we always find something she likes despite being a picky eater.,"Jade Island has been around for like 30 years!!! Their definitely doing something right. It's a mix of your typical Chinese/Polynesian food. I grew up dining here with my family, who absolutely love this place. Anytime I'm out with my mom and asks her where she wants to eat it's ALWAYS Jade Island. The portions are pretty big 2-3 people can easily share a dish. The service here is quick and so friendly. They get excited when you order a tropical cocktail (which are always strong) but hey I'm not complaining. Don't judge I work hard .",The Vintage Polynesian Atmosphere is great The food less so.,Jade Island
59,"This place is a North shore Icon.. heen coming here for over 25 years. Menu doesn't change but the flavor and quality of food is still there.. prices are still affordable.. needs a make over though.. but, the new owners are living up to the history of the pmace.. always a repeat..","I give this restraunt a thumbs down!  The food was served on a small plate and it was tasteless!  Also, the wait staff was quick to rush us out after eating the main meal.  I kept thing that this restraunt was nothing like the former Sanchos in Bay Ridge Brooklyn where the food had taste!",One Main Entree per person. What kind of policy is that. What a Wasted of food. Even we ordered more appetizer that we can try different things. We end up need to cancel all the appetizer to do what their stupid policy instead charging us extra on entree without make the entree bigger. My family and my friends will not go there again because this policy.,Went there Saturday and the food was very good I had the twin lobster special which was excellent the food here has become hit or miss Saturday was a hit place needs to be redone,This place has been around a very long Time and for a reason !Excellent lobster  excellent sangria Excellent service Family friendly Double lobster,"Haven't been here for years. The quality of the food has gone way down. Let's start from the beginning. The bread served at the table was from a supermarket. The salad was weak at best and the soup was bland and flavorless. The shrimp in garlic was obviously frozen and rubbery. The seafood paella was mediocre at best. The rice seemed to be precooked with overdone frozen seafood. The sangria was some premixed affair. The only thing that was decent was the fresh cooked potato chips that was served without a thought perhaps a to serve with a  little green or garlic sauce on the side. The servers were good. It's not there fault that the food is processed, boring and bland. I will not be back.",Real Madrid Restaurant
60,"Walked in and was told there would be a wait if 10 minutes, we said ok, and waited... and waited and waited by the door. I was confused because there was plenty of empty tables but didn't say anything. The waiters were all standing by the bar watching tv not even paying attention to us. After staring for 30 minutes at empty tables that we could of been seated at, we walked out. PASS ON THIS! Take your business to a place where you are actually wanted.",The food in this restaurant is pretty good . But the service is awful and the waiters aren't to blame . They don't have enough help . It takes way to long from start to finish .,"Came to this restaurant from reviews off yelp and was slightly disappointed. We had a party of nine and there was a pre booked table indoors so we had to sit outside. Which usually is not an issue but it was around 2 pm so it was hot and there was black ashes flying into our drinks even though we were under the umbrella. The server was really attentive to setting up our table outside and was very polite. We ordered 3 appetizers and an entree each. The drinks and appetizers came out in a timely manner but the entrees took forever and when some of the dishes came out, you can tell it was sitting under the heat lamp for a little bit. Server missed one entree which maybe could have been avoided if he repeated the order to confirm. The food tasted amazing though.","BEST CHICKEN MARSALA this side of the Atlantic Ocean! Don't believe me, ask the dishes! (Beauty and the beast joke, but I would lick them clean!)You gotta try their Chicken Marsala","Fantastic establishment to eat at! Along with their great options on their everyday menu, their specials are unbelievable! I also recommend the chocolate Jelly ring martini!",Place is a hidden gem for pizza. The big metro pies are different from any other pizzerias on the island and they are outstanding. The ingredients that go on the pizza good as well . The only reason I diddnt give it 5 stars was the Cesar salad was weak.‍Can't wait to go back !!,Giovannis Trattoria
61,"We wouldn't go back nor recommend it. Place was busy but in no way overwhelmed. Our entrees took an hour to come out. Waiter was terrible, not properly attentive and personality not suited for such a business. I spoke to the hostess and Maitre D together at the same time to request arrangement for dessert time. They failed to communicate my request to the waiter so the request was unfulfilled. When we departed the Maitre D was at the next table. I observed how no effort was made to say goodby, thanks, come again as our table left. The food was outstanding, prices a few dollars less than nearby restaurants. The bus staff was excellent and should replace the waiter. The Maitre D and waiter are the downfall. They were well staffed and in tight quarters so there really is no excuse to fail with such outstanding food and decent pricing.","Been here several times, nothing special, tried the chicken parmigiana a couple of times and the meatballs once, each time I was less then satisfied with the quality of those items, the pasta is good, but most decent Italian restaurants have good pasta, also the service is not that great, it's slow, inattentive and sometimes not very respectful. They need to improve on the quality of food they serve.",,This new Italian Restaurant is only open about 6 months and has a wonderful menu and a price fixed four course dinner for $24.95 -we started off with steamed mussels in red sauce which were delish -in fact we had spoonfuls of the sauce after the muscles were gone. My wife had fried zucchini which were wonderful in a nice red sauce-She had chicken Parmesan well I enjoyed the veal Saltimboca -dessert was included.We had the NY cheese cake which was surprising light and a delicious Tera masu.Most desserts are baked on the premises.Would definitely come back again.,"Very good food and staff. Decor is very simple. I like that they don't play loud music, so we were able to have a comfortable conversation talking at a normal volume. The salmon had a cream sauce with roasted cherry tomatoes, asparagus, and crab meat. Also came with a roasted potato, carrots, and broccoli. It was very good. My wife had the Frutta di Mare with gluten free pasta, which she enjoyed. Big portion. My daughter loved the pesto pasta. I had a taste of my Mom's lamb chops - holy crap were they delicious!  She said they were the best lamb chops she ever ate at a restaurant. My Dad had the Veal Saltimbocca. It wasn't long before his dish was empty. Appetizers were also delicious. They were very generous with their wine pourings. And the prices were very good, especially the Complete Dinner Specials, which were the same price as the regular menu, but included an appetizer, coffee and dessert. This is a solid Italian Restaurant.","Dined at Trattoria Toscana last Friday after checking reviews in Yelp and it was quite a good surprise. There are so many Italian restaurants in this boro, that it's quite impossible to try them all and find one that will please our taste. First, The quality of the food at Trattoria was above expectations. We started by ordering a bottle of red wine, a  estate grown Pinot Noir that was smooth, light and paired very well worth our meal. They have a well developed wine list that is quite impressive, and their wine bottles are affordable. They also offer ""house wine"" which I didn't try. For appetizers we ordered the grilled octopus, which was very tender and grilled to perfection. It came on a bed of Arugula with a white bean cream... just delicious. Excellent dish and excellent choice. Our Main entrees were filet mignon and the grilled Bronzino in a white wine sauce.  Bronzino was was very well presented and tasted very fresh. The Bronzino  was taken off the bones prior to being served. Fish was fresh, soft, well prepared.  Both dishes came out with potato and vegetables.  We were impressed with the presentation of the dishes. For desert we ordered the homemade pana cota. The service was excellent. Their waiters constantly checked on how we were doing- not rushed at all.  We enjoyed our meals and took leftovers home.  The restaurant got pretty crowded around 7:00'pm, noise is moderate. They also had a couple playing live music.  I would definitely go back to Trattoria Toscana if looking for another great Italian meal in Staten Island.  I recommend ppl make reservations before heading there, this restaurant gets crowded, seems to be  popular and very well liked by locals. It was our first visit and was just a very good choice for us last Friday! We are happy that we were able to have a great meal there with a wonderful bottle of red wine, a delicious dinner, excellent service and were never rushed out of there. Will go back! Their parking is a plus!",Trattoria Toscana
62,"What a disaster.   Got here at 645 told its about an hour wait.   Fast forward an hour and 40 minutes, still not seated.  Asked why, told the kitchen is backed up.   Really??  Asked for a manager, and managers are too busy.  Staff is not pleasant and management is non-existent.  Absolutely ludicrous.  Won't waste my time coming back.","The service is slow, and the server would only come by to give us our food. They ran out of prime ribs at 8:00 pm... the clam chowder and salad were too salty. The salmon was great tho. The seats were also filthy when we got there. There was left over food and scraps on the seats. Not the best experience I've had at Outback.","Food was good.

My friend had lamb chops and those were pretty bad, fairly dry and very little taste, almost as if there was no seasoning. Would not recommend the lamb chops.

No complaints,"Definitely the best Turkish cuisine I've tried. I love this restaurant. The food is superb! They offer small or large portions, which is perfect if you are not that hungry. I usually get the chicken shish or chicken chops. All meals are served with delicious bread, salad and rice. Everything is perfectly cooked and seasoned well, very flavorful. The ambiance is beautiful. Hanging chandeliers, with a beautiful setting and oversized windows overlooking Hylan Blvd. There is a nice outdoor seating as well. It's usually very busy on the weekends, but I never wait long to be seated. The staff is very friendly and attentive, always checking in to make sure everything is ok. They make you feel right at home and will sometimes offer tea or desserts - on the house during those busy nights where you may have waited a few minutes longer for your meal. Amazing food, elegant decor and great service! You won't be disappointed.",Best turkish restaurant in Staten Island. Service and food was wonderful. I highly recommended.,"This place is just amazing . My family and I come here all the time , and tonight we all went again with my extended family too. We were a party of 8 and they accommodated us right away. I always order the lamb gyro entree, so good. And I get the hummus,babaganoosh, and stuffed grape leaves appetizer. My niece who came with us today ordered the falafel platter , best falafel I ever had, crispy on the outside , soft in the middle . My husband got the yogurt lamb Adana , had a great sauce in it . We all had a great time and the service is always great. The waiter even accommodated us with separate checks . Great waiter. Thanks for always giving us great, fresh food and a cool experience",Zara Cafe Grill
66,It was really quiet when we went in. Food came out quick. I got the cheeseburger noodle bun. The thai milk tea drink was actually good,"I ordered a spicy salmon roll, spicy tuna roll, salmon avocado roll, and a spicy kani salad. The spicy kani salad was very disappointing. It was unlike any that I have ever had, with just some raw lettuce under some crab meat. There was no flavor and it was not what I expected nor what I wanted. The rolls are very small compared to others that I've had, and they were nothing special taste wise. The entire meal was very underwhelming and disappointing.","Their main dishes is now a five stars! Less oil in their main dishes with more veggies with phenomenal service. I wished they were opened sooner. Staten Island needed this place a long time ago. Right after, I go shopping that's a few minutes away. This spot don't disappoint. They're getting busier every time I ordered my sushi game.","I love the PokéBowl, always order this with eel and roasted duck, very tasty. Delivery is fast, and customer services is wonderful!","Very delicious Asia food ! Came here to try the famous sushi burrito as it has great reviews and it did not disappoint. Also tried the sesame seed chicken, fresh and tasty. Very happy we found this gem, highly recommend it. Check out the pictures, everything looks as delicious as it taste.","Salmon Bento Box: comes with soup or salad plus pick between white rice or fried rice. Great meal, clean restaurant, awesome staff. Will be back!",Simple Asia
67,We ate here twice but I will never return. The manager was rude and the staff clueless. On both occasions the hostess seemed startled that we didn't have a reservation and was unsure where to seat us in a dining room that was 75% empty. First time we had Sunday brunch and enjoyed the meal. We decided to go back for dinner on a Friday night at 5:45 pm without a reservation. Again the hostess  looked over a seating chart then informed us we could only sit at a high table in the bar area. I am sorry I agreed to do so. Only 2 tables were occupied in the dining room but we were informed that the others are all reserved. Several other couples were also turned away. Mid way through my meal I did see a couple given a table. They admitted that they had no reservations either. When I spoke with the manager he explained their policy. I pointed out the couple who had been seated and he shrugged his shoulders and walked away. No apology no nothing! When we left at 7 pm the dining room was still empty.,"So here on a date night, total disaster.  They have a party upstairs. Now every dine in customer has to has unaccebtable wait times.  Now to boot my food off the special menu was total crap.  Over cooked pasta, ruined dried out chicken.  Waitress was really not good either.  Never paid attention to our empty drink glasses.  Money best spent elsewhere.  Oh and as im writing this, folks who just sat down just got their food after we waited over 45 minutes.  Bye to this out dated dump!!","The food is OK quality and the price reflects it. However, the place itself is a DUMP. The paint is peeling everywhere, ceiling tiles are water stained, curtains from 1950s, overall the place is in need a COMPLETE renovation.",This is a great restaurant located on the north shore of staten island NY the food was excellent and delicious Excellent service here It took me a while to decide what I wanted for lunch and the waitress kept coming back to see if I was ready to order She never made me feel pressured to hurry and order Definitely worth the money to enjoy a meal,"Great place for brunch! We've been here multiple times for their bottomless brunch and it seems like no one else has heard they do brunch! Bottomless brunch for $25 includes bottomless beverages (almost everything!), a basket of fresh breads (think bagels, croissants...), and a plate of fruit/pastries in addition to your main course.My 'go to' is the manor eggs which is essentially eggs benedict but with bacon, ham, sausage, English muffin, and home fries. My husband usually gets the French toast but tends to ask for it without the cornflakes. We absolutely will be back!",Excellent food and service. Always warm welcoming and accommodating. The owner is very nice wants you to enjoy your dining experience. Recently had a party in the upstairs room. Highly recommend.,Manor Restaurant
68,"We called for a delivery order at 6:35pm and were told 45 mins to an hour, which we were expecting. I paid for the food on the phone by giving my CC number. It's now 8:10pm and still no food. We've called twice in the last half hour and both times were told the delivery is out already and should be here any minute. This is absurd at this point and had I not paid already I would have cancelled the order.",Food is decent. Kind of expensive for what you get. The worst part is the wait time. I ordered pickup to avoid the long wait time for delivery but pick up is just as bad. Ordered through seamless at 7 pm. Was told order would be ready between 7:45-7:55. It's 8 and my husband is still waiting. An hour wait to pickup two sandwiches on a Monday night from a take out place? Food takes over an hour Every. Single. Time. Seriously need to work on your prep time guys.Update: sandwich was cold. How is that possible if my husband was waiting? You would think it was freshly made...,"I ordered from them last week and loved the white pizza with broccoli, so I ordered it again. But this time they hardly put any broccoli and added cilantro, to which I'm allergic to! Terrible! And they were also over 45 minutes late in delivering it when I live less than 3 miles away. Very upset and if you have food allergies, I don't recommend you ordering from this as you never know what you might get.","A few months ago, one early evening, I decided to walk in and asked to see if they will make Eggplant Rollatini without bread crumbs and I was praying that they will say yes. The lady that was at the front went in the back and asked the cooks, she came back and said no due to all the prep was done with breadcrumbs. I was like aww man, I was okay with it and moved on to order food. The nice lady told me for the future, I can call the place up in the morning or the night before to request Eggplant Rollatini without breadcrumbs and they will honor my request. Good to know for next time!As I was ordering the food, one of the cooks came out and said we have one eggplant left untouched!!  with a big smile. I laughed and the nice lady asked if I still want what I requested, I replied oh yes please! My prayers were being answered. The nice lady at the front said, it will take a little longer to cook than normal and I told her no problem! Just take all the time you need, just made my night!That night, I ordered garlic bread eggplant parm sandwich for my father, ordered eggplant rollatini without bread crumbs and vegan dish with no pasta, which it is called Titi Olga.I could not wait to eat Eggplant Rollatini, I stopped eating gluten for two years and I missed eating Italian eggplant dishes due to bread crumbs. Many pizza and Italian restaurants look down on you if you asked to make food without bread crumbs. Their eggplant rollatini is delicious!!! I enjoyed it and I'm so happy that I just randomly walked into this location to get my eggplant fix. Thank you! My father enjoyed his sandwich. He would never though garlic knots sandwich would work lol Titi Olga is a healthy vegan dish and I enjoy it without feeling guilty. A few weeks later, I ordered a pizza pie from them and it's absolutely delicious! Artichoke Maddness is what it's called and I enjoyed it.Can't wait to come back to try other food options they have.","The square pies are really delicious and unlike a standard square pie.  Kind of like an L&B style pie...but different.  Hard to explain, but I do know that if I want a good square pie, Basil is a great option.  The paninis are great as well.  I love the Action Jaxon.  They are HUGE though, so I would suggest getting the 1/2 sized one unless you want leftovers for the next day.  Two people could easily split a full size panini and have a full meal out of it.",Excellent place to order great Italian food.  Impressive and convenient  for my family.,Basil Cucina & Catering
69,It's kind of the situation and it's like you can be your own worst enemy this place could be great to be five stars but the people in the kitchen cut corners it depends on who cooks your food it could be disgusting or it could be great you have a 50-50 shot,No parking space at all. Food and service are just okay.  Rush you to pay the bill even only a  couple of tables oo customers.  Not relax to have dinner there at all.,Dysfunctional. Ordered food for delivery almost 3 hours ago... 2 hours and 45 minutes exactly and was given an estimated delivery time of 1 hour.   When i called back after an hour and a half I was told another half hour.  Now when I try to call to ask to cancel the order can not get through. Either I get a busy signal or no one picks up...  I understand New Year's Day is busy for Chinese delivery but this is ridiculous!  I sent my husband out to pick up something else because at this point I don't think anyone is delivering.  I will not be ordering from them again.,Great neighborhood Chinese. Food is delicious. Decor on the dine in side is very nice. Take out is quick. Staff is nice and friendly.This place is a winner!,"Wow! Super blown away by the quality of the food, cleanliness of the business, and most importantly, the amazing customer service. We came right when they opened on a Saturday morning and were greeted by very friendly staff. We were the only diners at the time and the service was so good. Also, whatever secret tea blend they have is amazing. It's so fragrant and frankly, the best Asian type tea I've ever had. I hope they deliver because we will definitely be ordering from here. Also, as a starter,  you get sliced and fresh fried wonton shells to dip in a sweet and sour sauce (idk if you get this for takeout).Steamed Pork Dumplings: 3.5/5 The filling was crazy good but the dumpling skin was thicker than I like. These are definitely handmade though. I just prefer the really thin skins. Still ate every bite!Moo Shoo Pork: 4.5/5 First time trying moo shoo from anywhere and I'm so glad my first experience was a good one. Very very good! It's like a Chinese burrito of sorts. Sesame Chicken lunch special: 4.5/5 Ohhh this came with the special tea I mentioned earlier. Sooooo good. The friend rice is super fresh and not dry. Chicken pieces were juicy and perfectly cooked. Everything was so good! Thank you for a great 1st time experience! See you all again soon.","This is my local spot. Really cool atmosphere with amazing service and delicious food   If this place was in Manhattan, you would never get in",Hong Kong Kei One
70,"Website says they are open but beware, they are not open on mondays. They should update their site if they are going to change their hours.",I thoroughly enjoyed the food and drinks tonight but unfortunately the atmosphere was not up to par. The overall appearance wasn't very welcoming and lacking in decor. When our food was served we had to fight off the flies. Big turn off!!!!,"Been to this place food wasn't bad but service could be a lot better. Went as a group and before we even ordered the waitress had to tell us the ""list"" of things on the menu they no longer had. After waiting for our food that came out one by one 10 minutes apart from eachother and one order wrong, we decided to eat and get the hell out ASAP. They turned the music up so loud we couldn't even enjoy a group conversation. We went, we saw and we will never return. I give this place another 6 months before it goes out of business.","This restaurant is located in a driveway off the road near the dock. It's a nice place to hang out, have a drink or have some food. The menu is a digital book (tablet) with pictures for you to see what you will be ordering.Came here for a few drinks, and to hang out by the water for a little bit. The staff is friendly and engaging. I did not try any of the food. It looked like everyone was enjoying their meals, and the food looked good.They have a nice setup here with an indoor restaurant/bar, an outdoor enclosed restaurant/bar, and outdoor (by the dock) bar with some seating. They have nights with special events so check in to see. When I went they were going to film a movie (with a well known celebrity) after they shutdown the restaurant. So this is a place to come and check out, especially in the summer to take advantage of the outdoor bar.",This place really should  be hopping and it's not.. came here tonight inside was totally empty ...so we sat outside great night ... they weren't set up for people walking in ..   A different crowd that you wouldn't think of ...our Waitress seem to be playing the bouncer outside in the parking lot tonight She did apologize but even thou  .. this was our third  try ...that they had valet parking which I totally don't understand  when we    left the restaurant he gave me the keys and told me my car is over there   What happened to the valet ? Lol,"Very good food and great service at the Waterside.Returning again to the waterside on a really beautiful summer evening did not disappoint.  The service was, as always, great. And the food selection, presentation, and quality were all well done and delicious.Recently, I've spoken to friends who have not given the Waterside a recent try.   I ask you please go on a beautiful night and enjoy the views, great service and very well presented and delicious food. J------Yes it could use an update in a few areas -Yes perhaps the money spent on iPad menus could have been better spent on other things",Waterside
71,Very disappointing restaurant. Food was bland and poorly presented. Service was disinterested. It was barely mediocre Italian food.  We had checked reviews on Yelp and they bore no resemblance to the food and service experience. Reviews must have been by family or friends.,"I Hope this place goes out of business!!!Extremely disappointing, this place is a robbery, and completely sucks!!!My gf took me here a couple of years ago.. The place is alil pricey, I ordered ""Pink salmon"" which was like $25.. By Pink Salmon, that's exactly what I wanted, a nice salmon dish.. I by no means, intended to order a $25 bowl of macaroni, as I can buy macaroni for $1 a box at the grocery store, and cook 2 LBs of it myself at home!!!So I order this ""Pink Salmon"" entre.. for $25.. The menu claims its just that, a salmon dish..The food comes... and its a bowl of macaroni, with a couple chunks of a salmon steak cut and thrown into the macaroni. This place should be ashamed of itself!!! The same exact half a salmon steak that was cut into bits and thrown into the pasta, was the same exact type of salmon steaks you can get at Costco 6 of them for $20.. So why was I told I was being served salmon, when really I got half a salmon steak cut into pieces, and thrown into a $1 bowl of macaroni, then we were charged $25 for this?No effort put into this meal at all.. And I could of easily, and lazily made the same thing, at my home, for a cost of $3.The service was also awful.. The waiter was rude, didn't care at all about us.. and when I showed him the menu and said ""where on the menu, does it say this is a macaroni dish with alittle bit of salmon in it!!!?"" his reply was a shrug followed by ""ohh well.. tough luck"".I hope this place falls apart!!!!!!","The Staten Island Advance periodically list the bests Italian Restaurants on the Island.. I've been quite perplexed why Danoi has never been included in the list.. Others that were I've dined at and any of them can't compete at all with this place for the food, service and price... My go to place on Staten Island.. I highly recommend !",Been traveling to Staten Island for the last 50 years(don't ask). Although most restaurants on the island are a some version of neighborhood Italian this one stands out.  The ambiance is white tablecloth and uniformed wait staff. They are very attentive and responsive. The menu is more or less standard but each item was well prepared and the portions are generous.  Main courses run around $20 including the veal dishes.  All and all a very solid performance.,"The food was not good, nothing was fresh. Everything was prepared well in advanced and reheated. Had the calamari as an appetizer, rubbery and mushy. Wife and mom had the shrimp parm, which I picked at to try, again not fresh not tasteful along with nothing special pasta with bad sauce. Our waiter was always in a rush. I know that he's not there to stay for a conversation, I'm reasonable, but he was a little too Kurt and couldn't be found throughout the night. The place is old, which is fine but at least keep it clean and nice. Bathroom was disgusting, the carpet smelled musty and looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years along with the rickety chairs and tables that needed sugar packets to level it out. Thick layers of dust over the decorative large bottles of wine. I won't be back. I only gave 2 stars because the host was nice.",We ate here once...food was pretty good ....This is an old house converted into a restaurant .About a 20 minute wait on a Saturday night ....outside not well lit,Da Noi Restaurant on Victory Blvd
72,"Dear new owner of Pho Rainbow,The hot sauce suppose to be spicy, not watery! Same goes for the hoisin sauce! Stop adding water to it, you are going to loose regulars. I ve been going to this place for a few years now, and while it wasn't the best , it was pretty good Vietnamese place on the island, with the descent food and flavors. However, it seems to be worse now. Milk tea, I ordered, had too much condensed milk in it and was way too sweet, the brought of my soup didn't have much flavor , and the worst thing -watered down sauces. Ugh. I ll think twice before I would eat there again :( too sad","I had special and meatball pho there. It was okay. Flavor and fragrance were there. Okay amount of meat toppings. Could've given a little more. Egg rolls are more Chinese style instead of Vietnamese style. Dipping sauce for egg rolls was bland even for me and I'm the type that don't add salt and pepper on my food. Being a Viet, I know my fish sauce game. I had grilled pork and egg rolls with rice vermicelli to go. The vermicelli was not the the same type that you get at an authentic/Vietnamese-owned restaurant. It was so much thicker. When I reheated the vermicelli, it broke down into liquid, which was the weirdest thing. Never seen something like that before","Never ever come back again. I usually love this place for dinner or take out. Specially I love their rainbow drink, noodles, rice, etc. but after they change the owner, the foods taste so bad. The soup not taste good at all. Also, my kids love to handout with the people who work there before. Now, they don't friendly at all which is ok. Black list of this restaurant now‍‍‍","I'm only giving this place four stars because I'm staying loyal to my other Vietnamese restaurant Pho Mac. Whenever I get a craving for Vietnamese soup or taste I try to find something new to try or places. So yelp this place in Staten Island and had four stars is  usually a good sign.Nothing fancyJust a bunch of tables some music playing in the background the service was really nice and complementary. They pretty much explain anything you want to try. I had a coffee and a huge coffee lover it was a bit too strong for me with the condensed milk but it really had a good flavor next time I will get it in ice to water it down. I had the pork chop pho, with some summer rolls both delicious the soup though was on the small side from many other places that I go to but it was just enough to fill up my belly definitely try this place nothing fancy like I said. But bold flavors I will be coming back.","Pho rainbow has been around for a bit now however the ownership has changed. The new expanded menu and cleaner menu seems to have brought some new life to the place.  It's summer so I didn't stop by for the pho but rather just wanted some rice and grilled pork rolls. The staff is eh, nothing special. The guy serving me was a bit too busy on his phone and didn't really tend to me which I didn't mind until it was time to order. Food came out pretty quickly so that was good. Beef Cube Rice was ok, a bit on the peppery side. Mixed with the rice it was good, could have used some fish sauce to balance out the dish overall. Grilled Pork Rolls was good. I really enjoyed it. Rather than using fish sauce I opted for peanut sauce and mixed it with Siracha. I would highly recommend this appetizer.","Yummy simple Vietnamese. I came here on a chilly winter night with my boyfriend and we had fresh brewed tea within a minute of sitting down. So good and much needed in this weather!We ordered tofu summer rolls and butterfly shrimp spring rolls. The summer rolls were standard and decent. The shrimp rolls were ridiculously spicy!! Super spicy and flavorful jalapeños are wrapped up with the shrimp. For our entree we ordered the vegetable pho and the shrimp beef broth pho. My boyfriend loved his and it was super flavorful. However, I've had better vegetable pho elsewhere. The veggies were basic and I would have loved some tofu. However, it was a solid bowl of pho! I prefer the pho I am used to in Orlando, but for Staten Island this is probably one of the only Vietnamese places on the island.",Pho Rainbow II
73,"It became obvious quite quickly that they are not as clean as one would prefer. The menus were sticky and the cutlery was smudged. The bread on the table was as hard as bricks and there was no difference between the ""fresh bread"" and breadsticks. Two of my friends got food poisoning after eating their Penne a la Vodka with chicken. I have a shellfish allergy and ordered a simple baked potato. I reacted to it anyway which only shows that they are not as clean or careful as one would prefer. The food was just okay and for two people to get so sick almost immediately, it was a sign for us to leave so we did. We are definitely never going back.","Was there for a special birthday. Had a really wonderful time. However, the food wasn't good at all. It was buffet service and they served you. The servers gave you such tiny amounts of food. When one girl gave me vegetables,  she put a few pieces of shredded carrots on my plate and I had to ask her for more vegetables. Everything was greasy and no taste. Couldn't even eat the salad. The drinks were also watered down. The servers were very nice. They were very attentive. But, I'd never go back there.","Looking at all the reviews I thought this place would have been a home run. Ordered from here through Uber eats when the food arrived the best part of the order was the delivery man who was very fast  and polite who had no affiliation with the restaurant . I ordered 2 platters through here which according to the menu should have each came with soup,salad and dessert. What arrived was one mystery soup (which on the app you get no choice to pick), one salad which( I included a pic of) was simply old brown lettuce with one little tomato and no salad dressing and we received no desserts. The portion size for the price is not worth it. I called to ask abt my missing items and it was pointless.  The other yelp reviewers must be friends of the owner.","On Saturday, May 11 we celebrated my Son, AntonioJude's Confirmation. We were lucky enough to have the private party room because we had a bigger party which was helpful because of having a few disabled people & quite a few children and carriages too. I was told at time of booking there was no guarantee of private room versus dining room. Amanda is who I dealt with from booking until after the party and was an absolute doll, Anything I wanted or needed she made happen, even changing menu to our needs. Was everything 100% perfect, no because that's impossible. Did every guest love what they ordered? No but if they said they weren't happy the food was exchanged. The cake was better then expected since it was from Canlons and not the bakery I've used for years. I thought the printed menus was a nice touch. My sons name was written correctly on menu & cake which is usually messed up on everything. Lol there was one small error on my bill which I didn't realize until after I'd gone home but since we went back yesterday when Eddie the owner came to greet us and I mentioned it he immediately took cash from his pocket and gave it to me as he apologized. Did I mention I work in catering for nearly 27 years. I say this because maybe I know what's a big deal or not but I can say I was very happy with everything and would use Canlons for more parties in the future. At the end of the party we were handed a envelope that said God Bless AntonioJude with a $50 gift certificate that's good for one year. Imho that was super classy, generous and so thoughtful. Thank you to the staff, Amanda & Eddie for giving my son a great celebration.",First time here and it won't be our last! Never even heard of this place up until recently. Such a nice hidden gem. Great service and friendly staff especially the owner who takes his time to say hello and see how everyone is doing . We all ordered burgers which was was pretty good. Next time we'll be trying something different for sure.,"Stay far away from this place.  Called in January to book for my daughter's shower in June, was told to come in and speak to the manager, when I get there the only person helping me is a 16 year old waitress.  She told me I could leave a deposit and she'll write it in the book, and hands me 2 luncheon menus and told me that was the price.  I felt uneasy so I did not book right away.  I went back three other times because I liked the room but never got anyone but the waitresses to book the room and no contract.  They told me that I could choose from one of the luncheon packages, even bereavement because it was a Saturday afternoon party.  I gave a check, they wrote it in the book and I sent out my invites.  I recommended this place to my sister that was having a party because the price was reasonable, when she called she was quoted a price $20 more per person than what I thought I was getting.  I called the restaurant and again got a young person to speak to, I told them I was told that I was getting the price that was listed on the menus given to me, and they said no we can't do that.  I then asked to speak to someone in charge, they put the owner on.  The owner immediately had a hostile attitude and told me he would absolutely not do the price that I was quoted and no cake included either, I said I've been there 4 times and told the same thing every time I went there, he said who doesn't get a contract when their having a party? And I said I tried but you have children taking care of your party bookings.  He then said to me, what do you want me to do about it?  Very arrogantly like he could care less, I told him that I was not happy about this and he said then come in and get your money back, I told him I already sent out my invites and he said and I quote, ""then you better zip your mouth or I won't help you""  I was absolutely furious!!!!!  I said how dare you speak to me that way, and he said and I quote, ""I've been in business for 30 years, I don't need you"".  He then hung up on me.  Being a mom and putting my daughter first I called back because I didn't want to ruin my daughter's shower, I was then given a price that he would agree to and I said I need that in writing and emailed to me, he said no.  He then said and I quote ""I'm a dinosaur and I don't do email, if you want a contract you will have to call and make an appointment with me and come down and get it.""  This is the same man that comes by and greets everyone with a smile and shakes everyone's hand when you go there.  Don't be fooled by this arrogant jerk.  Do not book any parties with this place, they are unreputable and insulting!!!!!!!  I hope everyone that reads this beware!!!!!!!!",Canlon's Restaurant
74,I got the falafel with bryianni rice and chickpeas and onions with the garlic knann and coconut water. First time and won't be a last time either.,Food is great! However service is terrible. The guy guy behind the counter in glued to his phone. He will not know if you are stand in front of him for ten minutes waiting for your check. And god forbid you ask him mores then 2 questions. This man does not want to be disturbed from his phone. The bathroom has no paper towels. Tables are dirty. I would have given them 5 star had it not been for the service.,"This place is hit or miss and it's a shame because when the food is good, it's really good. Recipes seem to be ever evolving so expectations aren't met when you order your favorite thing. I would NEVER suggest eating in. The place is sooo dirty - sticky tables, gross floors, overflowing trash upon arrival. There is only one person answering the phone, taking front of house orders, completing platter orders, and distributing orders. It's far too much for one kid. This effects speed and cleanliness. Lastly, if you are in the restaurant, don't ask for ketchup, you'll get laughed at and told it's in the back. When you ask for it from the back, your acknowledged but no effort is made. Very disappointing especially because we want to support our Muslim businesses.",You can't go wrong with this place. I tried both the regular chicken platter and the chicken tikka platter. Both awesome. Chicken tikka was soo juicy!!The portion size is great!! The prices are the most reasonable you can get for platters!! Great value for the money and very good service. Highly recommended!,The Halal spot where you will find fresh delicious authentic seasoned flavor and quality product great customer service great variety my go-to spot when I want a delicious meal in fact I'm here at least once a week every week .I recommend the chicken tikka the Tandoori wings and lamb chops.I've only visited the Carteret location but they now have an Old Bridge location I'm hoping they'll open up a location in Newark New Jersey but until then I will continue to be a loyal customer God willing.,"Authentic cuisine!We have been pleased time and again. Sometimes they run out of the things we like but that opens a door to try new menu items and we have never been dissatisfied!  We only just discovered the Halal Spot some months ago but have been eating here at least once a week. The lamp chops are my favorite my wife loves the Chicken Tikka. Whatever your selection is your sure to enjoy. The food is always cooked fresh, and the seating is comfortable. Good for kids, friends and family.",The Halal Spot
75,"Love it here, great salads good pizza. Nice atmosphere, not fancy but perfect for family kinda days","Food is good,  but this waiter was terrible. Lost, Dazed and Confused.Waiter said ""I'm busy"", i said ""not my problem"".  He  Proceeded to clean off the entire table, But left my plate there.   I gave it to a bus boy, And said since the waiter decided to ignore me could you wrap this up please. If I want Compania ill go to Tottenville.   But if my Tottenville I go to Deluca's or Reggiano",Close at 11:30pm. Walked in at 10:45pm to place a take out order and was told the restaurant was closed. Booooooooooooo,"One of my favorite fancier pizza places on the south shore. The inside is more like a restaurant, nicely decorated with a bar and often they host parties of large groups. The menu is mainly pizza, but there are also apps, pasta, and paninis. I've tried several pies and fried calamari and I've never been disappointed, definitely one of my favorite margherita pies. Even pitchers of sangria (white and red) were delicious! The atmosphere is always chill and the service is alert and prompt. As long as you have a reservation, you should be seated right away. Prices are a little high, but you get what you pay for-- always clean inside, good atmosphere, and delicious food. Consistently a solid option for pizza and drinks!","Loud and busy most nights, Campania serves a solid pizza and the staff is predominately very accommodating and professional.That said, when you venture out of the pizza section of the menu, you'll dine on marginally ""Italian"" dishes served to a largely American-Italian patrons.  You would think they'd know better.To be clear, the food isn't bad, it's just very Romano's macaroni grill / Olive Garden - ISH or so I would imagine.The meatballs are so heavily breadcrumbed, they're like eating a bread ball with a touch of meat.  The pastas are marginally passable but not at all authentic.  More ingredients isn't the answer unless you're trying to distract from the mediocre prep and execution of the dish.So a small piece of advice- stick with the good to very good pizza.  Have a beer. Catch the game.  And if you really enjoy an unreasonably high volume  dining experience on mostly mediocre food at best- this is the place for you Rating - 3Stars = good at best","We've been to campanias so many times!! but this is our first time we didn't order pizza (sad face), the pizza is so good!!!. We decided on the family style Sunday sauce instead. The meatballs and sausages were pretty tasty. Would I get it again? Probably not. I prefer my own meatballs and sauce, but mom wanted to try it.",Campania Coal Fired Pizza
76,"Well today on the way to my doctor appointment I stopped in to pick up an order of crispy calamari. What I received was an order of mushy, very thickly sliced ,chewy, calamari. It was basically inedible,it's sitting in the trash can outside the doctors office  at 1 teleport drive. All the breading wasn't even stayin on and it didn't even come out hot, just warm. Seems like they were too lazy to make a new batch and might have reheated it in the microwave . Way too overpriced also. 15.00 dollars for a small order was ridiculous too.  I won't be going back there.","First, service here is slow and unprofessional. Our waiter made ordering food actually an awkward experience. Second, the boss came out and stated my friend was not 21 and was not allowed to drink (we are here for his 21st bday). When that was settled, they then continued our conversation with a political debate and claimed all ""college students"" were brainwashed. Very inappropriate and awkward. Stay away!P.S. the food sucks","Awful customer service. I called in the early afternoon on mother's day to ask whether I could get a take out order for 10 people. They told me - 'yes, sure'. I then shared the menu with all the members of my party, we spent about an hour selecting what to order and when I called an hour later again same guy told me that they can't accommodate me due to being busy. I tried to remind him of our conversation from an hour ago, but he didn't care, no apology given, just insisted they couldn't do it as they simply got too busy. Not acceptable!!! Will never go to this restaurant again.","This is my favorite Italian food place, ever!! The ambiance in this place is so comforting. It's super family oriented with pictures covering the walls. The service here is always superb. Giuliana herself is onsite every time, walking to each table introducing herself, checking to see how you're enjoying your meal. The bread that they start you off with is literally to die for. I feel like the best thing about this restaurant is the fact that you can ask for things that are not listed on the menu. So in essence, there's always something for everyone. If you're looking for good eats on Staten Island, this place is highly recommended!","I really like this place, they make me feel like a family, always fresh food and delicious.Great choice for Staten Island.","The food is very good at Guiliana's ! I recommend getting the Caprese salad, so delicious! All the entrees are very good, last time I went I had the chicken Frangelico...excellent! The chicken Valdestano is very good too! Definitely recommended and when I'm back on Staten Island I'll come just for dinner here :)",Giuliana's
77,"This place is just okay. I came here on a Friday night for dinner. We were seated immediately and drink orders were taken. Everything was going well and we ordered mozzarella sticks for an appetizer. We were served the app but were never given plates and forks and napkins during this time, even though our waitress promised to bring plates so we could at least over them. Plates never came and eventually she brought up napkins, and we ordered our entrees. My boyfriend had the philly cheesesteak which was aparently very spicy and overseasoned. I had a cheeseburger and it was bland - plus the waitress didnt even ask how I like my burger cooked (rare) and it was definitely not rare at all. And the trays the food was served on were stained with food from the previous diner (see photo).It took a long time to get another beer during dinner as well which is annoying when its the only beverage you have. Also, on the way home from dinner, my stomach was killing me - doesnt say much about the food quality. This is a place for finger foods and watching games so I guess I expected more. Will probably not be back.",Buffalo wild wings Low key mad booty. The service was Odee slow and the food wasn't even that wavvvy. The wings were not tuff and I came here for Odee wavy tuff wings but they were ass. this place Stank as hell.,Poor customer service. Was seated and unable to catch staff attention for 15 minutes before deciding to leave.,"Buffalo Wild Wings has pretty good food and good deals, but be prepared for a long wait- even when the restaurant is pretty empty.I've been to this Buffalo Wild Wings a lot, it's basically a go-to for my friends and I. There usually isn't any wait to be seated, but there have been many times I would wait 30+ minutes for my food, which can be frustrating.If you are willing to wait, the food is pretty good. Buffalo Wild Wings has a ton of different flavors for the wings that can cover pretty much any preferences; I personally recommend the Parmesan Garlic. Their appetizers are also really good, and after a certain time (10pm?) they're heavily discounted. You can get mozzarella sticks, quesadillas, and nachos for about $15 in total.Tuesday and Thursday has pretty good deals on wings too- Pretty much half off the menu price.","I love their Happy Hour specials and I love their wings, especially when those cravings hit. However, service here is extremely inconsistent and terrible for the most part. You come in seating yourself and you have to wait quite some time before a server comes to take your order and then another eternity for your order to come. Some of the servers here are respectful and attend to you in a timely manner with water, drinks, updates on the food, etc... but there are some that are utterly disrespectful and it makes you wonder why the heck are they even working here if they are so miserable and it shows in their attitudes and body language. Why do I keep coming here? It's the cravings and there isn't another BWW in Staten Island. As with take-out, I've had quite a few screw-ups with my order and it takes a long time to speak to a manager to compromise on a solution. I understand it is a chain restaurant, but management needs to really get this place organized better and hire more and better employees.P.S.,Please bring back the roasted garlic mushroom and spinach dip appetizers on the menu.","Mother of pearl.... I know this is a chain restaurant but can the service suck anymore????? Walked in at 6:25, it was empty but still waited for 5 minutes to be seated because the hostess was MIA. Finally seated, we waited literally 25 minutes for a server to come over. Her name was Aliyah, she was lovely and did apologize for the long wait.  We weren't given water upon being seated, nor when we got our food. Apps took about 10 min to get and were good. We had the chips and salsa to start and mozzarella sticks. The girl who brought us our food was named Emily, she was a ray of sunshine *rolls eyes*. Clearly they need to hire better help. I had the buffalo ranch chicken wrap which was pretty decent, but still had to wait a lifetime for water. Maybe they assume you don't want if you order a alcoholic beverage? I had a tall draft of Angry Orchard which is $3 as is their other drafts are all day everyday. I would pass on this place, which is disappointing since I love me some wings and BWW.",Buffalo Wild Wings
78,"How long does it take to make scrabbled egg and to bake potatoes? 5mins? 15mins? How about 45mins? Well, 45mins is what the chef and waitress here feel it takes to make a 3 bite sizes (supposedly  3eggs, though feel like 1.5eggs)of scrambled eggs and bake 12 tiny potatoes. We visited the place on Saturday, July 20 and was got a cold, half hearted smile from our waitress Sam. Since it was the hottest day of the summer, we ordered for some cocktails. In less than a minute my cocktail was on the table. My drink had none of the ingredients of what was on the menu and the champagne in it was flat. It was clearly been sitting out and might have been something they got it wrong for someone else. We ordered the food and had a long 45min wait to get scrabbled egg and potatoes while my wife ordered avacado toast. What's even more interesting is that the menu said fried potatoes but what we got was baked potatoes. No explanations on why they changed and no apologiesWill not suggest this place, more because of the service than the food. You got 2stars in spite of the lousy service bcoz the food was edible",I hardly ever write reviews but just had to this time.  I hate to give a relatively low star rating because I think the food here and wait staff are great. I have been here a few times before. I would otherwise give 4.5 stars and I will probably come back again. But last night boggles my mind. Our dinner party sat down at 9:45 PM (Open Table had a seating available for 10 PM).  The manager was not happy and told us we had to get our orders in by 10 PM and had to leave by 11 PM. IF THAT IS THE CASE - Don't offer 10 PM reservations on Open Table. By then it was too late to go somewhere else. For a party of four - we ordered over $500 of food and drinks to compensate the wait Staff. They were gracious and told us not to worry.Nevertheless the manager kicked us out at 11 PM. We would have been done at 11:30 but we were forced to guzzle down the remaining wine and box the rest of the food and left the restaurant at 11:15 PM.So this is fair warning. Do not come here later than 9 PM or you will get run out at 11. Even today I notice Open Table offering a table for 2 at 9:45 PM. WHY EVEN OFFER THAT TIME SLOT IF YOU ARE GOING TO GET KICKED OUT AN HOUR LATER BY THE MANAGER?,This is seriously disappointing. The chicken looks like a potato chip! How can this be considered on the dinner menu? It's more of a snack rather than a meal.,"I tried this place when it just opened and forgot to leave a review. It was great then and is still great now.The food is delicious, offering an interesting twist on flavors for comforting, classic food.The food:The bread that comes with the table is delicious, fresh, and served warm with butter that's soft as well so no muss with spreading. That's always appreciated in place of hard bricks of butter and cold, crusty breadSeared Ahi Tuna - smallish portion but delicious and cooked wellBrisket sliders - super good and that spicy tomato jam is amazing and really amps up the flavorSmoked Mac & Cheese with bacon - good sized portion, not too big not too small, with a great combo of flavorsRoasted cauliflower and fried cauliflower - both were good although the fried one was a but too fried for my liking. The cumin aioli that accompanies it is delicious!Patatas Bravas - not the best of this dish I've had but not bad at all. It's a good mix of regular and purple potatoes, small, whole with a good amount of sauce on top. I think it should be given on the side but that's an opinion. The sauce could be better.Pistachio cake with strawberry ice cream - it was super good. The flavors were on point, the cake was nice and dense and the ice cream was a perfect pairing.I ordered the ""One L"" cocktail, it was good, nothing special, but a good cocktail with a good balance of flavorThey have a slightly limited offering of the common whiskeys so we ordered the Lagavulin. It was super smokey and a great whiskey. They don't carry Glenfiddich, which is a good, common order.The decor and ambiance are great as well!I did take a star down because of the staff, however. They were not rude or anything of the sort however it did seem like they were either understaffed or new without training. We had several different waiters, which I'm not crazy about. One was a busser/waiter, the other a bartender/waiter. They had a pretty large party that night so maybe that was the reason but it seemed like they were disorganized. We waited quite a bit for each drink order, as well as roughly 20 minutes, if not more, for the dessert to come out. I get it, you're busy.We also had the misfortune of being seated at the table right near the thermostat and I guess someone was complaining of it being hot inside (it was fine) so random waiters, and what I think is the manager, kept coming and asking us to check if it was set to ""cool."" I get it, limited access, but it was quite annoying to have to constantly move around and try to read the display. The same person I perceived to be the manager made an odd appearance, after we ordered dessert, and was like, ""so um, everything good?"" Yep, everything was good.We ordered more than we needed so asked for our food to be wrapped up. They did but my remaining sliders weren't packaged for us, which I only noticed back home. It was definitely upsetting because I really liked them and was too full to finish them there and had planned on doing so later in the evening.All in all, on a less busy night, I'm sure they would have gotten 5 stars from me, but several things really put a tiny bit of discomfort on the evening.",Came here for dinner. The sharing plate style of the place really is great and is plenty of food depending on what you order. Prices are certainly fair and the drinks are quite tasty,"Very disappointed that they do not honor the Wednesday Hump Day special as advertised on their website unless you ask for it. We had to ask if it was available and were told I have to check. We ordered 6 plates only one was taken off. So that was adjusted. (3 for2). Then we saw the drinks 2 buds $6 each instead of $3. And a martini was $12 instead of $8. We had to have the bill adjusted 3 times. The waitress said was unaware of the Wednesday special as she usually doesn't work Wednesday. My issue was with the manager who changed my check the first time. And the second and the 3rd. Really trying to hold back from honoring the happy hour specials? I even asked the waitress if anyone else received the special that evening and she said no. So take it off your website instead of having a ""secret happy hour"" that is only offered if you ask. That's a dishonest way to do business! On a side note all our food was delicious. You can see the all day Wednesday Hump Day special on their website under events. I posted a pic  here.",Violette's Cellar
79,"YUK! This was awful, we had mystery a meat appetizer in a greasy pastry shell, that tasted like it was marinated in pure vinegar, I had the beef rib main course and needed a chisel to get the meat off, which was drenched in a sweet sauce, awful. My friend had a beef soup with tamarind that was awful, and a cream and string bean dish that was not edible. This rates as one the most awful dining experience of my life. On top of it all because we ordered from the menu and didn't opt for the buffet we had to wait 45 minutes for our awful food choices. We avoided the buffet because of the greasy fried items, little did we know that is the cuisine. $50 with tip, a waste of money.","The chicken adobo tastes just like grandma used to make! It's tough to get across the Verrazano Bridge, but when I do, I'm gonna make it a priority to come here. Also, they have a shop across the street where you can buy Filipino groceries that make my heart sing: pandesal, spam, nescafe, bean thread for pancit, calamansi extract, and even a little deli counter where you can buy fresh, creamy leche flan to go!","I am not going to oversell this place. It's good. No need to elaborate. If you go, you'll learn how good.I've said too much. Prepare to be smothered with a small pillow now. Sleep my child. Sleep. Shhhh.","Absolutely delicious. I used Uber-eats to order late night on a Sunday evening and was not disappointed. The ribs fell off the bone, garlic rice rice ws worth the up charge, adobo was a little salty for my taste but was still really good. The pork egg rolls were amazing and the curry oxtail ws fantastic. A bit pricy for only having 2 small oxtail pieces in it but maybe I just got unlucky. Anyway the food here is great. I would order again.","If you are craving filipino food for a decent price, this local spot will satisfy you. There is a good selection to chose from and the protions are fairly big. Me and my friends arrived on a Sunday night and there was only a few parties. We ordered the lumpia to share, kare kare, miki bihon, crispy bicol, and chicken inasal. The lumpia came out hot and crunchy. The kare kare was a bit bland and some pieces of bok choy were bitter, but the meat was tender. The miki bihon is a mix of egg noodle and rice noodles. The chicken inasal was also a bit bland. The crispy bicol was my favorite, it was flavorful and tender.The staff was friendly and worked quick. The place was clean and had a homey feel.Overall, most of the dishes were on a bland side but I suggest the crispy bicol!","Good Filipino food at a decent price! Everything we tried had a unique flavor! I don't eat Filipino food often so I don't have much experience as to how it compares to other places. But I really enjoyed dining here. Restaurant also has a mini parking lot for like 2 cars. Space was pretty spacious. Sisig tacos-good. Lots of meat. Tastes better with hot sauce. Kare Kare-peanut buttery goodnessSisig baboy-  crispy pork belly. Pretty good as well. Love the fatty parts. Garlic rice was so aromatic and delicious as well. Eaten together with the Kare Kare sauce, it was greatttt. I tried their melon drink. It was a bit too sweet for my tastes.",Phil-Am Kusina
80,"We always come here if we craving for authentic Italian food. Today I decided to treat my dad early for Father's Day. We arrived at 5:30 and was seated immediately. My dad loved their lobster and ordered it again. I ordered the eggplant parm and my mom ordered the seafood pasta. When the lobster arrived, my dad happily tasted the lobster but to his dismay, he said the lobster was not fresh and tasted like tofu. We complained to the waiter and told him to cancel the order. He was really hoping to enjoy some fresh lobster but it was a dead one. We have been here several times and this was the first time that he complained about the lobster. Hopefully, it doesn't happen again.","Don't know what the hype is about.  Mediocre food, old school dark, carpeted restaurant-could use major updating.  The accordion player is a nice touch until he stalks until he receives a tip.  Wouldn't return.","I hate to give this restaurant one star, the staff was fabulous. The restaurant and bathrooms were spotless, and while there are no booths , the seating isn't that bad. The sauce was disgusting,tasted like it was out of a can, I've had sauce out of a jar that was better, the ziti was overcooked , the cheese tasted like a bland commercial unblended mozzarella that you would get in a supermarket. The bread basket contained bread that tasted old and disgusting, the vegetables tasted like they were out of a box. the eggplant was very tough , and I believe it was frozen. The phone was constantly ringing,it was so loud and annoying, that I was starting to get nervous. We went here based on overwhelmingly five star reviews on yelp. Those reviewers either had the munchies from too much weed, or have never been in a decent Italian restaurant in their life.",The best Italian on SI!My favorite restaurant here.The food is always fresh and the service fantastic.Always worth a visit! I could happily eat here every week.,"I always forget that this place exists. I do not know why. The food is amazing and the service is just as good. Went there with a party of 7 for a late dinner. You figure after a long night the staff would have been spent by an 8:30 reservation. We did not feel one bit neglected. The staff was attentive and very friendly. Helped with the menu choices and gave good recommendations. I tried the Pork Chop La Strada which my friend was raving about. I was very satisfied. The portions were nice and the Pork Chop had just enough heat with the Cherry Peppers and breaded perfectly. The fried calamari was crunchy and tasteful, made for a perfect appetizer.I will definitely be returning","My family I went for an early dinner on Tuesday, we were a large party of 11 people. Restaurant was empty so they were able to accommodate us! They highly recommend the pre fixe dinner, I'm assuming because we were such a large party that would have been easier on them. It wasn't really explained how it would work but in the end it all worked out. The pasta was excellent but the fish was just OK, I did not like the veggies that accompanied the fish, they seemed like they had been frozen or something and not very fresh. The bread basket was excellent and so was the Cesar salad! Atmosphere is nothing special at all. Overall I give it a  so so ! Oh and the bussers who took care of our table were great!",La Strada Restaurant
81,This was a disappointing very mediocre experience.We have been here 3 or 4 times prior but tonight's experience was the worst. The service was pleasant but lousy. We ordered wings and they never brought wet wipes. They brought the food during the appetizers so the food came back cold.The prices are NyC and the product was StateN Island. The live music was awful not the usual vibrant accompaniment to a dining experience!They made me a mixed drink with a top drawer tequila which I did not ask for. So that's it just okSuper expensive and nothing special - even the entrees were tasteless.... oh well used to love this place.,"Went there for my husband's birthday dinner. I made reservation at 7:30, arrived and be seated at 7:40ish.  We got served water 10 mins later. Then 30 mins later finally we got our drinks. Btw my husband asked what kinds of whiskey do they have, the waitress seems clueless, had to check on her notes again and again, to give us 3 brands of whiskey. After ordering food, we sat there till 8:30, no food brings to us. We called the waitress and turned out she severed our appetizer to wrong table! Another 20 mins wait for apps. So from we sat till we got starter, we waited for over one hour! This is really unpleasant and unprofessional as an expensive restaurant. FYI, 2 glasses of shot whiskey cost over $50 after tax! There's no liquor menu, waitress didn't give us any information about the whiskey she offered. No surprise brought the most expensive one to us. I ordered fisherman stew which has a lot soup, boxed the leftovers. They put it in the solid food container, only 5 mins walk till we got home, the soup spilled all over everywhere!I had to say, the food there was delicious! But the service made everything meaningless.","What a great location.Was here in the summer and the corn on the cob and a bacon cheese burger made me return but this time was a disaster .Unfortunately not too many options on the menu, my guest ordered the Chicken Sandwich( disaster) the fries were coming out of the plate, octopus appetizer cooked and seasoned perfectly but just like the fries on the burger cover with some greasy salad, what a turned down.And way too expensive for what they serve","We are always looking for a great brunch spot especially on the island. We had heard of Surf and decided to try it out. When walking in it has a very industrial feel with high ceilings metal and piping exposed an outdoor patio, open kitchen and a private dining area upstairs.  It's very cool feel to this restaurant. We decided to stay in the restaurant because it was rather warm so we decided to get a hi top table by the bar.There are two options one with a wine option or with out.  It also comes with an app and entree.  The brunch also comes with bread, strawberry jam and butter. Which is a nice touch. After looking at the menu We decided on burrata with roasted peppers and Vietnamese chicken wings as an app.  The burrata was creamy and the peppers were rich and went well with the cheese although a small dish it was very good. The wings on the other hand were extremely unique and had some heat. They were super crunchy.  There was a larger portion to this order. For our main French toast with pecan butter and maple syrup and a burger with onion jam, egg a beautiful tomato and butter lettuce.   The French toast was a thick piece. it was lightly sweet and fluffy with a custard texture. The pecan butter was a beautiful touch. I also love the beautiful maple syrup.Lastly, the burger was beautifully cooked with a onion type jam a perfectly cooked egg and fresh sweet tomato and lettuce on a brioche bun. Accompanied by crunchy fries. We ordered the froze which was my first time having and I thought it was really delicious. It came with fresh frozen blackberries. Overall I thought brunch here was really nice. The food was delicious and fresh. Staff here is friendly, laid back and really accommodating.  The atmosphere is really great you almost feel like you are not on the island for the time you or at brunch/dinner.  I would def come back and try dinner There is a parking garage/valet ($10) (349)","Whoa ... that view! Awesome location.From their menu I had the short ribs which were delicious - though my friends ordered the chicken and it was a bit dry. Now, the side orders are a bit blah! Mine came with creamy corn which I thought was not a good choice to offer with ribs - maybe mixed veggies or even roasted potatoes or something less boring. My friends ordered the zucchini side and it was quite yummy. The thing with this place is that it is pricey and for that it needs a little more creativity with their food - but the location has an amazing view of the New York City and I think that's pretty much what their price is worth. The night we were there something must've happened with the chef/kitchen staff - side orders were delivered extremely late not only for our table but it seemed to be the same issue for two other tables around us - the place wasn't packed at all - it was a Tuesday night so I'm not sure what the issue was.Our waitress was phenomenal. Extremely attentive and apologetic for all issues.","Surf has the most beautiful outdoor seating.   The food is good.  The burger is very delicious at brunch.  We also enjoyed the wings, as they are very flavorful.  The tuna tartare is a little too full of lemon/lime juice.  The chef is very nice.  He comes to the table multiple times to check on the guests.  This is a major plus. Because of the above, I am conflicted and keep giving Surf another chance.  The issues I have with this place center around service.  I have been here twice; the waitresses we had were not very attentive.  I poured my own wine (the whole time).  We asked for ice for our wine and then had to keep asking for more.  It seemed like they were doing us a favor.  Secondly, the manager meeting us at the door to complain about our outside coffees is unnecessary when I am about to order a bottle of wine and we spent a small fortune on the meal.  It is unnecessary conflict and starts customers on the wrong foot.   I wouldn't have bothered addressing this, if it was my restaurant.  Additionally, the policy to order everything at once is a big turn off.  If there was a line waiting for tables, I could almost get my head around this but there isn't.  This policy should be changed immediately.  You are cheapening the place and the experience.  It makes the customer feel like you are rushing them before you even start.  This policy is small potatoes.  Finally, another huge positive is the live music at brunch.  The singer is very talented.  Definitely a draw.",Surf
82,I've been there a few times but am not a fan. On my recent vacation I met my sister there for lunch. I ordered a fish sandwich with fries.Nothing special for $13.95. Totally overpriced for a sandwich. I can get a full dinner anywhere for the same price. I really didn't look at the price when I ordered and didn't think it would cost that much. So my check with a beer and tip came to $21.45 for lunch.,Everything here is exceptional both the food and waiters. Both my wife and I go here every week.,"I ordered the veggie burger and it was gross! They charge extra for cheese but if it didnt have cheese it would fall apart! The ""burger"" had big chunks of peas and carrots,accompanied  with this earthly taste. It was gross!!! Just take it off the menu! Burgers should have more of a meat consistency, not a ""patty"" with chunks of peas and carrots falling apart. You're  better off just getting a side of veggies.","I feel like anyone who lives in the surrounding area has been to the ""Waiting Room"" at least once.This is a great place to come with friends and the atmosphere is extremely chill with a lot of diversity. The music is always really good and the food has never been bad. I usually stick to more of the basics, like wings, finger foods, and burgers/sandwiches. Definitely better than most bar food, but still not a place I would come to if my main priority was dinner. If you're lucky, they also have live music sometimes, which is a plus. If you're looking for good music and a relaxed environment, this is a cool place to come. Casual attire here, no need to dress to impress.","Initially the service started off efficient and friendly. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and looked delicious as you can see by the pic. My friend loved the Nachos with Chili and said they were the best ever. I wish I could have shared the same sentiments regarding the crab cake sliders. The Crab Cake sliders were very well seasoned had somewhat of a crab  flavor, yet tasted extremely processed and loaded with more filler than crab meat. I only ate 1/2 crab slider. By the end of my meal, my stomach ached like hell. Would I come back again? Absolutely, I've been here once before and it was okay, but there would be one huge change, I would never order the crab cake slider again! In addition it should have been taken off of the bill, but who I to think that customer service means something?","Once again my wife & I stopped into our favorite local go to spot, after each of us having had a long stressed day at work.  We started off with an alcoholic beverage, shortly thereafter ordered the buffalo hot wings.  I must say I've had my share of wings at many locations, but these wings are honestly the BEST I've had, and there's no doubt that their wing sauce and blue cheese contribute to that! Not ashamed to admit I've actually sipped on their wing sauce as I always get an extra side of it . The reason I felt compelled to write this review was because we both tried a dish that's on this month's special menu.   It's called THE SHRIMP ALA DONNA. No doubt about it, it's very likely the BEST dish we've enjoyed at The Waiting Room.  Talk about restaurant lvl quality!!! Kudos to the chef!!  Don't hesitate to order this wonderful meal if it's on the menu!!!I'm sure my wife and I will have it again before the month is over!!!Thank You WR!",The 'World Famous' Waiting Room
83,"Classic Staten Island restaurant in the famous Clove Lake Park. All season dinning room on the water as well as seating inside the historic Stone house. Valet parking available, seating outside on the lake. Various menus available for all events planning and a full service bar.  Brunch available on weekends followed by a stroll in the park.","Came here for a graduation celebration, the location of the restaurant was beautiful. Unfortunately the food and service was bad. I ordered the crab cake, mussels, and seared salmon. All of the dishes were lack luster in flavor and the salmon was very dry. When I made a comment about the salmon the only response I received was ""Oh, okay"". The staff did not seem enthusiastic to be there as their faces were dressed in despair. I feel like this restaurant has potential if the staff and interior was more inviting to consumers. A piece of advice for the staff, ""You are there for the costumers, they are not here for you"".","I went here for a wedding and it was just okay. The view was lovely but the seating area is cramped. There was barely any room for dancing. The service wasn't the best. For example, when I received my salad, I saw that it had something on it that I'm allergic to. I asked for one without that item and when they brought it out to me, it was still on there. The food itself was just so so anyway.There's only one small bathroom for everyone, whether you're at the restaurant or there for an event, like I was. And that leads me to my main issue with this place. At the end of the evening, I went to the bathroom before leaving and slipped on the wet floor outside the bathrooms by the bar. I fell on the ground and hurt my knee enough to bleed. The workers just stared at me and went about their tasks with a few of them actually laughing. No one asked me if I was all right or even approached me.Needless to say, I shall never return.",First time here & wish we would of come here before....food ...view ..atmosphere ...service...everything was excellent...on point ...just a real nice place to sit & enjoy a meal will be back,"Used to be very good. Last few times I've been there it hasn't been that good. Its so inconsistent. And the wait staff just isn't what it should be. Recently went for snacks and drinks Sunday afternoon. Oyster Rockefeller - 1 was bad and when we tried to tell waiter it was rotten he ignored us and walked away. No attempt to fix it or apologize. Truffle fries - not on menu but ask. SSoggy. Such a shame. Seared tuna. Ok but comes w a pile of guacamole that's bland and only like 2 fried won tons. How do you expect me to eat the guacamole? W a fork? Asked for more and only gave us like 5 more. Coconut mule. Was good but the waiter went on and on about how I can't make it at home. They make their own special syrup etc. Ok. Relax. Few Beers. Served 2'nd beer w/o glass. Give me a clean glass please. The most annoying thing was the waiter who was absent and didn't seem happy we didn't order more. He kept saying that's it. What about entrees. And then didn't bother to pay attention to us. We spend like $80-90. It was mid day Sunday. Doesn't matter what you order, you should be treated well. I wouldn't keep coming here after this visit.","This place has solid potential, I booked back in Nov '18 for my husband's birthday dinner. It was midweek and we arrived late due to work holding us back. I specified that it was a special occasion dinner when making the reservation. They sat us facing a wall. There were tables by the fireplace and tables by the water. Nope, wall. Service was good from there and our dishes were cooked nicely and presented well. It was pretty late and obvious that they were closing. So we asked for the check. After we put down the credit card to pay a confused server ran out offering dessert for the birthday. We just wanted to go home. Again, potential was all there, but it just never quite translated to a good quality experience all the way through.",The Stone House at Clove Lakes
84,One of the worst local dining experiences I've ever had!  The waitress was appalling and rude. She was not helpful at all and had no idea what beers they offered or that they were out of burrata appetizer.  A total waste of time!!!,"I usually like this spot as a local because it's great home style Italian food. However, the service/quality was awful. It appeared they were more concerned and overwhelmed of a communion party than us. We waited 40 minutes for our entree. The appetizers were terrible, the burrata tasted gross. The steak was cooked completely wrong, the waitress wasn't even prepared knowing the day sides. She was totally late on our requests ie: napkins, we never even got our waters. After our apps she forgot to fire our food. Just overall the experience was terrible and unfortunately we did not leave a tip, and we told her the food was terrible and we weren't happy she didn't even call the owner or let someone know. So we could get accommodated like a different meal perhaps nothing. The issue is training and service. The food was eh. My steak was not medium rare. It was more medium well. And the other steak the same. Then again we waited 40 mins for it so no wonder it was cooked wrong. We are never coming again. And i won't be surprised to see this place closing soon","Ate before I came here so I wasn't too hungry, just got an appetizer and it rocked.  Also ate a lot of my friend's veggies because he wasn't taught the importance of a balanced diet.  Got buzzing on some auther kill swamped water IPA...... joe was a sweet heart and I recommend dis joint.... cheers!",I absolutely love this place. I walked in to the most adorable sight it seems the restaurant owner had his daughters at work with him today and it warmed my heart the most adorable and polite young ladies ever! One of them promptly brought us menus and asked if we wanted something to drink. It's clearly family own business and the family was amazing. I ordered a ceaser salad and my boyfriend ordered the spring salad which were both amazing. For our main course I got the rigatoni with shrimp and he had the Alfredo with shrimp both we're spectacular! Definitely will be trying here again and soon.,"We stumbled upon this gem when we were hungry in Staten Island. We wanted something quick, but still delicious. This place came up. We got the shrimp oregano pizza which was amazing, as well as a buffalo chicken pizza and fried calamari. It said personal pie so I thought it would be small... but it was actually pretty decently sized. 2 people, my big eating boyfriend and I could only finish the calamari, and 1/2 of each pie. If you're looking for an awesome spot, definitely check this spot out.","Great food and atmosphere. When available...have the Sunday Sauce.Service friendly, portions plentiful and perfect for family get togethers",Errigo's
85,"There's barely anyone here and takes more than 30 minutes to make a chicken panini. Make sure you place your order in head of time. Plan to wait 30 minutes later, they didn't even take my order!!! These waitress made me wait for an order they didn't even put in","Ordered through Grubhub today. Food is great, but as my coworker took a bite of her panini there was a huge piece of hard plastic that must've broken off of something. I contacted Grubhub in which they said they contacted the restaurant and that someone from the restaurant would call me regarding a cash refund...no one called me. Usually my coworkers and I's go-to spot, but may have to reconsider that.",Cash only? Seriously. It's 2019. I was about to stop in here with a large group for a late lunch but once we saw the sign we changed plans and went to cucina Fresca a couple doors down. Cash is inconvenient.  Charge a fee if you don't want to pay the processor fees.,"The food here is delicious!!  It was my First time here yesterday, and i ordered the burrata as an appetizer and was so good. they gave it with arugula, tomatoes and roasted peppers. It's pretty inside, our waitress was nice and the service was good. Not expensive either, will be returning.","Highly upset to give this rating as I was looking forward to eating here. HORRIBLE experience will not be returning and will recommend for others not to come here as well.Walk in- all the girls are surrounded by the register not paying attention, keep in mind we are the only customers in the entire restaurant.Our server (blondie who never gave her name) told us to sit anywhere we liked.Ordered a smoothie, they didn't have the right ingredients (no harm done I got a soda instead)Here's where things started to get frustrating..We wanted to know what the soup of the day was & had to keep staring towards the register in order to get someone's attention (specifically blondie because she was our server). After we ordered our food 2 more tables come in, then another man comes in.Still noo food. No one came over to let us know what was going on either.I'm not exaggerating when I say I was staring at every single server & they each made eye contact with me & continued talking like school girls at recess.After waiting an entire hour from the time we put our order in, and watched our server leave without saying a word to us, a new server came over (curly dark hair with glasses, nice & helpful at first).Brought over a Caesar salad and we had to re-give our order again. We only got fries, bruschetta which is cheese bread and tomatoes & a salad (I think they had to hand pick the veggies from the farm).I then asked our current server if she will be the one receiving the tip as I don't believe our previous server should get one penny from us. She explained that they pull tips, apologized and then proceeded to try to say that in shift change things get crazy.I wish I had a sign that read: I AM A SERVER.I know what happens in shift change, I don't care one bit about a shift change because when I do a shift change?? I go back to my table, introduce my new server, ask if the table needs anything and I reassure my table that their food is on the way. I let the server know I want the manager to be informed to which she made a face to all her coworkers by the register & they proceeded to giggle as if making a table wait and giving crappy service is a joke.It's a shame because the food was good, your staff however needs a huge improvement.& lastly, they comped our fries.. that's not what we wanted. We wanted to speak face to face to a manager who never came out and we wanted to address the fact that everyone else who came in after (also got bigger orders with meat and food that should take longer) got their food before we got ours, not because of ""shift change"" but because of the quality of service from employees.","Stopped in here for a nice lunch. Service was very friendly and attentive. I had the grilled eggplant, zucchini, mozz, roasted red peppers, and black olives with a fig glaze panini. It was so good. Hubby had the grilled chicken, bacon, and pepper jack panini. Nice to know there on Staten island now.",Panino Rustico - Staten Island
86,"This is by far the WORST Sushi place I have been to. After half a day doing indoor activities,  me and my friends needed to find a restaurant to munch at and we found Sapporo Sushi House through Yelp. What is worth wild here,-Clean bathroom (with lotion in the Women's bathroom)-Lovely renovation and decoration-Restaurant seems pretty clean (including a clean fish tank)Why 2 Stars? -Services (food) was terrible ~ Very lay back waitresses (Everything took forever, includes being seated, getting us a drink, placing our order, waiting for our food to even waiting for our credit cards to be charged)-Food was HORRIBLE.Upon entering the restaurant, we stood for 3 minutes or so and we were not approached and there was customers from the other side that was telling us to sit wherever. We were the fourth table that night so it was not busy at all. Even after being seated we were not ask what wanted to drink until 10 minutes after we were seated. There was mainly one waitress there and another one that didn't come out until later on but for four tables it is technique not busy. We waited at least 20 minutes before our bento boxes came out.Food wise: -The Salmon teriyaki was so dry and didn't have enough sauce-Beef teriyaki tasted like heated straight from the freezer (funny how they would even ask "" how your beef cooked""-Shrimp teriyaki was tasteless-Everything that was tempera was heavily breaded-Masago in the California roll had a weird tasteLuckily we were only order a bento box and none of their special rolls. We were planning to order more depending on the food quality. This is a Chinese own Sushi store which normally isn't as tasty as authentic Japanese sushi restaurants but in my option this was worst than homemade.",Ordered a miso soup and there was a HUGE ant in it. I told the waitress and she took the it back and didn't even apologize or take it off the bill. Absolutely disgusting,My favorite sushi place I always order for delivery until the delivery guy yelled at me demanding for a $20 tip meanwhile I live 4 minutes away and I do tip smhh,I think this place serves great sushi. The luncheon specials give you great value for the reasonable costs. The fish is fresh and delicious. I have gone to this restaurant for a number of years and it always serves quality food. Highly suggest that if you haven't visited Sapporo in Bulls Head - you should put it on your list.,"This place looks pretty when you come in. The waitress greeted us upon walking in and sat us at a table. The basic rolls were pretty cheap. And the special rolls were average price ($8-$13). Kani salad had more cucumber than Kani :( it was good though. The food didn't take too long, considering we were one of the only two tables there. The presentation was very pretty. I ordered the American Dream roll and the Spicy Kani crunch roll. They were both just okay. It tasted like everything wasn't so fresh. Like the shrimp in my American Dream roll was sort of cold and tasted like it was sitting out. I've definitely had better sushi. My mom got the Ichiban roll and the Peanut Avocado roll. She liked the ichiban roll better, said the peanut one was average. I probably wouldn't come back.","Came here for dinner Saturday night. The restaurant had a very nice decor. We got seated immediately and was given hot towels for our hands which was nice. We order 2 appetizers: shrimp tempura and a salmon pizza(usually its tuna but we requested salmon) the tempura was good lots of different veggies accompanied it. The salmon pizza was okay. The tortilla was used in place of the pizza dough and it was super crunch. There was a lack of flavor in my opinion. We then ordered the sushi boat. There was a lot of ""white"" fish. Overall i was a lil disappointed and wish there was more of a variety. I got the chicken udon soup for my son. The soup base was excellent but the chicken was a tad on the dry side.",Sapporo Sushi House
87,So freaking good- the crust is made so well on pizza.A must try is the the zucchini pizza!,Decided on a Sunday night to give door dash a go and ordered giove which use to be one of my favorite pizzerias on the island. The order comes after about an hour of waiting which is fine opened the box up to find that the pie of completely wrong. Called them up explained that the order was wrong nicely and they told me to drive down and they'll have a pie ready providing I return the pie that was delivered to my house. At first I was just going to leave it but my mouth was watering for that imported prosciutto. Pull up to giove the hostess snatched the pie out of my hands and the aggravated opener in the back slapped prosciutto on my ice cold pie I asked for a fresh pie he told me that this is a fresh pie. So much for giove the big B walking in was the icing on the cake!,"Ordered pizza from here and it was just alright. Definitely was not the best pizza I've ever had. I ordered a regular plain pie. The pizza looked blah, nothing special. The pie was still hot when I picked it up so I assumed it would be cheesy on top, but it wasn't. It looked like that hard cheese when it's been sitting out for a while. I also ordered 2 buffalo wings. When I think of buffalo wings.. I assume sauce all over the wings. I got the complete opposite.. not sure if this was their take on buffalo wings (extremely disappointing). All that was in there was the wings and the thinnest layer of buffalo sauce on the bottom. You can wipe it off with one finger! Buffalo wings has to be the easiest item to make on the menu!!! Most likely will find another place for pizza.","The review you've all been waiting for!  Let's do this.Celebrating my 200th YELP review by sharing my all time favorite pizza place, worthy of a special trip from far away lands (very exquisite pizza).I have been to many a pizzeria.  I was raised on pizza and in my house, takeout chains NOT pizza.  Of the many pies consumed across the country, world even, none hold a candle to my holy grail 'za.  They can try all they want, those other guys.  They can put tacos on pizza, ice cream cones, cheeseburgers even.   Let those guys do that and distract people so there's more tables here.  Pizzeria Giove is my hands down favorite spot for crispy, thin crust flavor packed pizza.What, you ask, Gina, separates Giove from the pack?  Brick oven white pizza with a superior quality of crust and cheese.  These unorthodox white pies have won awards in pizza competitions in Italy, Internationally and the US.  Imported ingredients reign supreme.Crust is allllways crispy on the bottom and thin.  It's magic.  You can watch them make pizza, but don't expect to learn any secrets.  Time honed family recipe, modernized by the sons of well known NY pizza makers.  But that crust. . . It's what pizza dreams are made of.  Crust is always dry (nothing worse than soggy pizza) and when you pick it up + fold it literally snaps in between your finger tips.  It's not quite a cracker crust because when you bite into it there is a chewy element.  Ultimate crust goals.Cheese.  Specially made stracciatella.  Made in house using an unconventional technique this is *the* creamiest most flavorful soft white cheese known to man kind.  It's insane.  The combination of the thin crisp crust and creamiest dreamiest cheese are memorably addictive.  I've asked friends to drive from Jersey City to Staten Island when the craving strikes.Toppings are bursting with flavor.  Always prepared freshly and with high quality raw ingredients.  The usual suspects like pancetta, arugula, Crimini mushrooms are joined by more unusual ones like bresaola, marinated cherry tomatoes and sopresatta.  The specific pies you must order (all white as this is their specialty):1. Variopinta.  The one that started it all.  This white pie beat Bobby Flay, drawing acclaim to Giove.  Thinly sliced zucchini, stracciatella, garlic and herb infused cheese and panchetta.  This one is addictive.2. Re.  What all pizza wants to be when it grows up.  Sopressata, stracciatella, soft garlic, sausage.  Complex, heady and satisfying.3. Parma.  Beneath a cozy blanket of Prosciutto di Parma arugula, creamy shavings of Parmigiano Reggiano + marinated cherry tomatoes are kept cozy.  This is a great summer time option.  No red sauce.Bonus - fried calamari.  These are crisp, lightly battered tender on the inside rings of joy.  In the Marinara sauce that accompanies you can actually taste sun ripened tomatoes and basil.Pro-Tip - I do think the traditional red pizza here is beyond better than any trendy city spot.  You will be shocked at how good it is in fact.  But definitely try a unique white pizza as these far exceed the ordinary.Inside, there are 10-15ish tables so I'd recommend making a reservation.  As for the bar situation, there isn't one but B/W/S are served.  Some decent wine bottles on the list FYI.I have dined with many pizza aficionado friends at this unassuming smallishfamily run Italian restaurant.  All come away raving and proclaiming about Pizza Giove.  Even the most jaded and pizza loving veterans.I'm giving my treasured secret all-time best pizza spot because the world is full of over marketed mediocre pizza.  Come here and I promise you'll look at pizza through a new lens.  Ciao!","One of the best pastas I had in my life! No matter where i travel, I always want gioves pasta !!!! Always on point","This pizza place is amazing. The food is always so tasty, I loooove the pizza. 20/10, I would recommend",Pizzeria Giove
88,"Here is a tip, don't yell at customers that actually liked your restaurant.. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and the lettuce had a wierd flavor to it. One of the managers I think comes back and basically yells at me saying it's fresh and a new order won't make a difference. Ok, no reason to raise your voice at me or get defensive. Truth is the food has been getting worse. Not coming back anymore.","It's fake Chinese food, and not even not good fake Chinese food at that. You can tell they make the pork and meats beforehand, leave it on the counter ready for order, then mix it around with some sauce before serving. If you like that sort of tough texture and non-authentic flavor, then go ahead. The dishes are nice, the prices are ok, but I wouldn't go again.It's not for people looking for real, authentic Chinese food.",They sucks. Ordered for delivery TomYum +$1.5 for shrimp.and what i got... small container of muddy water with one shrimp in it. Almost to non vegies in it; few onion slices floated by but still almost $6 for that.  Disappointed....,"My new fav Asian restaurant on Staten Island for sure.  I came in on a weekday, not many people there yet, it was an awkward time. The manager/owner? Is such a good woman, she spoke so kindly to me, (I have breast cancer I'm only 31). I've been back twice and they're so sweet, extremely accommodating & very helpful w/ explaining the menu. Me and my guy friend came back today, a tues, a few people here friendliest waitress ever, was giving a free appetizer. I used the Groupon for 2 for here it's a great deal! They have a lunch, 2 person dinner or 4 person dinner. They also have amazing ore-fixe deals. This place is certainly worth it. The food is the beat part, all so fresh, made to order REALLY. They take a few mins to make it but I'd rather wait then have pre made and pre fried foods!  It's not greasy, it's flavorful, fresh and a great pick for date night.","I can say with complete confidence that this is one of the best Asian restaurants on Staten Island if not in the New York City area. I had given a great review in 2014 when I first came to this restaurant and at that time it was under a different management. Though it has changed hands several times, and though my original review was outstanding I could never believe that they can outdo themselves, but they have. The decor is simple but sophisticated, the attention to detail from the service to the plate presentation is par-excellence. And now for the food, the reason why were all here; absolutely superb. The shrimp dumpling soup and the kani salad was a great introduction to the wondrous journey that would soon follow. The coconut shrimp was by far the best coconut shrimp I've ever had at any restaurant. The beef Royale as well as the calamari was a pleasure of tenderness that melts in your mouth. And the crispy beef was not only to die for but to be reborn. This chef is a Maestro and the entire dinner, for my girlfriend, my mother,  my godmother and myself, from soup to desert was a symphony orchestra of the highest esteem. The deserts were orgasmic and the price will have me coming again and again and again. I urge everyone to list this restaurant as a priority destination in the very near future.","I can say with complete confidence that this is one of the best Asian restaurants on Staten Island if not in the New York City area.

89,"Food is good, but the waiter/cashier is rude. I was asking him how much for a whole chicken, then he points at the menu, then I ask him does it come with anything? He said no, then he rudely point at he combo section of the menu and said "" just look at menu, I have an headache""...",I  just ate the worst Lomo saltado that I have ever had. The beef was tough and tasteleas and the rice was bland. What a shame. I am sooo easy to satisfy anf It's such an easy dish to make. The salsa music and decorations are nice but I will never eat there again. Yuck!,I ordered delivery. It was on time. Unfortunately  Lomo Saltado was so hard it went to garbage. Not sure if i order again  from there.,"My husband and I came here on a Friday afternoon. It wasn't at all busy. We ended up ordering the rotisserie chicken that came with salad, fries and our choice of a drink or soup. (The lunch special) I chose a drink and my husband chose to get the chicken soup as his side. The best part of our meal was that chicken soup and the fries. The fries tasted like yuca fries and they were so good. I'm guessing they use the same oil to fry the yuca as they do the fries because the fries have a distinct yuca flavor and they were so yummy. I would recommend getting the fries with the white sauce they have. Our meal came with two sauces. One was green and one was white. I personally liked the white sauce better because the green sauce had too much garlic for me. My chicken breast was a bit dry so the sauce really helped bring some flavor back into it. My husband was able to enjoy both sauces since they were dairy free. Nice! The atmosphere of the place was quiet and they played a track of some love songs from the 80's and 90's which just made it feel even more quiet. I think some lively music would make it feel less quiet when the place isn't packed with customers. I thought the restaurant was clean and well kept and the decoration was traditional with a modern twist.","Mmmmm Mmmmm good! If you haven't tried this place, you're missing out! Authentic, fresh, hot and delicious Peruvian food. You certainly get a bang for your buck here!","Seriously delicious ~ I got delivery ~ food came within a reasonable time frame, and was hot and packaged well Portions are fairly huge, and the food tastes incredible.  The 5.00 delivery fee is what keeps me from ordering very frequently. with taxes and tip- you end up paying at minimum about $10 extra in fees, which is just insane.  Not sure if it's just to my area (st George) or all over. They should just make a $20 minimum - at least then my money would be going toward more food and tipping the driver more, as opposed to fees that lead me to order way less and less frequently, because of how pricey it makes the order.  Regardless - You will not be disappointed if you order from them - the food is just so good and one of the best in the area.",Cuzco Peruvian Restaurant
90,I went today for lunch . The waitress was terrible . I got up twice to get my own soda and napkins cause she was nowhere to be found after she brought our food out . She didn't come n check once if we needed anything .  She only got a 5$ tip . Fuck that !,"I wish I could give them zero Star , But it won't allow me to. I ordered food from them received my food after one hour freezing cold with the order of bacon wrapped in the foil. Very unprofessional , The lack of professionalism In talking to customers. The food was resent to me also after an hour with the same conditions as before. So you cannot deliver food you shouldn't do it . Do yourself a favorfavor and stay away from this place.",Usually come for a quick bite in the middle of the night when I'm on my lunch break.Little pricy for a diner.Also a frozen burger nothing special.Can't go wrong with a cheese burger or breakfast keep it safe and simple !,"To this day, I still tell everyone about this place. The week I spent visiting New York City, I spent every night on Staten Island before returning to my hotel at the best diner I have ever been to. Mike's was the best service I had eating anywhere during this trip. The f**king BEST!I'll admit, Yelp wasn't a thing when I was there last but the memory has stuck with me and I regularly tell anyone traveling through the area that whether they stay on Staten Island, or in Manhattan, make sure they make a stop by Mike's Unicorn Diner. If you are staying in Manhattan you need to take the 30 minute (1 hour of ferry riding fun round-trip) Staten Island Ferry ride and head up Victory to Mike's.I have a terrible memory these days and I still remember the details from every excellent visit to the diner that week. We were there at all hours of the day and night that week. We had a server who was from Ohio, which at the time seemed weird that we kept running into people from Ohio when we traveled. Just get used to it. Ohioans are everywhere you want to go to get away. I get weird looks because of the unicorn part, but I tell them how worth it it is. Literally, the only outstanding food and service we had in or out of the city. Their menu was huge! If you were craving it they probably had an item for it. And we tried almost everything. Even the calamari. This was not a ""never eat anything you wouldn't order from a gas station"" type of deal. This food was delicious no matter what we ordered. In the city we paid way too much for lackluster and even bad food. We had to send plates back at some very well known restaurants for undercooked food that anyone would know should never have been. One place was so busy our server forgot we were even there to take our order so we left and went back to Mike's, the only 100% great service we had on our trip. If I return to the area, I will be back.","This is easily the best diner on the island, and is my go to place after a fun night out with my friends.  The service is almost always friendly and the food just hits the spot.  I think in the many years I've been going here I've only had 1 or 2 unpleasant experiences, but the staff is always willing to fix whatever the issue is!If you're craving diner food, make sure Mikes is in the name for the best diner food you can get.","Went there today with my son . We both ordered cheeseburger deluxe platters , one well done and one med well. They both came out RARE . Mine was so rare that the blood was soaked into the bottom part of the bun . It grossed me out , and being that our waitress was nowhere to be found after she brought our food out , I had to get up myself and bring my plate to the someone who could help me send it back. Luckily it was the manager . After that , our waitress brought out my food once cooked well done . She never returned again .. we had to use the same napkin we sat down with and she did not come and ask if we wanted refills . Her service completely sucked . It sucks  cause the food was good ! From now on , I'll go at night when the better waitstaff works. This lady shiela is always there late night and she's awesome . The day shift sticks ! I warned you ! Lol",Mike's Unicorn Diner
91,"My dad and I had the shawarma.  It was freshly made to order.  I expected tzatziki sauce inside but since this is my first time, I am not sure.  Anyway, we were given a white sauce on the side but, the shawarma seemed very dry.  Maybe the meat was old as I am not sure if it was sliced off the vertical spit.  The owner was indeed very attentive to our needs and I would give it a second shot another time.  The prices were fine.","I came in at around 2pm on a Wednesday, enticed by the 5-star Yelp average, craving a shawarma. My experience, for whatever reason, was radically different from those of the previous reviewers. There appeared to be one customer in the place, and one customer speaking to what appeared to be the only employee. I stood in front of the talking pair for two or three minutes. The employee never even acknowledged me.Finally, the apparent ""other customer"" finished his sandwich and approached me, asking me what I wanted.I ordered a shawarma on pita. It said ""comes with lettuce and tomato, other toppings extra."" This turned out to mean exactly what it said: no tahini, no nothing: just a sad-looking sandwich with lettuce and tomato, wrapped in a supermarket-variety pita.The shawarma was very dry, bland, and--astonishingly--needed salt. I asked for a little bit of hummus to flavor the sandwich, which they gave me at no charge. The hummus was bland and thin.As I write this, around four hours later, my stomach is not feeling happy at all, and neither am I.",,"The food is fresh! Everything is made fresh!The owner is so friendly. If he's not busy, he will offer his hospitality and share what his culture represents. Give you taste of a food and explains it. Such a nice guy! The hummus and baba ghanoush is delicious!Baklava is the best I ever had. It's sweet and overloaded with almond flavored. We usually order a salad with chicken shish kebab or Shawarma and falafel, it's a taste of home in Lebanese. Tahini sauce is smooth and light tasting sauce. The prices are a lil pricey but it's so worth it. For a treat, you cannot pass it up!I will be back for more!","Ordered a bunch of food for delivery and threw most of it out sadly. The Kafta was so dry, literally zero fat, that it was like chewing gum. Kafta needs a little fat for flavor. We had both the beef and chicken shawarma, the chicken was palatable but the beef was super super dry, inedible.  The salads were so so, for delivery it would be nice to leave the dressing on the side, by the time it got to us it was complexity wilted. The Baba Ganoush was not touched again by any of my guests after the first bite. It literally smelled and tasted like burnt food. I know that it's fire roasted or oven roasted but it was bitter and burnt, awful. Due to the meat not being good, the rest just sat there..was so excited to eat my favorite food from childhood, I LOVE middle eastern food but this was just off big time! Sad indeed._________________So I am replying to the comments of the owner after my review, which he found to be an unfair attack.  Let me clarify for you a few things:1. I have never eaten baba ganoush from a can, I have, in-fact, had it in the middle-east on many occasions, and I have eaten it at my friends homes in Michigan, who are Lebasnes.  I fully respect and understand that the baba was fire roasted, as it should be, but this baba was burned and bitter. This was not just my opinion, this was the opinion of every single person (6) other than my husband, who ate it.2. I do not need to tell you how far I am located from you, if you feel that a certain distance from you is ""too far"" then you need to tell Seamless or Grub Hub that you will not deliver to it.  There is also GPS mapping, you could have checked.  I order middle eastern food all the time, in fact, I order mainly from Brooklyn, which my husband goes to pick up, so round trip it's about an hour.  The meat is ALWAYS juicy, even if I re-heat it, there is enough fat and texture to keep the meat palatable.  Your meat, ALL OF IT, including the kefta, chicken and beef, were bone dry.  Again, this was not only my opinion but the opinion of every person at my table.  We have ordered these types of items from Chinar on the Island and Nargis from Brooklyn, your meat did not hold a candle to these places.3. The fava beans dish was unremarkable, left on the table.4. Lebni was very good, will give you that.5. Bread, even if traditional middle eastern bread, was served inside a plastic bag, from its original packaging.6. I do not need to tell you to put dressing on the side, logic would dictate that if you know you are delivering a long distance away, put the dressing on the side so as not make the salads soggy.7. Requested all the rice to be in one container, received 6 containers of rice.My review is fair, regardless of what you say.  I am not trying to ruin or hurt your business but the food overall, was awful.  IF the meat was at least tender and juicy, things would have been reviewed differently. I know distance does not dry out meat, dry meat is dry meat.Wishing you luck in the future.Replying to owners comment about me trying to ruin his business..1. When I asked you to place the two shawarma plates in one container, it was not to ""make it look like"" I'm ordering more food than I was. Never in any of my reviews did I say that there was not enough food, I have no idea where you got that from.  The reason I asked to combine the meat in one tray was so it would be easier to serve, period. Just like I asked for the rice to be in one container but you never did that. 2. The falafel was dry and cold. 3. The tabouli was fine, nothing amazing and way to much parsley and not enough bulgar. 4. Please keep in mind that IF the meat was palatable there would have been plenty for everyone to eat. I spent over 200 bucks for this catering order.  Since most of the food was not editable, we didn't eat it and ordered sushi. I respectively disagree with you about my intentions. They are NOT to ruin anything, they are just my opinion of the food, mainly the meat. With so many choices for middle eastern food, I will go elsewhere.","I felt the food was fresh, well seasoned and extremely authentic. The babaganoush was amazing it tasted so fresh!! The shawarma and mixed grill platter was also super flavorful. I finished everything wanting more :). The owner is a sweetheart and makes everyone feel welcomed and genuinely cares about the quality and taste of his food. I will definitely be coming back!!",Mashawi Grill
92,"I write reviews very rarely, only if I really like or dislike a place. This was probably my worst experience with pizza. It's a shame that a good dough, is poorly accompanied by low quality ingredients. Mozzarella ? Looks more like Pollyo cheese strings, very salty and chewy. Pizza is overloaded with cheese and toppings, making it flavorless more than anything else. Sauce is salted and with the cheese string mozzarella.... you will need a lot of water at your table. Avoid mushroom pizza... flavorless as well, truffle oil ? In 2019 we still have people believe in truffle oil ? Chewy mushrooms, over cooked on pizza. Crostini ? Don't order them... save yourself 12$","Is the pizza supposed to be burnt?The restaurant was nice, but the pizza was VERY burnt - the bottom was completely black. We paid over $21 for it but it tastes like burnt toast. Very unfortunate!","Called yesterday to make a reservation and when we got there the manager explained ""we don't make reservations. We write your name down and do the best we can."" Totally unclear and unprofessional. 8 people will never come back. Not accommodating at all. Also 1/2 the group are industry owners and professionals. Terrible example of someone who may put out a good product and forgets about the point of hospitality.","I would just like to start by saying congratulations to the team at Seppe, they nailed it! We were in there last week with 4 family members and Sal (which seems to be one of the owners) was most gracious in taking his time to explain the menu and the process. The place itself is beautifully done with its vintage bistro inspired look and modern details. Now for the important stuff, we ordered 3 pizzas (rectangle) the prosciutto honey, the also the pepperoni with fresh jalapeño and a margarita.  Right off the bat you can tell they were made with premium products. The crust has a nice crisp and charred taste. The sauce was simple and tasted like sauce should taste. Like tomato, not over spiced. We also had the wings and calamari and they were on point. I had 2 special cocktails and they too blew me away. So I'm not sure some of the reviews that were left were about but this place is fantastic! Thanks Sal & crew! We'll be back!","We used to come here for pizza time to time as we live in URBY. But this night we went there, after we almost finished pizza the cockroach ran in front of me and my two friends right on the counter by the plate. And when I pointed it to the bartender (or whoever it was) he killed it. And it would be fine if he would just joke around and be nice to us but he started to pretend like we didn't see anything and that it was just a spider and like we have some problems But tbh, they have really nice pizzaThe only thing that sometimes probably you can find extra protein in it","There is no direction when walking in, stand by the door looking dumb till one of the waitress seat you.The food is good BUT THE WAIT STAFF SUCKS. I have had better service at a diner. Good luck waiting on your waitress, shes too busy talking to the other waitress about nonsense while my whole party stares hoping to eventually snap her back to reality and bring us the check cause we are dying to leave this crowded, loud little pizza place. I have been here 4 times and 4 times I am stuck with terrible service.At least the food is good. My waitress spilled my calamari all over my table then used her hands to place it back into the bowl. Granted she replaced the bowl 15 min later. Dont show up too hungry now, the wait for your food is a while. No bread, no nothing while you wait.Please train your passive aggressive waitress' to care. Once Vice opens up watch your customer numbers drop. I will spread the word on my experiences here.3 stars is for the food, 0 stars for the crap service.",Seppe Pizza Bar
93,"Nice and quiet atmosphere. The service was friendly but it took forever to get our food served and the place wasn't that busy. Too slow!!!!I personally liked my steak; a quality cut and cooked medium and juicy as requested. But the rest of the family absolutely hated their choices. My wife and  son got their food from the New Orleans Cajun seasonal menu. A chicken glazed sandwich and a Po' boy sandwich. The bread was not fresh ( the bread in a  Po' boy must to be crunchy and fresh it makes the sandwich ) and the shrimp and chicken were drenched in their respective sauces. It is like they just dump a tone of sauce in a bowl, move it around to be served in a crappy old soggy bread.I am giving the 3 stars because my T-Bone steak was really good and their salad bar was pretty satisfying too. If you go to this restaurant stick to the steak options. I should've known better.",I went out with my colleagues for lunch  for an hour and I was really disappointed. The waitress spoke with a slur which made me think that she may have been high off something she was extremely slow and was not accommodating. We  were at lunch so we only had an hour and it took about 45 minutes to get some burgers and fries.  She kept coming over asking if we needed something which became annoying.  We told her we needed  our food because it was only our lunch hour. The hamburgers were ok but I thought it would have been better as long as they took to make them.  Was not a happy camper at this place and  probably will not  be back.,"This place is terrible! I've been here several times because it's my brother in laws favorite place and every time I go I get the prime rib which taste brined, salty, ashy, not fresh and over salted. The service is slow and not on those game. I really hate coming here and the one in Plainfield is so much better! Even the salad bar is not kept well.",This is our first time at Charlie Brown's Steakhouse. Delicious food and a great environment! The host and our waitress were very pleasant. The prices are fair and portions are large. Will definitely come again !,Service was good but food is so so.. Salad bar had extremely wet lettuce... Had the meatloaf which was just ok. Went at about 4pm on a weekday... Quiet empty but could be relaxing.,"I dined in this past Sunday about 5:00 was pretty empty and we were seated right away. We ordered the artichoke heart appetizers in a lemon sauce very tasty.  My husband had the half rack of ribs with bbq chicken and garlic mashed potatoes he enjoyed it very much. My mother in law had the 8 oz steak with sweet potato fries also good. My daughter and I both had bacon cheeseburgers made just how we like them. While the food was very good the salad bar was rather less appealing. A little messy some things lacked flavor/sour taste. Now let me tell you how great our waitress was I explained to her it was my mother in laws 65th birthday and I had the number candles with me, we ordered the brownie sundae which was a good treat to share for a table of 4. Well when she gave us the check she said the desert was on her and wished my mother in law a great birthday  I would definitely return just wish the salad bar was better",Charlie Brown's Steakhouse
94,"I wanted to try beer garden but I will never eat there again. The driver who delivered the food was rude. I was sent a brown perogie wit burnt onions (not crispy) burnt. My kids ate none of their food, my little one had chicken fingers and fries that came cold, and a thin piece of chicken (80% breading). Wings were soggy and tasted old. The only thing that was right was a fried egg that's not good to get repeat customers.",I placed an order through grubhub and my estimated delivery time kept getting pushed back. At first it said 8:45pm (placed order at 8:04pm) then it said 9:15-9:25pm and then finally it said 9:45-10:05pm. I had to get a refund because that was just unacceptable.,"This is our second visit, the first didn't sit well. Today we received horrible  service. The waitress/bartender was rude and impatient and beyond disrespectful to myself and the others in my party. She was condescending and trite when taking our order. Needless to say, we did not stay.I'd like to think this was just her personality- however, she did not treat the other patrons in this manner(those who were of similar race).I don't like to play the race card, but this was earned. None of us will be returning. It's not worth it.","Drop by on a late Friday night. Not the best local bar i've walked into. But its nice, friendly. The crowd is range 20-40s. Compare to the other local bars in the area, its usually with a-lot of older people. Lots of beer selection. I start off with a gin and tonic. And he said 5 buck. Thats the moment I know this is the spot ill be around when i cant sleep. Lmfaooo! Tbh the drink is on the cheap side. Tastes cheap. But all good, cause they charge whats its worth which I appreciate it.Overall a very nice spot to have a drink and chill and just idk.. watch sport games?","Food was ok, can't really write home about it, it does get better with larger quantities of beer. Service was good many TVs for games. Will visit again if my cable goes out. Who needs food when we can eat beer. Keep on living","Bottom line: neighborhood bar spot under the cloak of ""beer garden."" Handful of beers doesn't really fit the selection we expected. Breakfast was good and cheap though. Gluten line: small menu filled with staples; pizza, burgers, and even mozzarella sticks. But it ends there. Long line: it's ok. Parking is very limited. They had some goodies on tap, but some of those marked on the wood pieces as seen in the picture weren't actually available, like La Chouffe. Service was reasonable. Breakfast was a good value. Tap beers were BOGO but served in small (I think 10oz) glasses so not really a savings. Crowd seemed mostly like locals, and we did get that ""you ain't from round here"" vibe. Didn't come expecting culinary masterpieces, but the gluten free menu only had real real basics on it. Won't be bringing wifey. Nothing really bad about the whole thing, just not very memorable. Would stop for a drink if in the area though.",The Beer Garden
95,"This thai restaurant is conveniently located near the staten island ferry. Also! They are open on Sunday afternoons, and even on lazy Sundays they will make pad see ew with beef. You can also order through yelp, which we did.Unfortunately, if you order pad thai without fish sauce they will call then hang up in an attempt to change your order. Finally, when you've gotten so hungry that you go in person to check on your order they say that they can't make you the pad thai. They also had conflicting results with yelp as to how to adjust your order that you are still unsure if it has resolved.The pad see ew was medium. The meat was kind of burnt.",Been waiting for decent Thai food on Staten Island. This place is not merely decent but amazing.We eat there frequently and also pick up large quantities of take out for our family.,Not happy with the lunch entree ordered. Thai rice was so small and the 2 rolls looked like cigarette sticks. Called the restaurant to discuss and they became argumentative NEVER AGAIN.,"Stumbled into this place one afternoon in search for something yummy for lunch. The restaurant is tucked behind Richmond terrace next to the court house, the food was surprisingly good. The drunken noodle is packed with flavor and just the right amount of spice and the service was very friendly! Nice to see more Asian cuisine coming to Staten Island.","I have been dining in, picking up and getting delivery from Thai at Chang Noi since they opened (_years ago?!)Food - consistly delicious.  I've tried almost everything and favs in each category are:App:  Curry puffs, Summer Roll, Duck Roll (I dont do duck anymore but when I did it was like confit duck on crack.  Finglerlicking good.)Salad - Papayan but can be a lil spicy, Mango is also yum.Soup- Tom Yum and Tom Ka Kai Main Noodle: Drunkin (Beef, Seafood, Veg all yumm!) , Pad Thai is more flavorful than anywhere else I've tried. Curry: Massaman is delish and subtle with spice, Penang when I want bolder flavor.  I just favor these but my friend have had others. Rice - Basil Fried (spicy-ish) and delicious.  Pineapple fried rice when I want l want lesa less spice. Sweets:Pumpkin Custard with Sticky Rice (nice ans isnt super sweet)Fried Banana with ice cream Service: This is something they worked on for dine in experience ans its been improving (which is us great now that they're expanding.) I want to be fair and take a half star off for this.  And Thai Iced Tea Always an indulgence. Just got another delivery tonight, arrived in 20 mins and was yummy as usual. Give it a try.",Environment is simple but food and service is great!!          Sever is super friendly and is willing to help anytime.     I got no complain for this restaurant. Everything is super amazing including food and service. I and my friend both loved this spot. We will definitely come visit this place again when I come to staten Island .,Chang Noi Thai
96,"If I could give it -5 stars I would , ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING !! Not close to Mexican food 1. Chips and salsa lacked any type of flavor the salsa tasted like can open tomato sauce from the supermarket 2. The chicken wings were WAYYYYY too seasoned they dumped a bunch if powder of seasoning onto the wings which made me choke 3. Now onto the carnitas tacos the meat tasted like old meat from 2 weeks ago and had no flavor at all or no sauce they use the same type of sauce for every entree4. The blackened chicken quesadilla was the only the food that me and my bf ate which was the size of my hand , we ended up eating across the street at bayou restaurant 5. The horchata tasted like water with sugar6. The chef was on the floor while we were waiting on our food for an hour.7. The waiter was polite but there was only one waiter running the floor This place is way too over hyped and over priced , DISAPPOINTED never coming back I did end up throwing up after eating the quesadilla and bite of the carnitas , save your money or go at your own risk , there is way better mexican restaurants out there such as Mad Dogs in the city .",My friend went to this restaurant on a date and her boyfriend found a dead roach in the fajitas. They ended up giving the meal for free but there's obviously a pest problem here. DISGUSTING! Will not be eating there. Ever.,I enjoyed the food where they fall short is attitude the waiter disappeared i had to ask someone to get the waiter. Im all for space but when im waiting for the waiter and look around and hes not anywhere thats an issue 5 mins ok but not the case he was ghost for most of the time. It was really hot on the 2nd floor and one of the waiters looked like he didnt want to be there not friendly at all if i asked him something we got that leave me alone look. Food was good other than that,"Surfing through yelp to find a new taco spot on a Tuesday night, naturally.Came across this awesome little place and deceived to check it out after reading reviews!Did not disappoint! Top 3 taco spots on the island hands down.As seen in pictures not only did the food LOOK good but it was delicious as well. BIG fan of empanadas and Sofia's has the best ones in my opinion. Atmosphere was also very fun with a Mexican romance to it, perfect for taco eating, guilt free.Will be back for sure.","Ok so disclaimer: I only had drinks and guac, so if you want to read about tacos this won't help!I went to this place during lunch to grab some drinks and some chips and guac. I heard so many great things about it and it's relatively close to my neighborhood. It is super cute and decorated really well! We opted to sit outside because it was super nice out, and I'm so happy we did! The outside is really quaint, with lots of colors, plants, and unique decorations.I ordered the spicy mango sangria while my mom ordered the guava margarita. We also got an order of their ""secret"" guac. And wow was everything great! The spicy mango sangria had a slight kick at the end, and the mango is fresh puree which is such a difference compared to concentrate. I did try some of the guava marg and it was also delicious! The guac was the star though, with the perfect amount of chunky avocado, spices, tomatoes, and salt.The staff was also really attentive and friendly, always smiling and checking in on us to make sure we were comfortable. Of course I will come back for tacos because this was a great first impression!","Random taco craving decided to stop in here... The atmosphere feels Mexican like I was in Mexico on vacation from the front door to the bathroom . There is patio in the back u can dine at but a thunderstorm was on its way so we opted to stay inside. My sister ordered blackened chicken quesadillas I ordered carne asada tacos (3) and a strawberry white sangria. So the presentation was amazing made me want to eat the food BUT (of course there's a but) the food flavor wise was missing something salt ,lime  something. The drink I ordered when they got it right was good but for me the food was just below average .. A lot of their alcoholic drinks have something spicy in them which for me is not enjoyable.",Sofia's Taqueria
97,"New management is definately having a hard time transitioning to an all-you-can-eat restaurant.  The plates came out fairly slow and the pieces are very large (normally a good thing, right? But wait for it....) I left 6 pieces on my plate because of the unexpectedly sizes of the rolls. Therefore, I got charged the 10 dollar ""wasteful evil person"" penalty.  (First time I ever experienced this!).Anyway, I would have returned as a much less wasteful customer if I was not subjected to a manager's interrogation about their policy.  Hell, I didn't even put up a fight over it.  I think she just enjoys scolding people to make a point to others.  The sushi is actually very good, but you can find very good sushi and avoid the real possibility of being emotionally abused while dining out easily enough. Go at your own risk.  Live long and prosper, Sushi police women.","I dont usually post but I had to this time. Do not eat here. I ordered food and was sent brown tuna, salty sushi rice, and rock hard avocado. Any place that sends out food like that doesnt care about their customers.","Each member of my family ordered the Lion King roll which was our favorite. This time the shrimp tempura was, cold and stale. It was so bad I spit it out instantly. I brought it to the attention of the waitress. The waitress and manager had the audacity to say that it's impossible for it to be stale, it's made fresh each time.I've never even had tempura this cold and stale in my life including delivery! So we simply asked to order something else instead, (which is already an inconvenience since this was our favorite thing to get!) The waitress just walked away instead of taking our new order, we already had waited so long to get her attention in the first place. She came back and said that she talked to the manager and instead of being apologetic for the terrible food and service she said she'll take it back but said ""next time don't order chicken or shrimp tempura then, so we don't waste food""There won't be a next time because after going here regularly for the past 10 years, since it was called Mitoushi Sushi, I will never be coming back.",One of the best AYCE sushi I've had. It is a bit pricier per person than other places but the quality great! They don't skimp down on the food just because it's ayce. They also have regular sushi if you don't feel like you're big eater.,"One of my favorite sushi spots. They have all you can eat now which is great! But make sure you don't over order, because there is a charge for uneaten food. Food is always fresh, and delicious. Highly recommend! Great for night out or date night!","If you want quick and delicious sushi this is the place. I was coming here before the name was changed to Sanma, not much is different besides the name. My favorite is the sushi appetizer pizza. I usually get a spicy shrimp roll here, they make it like no one else I've ever tried. I highly recommend this place not expensive but very good and fast service.",Sanma Japanese Restaurant
98,I have tried Indian food before and I know how it should taste as it is one of my favorite cuisines to eat. The food here is tasteless and bland. I was excited to order from them but surely was disappointed when I tried the food. Everything I ordered barely had any real taste. I was very unhappy and will not be coming back.,This pace is awsome had tikka misala and the spicy lamb and was awsome will order here again,"We placed a dinner order for pickup: chicken tikka, tandoori mix grill, nan, garlic nan. $40 worth of food was borderline un-consumable. Tikka sauce had no resemblance to Indian food, it was more tomato Italian. Mix grill meats and veggies tasted worse then they looked. Our family tried Indian food in all NYC boroughs and this was the worst by far. Nan was the only saving grace. Garlic version was less tasty and not worth the extra $.",I've been here twice already in 2 weeks starting 2 weeks ago! The food is amazing! Chicken tikka massala is phenonmenol... sometimes I lick the plate cause the sauce is so good. And please try the onion fritter and the fish pakora.Holy tastebuds batman! I dont think you will be disappointed!,The food is absolutely delicious! I use Door Dash delivery service to get my food delivered and I've never been disappointed. The food arrives hot and in a timely manner. My favorite dish is the Drunken noodles. I've recommend this place to a few of my friends and they like it just as much as I do..,Really good Indian food. Quality is decent. If dining in the papad is always cold so don't bother asking for a warm basket but overall quality of food is good. The plain lassi is amazing though and if you want dessert DEFINITELY get the kulfi it's amazing,Taste of India II

And this time.... it took forever to bring our food! I told my husband... never again,"This would be a zero if possible.  Let me first say, we didnt even eat here, we came for $100 worth of gift certificates for family members.  We arrived at the front desk and were told ""only the manager could give these to us"", fair enough.  But then 5-10 minutes pass and its getting awkward.  A very angry looking manager then comes stomping out from the restaurant floor.  He immediately demands ID from my wife without any greeting.  Ok, maybe there's fraud at this chain, whatever, but so rude?  He said it like it was an accusation and then stared at the ID and stared at my wife intently.  It felt like we were getting checked into a police station instead of buying gift cards.  Then he took her credit card rudely and ran it and stared at the receipt and card intently comparing them.  The regular cashiers could obviously tell how rude he was being and awkwardly looked down.  This is the point where someone says ""he's doing his job"".  Sure, but after the wait and hassle once the card went through, he turned his back without saying a word and walked away.  No ""thank you"" for spending $100?  No ""sorry for the wait"".  We all have tough jobs, but there is no reason to be THAT rude to paying customers.  If a regular employee had done this I wouldnt have gone thru with a bad review.  I rarely give bad reviews.  But this is a MANAGER.  Never going to eat here for any reason now.","Dave and busters is actually a fun place to hang out with friends or family. Problem is their food sucks. The waiting service is horrible. Takes 45mim for someone to get your order. When they do take your order you have to wait another 30-40 min for them to come back to get a refill. It's not the waiters fault that Dave and busters have 1-2 waiters serving 10+ tables. The games are fun. I had a issue with one of the games that had close doors.  I think a bedbug bit me. As soon as I got home I threw all the clothes in the dryer just to be safe. Some games do not work so you have to speak to customer service to fix the issue or give you a refund. Their Groupon deal is pretty good. You get two all day cards for less than 25$. If you have the student 25% off deal you get it for 18$ Anyways, I do recommend Dave and busterZ I just wont eat there and be cautious with the games. I honestly do believe there was a bedbug that bit me.","Me and my husband decided to take our nephew to Dave & Buster's. It's a pretty big space,  reminds me of an Atlantic City of games. The cool thing is not only kids are having fun, the adults are too so awesome. We didn't eat here so I can't comment on the food. The girl in the front was helpful and explained how the card works. We were playing games for 1.5 hours, all had so much fun! At the end we decided to try the virtual reality ride which is an extra $6 pp (picked. MIB). It was pretty cool and worth to experience it.I would definitely come back for the games maybe try the food and have a drink next time.",Place is so great for when you want to play with grandkids and let the guys watch foot ball.

Can't believe what a great time we had tonight.,Dave & Buster's
100,Came here for breakfast when we were in town for a funeral. No issue seating a walk in party of 12 right away on a Tuesday morning. Food was all pretty standard diner fare. All decent but nothing spectacular. Biggest issue we had was the service was very slow. Seemed to take a lot longer to come out than it should have. We were there for nearly an hour. Especially odd was two people in our group had gotten oatmeal which was brought out 15 minutes before the rest of the breakfasts.,"The diner has a nice big sign saying open 24 hours. And it is displayed online as 24 hours. So I was on my way to work and it was 4:30am and I called to put an order in and no answer. So I ended up driving there. Got out of my car, walked to open the door and it was locked. The guy cleaning just looked at me and the lady working looked at me and tried to quickly duck and hide behind the counter as if we didn't make eye contact and she didn't know I was there. I'm not even mad because I still got my food. I just felt disrespected for her to hide from me like that after I drove there and got out of the car. Why hire workers if they can't give you business while being open. So I had to get in my car and go to mikes diner. Was putting a big order in for my co workers. So mikes unicorn diner will now by my go to which is 1 minute away. Thank you z one","We all ordered our food for dinner, except mine never arrived. I picked at my wife's food and really lost my appetite. The waitress never came around or even walked past our table while she had only a few other tables in her section. She finally came by after everyone finished eating. I told her my dinner never came out and she said you should have told me when I walked by. Instead of fighting with her and telling her that you never walked by our table, otherwise we obviously would have said something since everyone had their dinner already. On top of that the food isn't that great.",I've always come here for breakfast or lunch. I really enjoy their breakfast and love their salads and wraps. There is a bar area that I've been to a few times. No complaints. Service is good also.,"Been here a few times for breakfast and lunch. So far every experience has been good.

101,"Delicious thin crust pizza. Place is small, but spotless. Friendly staff, try the round slice with the basil on top.  Looking forward to trying the food ( sadly, no veal parmigiana on the menu). Four stars instead of five, because I think the slices could use a smidgen more cheese.","Undoubtedly the BEST PIZZA ON STATEN ISLAND. Whether it's the regular pie, white pie, vodka pie, or their signature round pie, there is no better option than this place. I could go into detail about each of these pies to explain how good they are but instead I'd advise for whoever's reading to drop whatever it is you're doing, whether you're at work, at the gym, driving to the airport or going to grandmas and reroute your gps to round pie for you to experience this place for yourself.","I've been in SI for a little over a year and have been searching for my go to pizza place. I haven't found it until tonight! I'm a huge fan of thin crust and this met my expectations. I was expecting soggy crust, but it was crispy. We had ordered online- 3 cheese slice, 1 margherita slice, French fries (crispy!) and salad. Will be coming here again!","I'm a sucker for some hype. Originally went when they first open to try out the pizza. You need to know what you're in for. It's not typical. It's thin crust. I tried slices of round pie special and plain. Both good but found the plain much more flavorful.  Since I've tried a few other specialty slices which were all good but still think plain takes the cake.  However many slices you can normally eat, plan to double it.  Stromboli was a bit thin for my taste but flavorful, no deduction just a preference.But that's not why I'm here. Pizza joints are only as good as their chicken parm. Sorry, not sorry.  I picked this little gem up for lunch. First up, the bread. I've had this at every place on strip. Luigi's tries decently. Round pie bread is fresh, soft inside and crispy on outside. The sauce is just right taste and they didn't smother it.  The star...the chicken. First bite you know this wasn't reheated like all the other places nearby. It was crisp, flavorful and fresh.  Hands down best chicken parm hero in area. Well done!",This is one of the absolute best pizza stores on staten island today while only open for about 1 year they have figured out how to make people happy They have several different types of pizza My favorite is the ARUGULA salad slice But they are all delicious  They dont deliver but they are central located in staten island,"So much better than Pronto. Even though they are related, the food stands on its own. The ingredients in the pizza are fresh. Their wraps are great, such as chicken Parmesan vodka. Their pastas are great as well, such as baked ziti vodka. Garlic knots are killer. Only issue is that their pizzas don't travel well. If you pick up, they get cold quickly, because they are so thin. Might have to reheat if you live more than mile away.",Round Pie Pizza Company
102,I'm not big on writing reviews because my hands are usually busy doing things like eating. Today I'll make an exception because I've been sitting here for over an hour wondering if I'll ever eat again. Stay tuned for the rest of the review about the food. Should I not continue the review it means I unfortunetly died of starvation.,"Now I've frequented this Chili's location several times. My only gripe ever was the service is slow especially on a Sunday until today. My boyfriend & I was seated in the bar area, had a server named Hamze that appeared to be new but he was trying. We ordered honey chipotle chicken crispers for our entree & my boyfriends had a hair in it. Being that he is bald & I have a head wrap on, it's not neither on of us so we tell Hamze & he takes the food back to kitchen, comes back and ask should he place another order or have his manager remove it. Not one apology left his mouth but maybe he didn't get the customer service training. We tell him put in another order. What was baffling is that the general manager Anthony Acampora never stepped out to extend an apology. Makes sense why Hamze didn't know it's better to offer an apology. Comping a meal would've been nice but an apology is all that was truly needed. Now he may of been busy but I would hate to think race is why Anthony Acampora could not take 30 seconds to apologize. Please check your food when you visit this location.","This Chili's is okay. The food is usually on point but the service is usually not the greatest, and is extremely slow. I went there yesterday around 8. We ordered drinks and 2 appetizers and we didn't leave until after 10 because we were trying to hunt our waitress down the entire time. She only checked in once, and we had to ask a different waitress to help us out because ours was visiting every other table, just not ours.","I've been going here for a while, but I recently went here while having to follow some annoying dietary restrictions.  When I asked the waitress about removing an ingredient from my meal, not only did she happily say that could be done, but she provided me with other items I could add or replace to avoid the ingredients I couldn't eat.  When I went in I was really nervous about being inconvenient or annoying because of what I couldn't eat, but the waitress was incredibly friendly and helpful! And the food tasted great which is always important!",Not bad for a chain restaurant .Service was good and the food was not bad.Not like Applebee's /tgif/outback that have gone downhill in the past few years .We would probably return for a quick bite,"My boyfriend and I decided to go to Chili's since he had never been. We came at the right time because they had $5 margaritas which were absolutely delicious. We both had the strawberry  lemonade margarita which was sweet and tasty. I love the sweet brown sugar around the top of the  glass which made it even more attractive looking. The hostess and waiter were very nice and the atmosphere was great. It was a Sunday afternoon so it was not that crowded and loud. We order the triple appetizer which consisted of cheese burger sliders, boneless buffalo and honey crispers, with some egg rolls. It came on time and all was fresh delicious and tasty. Once the main course came we were stuffed. I had food to take for lunch the next day. This was probably my third time going to Chillis and I'm never disappointed. I will be back.",Chili's
103,"If you want uncooked food for high prices with a nasty staff and broken furniture, this is the place for you ! The 99cent sauce, chicken parm with cold cheese, and steaks that are so uncooked they try to run away from the plate when served highlighted this awful dinner. Make sure to ask for  Frank the ""partner"" (the guy who is drenched with sweat) of the restaurant for some extra unprofessional and rude service. Don't be fooled, this place use to be great under the old owners, but the new owners absolutely ruined this once great establishment, and I'm actually impressed how quickly they've done so. Avoid at all costs, there is so much better Italian food on Staten Island.",Last night was my first night there it was a birthday party we were a table of 12 I could express to anyone more that the service was absolutely horrible our waiter was absolutely nonexistent never came back to see if you wanted more drinks we had trouble getting silverware and plates never offered dessert menu never offered coffee took an hour and a half to get appetizers and our entrées came out sporadically when going into complain they were too busy eating behind the counter worst part is table of 12 to gratuity is added clearly they need to change I would recommend anyone not to go there there are plenty of places to eat on Staten Island this is not one of them the food was OK but the service was absolutely horrible I could not believe it I was so taken back Do not do not waste your money what a disappointment,"Awful! Awful service, awful food, awful empathetic attitude by everyone working there.Seated at a large table that hadn't been swept underneath all day.Ordered pizza as an appetizer - one was burnt and the other substandard. Couldn't get the server's attention even though 1/2 of the time, they were standing around.I asked for an additional plate so my elderly aunt could try some of our food, as she just wanted pizza. Plate never came.Entrees took over a half an hour to come out.  Pollo Martini was just ok and my husband's eggplant parmigiana had very little cheese. Server only came over when I had eaten half of my food and pushed it away.When we placed our entree order, I also placed an order for a chicken parmigiana to go. When our food came, I asked the server if she had put in the chicken to go order and she said she had. Forty minutes later, I paid the bill and asked for the to go order and was told it wasn't made yet because the kitchen was backed up! Owner needs to know how his restaurant is going downhill. This is the third time I've been there; the other times were great. This, unfortunately, made such a poor impression that I won't be back. There are too many other places to eat.","This place has it all. Great food, great service, and great ambiance. I highly recommend the sweet and spicy fried calamari. 5 Stars!Besides dining there, we used them to cater an event and they hit out of the park. They were very helpful with choosing the menu, showed up on time, helped us set up, and the guests just loved their food. Don't leave here with ordering the homemade cheese cake  for dessert...","This was probably our 10th or 12th time visiting Capizzi and have always been very happy with the service and our meals. Unfortunately, tonight was a very different story. Typically I would chalk it up to it being an off night, but too much transpired during our visit this time. First we started with wine and appetizers. My husband shared that his wine (merlot) tasted much different than usual and somewhat watered down. The calamari was good but not as crunchy as usual. My arugula, apple, walnut and goat cheese salad was ok but was overpowered by balsamic vinegar. When our main course came out- eggplant parm and their special spaghetti for the evening, I first noticed the very small plate my spaghetti was in. Very little room in the bowl to toss the pasta let alone get my fork in it without it falling all over the table. When I tasted the dish, there was barely any olive oil on it that it tasted plain and very dry. It was practically inedible (so much so the server noticed and removed it from the bill bc I barely touched it) Next, my husband went to cut into his eggplant parm and noticed there was a huge piece of plastic on top of it. The server apologized and made my husband a new dish. No one came back to make sure it was ok after that, no manager came by to apologize- nothing. This dish although plastic free was unimpressive. We were floored and needless to say extremely disappointed. Unfortunately, this will be our last visit to what we considered our date night spot.","Today my husband came in to try dessert after our dinner on the beach at great kills park. We sat outside that was very nice since it was just a lovely evening. The place was empty. We both wanted a cappuccino , came out , tasted very bitter, we ordered the cannoli and the mixed berry cobbler . The cannoli was so tiny with barely any cream, and the mixed berry cobbler was just ok, did not taste fresh. The wait staff was not attentive , considering there was only one table there being served inside . It has a nice outdoor seating area which I loved . Maybe I will come back and try the food , but dessert was just blah .. . A note to the owner , look at the pics I posted of the cannoli and then your picture that you post on the website . Does not look the same at all, or very appetizing .",Capizzi
104,"I've been here many times before within the last few years and always had a good experience. I came in last night for my 30th birthday dinner with a table of 8. The waiter was very nice , made us all feel very welcomed and offered suggestions for drinks. We ordered drinks and they took a long time to be made. We watched the waiter keep checking the bar for them but there was two bartenders on and they were both on their phones. There was only two guests at the bar at this time. We put in our appetizers and our meals . The appetizers came out quick and were all delicious. After the appetizer plates were collected, we waited about an hour for our food to come out before we asked about it. The waiter assured us that it would be out soon but they were really busy. As we were waiting , they set up a large table next to us which blocked us in and made it difficult for my party to get up to use the bathroom. 5 of our entrees came out and we waited ten minutes for the other 3. We asked the waiter because we were waiting for everyone's food to come out so we could eat together. He retook the order for them. After 45 min, the waiter asked the manager to come talk to us because those 3 entrees were still not out. She rolled her eyes and then put the blame on the waiter and said he didn't put in an entree. We were missing three so that didn't make sense. Finally after waiting 2 hours for food , the last three entrees came out and everyone else's food was ice cold at this point. All three of those entrees were wrong but they ate it anyway because we were starving. The hostess and the waiter were both trying to make things right. Other waiters came to us and tried to help also. The problem was with the management and the owner. The manager blamed the server and did not seem to care about the problem. The owner finally came over to us because we asked to see her . She also rolled her eyes and came over  with an attitude and very defensive. She did not care that this was my 30th birthday and we were trying to make the best of it. 5 of the people at this table were servers at other restaurants. This was handled so poorly that I will never be back. It's a shame because I know the food is really good here but I would never recommend this. Shame on the owner and manager.","The service is absolutely terrible and the owner was even worse, rude and entitled!!!!!!...  We waited 40 minutes for our drinks to be served and our order taken, after over an hour our appetizers have not been served yet and no one came to ask us if we wanted another drink....  When i approached the owner to let her know what was going on, her response was this ""I own the place and I haven't eaten yet"" and that i need to be more patient...when i politely pointed out that i am the customer and should be served... she was dismissive, i then said we are leaving, she insisted we pay for the the drink served and when i said i would not pay for this terrible watered down drink that i waited 40 minutes for she threaten to call the cops on me..  i can not comment on the food as we did not even get a piece of bread or a glass of water......She later responded to a review posted on facebook, calling me a thief for not paying...This just shows what kind of management is over there. What she should've done was apologize for the terrible service and offered to buy us a drink on the house and HAVE the waiter  bring our food, instead of tell us, how she is  the owner and she hasn't  eaten yet...... terrible customer service!","We went there this Saturday and was disappointed.  Waiter brought food and served meatballs with his thumb in the sauce.  When questioned he said oh well, I am new.  Ordered steak medium rare and it came out charred and like a brick.  When cutting into it , it was so over cooked it was white. Hostess tried to remediate with free after dinner drinks.  She was very nice and apologetic.  Unfortunately,  will not go back and do not recommend","I know I left a comment for this establishment and I am unsure where it go. In December 2017, I came in here with a group of five, all of us are deaf and the wait staff found us a nice round table in the heated tent, better for us to communicate with each other. We inform our waiter that we are deaf, we depend on visual cues and gestures. Most of us speak pretty well, we just want the wait staff to make sure there is no misunderstanding and just be patience with us.The wait staff were very accommodating and understanding. We ordered drinks and food with no issues, both drinks and food were delicious. A friend of ours is not a drinker, they had no non alcoholic drinks for her and it was a little disappointing. That friend asked for non alcoholic slushy strawberry daiquiri. The wait staff came back with a shirley temple drink for my friend and we all laughed, we appreciate his gesture. The wait staff could have told us that they do not offer non slushy alcoholic drinks and offered different types of non alcoholic drinks. We will be back to try out new dishes and have that coconut martini again, it was so good!",We booked a party for 36 people about 2 months in advance. We ate here before and the food is reallly good. We were told there would be live music on saturday night. Several days before the day of the party we were told there wont be live music. The day of the party we confirmed we are getting the more expensive $36 menu plus top shelf open bar instead of the $28 menu with janice or jannett. Once the hot food started coming we realized they are serving the $28 menu. At this point our hostess janice has left the restaurant. We advised the person in charge at this point margaret of the issue. She said she will investiaget. Then came back and stated we should have advised of the different menu earlier on. Seriously????? She then came and did us a favor and charged us the $28 menu that they served. At this point i wasnt even going to write a review. What really ticked me off after over 30 min of waiting for the check the manager onduty couldnt even take care of this. They had a 19 year old waiter settle the check. Also the host booking the party should have been presenet during the party to prevent issues like this. Spark notes:  food is great. Our waiter was great. Good retaurant to come eat a la carte with family but i would stay away for larger parties.,"Where do I even begin?  This place blew my expectations out of the water.      I'm not usually a martini drinker, but the different flavors and options had me intrigued. I tried my friends mint chocolate martini and had a 16 candles (sort of like a birthday cake martini) and a coconut martini for myself.  When they arrived at the table they were all too beautiful to not take a picture, and they tasted as good as they looked.The food was just as good. I ordered a crab cake as an appetizer, thinking it was a little pricy, until I saw the size of it.  It was big enough to share (but I did eat the entire thing myself because it was just that good).       For dinner I got a personal pizza, which I could barely eat because I was so full, so I brought it home with me.      Overall this place quickly became one of my favorite restaurants and I'm already looking for an excuse to come back.",Michael's Martinis & Meatballs
105,Not sure what all the hype is all about. Tastes like any other burger to me. Tastes good but not sure why some locations have enormous lines and waits.,"Shake shack always hits the spot. Fast food burger, shakes, beer or wine...you can't go wrong with any item from their menu. From their cheesy fries, to shack burger, chicken sandwich or chicken bites.  Everything taste fresh and it's real meat.  This place is spacious and has outside seating.","The food is excellent, however; the bathroom and tables were not clean.  It really wasn't crowded.  This is an issue with management; there is no reason there shouldn't be a clean restroom, and tables......step it up a notch guys.  The food is good, but show a little pride in what you do.","I try to come here once a month now to curb my burger cravings. In the last few orders I had, has been lettuce wrapped double burger with cheese, pickles, cherry peppers and sauce on the side. No sides order. I'm watching what I eat. lol ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Every time I order, the burgers are always hot and yummy to eat. When it first opened last year, I went with two friends and it was crowded on a Friday night during winter time. We ordered burgers and French fries. . They made sure gluten free bun burger for one of the friend were separated from regular burgers and I found it impressive. Considering I was new to gluten free stuff at the time. We all enjoyed the burgers and the French fries were hard so we just threw them out. Just be mindful, the French fries are not gluten free due to its being cooked into the same oil with everything else. Root beer in this place is pretty good, one of the friends introduce the root beer to me. I have no complains for this location.","The Double Shack Burger is delicious. 2 patties, cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and their ""secret"" sauce, which I'm pretty sure is a combination of mayo, ketchup, and mustard. Don't come here if you're on a diet, but great for indulging your taste buds. My daughter loves the chicken bites.","Pros - Clean, fresh food, & near one of the most populated areasCons - Very expensive, mediocre food, & better competition nearby.Phenomenal place although the chain itself is a glorified Wendy's. Average burgers, below average fries, & majority of their food is better than Mcdonaldd, although, at what price? I recommend Five Guys over Shake Shack any day.",Shake Shack
106,"Fast delivery, but awful food! Pad Thai just cheap noddles drenched with hot sauce packets.. sushi was ok but chewy like it's been sitting out. I could not make it through one whole sushi bite so my husband ate it. Best thing we ordered was chicken teriyaki. Worst food experience since moving to Staten Island :/","So this has been our go to sushi place since it opened.  Usually it's fine but the last few orders were noticeably off- sushi not as neat as usual, but we ignored it.  Well tonight my husband ordered a bento box and just as he dug into his rice a nice sized bug crawled out.  We almost vomited and threw everything away.  Never again.",Perfect...simply perfect...from start to finish...sake...our favorite...kani salad...nice hint of heat...the sushi...fresh..perfectly prepared...

107,It's sad to know that racism still exists in 2019 if you're black don't even bother coming here you'll get cold bread and you'll be sitting down for hours with no service while everyone around you get their food even though they walked in after you,"we came on a friday night 5/24/19 and was immediately sat down. offered water and the bread came about 15mins after (waiter said that it was coming out hot) the bread came and was cold and hard! i took a bite and spat it out because it did not taste good at all, even with butter! we ordered an appetizer and main dishes at the same time-before the bread came... 45minutes later and no appetizer was brought. i complained and it came out 2mins later. waiter was apologetic, blamed it on a party happening..... a group of two came whilst we sat and waited. they were immediately served their salad and appetizer....it is now over an hour and our main dishes have not been brought out yet! ....i am actively writing this review because in all my years i have neverrr experienced such horrible service!!! i am pissed and waiting to see how long this will take!!!!!!!! i spoke to the manager after one hour and twenty minutes and am still waiting! oh and that party of two who came in and was immediately served received their main dish as i am still waiting.","This place gets one star because I cannot give zero stars.  Here is my review on why neither me nor my family/friends will NEVER step foot in this establishment.  We cannot rate the food because after an hour and twenty minutes of being seated  there WAS NO FOOD served to a party of 2.  Only cold, hard, bread, which was told to have been coming out hot, was served, along with water.   This review is for the horrible service, and to let everyone know that RACISM is alive and well at this establishment!   It is not hard to conclude that you are being treated differently because of the color of your skin when you have been treated poorly and you are the only ones is an establishment full of others who do not look like you.  It would be hard for me to conclude racism if it were not for the white folks who came in way after, but received appetizers and salads within minutes of being seated.  It would be hard to conclude RACISM when the reason you're given for slow/poor service is that the kitchen is slow, but you see others receiving their meals from the same kitchen, and you then realize that the kitchen is just slow for YOU!   It is not hard to conclude RACISM when no one expresses a sense of urgency about rectifying the long wait time and poor service, and they don't care if you stay or leave!   These are the reasons we will NEVER step foot in such an establishment again!  And for those of you reading this who are of the WHITE persuasion, I want you to know that we need you to stand along with the rest of us in the world, and not support establishments that don't treat EVERYONE fairly, and with respect equally.","This restorant has a high class food, high class service and excellent Live Music every Friday and Saturday.A rich menu, a great chief with a lot of experience. Professional people drive this establishment!","I love this place. Traditional Italian food and always delicious. The soups are especially good. I got their tortellini soup and it was so filling that I hardly needed an entree. The entrees are broken up into pastas, risottos, and meats - but it's vegetarian friendly. I got a rich mushroom risotto and it was superb. Overall, I haven't had a bad dish yet. On Fridays and saturdays, they have live music. It tends to be some traditional Italian songs. One standout quality of this spot is the friendliness of the waiters and the owner. They welcome you when you get in and  make you feel like family. Also - ample parking out front and they're on grub hub if you prefer to order in.","I was pleasantly surprised,When you walk in everybody is 80 years old and are dancing the live singer is very goodThe food is very good and the service is very goodAll the food came out just how we ordered it The girls drove them crazy I feel like I'm in a nursing home but I enjoyed it very much",Ambrosio Italian Restaurant & Banquet Hall
108,"Food is just OK and the customer service is atrocious. I ordered a vegetable soup (I was sick and do not eat meat), white rice with pinto beans on the side and my boyfriend ordered half a baked chicken with rice and beans (both orders come with rice already in price). When I got my order, I saw that I received baked chicken, rice and beans and a big container of plain white rice. I was, however, charged $20. When I notified them that I did not receive my soup or beans, they proceeded to accuse me of lying. You charged me $20 and I received 3 items and 2 of the items come with the meals. why would I lie for some soup? They were so rude and for mediocre food ? Never going back again.","First time caller. Tried to order a family style dinner and the woman only understood chicken wings, chicken wings and chicken wings.

I think if this was not located next to my gym I would actually lose some weight. The place is very clean and the people working there has always been super nice  Ordered Pernil with Yellow Rice and the pork was cooked perfectly. Super tender with just the right amount of seasoning. There was nothing bad to be said about the dish and it was such a delight to have.My potato stuffed with beef was delicious as well and I would highly recommend these if you stop by. Usually I would order some fried plantains too but they were out. I was really surprised by that but it didn't really ruin anything.I would highly recommend el pollo, probably not after working out but hey who am I to be a hypocrite.","This restaurant is not far from highway 404.   It's a nice local Spanish restaurant with a few tables.   The staffs are friendly, they don't rush you to order.   The portion is very generous.   I ordered chicken with black beans and rice.   The chicken was well seasoned.  Black beans and rice was delicious.  Finding parking here is a problem since they don't have a parking lot.",Absolutely love it here!

109,"After a five star review last time and multiple visits....I have nothing good to say about it this time. We walked in, a party of four and were told it was at capacity.  The bar was NOT even close to full.... In fact there were a few scattered seats. It was not a bartender I have ever seen before.   What a disappointing experience. They wanted to call me in ten or twenty minutes.... I guess I should have waited in the cold. Think I will not return. Thanks for not being loyal as I was a loyal customer.","Staten Island's hidden gem! This is a cocktail bar, not a party club place. If you want to sip high quality drinks from amazing mixologist you've found it. Dark, low key, quaint atmosphere makes this place cozy.","Why are you so obsessed with my husband and I? You're prying into our personal lives asking people where we live, stalking us WTF! Take my honest comments act like a professional and learn how to correct your behavior! You've been speaking to The most pathetic losers that I actually know & see around, asking personal information about my family, my kids and quite honestly it's starting to scare me, not my husband! I will not continue with this rant anymore but the next thing I hear that you're asking about us I will have to get an order protection against you ROY!!!","One of my go to places for well made cocktails and good food. This place is open till 4am which means you and your friends can have the Afterparty here.Bartenders here are friendly and knowledgeable about their drinks and food selection. They have aGood selection of beers available which won't disappoint! (Flagship Brewery's Swamp Tings is a must try) This place has a great vibe as soon as you walk in. Candle lit walls and music that won't drown out your conversation. There are no tv's here, so if you're trying to catch a sports game here try another place.If you get any sandwhich, just know they put the right amount of crunch in it, just make sure you squish the sandwhich a little bit so you won't scratch the roof of ya mouth ;) For the good quality drinks, you'll be surprised at the price of drinks here. Out of all the bars I've been to so far, this one slows down the N.Y pace.","Been to this nice little hidden bar twice. The only drink I've had is their Hot Toddy which is very nice and really warms up your bones and insides. Very chill atmosphere. Took my spouse here for after dinner drinks and since his palate leans towards not liking the taste of alcohol, he opted for the bartender's choice drinks. This means that the bartender basically makes a drink to whatever flavor profile you have.",Been wanting to stop here and decided to today as it was my anniversary. Didn't disappoint I had the east side Rickey which was delish. It was refreshing with mint and cucumber and other stuff. My hubby had just a glass of Cabernet.

110,"Just delicious! Fresh & tastyOrder in advance before going there so you don't have to waitOwner is very niceGreat service a lit pricey, but worth it, by the way, the bad reviews are just nonsense. I've ordered so many times here different dishes they all delish. There are 2 things that are bad: Parking & waiting for food that's why I said to call in advance. I've been in many restaurants in the island not as clean as this place & food is great!","Two stars instead of one because the service was excellent. The worst falafel I ever had. Falafel was mushy, too salty, just lousy. I don't understand the great reviews.","They obviously do not want business. Called in an order for delivery, the guy on the phone first said ""ehhhhh might be an hour my driver is on Hylan."" Then said ""What do you want?"". So I said I wanted a #30. He said ""Welllll minimum order for delivery is $8. Yours is $11. It don't pay to deliver."" I said forget it. He babbled on a little more and I just hung up. Oh well.","Craving a Falafel sandwich and no where near my standbys in Brooklyn I found Eddies Falafel on Staten Island. Located in a bustling area on Staten Island with a large middle eastern community I figured this might be a great move.Parking is a challenge, there is not a lot of street parking so I snuck into a parking lot up the street.Eddies was quiet on this Wednesday.Small counter and a polite gentleman greeted me and asked what will you have. Falafel on a pita, within 5 minutes fresh falafel fried and placed into a pita, the sandwich was decorated with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, tahini and hummus....the only other question was hot sauce? Of course....lay it on me. Mistake number 1 was trying to eat this massive sandwich in my car.....mistake number 2 was neglecting to ask for extra napkins. The sandwich was a delicious and glorious mess.Just the right amount of garlicky falafel, crunchy vegetables, smooth hummus, tahini and spicy hot sauce. At $5 and change a clip....this was a bargain.I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch and will be back to satisfy my falafel cravings. The restaurant is Kosher...if in the area give it a shot!","PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT:  All the positive reviews of this place are fake.I ordered the chicken kebab meal.  Chicken was rotten, dry and burnt to a crisp.  Hummus tasted exactly like the prepackaged kind you get at the supermarket.  Yes, it's easy to detect such hummus by the citrusy taste.  French fries were typical frozen fries.  Everything except the fries was MICROWAVED!The waiter (I believe the owner) never asked if we wanted anything to drink nor did he give us water.Oh, and there's no air conditioning.Plain awful.","Simple but delicious food!

111,The worst. Food is ok at best but the delivery is the pits. They dint even care. Over two hours ti get a pie. Ridiculous.,"Ordered wings and a vodka pie which were good, however, it took at least an hour for them to bring us the pie. Waitress who only came around once said ""they were making it fresh"" No duh.","Food is good, but the customer service is deplorable. I've been ordering for 30 years. When my order is wrong, they expect a tip when they bring the correct order and it's a song and a dance to get them to bring the correct order. It's such a shame because the food is good, but they aren't the only pizzeria in the area. Try somewhere else like Euro Pizza.","I hate to rave about this place because it's hard enough to get a table but I must! Forget about atmosphere, it's just a roomy pizzeria with a small bar, if you're okay with that then you've hit the jackpot. Everything on the menu is cooked fresh and delicious! The staff are young energetic and attentive servers. Rich is our favorite but they're all fantastic. Very reasonably priced drink and wine menu. Just go here and stop looking for another restaurant immediately!","Having lived on Staten Island for so many years, I can't believe I never tried Villa Monte. We ordered a few pesto, grandma and sicilian slices - they were all so good!! Also got an order of garlic knots and they were so buttery and garlicky ..literally missing their pizza as I'm writing this. Def planning to visit this place every time I'm back home!","Can't believe it took me this long to review our neighborhood family restaurant. My wife's family goes to Villa Monte  (commonly known as Gino's ) for over 30 years.It's a family owned business with very good food and a huge menu. My favorites are the shrimp  Parm plate, chicken monte and chicken Di Napoli plates (exceptional options) and hands down the best chicken parm hero in the island. You can't beat the hero's in this place. The vodka sauce is a little disappointing, quite tasteless... you just taste basil on it. They have to change their recipe. The only thing that can get annoying about this restaurant it's the lack of organization when seating the people. Saturday can get quite crowded and young teens are the ones handling the pressure.  Also please make sure you have enough drinks to last the entire week - - - last Sunday they had almost no alternatives but coke and sprite, quite irritating! I would love to give five stars based just on the food but eating in a restaurant encompass the entire experience so four stars it is. This is our family spot and my kids are crazy for the pizza and garlic knots so I am married to Gino's for life like it or not lol.",Villa Monte Pizzeria & Restaurant
112,"Never again!  I ordered eggplant fries and butternut squash raviolis.  The eggplant fries were dripping with grease, I couldn't even eat one!  Half of the fries were burnt and the other half looked like they were laying around in grease for a day or two.  The raviolis were topped with a wad of goat cheese, there was no mention of the goat cheese in the description on their website.  I cannot eat goat cheese so therefore I could not eat the raviolis. Worst meal I ever received, think twice before ordering from here.","Not sure if that was the Cook or the owner of the pizzeria who was at the register just now. I've usually been a fan, and have been coming for a long time for the pizza, but that guy just really turns me off to the whole thing. Not only did he talk to the girls that are the waitresses in a very rude way, but as I paid he didn't give me a thank you or hello. Also while I was waiting for my waitress, I made eye contact with him, at that point he could have said you need something... Instead  he gave me a dirty look and kept going. Must be a misogynist, because he was really nice to the guy who went in front of me to pay. It's a shame that this island has so many misogynists... I try not to line their wallets so much. I'd rather go to a female-owned then experience this crap. So you hire a bunch of women and talk to them like shit, pay them minimum scratching for tips... That doesn't mean that you're with the times.",Best pizza ever. Thin crust not overdone sauce perfect amount of cheese!  Hidden gem in Staten Island. We transport this pizza to DC and Philly whenever we can!,"Retroactive to May 2019:Was at a family party in Staten Island and had the wonderful (and surprise) pleasure of eating Joe and Pat's. It was some of the best pizza I've ever had. Period end of story. From what I understand, the locals prefer Joe and Pats to the likes of Deninos and Brothers. I can't weigh in on that but I am all in on Joe and Pats.",1. Way over priced2. Delivery Fee (I went to visit a friend and decided to treat everyone to some pizza)3. Drinks are over priced4. The pizza crust was burnt (I called to tell them but couldn't get through)Its seems like this business wants to grab your cash and charge you for overprice items. I won't order from them again! The only good thing was delivery was fast.,"This is the BEST restaurant in Staten Island, hands down. Their menu is HUGE and everything on the menu is the most incredible dish you will eat. You HAVE TO TRY the margherita pizza, and random but make sure you get a side of garlic sautéed broccoli, the best broccoli you'll ever have!! I love that you can also get pizza by the slice because even if you're in a hurry you can get the best pizza around. The staff is sooo friendly and helpful here, if you need advice make sure to ask them for their opinion!! They're so nice. My family has been going to this restaurant for over 40 years and we don't plan on stopping anytime soon!! If you're in the mood for great food, this is the place you want to be!",Joe & Pat's Pizzeria
113,"This was not a fine dining experience. I asked what they used for ""fish & chips"" I was told fresh sole. What I got was thin sliced deep fried CHICKEN! When I told the lady in charge she confirmed that it sure was chicken, shrugged her shoulders and walked away. They charged me full price.This may be a Staten Island thing. Everyone in the restaurant, every last diner, shouted! It is a small upscale setting and Staten Islanders don't have conversation level voices, they shout. The people they are talking to are inches away but they shout.","Very disappointed!!! We planned a nice dinner for a 40th Birthday. We were 6 people on a Wednesday night. Our reservation was at 6:30. Our waitress came and took our drink and dinner orders, we waited almost an hour and a half for the entrees to come out!! She never once came and asked us if we needed anything or wanted another drink. We actually had to get up ourselves and go to the bar ourselves!! Needless to say we were a little disappointed. The food itself was not good, the salmon was dry and they covered it with a mustard sauce that didn't help it. The cod was maybe a 3 oz portion and not seasoned. Basically this was food that we could have gotten at a diner. Nothing great, however, my complaint is the service. Never have we been to a restaurant and received this type of service. It was not busy. They were made aware of the Birthday in advance also. I do not usually write reviews but this was so disappointing. Our meals came with dessert but we didn't want to stay any longer. Needless to say we will not be going to Coles anytime soon.",Not to badWaitress was attentive...Went on a Saturday night...Place kind of small...Food ok,"I absolutely love this restaurant and everything about it. The food is ALWAYS fresh, delicious, and prepared super well. The people are so nice, especially the bartender Danny, and Mike! They always make me feel so at home whenever my boyfriend and I go for dinner! They have this amazing special on weekdays too where you can get a 3 course meal and a bottle of wine for the table, for $25 a person! (The more people, the more wine you get.) My boyfriend and I went and got a bottle to split, an appetizer each, an entree each, and a dessert each. I got the baked clams for my appetizer, and I HIGHLY suggest the stuffed tilapia! It was super delicious! The desserts they have are always delicious, as well. I can't wait to go back and have another wonderful meal there!","This restaurant is easily in the top 3 as far as seafood restaurants go on SI. Although some places make better dishes better than others but overall, Coles Dockside seems to make what it makes really well, despite not having a large extensive menu like Lobster House Joe's. I was expecting clam bakes, and lobster rolls when I visited here but was surprised when I didn't see those on the menu.  Instead, there are some pretty interesting gourmet seafood plates offered along with the typical seafood pub fare; the fried calimari, baked clams, and fish and chips. I first ordered the raw oysters during happy hour, at around $2 each. They were very fresh. I was not particularly fond of the way they cut the horse radish, which was shaved rather than grated, but I like my raw oysters simple and only with a touch of lemon anyway. I then ordered the fish and chips which totally blew my mind. For just $11, they give you two huge flounder fillets and a nice basket of fries, served in a steel basket; all super crispy and delicious. Their tarter sauce was clearly homemade and absolutely bursting with flavor. Last but not least, their staple, the Scallop and Artichoke croustade. They are known for this dish and I can see why;- its prepared with lots of white wine, garlic and was absolutely delicious with some Italian bread to dunk with.I will definitely continue to dine here. Come during happy hour because their prices are excellent!","Tonight we were a party of 8 for my son in laws birthday . We had a nice table overlooking the marina. The sangria was delicious. My son in law and I had the short rib special with the apricot glaze. This was so tasty  and flavorful, loved the glaze  . The meat fell off the bone. It was served with a pork belly , potato hash that was also so delicious. My husband tasted some of mine and loved it too. He ordered the lobster ravioli which I also tasted and thought it was the best I  ever had.. He loved it.  My daughters had the salmon dijoinase which she liked and the halibut special served with shrimp  and a tomato risotto. Everything was good on the plates except the shrimp. They seem to always overcook the shrimp at the point where they are tough and rubbery . The shrimp was not good on the other entrees too. The specials were all 40.00 dollars that I thought was just a little high , should have been 30. Two sangria pitchers were 26 dollars each . Also too much in my opinion. The fried calamari appetizer that we got earlier was also so delicious . I love the Thai chili sauce . The waiter was Charles, a very friendly , good waiter , funny too, cracking jokes even . We seem to always get him . Overall  dinner was good . The specials are all delicious ,  but slightly overpriced . The shrimp is the only thing I wouldn't order here . I will definitely be back to enjoy the other seafood Went here once again to celebrate my wedding anniversary with my husband. Called before to ask about specials and they said they has stuffed figs, as soon as I walk in the waitress Donna tells me she sold the last one. And it is only 630 on a Thursday night. .  Why dissapointed , no one updated the special board outside . Then we ordered a mango kiwi mojito, very good, only issue is way too many lemon pits in my glass. I don't like swallowing lemon pits through my straw. The fish we ordered was delicious once again, only lacking in extra sauce. Somehow thy never give you enough sauce for the whole entree, my husband s too. I ordered the potato encrusted halibut with a bisque sauce that was seriously way too good. My husband ordered the mahi-mahi that is always a favorite of ours , with a lime butter sauce, also so yummy. The side was a Potato that was ok, and very watery mixed veggies that we didn't like. We left them on the plate . There was bread pudding  and blueberry cheesecake on the special dessert menu still written on the board when I left , although when I asked our waitress about any dessert specials , she said to me just what is on the regular menu. . So we didn't see any dessert we liked on the regular menu, so we skipped dessert . My one complaint is that the waitress should know the specials of the night which clearly she did not know. Seemed annoyed when I asked her about it too. Over all best fish dinner. Dissapointed that this was our anniversary and we never got dessert, I really wanted that bread pudding .",Coles Dockside Restaurant
114,"Ordered the other day and not happy, puttanesca had only  4 olives and couldn't find capers hence the lack of taste. Stuffed artichoke was OK but the desserts were gross, ordered lava cake it was more like brownie batter, just A blob of mush. Also ordered the cheesecake it was stiff and tasted like it was old.  This is a one and done for us.","Will put ZERO star if i could.  Had the worst dining experience this past Saturday for a surprised birthday dinner that i planned for my gf .  It was a party of 20 (half are kids).  Table was set up nicely in the small private area that was open for dining on weekends.  We got there on time for our 7pm reservation.  Appetizers and drinks were fine.  Ordered our dinner and we didn't get serve our dinner til after 9pm.  All our surrounding tables were all getting served theirs.  Like Really?? Half the table were starving kids.  I had to ask our waiter and the manager at least twice to get the kids pasta dishes out first.  Then comes our dinner for adults.  All the rib eye steak came out WELL DONE when we ordered med rare.  There were no red at all, it was FULLY COOKED on all 3 of them.  They should be a shamed to even serve it to us.  At this time is past 9pm, we just decided to return it and not bother order anything else and just eat the pasta dishes that was ordered.  Manager Sergio told us there's one rib eye on the way, just try it and share it, on the house without charge and I didn't care for it but he insisted.  Came, we barely touched it.  Was dry and  not cooked to our liking of course!  We waited forever for someone to clean up our table and when someone finally came and finished cleaning we just wanted out of there instead of ordering dessert.  Waiter asked if anyone offered us dessert menu, I""m like no one bothered to and we just want the check now.  Forgot to mention, the $80 lamb chop my son ordered was also dry and well done but he was starving and ate it.  Sergio the manager knew i was not happy with our dinner and apologized and said will do something nice for us with dessert.  Never saw him again after table was cleaned.  Didn't even get to order my friend the birthday girl her dessert.  Owner stood by our table, not apologetic at all and just stood around.  So very disappointed at myself for picking this place and ruin this birthday dinner.  Would never come back again.Also i found out afterwards one of my g/f thought they are just racist perhaps?  When she walked in and told one of the guy shes here for a reservation under my name, he sent her to the main room without checking and said you're on the other side.  Idiot didn't even check and sent my friend to the main dining room where she got sent back to the private dining room.  JUST A HORRIBLE RESTAURANT OVERALL.  Poor management and chefs.  I did not even want to pay them any tip to be honest but i did just b/c the waiter worked our table and wasn't his fault how food came out.  We would've had a better $800 dinner else where.  NEVER AGAIN Andella's!",Horrible!!!! Ordered penne in vodka sauce it was horrible. Had the wrong address so delivery took forever. Just don't bother,"My wife and daughter and I ate here this week. The restaurant was highly recommended by several friends of ours. The service was exceptional right from the beginning. The manager (possibly owner) Mike greeted us very politely. The decor was attractive and well kept and the seating arrangements very comfortable. We were dressed neatly, but casual- jeans and button down with shoes - and felt this was perfect for the setting. Sergio was our waiter. He was incredibly knowledgeable and polite as well as humorous. He was very well aware of the menu items and seemed to be educated about wine. Appetizer: we had the stuffed artichoke which I highly recommend. For main course I had the NY Strip with cognac and peppercorn sauce with fries and mescaline salad. It was cooked perfectly (med rare) and the dish rivaled the last time I ate the same thing at a high end French restaurant. My wife had a pasta dish from the specials menu. It contained pasta with lobster, crab and other seafood. She loved it. My daughter had salmon. It was prepared perfectly and had some Italian touches to it, that made it far more special than the average salmon dish. Desert was a chocolate type of cream brûlée'. We shared it and everyone was impressed. -Overall I highly recommend this place. Price was very fair and the food and service well exceeded expectations.   -Jason","We just came back from Andella's to celebrate a friend's birthday. I have been there twice and it was fine. Food is decent, however I was never happy that there is not a bar to wait at if you are waiting for your table. Tonight however, it was a Friday and they were training a new bartender, service was slow, and that is all understandable. We had to ask for bread, butter, cheese, water......; For the food that wasn't served and bad service, they did make up for it by buying desserts and coffee. However, when you hire a manager for a very  competitive business they should have customer service training.Mr. Sergio Flores, Maitre D' came over after our meal and demanded my name and gave me his card and said 'this is for your review!'We left and will never go back.  For a very competitive market, they should be more customer friendly, especially when prices are high and they obviously should have a better management.","We just discovered this wonderful restaurant, even though we live very close.  We went two weeks in a row and were very impressed.  The food and service were amazing!  We had the cold seafood appetizer and rack of lamb and both were outrageous! Thank you Sergio, Mike, Davide, Melvin & Jose. And a special thank you to Jennifer!Susan & Jeff",Andella's Restaurant
115,Some of the freshest and most tastiest food I have ever had on the island. No wonder this place is always packed. What a find.The soups here are simply to die for. Try the lemon potatoe. Favorite sandwich is the Big Sister. This place rocks.,Food is good. Usually we get the chicken shawarma in a baguette. Portions are decent and the price is fair.The major problem of this restaurant is the service. If the lady is not there it's a Sh... show to say the least!I ordered online for the first time and of course got my order messed up! I called them back and got an obnoxious guy giving me a hard time which pissed me  even more but I gave it to him - - - what a horrible costumer Service. So I waited another 45 min to get the stuff that was missing and for my surprise the MORON send me the wrong things again. I gave up! Not ordering from them ever again.,"Restaurant is relatively dirty. Dusty grime on walls and ceilings. Table smelled like cleaning solution... Good that tables are being cleaned, bad to have to smell it while eating.Food was not good. They had no pulled beef. I ordered a shawarma platter... No flavor or spices at all which is crazy for something called shawarma. I got sweet potato fries and regular fries with it. SP Fries were good, frozen, but good. Regular fries were crisp, but should have been seasoned. The platter was served with no pita and no tehina/humus... Just an odd presentation for a platter.We also had a burger that was fine, and hot dogs that were plain.I'd suggest cleaning the restaurant every couple of weeks. Not using customer facing areas for storage... Get your staff in a uniform. One guy on the grill in a landscaping t-shirt, two in dirty undershirts...just odd for a kitchen that is in the open. I'd also recommend the owner take a plate of fries and sit down to eat if she's hungry. Reaching into a bowl, eating a few fries, and then running plates to tables (repeat 5 times) while never washing is poor form.I wouldn't go back here. In the past I've eaten from the Brooklyn store (only got delivery) and it was much better","Ordered delivery and it came on time.  The burger was absolutely terrible. Dry and literally NOTHING on it- bun and overcooked meat. Practically inedible. The onion rings were nice and thick, but the breading/batter was falling off each ring. By the end I had a pile of fried breading/batter. Flavor was pretty good, but poor execution.The best thing I got was the Holy Toasty. I wouldn't call the chicken ""crispy,"" but the charred bread certainly fit in that category. Really good flavors in here though made up for the bites that just tasted like burned bread. Overall, no need to go back, but not a terrible option.TIP: Order through their website, not grubhub. The menu items are cheaper.",Fantastic food and fantastic service. The staff is extremely welcoming and the food is great.,"Clean, Fresh , Friendly service. Affordable delicious food all the time. I highly recommend this place.

A few scraps on a piece of what should be rye breadNo pickle-Old friesThe burger was greasy and not good at allWaitresses were 'slammed' with a few tablesJody's is a former hit but now a miss","I don't often write reviews, but I felt I needed to here.  My husband and I went to Jodys - I've never been there before but I was looking forward to it because I've always heard such good things about it. First and foremost, the people who work there couldn't be nicer. Wonderful service. The problem was the food.  My husband got a chicken parm plate and I got the chicken adobo.  Granted, these are not typical items that one orders from a bar restaurant, but I was trying to eat as healthy as possible. A few bites into my chicken, I knew something wasn't right.  The meat was very tough and had a weird taste to it.  I pulled back the stuff that was on top of it, and I saw that the meat was actually a pale greyish color.  I was very turned off by how it looked.  I tried to cut off the bad pieces, but it felt like the entire piece wasn't right.  When you cut through it wasn't the usual white color.  I stopped eating it immediately.  I only had a few bites, but my stomach felt upset for a few hours after we ate (and I have a stomach of steel).  I'm not suggesting that this dish is representative of the overall experience of the food there - maybe it was just the exception to the rule.  But due to the disgust factor I felt, I will not be returning back.  $42 for food we both didn't really enjoy.  What a shame.","I had high expectations going to Jody's last night. Everyone told me how good the burger was. Me and my girlfriend had the worst  burger we  have ever had in our  entire life. First off  walking in the door, no one was there to great us. We had to wonder around for a bit until we found someone to write our name down for a table. I got the blue cheese Burger with sweet potato fries and my girlfriend got the same with onion rings. The sweet potato fries were burnt and the onion rings were nothing special. My burger had a burt taste but was cooked rare and my girlfriends burger was cooked beyond recognition. I will never be going back again, extremely disappointed!",Best burger and wings in town! Make sure to try the teriyaki wings they are the best!

117,This is my 2nd time coming to this taco joint. Overall I'm very impressed with their service and the quality of their food. I usually go to the Brooklyn location a lot but this location is a must.,"Can't lie, wasn't impressed with the food at all, very dry. drinks tasted like they had been loaded with sugar. Not a fan!","The tacos were decent but i thought there would be at least two tacos in an order but they only give a single taco and three of the tacos I ordered were shrimp variants and literally only had two shrimp in each one. I ordered it to go so I when i got home and discovered how much I got gypped, was totally letdown. I spent 20$ for four relatively small/medium sized tacos that really didn't even make me feel full in the slightest. Disappointing.","My favorite Mexican food restaurant. Love their both locations, this and the one in bay ridge, Brooklyn. Definitely order their pulled pork quesadilla! Love the Bloody Mary, if you can handle spicy food well. LolWaitresses are sweet and friendly.","I'm a huge fan of their Bay Ridge location besides the fact that they're so busy all the time. Figured we give this location a try cause it's so much bigger and more convenient for my friend that was already in Staten Island. We were all sadly disappointed. we got seated right away and they did get busy on a Tuesday night. I got four tacos, the long beach, dirty bird, bohemian, and the classic cali taco. The steak in the Long Beach taco was cooked very well done and dry. It was very tough to eat. The chicken in the bohemian taco was very moist and not in a good way, the water or whatever stew the shredded chicken was braised in leaked through the soft taco tortilla and ripped it making it pretty difficult to eat. My friends had the same issues. Their chips were good though, served warm and tasted fresh. Honestly don't think we'll be back because the quality of their tacos just weren't the same as what we're used to from their Bay Ridge location.","Awesome catering.  I love eating here so I gave them a shot when i hosted a graduation party earlier this summer.  My first event was so successful and the food loved by my guests so I used Ho Brah for catering again this past weekend. Both events I did a taco bar.  Each time the food was outstanding.  Steak, bohemian chicken and sunset pork are what I ordered for both events.  The food was so good, the steak stayed tender in the sterno dish, it was a huge hit.  The pork and chicken were also flavorful and fresh.  Everything was done right.   They provided 3 different kinds of salsa and several kinds of crema.  The corn tortillas were grilled and held the filling without breaking.  The guacamole was the best we ever ate.  They also provided flour tortillas as well.  I was really impressed with the food during my first event, and so were my guests.  So I used them for the second event and i swear the food was even better this time.  The jasmine rice was so fluffy and well seasoned.  I'm not huge bean fan, but my guests raves about the beans so I know it was good.  My food was ready and n time and freshly cooked.  Very professional.  I highly recommend doing a ho brah taco bar event if you're entertaining.  The food was outstanding, my guests loved making their own tacos, it was different and less $$ then your typical chicken Marsala/penne vodka fare.",Ho'Brah a taco joint

Went in this morning for coffee and a quick breakfast only that my coffee took 20 minutes to make and my food took 30 for just avocado toast with an egg. Our coffee was pure milk. The girl behind the register kept stating how frustrated she was. Never coming back here again. If I could rate this a 0, I would.","Ordered for delivery took an hour and a half to get it. When it did finally come, food was ok nothing to rave about. Staff when i called to ask where my order is was very rude.","Okay so today is 6/13/19 and it was pouring i called at their opening time to get an empanada and they were closed, so i walked over and they were all sitting in a car and they said it was raining thats why they haven't left the car (but they work all inside) and they still gave me the wrong order when they finally opened at 10. This is ridiculous they always mess up my orders and they changed the size of their food so deff a downgrade. Their smoothies just taste like shit! FUCK THEM!","Been here for the second time, Had an amazing juice , tried their super power & fresh made Greek salad.Everything was so tasty and their customer service is excellent.I would definitely come back again and recommend this place !!!!","Love this place!!!  If you love fresh juices and smoothies, then this is the cafe to visit.From breakfast to appetizers and wraps. You can't find a better fusion of freshly made beverages and small plates.I could eat here everyday and try a new shake each day. Great customer service, clean and welcoming.... Amazing!!!   What's better than a 5-star review??? I don't know either but you need to try Fresh Twist.","Went here for early dinner with my husband , this place is a gem . We had two types of empanadas .  A pork and cheese one that was good, but my favorite was the beef and cheese with sweet plantain . So delicious . Then we tried the Cuban wrap and the Cuban hero .

119,The quality has changed since this place opened up. The people who previously ran this place are no longer there and you can tell by the quality of the food and service! It's a shame because they used to be really good!,"Food is great. Sometimes it can come out a little greasy but most of the time it's pretty good. The only thing about this place is that they need to employ better delivery people. Once my family and I got harassed by one of their delivery girls, she called my phone non stop yelling and screaming because we told the staff that she took nearly 2 hours to come and deliver something when we live not even 10 minutes away from this place. She was terrible and the cops almost needed to be called.","I lovED this restaurant I would normally give five stars every time. I was a frequent customer. I will no longer go. I only came in for the Crab Rangoon, which omg was the best...I came in and ordered it as usual to bite into it and there was mozzarella cheese stuffed in it... I did not like it at all!! I went to the clerk and said can I get my money back or exchange it... I told stressed that calling it Crab rangoon it's misleading it should have cream cheese. She refused to help me and acted as if I was in the wrong. I'm all about customer service. I wouldn't mind coming back if she would have acknowledged they were in the wrong and just made it right.","I ordered takeout here with my boyfriend the other day and gotta tell ya, it was awesome! We were greeted by a smiling server who was patient with our being indecisive.My boyfriend got the teriyaki shrimp and I got a PHILADELPHIA roll, shrimp tempura and crab Rangoon. To my surprise the take out boxes had holes cut in the top when we got home. I assume it was to let off steam so things wouldn't get soggy. How thoughtful! Also, I appreciate that whomever packed the bag put soy sauce and an extra little cup so I could dip my sushi in soy sauce. Again, so thoughtful. We loved everything we ordered and will no doubt be back again!","Ordered take-out from this spot for the first time. Food was great and delivery didn't take long to arrive. I ordered the chicken teriyaki (extra chicken) with steamed rice, avocado & tuna roll, along with a mango bubble tea (SO GOOD!). I couldn't finish all of the food because the portion of the entree was more than I expected (not pictured). I had enough leftovers for lunch the next day. Definitely will be ordering from here in the near future!","Place is awesome, prices are so good. I wish there was more then one location on the island. There is no where to get bubble tea on the south shore of state island and I wish they would open a place like this.",Yummy Machi
120,"Second time here and was completely disappointed. We brought some friends there because we enjoyed the food on our first visit. We were eating there before a show at the St George Theatre. Took 10 minutes for us to be greeted. Finally someone ""pointed"" us to our table. We waited 20 minutes or more for someone to come to our table. The server quickly rattled off the specials as he poured water and never apologized for the long wait. He took our drink order and our dinner order together at our request since we needed to get to our show and had already waited entirely too long! Again we waited. This time it was about 10 minutes for our drinks. We were never asked if we wanted more water or another drink. Our food finally arrived. Never once did the server come to see if everything was okay. My risotto was pasty. The other dinners were just okay. Very bad experience. Not sure I would go back. Completely embarrassed that I had suggested this restaurant to our friends.","Ok so restaurant was empty on a Thursday at 6pm my wife and I came to enjoy a nice dinner, the ambiance was not so good the kavanugh hearings were blasting not romantic at all.... our waiter was excellent very knowledgeable and personable.... he was probably the best part of the night lol we ordered French onion soup and baked clams as a appetizer and ehhhhh not amazing for the price I ordered the aged prime rib expecting a phenomenal steak and for 40 something dollars it was actually awful,  it was basically room temperature but cooked medium to perfection, the steak was not tender at all or juicy and had no taste it was dry and very hard to chew.  My wife ordered a nightly special which was pasta with calamari,shrimp,clams, and scallops it was pretty good not anything to complain about.  After having the dinner my waiter came to the table and asked if I had an issue with the steak because he noticed I did not eat it I told him that I hate to complain about my dinner but that I was not satisfied and have a complaint about the steak being tough and chewy he replied that sometimes that happens, unfortunately for me I got a shitty ass expensive steak  ... he then offered us a free desert which they chose for us almost as if it happens all the time.  So overall the service was good but for 155 dollars for 2 people looking for a good steak and willing to spend money on a relatively expensive meal it actually sucked and We will not be back ....","I really didn't enjoy my experience at all. The food was bland and undercooked. The service wasn't great either. One of the employees (male) went to each table and asked how everyone was doing except for ours. I don't know if he was the manager but that rubbed me the wrong way. Atmosphere: A dim but smart casual medium sized space.Food: We ordered the lamb chop lollipops appetizer and it was more rare than what we liked and requested. It was absolutely flavorless, even after putting tons of pepper and salt. The green beans it came with weren't fully cooked either. The cowboy steak we ordered was really rare and again had zero flavor. We aired our grievances with the waitress and she could care less. She didn't apologize and didn't seemed phased by it either. Service: I did not like our waitress what so ever. She seemed to have a scowel serving us. She did not take pride in her work or the chef's. As mentioned before, one particular male employee went around the room talking to all the patrons except for us. There weren't many people so it was very blatant. Overall: If you like flavorless food with a scowel come here but I sure as hell am not.","Best steakhouse/restaurant in Staten Island, hands down.

121,,,,"We heard so many great things about Bella Famiglia we had to check it for ourselves. Bella Famiglia has a small parking lot in front of the store so we parked and we entered. We were so amazed how clean, neat and beautiful it was.  When walking in on the right is where all the prepared food items are in the glass cases. In the middle is the grocery items and left fresh produce/refrigerator section and such. We were greeted by Mike the owner. He was so sweet and extremely helpful.  He Gave us a sample of the few things they are really know for.The prosciutto bread. This bread mostly meat and cheese with some bread. Super moist but not salty like most prosciutto breads. I really enjoyed this. We usually eat this bread on the holidays at least that how we do.  Next we tried the mozzarella. OMG! One of the best I have tasted. Again, wasn't salty super creamy and delicate. Just really good!  Lastly, we tried something I would never have tried stuffed peppers. This was stuffed with ricotta salata, provolone, prosciutto, ham and a few other tid bits. The pepper was sweet with a bit of heat at the end. These were just addicting.  We also ordered a baked chicken cutlet sandwich with broccoli rabe, mozz with prosciutto on hot Italian bread. The sandwich was just delicious. Overall, coming here was def a good decision. We came here for a sandwich and we left with some great food and a new friend. Thanks Mike for a great experience. We will def be back. (354)","This place has the best fresh mozzarella on Staten Island. Five starsIf you want a sandwich stuffed with meat, for a reasonable price, go elsewhere. The photos are all you need to see the facts.","Food here is so good. Both the prosciutto and the fresh mozzarella are both a must try. Fair warning though, if you try it, this is what is going to happen!",Fiorito's Bella Famiglia
122,"Unfortunately did not enjoy my experience here. The thing that I liked most was the ambiance. Other than that nothing really excited me.The sangria was just ok. The chicken quesadilla was bland. The enchiladas tasted stale, I couldn't even finish it. The chimichanga was bland but alright. Never coming back. There's many more Mexican spots to try.",Bartenders are RUDE. will not give my service again. Intentionally embarrassed their customers in front of family members instead of being polite and friendly. Restaurant in general has poor and slow service. Food is nothing to write home about. Not a pleasant experience whatsoever.,"I went  to this restaurant quite often when I lived on SI.  My worst experience ( my experiences here are very inconsistent) was for Mother's Day.  They offered a steak dinner for a prix fix and that is what I ordered.  However, I receive a sub par steak and was told AFTER THE FACT, it was not the prix fix steak, but another steak altogether, and it was awful and overcooked,  Of course, I complained, and I got the stare down from the owner or manager, whatever it was and have never returned since.  I have loved their food, ambiance, whatever for 10 years prior, but after that--I gave up.  They are just too inconsistent or ""moody"" weekend to weekend.  You would think they would've learned by now....","Amazing! What a nice little gem on the north shore! Super inviting, warm, cozy and we had the absolute best service ever!  We had salmon, a tad dry but ok, steak fajitas were very well marinated and yummy. The filet Mignon was amazing. They make their own nachos chips for their nacho platters and the homemade salsa is out of this world, we took some home. The drinks are fantastic and we had the pleasure of listening to some great blues. Will be back for sure!!Only minus was it was very warm inside.","Still giving this place 5 stars because its a great place to hang out, service is always terrific, beer selection is incredible and the food always includes awesome specials.  BUT, they recently took the Dual Diablo Chicken off the menu!  How could you?  This is one of the most simple but unique tex mex dishes Ive had anywhere.  Two different grilled chicken breasts in two different hot sauces that were perfectly balanced to play off each other.  I was shocked to find out it was gone last night.  The table across from us tried to order it too and I noticed an insane amount of chicken fajitas going out that night (which was my replacement), I feel like half of those were people that got it in place of the diablo like me.  If its a costly dish to make thats fine, raise the price, Ill pay it.  I love a lot of stuff on the menu so Ill still come in a lot but that was my favorite.  Bring it back!","This is the place that help me discover my love for Tex Mex food and solidified my love of beer.  The ambiance is great, I've been told many times when I bring people here that they don't even feel like they are on Staten Island anymore.  We bring all our guests from out of town here for a nice meal.I usually get the Diablo Duel Chicken which is 2 different grilled chickens in 2 different hot sauces.  I've also enjoyed the Cowboy Burger and my wife loves the Pecos Chicken.  The Chicken Tacos and Fried Ice Cream are musts as bookends for any meal here.The beer selection is amazing, for any beer snob in your family, this is the place on Staten Island to take them too.  I've discovered so many great beers here.  I usually hold onto the menu so that I can study the 200 or so beers listed in between bites.  My favorite place to go on Staten Island for a night out.  Some nights they have live music as well, 9 times out of 10 this only adds to the experience, they've had some very talented folks come through.  Once and a while you get a band that doesn't understand how to set up their sound correctly, but that's rare.  I've been there live nights where the place is rocking, in a really good way, with the music.The reasonable prices, great tasting food, helpful staff and beer selection give it the top seat on Staten Island for me.",Adobe Blues
123,This is the worst seafood experience I have had in NYC...we arrived to the smell of bleach ....Frankie's crab soup... is Campbell's chunky beef n vegetable with a ton of old bay added. Couldn't really find any crab. Fried calamari way overcooked and under seasoned ....the sauces (hot and sweet) were metallic tasting and inedible also loaded with old bay .Ceasar salad was was topped with bottled dressing and no Parmesan .Linguini n white clam swimming laps in about 1/2 inch of oil. Octopus salad was marginal... oddly seasoned and served on soggy lettuce.If it wasn't for the polite wait staff I would have given it 1 star.,My mother always  said if u cnt anything nice dnt say anything at all........(Crickets),"This is a place my family orders from occasionally because their lobster's are great, however, today's order was an awful experience. When we ordered we emphasized multiple times that we wanted tartar sauce, even if it would have costed extra. The person on the phone had assured us that it would be no problem and that we would receive it (having had an issue several times before). When we received the order we received everything but the tartar sauce, yet again. We called the restaurant upset that we hadn't gotten it despite having asked so many times. The young man on the phone seemed flustered, yet we heard him read off the order to what seemed to be a manager on the other end. After reciting our order we heard a very angry man scream in the most disgusting tone, ""she doesn't get the f*****g tartar sauce"" to which my mom responded, ""who is that yelling in the background I don't appreciate him yelling like that."" He then told us that was his manager. Though we greatly appreciated the delivery driver eventually driving back to deliver the tarter sauce, to top it all off when we finally had our dinner the crab legs were dry and extremely salty (aka had been sitting in the freezer for the last few weeks). Overall, I truly wish the management would have treated their customers better and had just apologized for their mistake instead of getting irrationally angry and this experience wouldn't have left such a stain on our opinion of this establishment.","Best Lunch Ever!!I recently took a friend out for her birthday to Lobster House Joe's. It was so delicious and she was thrilled with her lobster lunch! Everything was just great! I wasn't familiar with the term ""sweet"" for the sauce for the pasta. I was afraid ""sweet"" meant that the sauce had sugar, which I can't stand, so I got the medium and it was a little too hot; the chef came out and said he never uses sugar in his sauce, so I'll know the next time. I was impressed by the food - and the dessert was great - I really can't wait to go back there with my husband.","Food came out quickly. It was tasty and fresh. The eggplant parm was delicious-sweet red sauce was very tasty. The popcorn shrimp appetizer was definitely from the freezer--that was a mistake. My scallops were large and cooked properly. All around great, but docking one star for that cheap popcorn shrimp appetizer. Just take it off of the menu! I'd definitely go back!","Thursday's are $1 oysters.  This place has been here for as long as I can remember.   Seafood is fresh , simply prepared and never disappointing.    Parking lot is a little tight so park on street if you have a long vehicle.   Nice little bar area with 4 seats and about 15 -20 tables spread out for dining . Market pricing is fair and service is good . Our waitress was very attentive to our needs . We had plenty of drinks , napkins and food . I ordered a dozen oysters, fresh and served with lemon slices and cocktail sauce.   Girlfriend had the mussels in sweet red sauce , very good smooth consistency in the sauce .  I had the broiled flounder - 2 filets were cooked perfectly in a buttery wine sauce - superb.  Both dishes were piping hot .   Small crowd was there everyone seemed enjoying themselves . A very local Staten Island crowd.",Lobster House Joe's
124,From Bklyn to Jersey a bit far for me but when available its always worth the trip...,place has closed . under new management. new owner. place renamed as noches de tikicia,"Was here Saturday night for my boyfriends birthday with about 10 people. Service people were nice but all over the place, no one knew whos food was for who, drinks took forever to get (we could see them just sitting at the bar and no one was bringing them to the table) we ordered dessert and also saw it just sitting at the bar with a candle in it and had to ask someone to bring it over already. The food was okay but everyone's rice was just terrible, it threw off the whole meal. It literally tasted as if it came straight out of a box, SO dry and flavorless. No one from our entire party ate their rice it was that un edible. We even heard other people in the restaurant complaining about it. I would not recommend this restaurant, there is much better and fresher Cuban food out there.","Awesome food and great service. Will definitely be back.Went on a quiet Saturday night. Club was jumping downstairs so it was fun background music for us. Lol. Didn't bother us at all. Waiters were attentive and every piece of food we had was delicious. We had Calamari, skirt steak with rice beans and plantains. Steak was tender. Calamari crispy. And plantain was to die for. Yummm. Sangria was on point. Two thumbs up for Tiki Mojito. Can't wait to go back.","This Cuban restaurant is absolutely one of my favorites. The servers are all really nice & they all work together to make sure everything was served promptly. All of our meals were EXCELLENT. Everyone loved they're selections, they were all truly authentic & tasted like my moms or my families Cuban meals. We love coming here and recommend it to anyone that wants to taste an authentic Cuban meal.","We absolutely loved this excellent authentic Cuban restaurant. Being Cuban American makes my ratings extremely tough. We were pleasantly  surprised that every item ordered was delicious, from the appetizer to the dessert. We will be returning in the near future.",Tiki Mojito
125,"Was hoping this place was good but I was disappointed. Forest Thai has been on Staten Island for sometime. I vaguely remember going there years ago and thought their beef satay was really good. Not sure what has changed since then but I can tell you the beef satay was not good.Thai Iced Tea, was terrible. I actually sent it back because it tasted like plastic. I thought I got a bad batch but the table next to me did not like theirs either.  Very disappointing when a Thai restaurant messes up Thai iced tea. Beef Satay, flavor wasn't bad but it was overcooked and dry. No amount of peanut sauce was going to save the meat, and on top of that the peanut sauce was salty. Pad Thai, there was nothing special about the pad Thai as the flavor was light. What annoyed me was the chicken. It was rubbery, tasteless and unpleasant. Usually there is a sauté flavor to pad Thai but mine tasted like it was boiled in water and sauce was poured over it. The people working there was nice but unfortunately the food was no on point.",The food is pretty good and fresh. But the waitress/host (older Asian woman) sucked!! And killed the vibe. She had the audacity to count the money in front of me as if I were going to short change her. I won't be returning ever.,"I really want to commit to liking this place but, every time I go there always seems to be something. Most recently, my date and I stumbled across a bad batch of soft shelled crab. Besides the dish being a little more than deep fried breading, the minimal amount of crab that was there had 'turned' to put it kindly. There was no issue when sending the dish back. On The contrary, the server seemed very willing to remove the dish and not at all surprised. Needless to say I do not recommend the soft shelled crab. I can say the mango chicken, flat thai noodle dishes and, soups are pretty tasty.",This is my favorite Thai food on Staten Island. So many vegan options and everything is delicious! Service is average but the food is just fantastic! A small gem of a restaurant.,"First time coming here and everything was okay. We got fried soft crabs and curry puff for appetizers and a chicken pad Thai for entree. The chicken on the pad Thai was way too dry but the noodle and sauce was on point. Oh yeah we also got a Thai ice tea, but it was way too sweet and didn't really have any tea flavor.","Funny this place always comes back and does ok. Theyre ok thai food for ok price. Considering our island has only 2 other locations that can compete, really have to give these guys a solid 4",Forest Thai Cuisine
126,"My husband and I decided to have lunch at our neighborhood bar. We heard sooo many amazing reviews about this place. I originally wanted to go to Cantina (on New Dorp Lane) but he wanted to try the bacon at Griff's.. we ordered the Peter Luger bacon to start. The bacon was literally thick cut Shoprite bacon with a sauce for $11 (picture included). Then our meals came out. He ordered a cheese burger with fries. We heard this burger was the ""best"" on the island. It wasn't seasoned at all. To top it off, they gave one small piece of tomato, no lettuce, no onion.. it was a sad burger! I ordered the french onion soup and caesar salad. The soup was okay, definitely not the best. The salad was terrible. Instead of caesar dressing they gave me oil and vinegar. It was gross!.. The drinks were whatever. Definitely never going back. Only gave this place 2 stars because the waitress was a lovely women!",Decent food just a little pricey but you get the amount you pay for. Also a little more seasoning could have done the job. I got the cheeseburger quesadilla it was huge.,"This is my second time here and i fucking hated it. Music got louder with every song that played so i was literally screaming to speak. Secondly the waitress delivered our food while talking on the phone and we had to catch the plate because it fell off the table since she acted like she was talking to the president. My cheeseburger quesadilla was so greasy it was dripping down my hand, the pork in the nachos were disgusting, the chicken fingers tasted like fucking tysons chicken nuggets plus they were cold the only thing that was good was the mac n cheese bites (god bless). Could of gotten sick with all the grease, didn't even have a solid server 3 different people came up to us the whole time so check on us and serve us pretty much bullshit. So i guess just come here for drinks and fuck the wack ass food. Gordon ramsey will piss on this place",This place is a sports paradise went in thinking it's going  be a good time I was wrong I had an awesome time in the place sport everywhere you looked the atmosphere was crazy great the food was on point wings pasta burger boom triple boom awesome the service spot on and overall you like sports good food and drinks  that's the spot we should all go to .,The best French onion soup ever!!!!! The flavor was out of this world! Loved how the onions in the soup were cooked well and they even put cheese inside the soup for added flavor besides the top! I also ordered the cheesesteak wrap which never disappoints!,"I've never heard of this place and it's location is definitely a little off. It's across Miller Field in New Dorp, but the food here is what I heard was great. They have high top tables along the wall and some tables in the back near the pool table. I must say though the spacing between behind the bar and bar wall was pretty big. I'm sure if they moved the bar a little closer to the bar wall more tables could be put out. The bartender was a woman with black hair, long lashes, and long nails who checked our ID's when we ordered drinks which is a plus of course. The drinks were strong and served as doubles. I only got to try the mozzarella sticks cause we were unsure on how to order food since it was a group thing. The mozzarella sticks were great. I'd def wanna come to try more of the menu and get the whole restaurant feel instead of the bar feel since it was around 9pm when we arrived.",Griff's Place
127,Can you ever go wrong here ?NEVER I had the Pastrami for lunch it was jam packed with meat ! That soft shell crab when they have them That's a 2 times a week for my family They are known for their burgers  But once in awhile it's nice to change it up !,Ordered a cheese burger blue cheese with bacon medium.  Got the burger over cooked. English muffin...over cooked.  Bacon...over cooked.  Pickles were good...,"First time here after hearing glowing reviews of the burger. The burger, American cheese, cooked medium, living up to all the hype. Kept it simple for the first time but I'll explore different variations in my future visits.","Decided to finally check this place out, people from all over come here for the burger, which is on a English muffin instead of a bun, we went for a early lunch, and thankfully we did, soon after we arrived, the place got packed! I didn't want to look at the menu & order anything but the burger, so that's what I had, with a French onion soup, which was delicious! I had the burger with waffles fries, and a side order of gravy to dip it in. Everything was GREAT! As I was sitting there enjoying my burger, I couldn't stop looking at all the delicious, great smelling dishes that were coming out of the kitchen! So the next time I go, I will make sure to look at that menu! Service was great, the woman taking care of us was very personable, and attentive.","Burger was nicely cooked but the roll was old. Should've jus stuck w the English muffin it comes on. Sweet potato fries speak for themselves. Like fried chicken, you'd have to Try Hard to mess them up. Coffee sucked. Their special penne shrimp vodka was deliciously piping hot, cheesy, spicy and fresh. Very very cool that a pub on the strip serves stellar pasta!",This small place really surprised me. The staff was really friendly and they were very attentive. The mozzarella sticks were amazing and the burger was as well. I don't have a single complaint and will definitely be coming back.,Duffy's Tavern
128,...there was glass in my food. I ordered a chicken tender salad and there were glass pieces covering the chicken tenders (see attached photos).,"First, I will start by saying my delivery took 30 minutes & I only live 6 minutes away. I ordered a deluxe falafel sandwich with french fries & it was pretty good. It was very messy so the sauce got all over & the vegetables fell everywhere. The falafel was great & the pita bread as well. Also, the fries were soggy & soft which isn't what I like, but it's not a big deal. Overall, I would probably order there again & try the rest of the menu.",Solid place to get some greek food - I typically order delivery from here as the atmosphere is nothing special. Recommend the falafel!,"Excellent food... warm, friendly service!!!  The owners Sophia and Dimitri treat everyone as family as you come in!  Prices are reasonable considering the huge delicious portions they serve !","""How Greek It Is?"" Should be more like ""How Staten Island-y It Is."" The food was actually really decent, so no complaints there. I got a monster gyro in an overstuffed pita with a side of fries, and a small cup of some lemony soup (it was either that soup or the chicken orzo soup, which I think this one actually was ... just with a splash of lemon concentrate added, or something. It was fine -- just saying). My colleague -- while ordering his gyro -- tried to be authentic by pronouncing it ""yee-ro,"" and was promptly corrected. He wasn't being sarcastic, just respectful of the culture, I guess.Him: ""I'll have the 'yee-ro' lunch special, please."" Waitress: ""OK, so you'll have the GY-RO, and a soup. Got it. And for you, sir?""Sorry ... for trying? The waitress was perfectly nice and helpful otherwise.The clientele was all locals -- cops from the nearby station house and a couple of tattooed women who seemed to be waiting for their firefighter husbands to come get home from work. And a full bar directly in the doorway was both enticing and ominous. I wondered if it gets busy (and annoying) later for happy hour. I wasn't gonna stick around to find out, though. It was lunch time and I had to get out of this strip-mall borough before the Verrazzano Bridge toll went up again.","I was in the mood for good Greek fare, and I got it at How Greek It Is. The food was delicious and very friendly service as well. I wanted to choose several entree items but I decided to return again and again to try more. I'm definitely a fan!!!",How Greek It Is
129,"As a 10 year vegetarian I'm very disappointed that they only have 3 meatless items on the menu. I got the veggie pita. Here's my thoughts on it: The avocado is cut fresh to order, the cucumbers are sliced way too thick, they don't give you enough tomatoes and they tasted old, their home made hummus is EXCELLENT.My sweet potato fries were completely dried out and burnt (I should have taken a picture)Prices are very high. They should do some sort of promotion discount for students, teachers, nurses, first responders etc......",We've ordered a couple of times. The food is ok. Ingredients are good but both times I felt the dish could use a little acid. Squeeze some lemon or lime on them! My husband said his chicken was dry.,"Very disappointed.  The sweet potato pancakes had black marks on them from the grill, the egg option was scrambled whites only which leads me to believe - they are carton eggs.  Cheap pancake syrup served in little black restaurant containers- not Maple syrup.  Kraft Mayo packets for the bison burger, no GF bread (as offered) and white domino sugar packets for the coffee.  If this were a regular restaurant not offering specialties - I would have not even bothered to walk in or reviewed this place but, the appeal is the advertisement of being a Health food spot and this meal was not healthy at all.  I left the restaurant wondering....what else are you not telling me?  Where is the meat and fish sourced from?  Just another diner on Staten Island,I won't visit again.  Update 9/17/2018I received a note from someone at Nature's Grill Cafe - accusing me of not being a patron, fabricating my experience and being a competitor who is upset that they are in SI.  In his words ""I must be a hater"".  I have attached the correspondence for anyone's viewing.  I am what's called an educated consumer and refuse to give my business to dishonest businesses.  I stand by my review..... I know the difference between maple syrup and thick, gooey cheap pancake syrup.  The Kraft mayo packets are not organic, the domino white sugar and Splenda offered is not healthy and the gluten bread offered on the menu was not available at the time, the pancakes were cooked on a dirty grill.  I was told to call if I had any further questions.  I will not be calling their response is reflective of their lack of customer care,  why would I call a place that customer satisfaction means absolutely nothing.  My only apology is that I didn't take pictures of the food to post for everyone to see.  Good luck","This is my new favorite place! If you want to eat healthy and not compromise taste, it's a must try!I had it delivered, the phone guy was so pleasant, delivery guy was nice, food was steaming hot and so fresh!   Definitely going to be a regular customer! Soup and sides are great also! Yum","Celebrating this as my 100th YELP review!!! I live in Brooklyn and go to the Bay Ridge location regularly.  I just happened to be out in Staten Island and decided to stop by. The menu is the same as the Bay Ridge location. The difference is the size of the location and number of staff. The Staten Island location is HUGE compared to Bay Ridge. There is tons of outdoor seating and it is done very nicely. I happened to come on a night that was warm and you can sit outside. There is lot's of space inside as well. The food is on par with Bay Ridge, there is a parking lot which is a GREAT so you don't have to drive around for a half hour to find parking. Everyone was accommodating and friendly. The quality of the food is good and what is nice is the consistency of delivering a meal that tastes equally as good every time. I would recommend them for casual informal dining, good quality and good service. Probably one of the better places to have an informal meal at on Staten Island.","I love coming here,you would never think eating healthy would be this good the more we come here the better it gets .....eating healthier became our comfort food",Nature's Grill Cafe
130,"I really wanted to like this place but this place is a bit ratchet. My friend and I visited tonight, and boy was it a waste of our time. So the waiter brings the whole sidewalk menu board to our table and tells us that this is the special menu,  like sis was it really too much to remember? The whole board was in our face like  (imagine this big ass door being the sidewalk board).The collard greens were an embarrassment to culture and the chicken was under done. I sent it back and it came back un-done AGAIN! So I asked to see the menu to pick a different meal. I get the Salmon I KID YOU NOT, as I was ordering the Salmon the waitress tells me that the chicken was cooked.  Get this,  Sous Vide style & that the undone look & possibly taste was due to fat in the breast. I should've left but I was hungry.  I told her that I've made chicken very similar to this and it cooked all the way through. Salmon was ok, however the sides were microwaved rice that probably came from a box & the string beans weren't fresh.  Take it from me, don't waste your time.  There's a bunch of other restaurants in Staten Island that know how to cook & serve.","Went back recently and realized this place isn't just good, it's great.  Really consistent cooking, even though the menu rotates often.  The decor and service are also top notch.Vida deserves the support and the businesses springing up around it on the block make it the center of a multiple stop trip.",They have been redeemed!!!  Took my husband for his bday dinner and except for the super small overpriced Vida bites the food was delish.  The Grecian shrimp dish was to die for.,"We have been going to Vida for years. Always a great meal. Food is fresh and prepared from the heart. Silva, the owner, is warm and welcoming.  Service has also always been great, including paying equal attention to our son, which we appreciate as many restaurants often treat children as if they are not at the table. Good wine menu. They offer beer and hard liquor as well. Prices are good for the quality of what you are getting. A gem of a place!",This place is a hidden gem. When you first walk in you're greeted by the most wonderful decor that gives a vibe that you're no longer in SI anymore. It reminds me of being on vacation if you know what I mean. The food is phenomenal to say the least - the chef is amazing. Service is wonderful and attentive. I'm definitely going back next time I'm planning a night out with my SI friends. :),I had really high hopes for this place. I was definitely not impressed with the food. Decor is really cute and warm. Service was very good.. Beer was served in a frozen glass and ice cold. There was only one other table present at the time so I expected the food to be perfect. And I was very HUNGRY. Food was the issue. The salad we ordered was very good. The Mexican themed appetizer was just ok The pork and chicken duo was meh.  I really wanted to like it. But the chicken tasted microwaved and the pork was the same as the appetizer.... Just ok. Feel bad saying it but....Doubt I'll be back.,Vida
131,"Solid place. This is my neighborhood diner, always there to cook for me when I don't feel like it. There for me when there was construction going on in the house and the lights, gas, or water was off. Thank you.",This is a very average diner. Service was okay and the corned beef sandwich I had was rubbery. Ive tried the Turkey club here which was also average.,The food is absolutely disgusting . I ordered a scrambled breakfast platter and I got a plate of shredded cheddar cheese Burnt to the Max is was inedible . The toast was burnt too . It was one of the worst breakfasts I had ever had . I walked down the block and got myself Dunkin' Donuts cause I was still hungry when I left . The service sucked too . The waiter was overwhelmed with all the customers . Too much on one person and it's a very small place . Def will not be returning. . Don't waste your time or money !!!!,"I have not come across many diners in recent years that have a family history in their business and make you feel welcome as a family from the minute you walk in and get seated.  Thanks to Aki, the owner of Staten Island Diner, we did not just enjoy it once on Saturday, but came back again on Sunday, and with only two days in Staten Island with our family, I wouldn't miss coming back the second time. As we came in as a table of 5,  got seated by smiling faces and upbeat servers and it did not take long for Aki to come over and introduce himself.  We told him my wife and I were here visiting our children from out of town, and did not hesitate to hand me the famous coffee mug with his profile picture on it to take home, and insisted we take a picture together with the mug.   Keep in mind, this place was packed and he took the time to spend talking to us, even explaining the history of how his place in the deli business came to be, as his grandfather started another deli on the Island years ago.  Getting to the meat of this place is the menu choices and the food.  My choice in any breakfast place is Avocado Toast and Over Medium eggs. Instead of putting the egg over the Avocado and toast, they serve it with fresh chunks of the Avocado over the eggs,  all on top of the toast.  I ordered the Turkey Sausage on the side and the server put a large portion of 5 meaty sausages on the table. Wow, what a treat. Not too stingy on their portions, in fact quite generous. There is no way that we were going to pass up the PB&J French Toast; 2 pieces of French Toast turned into a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich, topped with powdered sugar, and they served a 4 sandwich portion. Of course, enough for all of us to share.  INCREDIBLE. Have to recommend this dish with anything else ordered.  This was a real treat. My belief is that if I go to any restaurant, and the food is average, but I have fun and feel welcomed, I come back.  At Staten Island Diner, the food is EXCELLENT and we were so welcomed and had a great time too.Thank you Aki for making our trip to Staten Island that much better by starting out our day here.  You made it really special. Yes,, I am using your mug and look at your beard on that mug quite often.  Can't wait to come back and visit.","It's a diner but I like this place. The staff are very nice and the food is good. Try it, you'll like it.",Last night my hubby noticed the diner on the way coming from Alfonso bakery. It was time for dinner and I have noticed the diner in the 30 yrs I've been on the island it wasn't busy but quiet much time on their hands earlier in the evening.My husband ordered the big boy. I ordered mash potatoes and roast beef. The roast beef was so juicy and a big portion I really didn't think I was going to eat it I left my hubby two pieces to try sorry hubby. The mash potatoes tasted like homemade and roast beef was not dry.The young lady who waited on us she was as so attentive and respectful. As we were getting ready to leave people started to come in we thank u for a great dinner,Staten Island Diner
132,First time here. Friday night was crowded and without a reservation only waited 10 min for a party of 4. This is a neighborhood pizza place/ restaurant/ sports bar. Many televisions. Many crying babies. Loved the pizza but the other food was just passable. Cold antipasto was stuff out of a marinated jar. No prosciutto or ham. No slices of provolone or mozzarella cheese. Fried calamari had no taste and was greasy. ShrimpParm hero wasn't good either. Shrimp was not great quality and was overly fried. Pasta with vodka sauce was ok. I'd come back for the pizza only. Crust was delicious,"The food is usually good, but their delivery service is atrocious.  Good food that is over an hour to deliver then gets to you cold is not enjoyable.  A tip may be to add more delivery drivers so they are not sitting around waiting on 5-10 orders before goin out, you will sell more","If I could give zero I would, worst food I ever had, it was so bad I'm throwing it out smh the only thing I found edible that didn't make its way into the napkin or trash was the baked clams. I had ordered the hot antipasto from Grubhub","I went to Jimmy Max this past week for a lunch - my sister's track team was doing a fundraiser with the establishment and 50% of the check went to them. Immediately I thought this was very generous and love that this local business is supporting the Staten Island community. We ordered fried zucchini as an appetizer and each of us got our own hero. The fried zucchini came out piping hot and was extremely fresh. We could not stop eating them throughout the course of our meal. I ordered the Mary Max hero. It was similar to a chicken francese. There was definitely a lot of chicken in it but I wish there was either more sauce or cheese it seemed to be lacking a little bit of flavor. The price was definitely worth it though for the amount in the hero - plus I had the other half as my lunch the next day!I will definitely be coming back to Jimmy Max again. There is so much on the menu that I am looking forward to trying. I couldn't get over the variety of appetizers, dishes, and pizzas.","Great food, great service and family friendly. Everything from appetizers to desert will impress you. Now, let's talk pizza. The pizza is off the hook good. Thin crust and delish.","First Post...Jimmy Max - Max Brunch Burger $10.95Bacon, Egg, and Cheese on a Brioche Roll... with a hamburger! Ordered medium, came out medium. Very juicy, flavor to the meat, bun exactly as it should be, very brioche-ey. Egg was fried well, so no goo running down the burger, but the cheese was melted nicely and did run down the burger. Bacon was good. Served with home fries...cubed potatoes and onions, decently seasoned... Bonus Points... staff at the bar are great on a Sunday. Friendly, attentive, quick to tend to your needs...",Jimmy Max
133,Terrible food! This food made my coworker and I sick where she had to go to the ER. The sauce tastes spoiled. They have nerve to charge the prices they do with such inferior food!,"My fiancé and I just ordered two entrees and a side dish from here totaling over $40.00.  We were extremely disappointed by not only the two hour wait for delivery but in the quality of food from this place. The food was cold, the portions were extremely small - it seemed as if someone had already eaten half of the meal. Additional what was left of the food was old and the salad was brown and spoiled. When my fiancé called them to try to get our order redelivered we were first told that there was nothing we could do and then we were yelled at and told that there is nothing wrong with their food no one ever complains and they hung up on us. Order at your own risk.",I wish I can get my money back! Overpaid for a flimsy salad that cost 20$ that had one spoon of lettuce. (Chicken spinach salad) Which all the ingredients use doesn't even cost 20$. Than the chicken kabab again 18$ not worth the price. The amount they serve you is stupid. You get more food in a halal cart for half or less of the price. Food is not worth it. Rather drive to Brooklyn cheaper and better tasting food. The portion isn't worth the price.,Loveeee the sumac fries and lamb shawarma! Everything is always juicy and seasoned. Great food. Favorite place for takeout.,"When Sumac first open on SI, the food was excellent. Then the owner changed and the food/service became terrible. I never went back there until recently, because the place I wanted to go was closed. I thought to myself, lets give it a try, maybe they improved over the years. Well, let me tell you: WHAT A LET DOWN! The service is still crap, and the food is still just mediocre. Definitely not fresh. I will never be back, which is a shame because I love the type of food, just not theirs.",Best hallal pulled  pulled pork gyro around !   The only pulled pork that I found to be better was at the concession stand on Bingo night in the mosque on victory BLVD.,Sumac
134,"Went there with the family because of the reviews on this site and was so piss. The food sucks, the wait is crazy since they care of their deliveries before than the physical clients and the staff is very unprofessional. Was hoping to find good authentic Mexican on the island but this is not the place, won't be back.","The food is authentic the staff is friendly and professional and is fairly priced. Only negative is you can't order the taco meat by the pound. You have to order individual tacos, which can get pricey and no parking.","Based on food quality alone, I would give them four stars, it's savory, made it the right amount of oil, and the portion sizes are decent. I had the Azteca taco and the quesadilla. The service was kinda slow though, and I had to try hard just to get their attention for my order when not much was going one,","One of the best hidden secrets of Bay Street, a walking distance from the ferry. Bay Street breathes culture and has changed throughout the years. One long standing taqueria helped shaped the street of victory Blvd where you can have authentic Spanish food. Ranging from stuffed tacos priced at $2.75 to cemitas at $8. You can't go wrong with this place. My favorite is definitely chorizo quesadilla that is stuffed and over sized. The cemitas was loaded and weighed probably about 2 pounds.","This place is one of the best taco places I have had in New York! I would give this place a 4.5 and the main reason is because of their limited menu. From the outside this place looks pretty small but it is pretty authentic.  We went with 2 steak tacos, 2 chicken tacos, 1 pastor taco, 1 carnitas taco and a steak quesadilla with a side of avacado. They make the food fresh and it is not a long wait at all. The portions sizes here are HUGEEEE, you are definitely getting your money's worth here. The flavors here are amazing and my favorites are definitely the pastor and carnitas taco. Those two were extremely well seasoned and I regret getting just one of each. For avacado, you give you sliced avacado and not guac which is a bummer but we ended up putting the avacado inside the quesadilla which made it better since the quesadilla was a bit dry. However, the size of the quesadilla was huge and he put a lot of meat inside it. Overall, super friendly staff and amazing tacos and I will definitely be returning to this place in the future!!",My torta chorizo was was very good. Happened to be in the area... Not sure expecting to eat a meal...Service with a smile. Food made right in front of you.,Taqueria El Gallo Azteca
135,"A picture says it all. Forest BBQ's definition of ""half chicken"" but who knew that means half pieces of chicken?!? I wish I snapped a pic of the ""half garlic chicken"" which is 2 chicken cutlets in an aluminum foil wrapped garlic soup! Let me break down the events of the evening that led to this horrendous experience: -delivery over an hour-the driver didn't even get out of the car but passed methe food through his window-the owner threatened us on the phoneDo yourself a favor stay away.",This place is horrible!And customer service sucks!!They barely speak English and if you don't speak their language they have crazy attitudes!!Over priced garbage food..Garlic BBQ right down the street is much better..,"Ok ordered whole chicken with two sides rice and fries on a regular basis ,because the ribs are dry and inedible, price was always 20 dollars. Received order paid with credit card. I checked  my bank statement and noted they charged my card 30 dollars. Called the manager, she was not very helpful. Will never order here again.  Cash or card. That's not the way to do business. Sad!",My boyfriend and I went here a few days ago we were passing by and saw they had a sign at the window that says 2 PC's chicken lunch special w/rice and beans for $6 so we decided to check it out. We went in and placed 2 orders w/salad to eat in. Well let me tell you it was worth the money they gave alot plus the passion fruit juice was great.,"This place is a Portuguese style BBQ.  The seasoning on the chicken is different from the other BBQ places.  Got the lunch special two pieces chicken with rice and beans, beef rib, chicken & cheese empanadas and fresh passion fruit juice.  The chicken was well seasoned with crispy skin and not dry.   The beef rib was freshly grilled.  The empanadas was ok.  The fresh passion fruit juice tasted like it came from a powder mixed.  The service needs a lot of improvement.  The person taking order barely speaks English.  We waited over 15 minutes for the beef ribs and she forgot my chicken, rice and beans until we asked her. We were the only table at the restaurant.",Had the lunch special with rice and beans. Well seasoned chicken and good amount for such a great price! Tasted the short ribs my friend had and was cooked well too. Can't go wrong here for a quick bite (a little bit of wait but not bad) and cheap eat.,Forest BBQ
136,My husband and I have been there multiple times and have ordered take out many times as well. We have never had a complaint about this place until today. We placed an ordered for delivery at 5:15pm three hours later and still no food. Five phone calls later and no food. Last call I got the owner who wasn't very pleasant about the fact I've been extremely patient about our delivery only to have her say what you want me to do about it. So ordered cancelled. Never going back there again! The level of customer service it's at most mediocre if not extremely unprofessional! Too bad because we loved that place. Never giving them our business again!,"Okay I hate to do this cause honestly I'm not here to bash a place but today was just not a good first experience. My sister made a reservation for my father's birthday and we get there and the people seemed very unenthusiastic. Which whatever we got there and settled in, the waitress brings the menus and we weren't ready to order so we took a few minutes. First we ordered stuffed artichoke, shrimp cocktail, and fried calamari and the calamari never came out. We ordered the food took forever! We didn't even remind her about the calamari missing but whatever. We got three orders of the special lobster ravioli and my husband had a shell in his dish. We told the waitress, which she spoke so low, you could barely hear her and she didn't do or say anything. Said she would see what they do and they still charged us for it. The bartender/manager which wasn't the manager comes over and says THE CHEF SAID ITS OKAY TO HAVE SHELLS IN THE RAVIOLI. And says u understand? No I don't understand actually tell the chef to come out and eat shells in front of my face. Cause you can most definitely choke on shells in sauce and in ravioli. My sister goes to the restroom and over here's the waitress saying we're weird? If Gordon Ramsay himself was to come here this place would be closed! And btw three flys we're flying all around and I'm surprised there was an A on the door. But I don't see that lasting long. They make you sign the receipt before u swipe the card which honestly is not right. And also the waitress was no where to be seen and she automatically added each check which there was three a 20% gratuity. Honestly this place was a pure shit show!","Horrible service Bartender claims to be owner is a RACIST. The Blonde hair bartender, who happens to. be a Caucasian women  on Thursday 05//02/2019 ruined my cousins wedding reception. Charged my family tax on a cash reservation after the dinner. DO NOT GO HERRE OF YOUR NOT WHITE OR POSSIBLY SPANISH. if you're African American be careful.!!!!!!","I just came here to celebrate my aunt's 50th birthday and it was such a nice time. The area we were seated in was classy with elegant touches in the decor. The food and service were the best part though. The food came out very fast and the quality and quantities were even better. The pizza is comparable to any fancy italian place in manhattan. The chicken wings were juicy, tender, and crunchy. The stuffed chicken marsala with cheese and ham was also delicious and filling. It was a cross between chicken cordon bleu and chicken marsala. The servers were very accommodating and friendly-- always checking up on us and making sure all our food was delivered. This was definitely a perfect fit for the occasion","Solid delivery experience from Bella Mama Rose.Everything was packaged neatly, no runs no errors no drips.Ricotta white pie was outstanding, garlic, olive oil, high quality mozzarella and ricotta....highly recommended Fried shrimp, solid portion with a good marinara sauce to dipChicken Parmigiana sandwich, very good. Comes with a choice of salad or friesWe will order again....one strike against them and the reason for the star deduction....one item was forgotten","Went to dinner with my sister (615 on a Friday) I have a coworker that loves this place. Service was great, food was good. The restaurant was consistently busy with diners and take out. I'm vegetarian so I always get eggplant parmesan.I thought the marinara sauce was on the sweet side but my sister liked it.I would go back to try a stuffed rigatoni that sounded good.",Bella Mama Rose
137,"Go for the pizza, stay away from the appetizer samplerStarted with the appetizer sampler that consisted of fried foods. Mozzarella sticks were horrible; worst ever tasted. Buffalo calamari was chewy in pieces. A $20 disaster. And it comes with fries too. Big deal!Pizza is really good, although the Grandma Sicilian was too chewy. Crust crunchy, bottom chewy. Not how I expect a Grandma to be. Stick with round.Service a little bit weird and spotty","Your slightly above average pizza place, but for the price, I probably wouldn't have deliberately came to Staten Island for this. The Sicilian upside slice is definitely a good choice (stick with this one)-- per recommendation of another Yelp review. The AC was broken at the time of my visit, but if you sit at the bar side near the window, it's bearable.The weird thing is that I tried to get a soda from the fridge and immediately after I took it from the fridge, my hand SUDDENLY lost grip and I dropped it on the floor. It was the weirdest thing... a few minutes later I discovered that I had a sharp pain on my thumb and it started bruising up-- this actually doesn't really affect my thoughts on the place, but I thought it was weird since nothing hit me and I didn't bump into anything as it occurred... I am merely relating my story to another Yelp review describing how this place was built on an ancient burial ground... so there's my random story.",Good pizza Slow delivery with a $1.00 charge and overpriced drinks A 2 liter coke $7.00 Lost the business of the Ferry Crews because of it we spend a good amount of money a $27 pie you could give away a $ 2.00 soda not charge $7.00For it Posted the receipt by the time clock to let all our 3 shifts how messed up this place has become,Good local restaurant.They are nice Devore I very ordinary.Food is good.

138,"This place is an absolutely disgusting, rude mangers and very rude staff.avoid this place and go take you business some where else","The food is good, but the service was terrible.  Talk about wanting more, we waited over 20 mins to get the wine list, then another 15 to place a drink order.  Shouldnt be surprised that our waiter never came back to check on us once our food arrived and that I had to ask 3 different people for water before receiving some.  We gave up and left before they offered us the dessert menu.  For $75/ person, I'd expect more attentive staff.",Dinner was amazing as always but the waiter was really slow and kept taking forever to come to us.,"Great food and service , a New Dorp staple. My preference is lunch because of the crowds at dinner but that is no reflection on the restaurant and only a personal preference. A crowded restaurant is more important then what any wanna be restaurant reviewer in Yelp could ever say. Worth the trip!","I'm gonna start with the positive points, service was good, clean and drinks were good. Atmosphere was nice and warm. Negatives points.. the food gave me and my husband diarrhea. I got very disappointed because we picked this place to celebrate our 4th year weeding anniversary.Won't be returning here","Service was sooo slow! Literally waited 15 minutes for a menu. Waited had an attitude. No joke the food took an hour and 15 to arrive! Im never coming back. Place had a nice look , the food was average for the price",Brioso
139,"Garlic experience, if you want to eat garlic it might be a nice place, i ordered a Bolognese fettuccini, there was no meet at the sauce, a bit acid and full of garlic. Ok perhaps is how they liked Then I ordered a Creme Brûlée what a Sad experience was based cornstarch it came with a Vanilla  icecream ball, the ice cream get no melted after 7 min, deciding to write thisBottom line pricy not good quality food, ok but not good for what they charge.The service very good!I hope my experience was due to the choices I made.","The food here is average. There is no beer on tap. The wine selection is limited. There is a happy hour menu which provides some small and tasty selections for about seven dollars per dish. These are worth trying. For breakfast, there is no espresso coffee just the regular drip filter. Overall, for a for a restaurant attached to the Hilton, it is a disappointing experience.","I came her to celebrate my dad's birthday and I cannot Recommend this restaurant. Where do I begin? To start, we ordered a few appetizers. Calamari and mussels. Mussels were ok but the calamari was HARD as a rock. It was so hard that I couldn't put my fork in it.Delmonico's ribeye? 1/4 inch thick? Forget about it! Steak tasted like it was straight from the freezer. Bland, no taste. Cmon, Lorenzo's! Throw some salt and pepper on it!  I could of made a better steak at home with my eyes closed.Price wise your going to be spending close to 100 dollars per person if you order apps, entree and a couple of drinks.Would I return? Hell no! Too many options on the island. This is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to Italian and the island.",I was staying at the Hilton Garden Inn for business and I was hesitant to try this place because I'm an avid Yelper and the 3 stars made me wary. Travel fatigue won and I wandered down for dinner. I found a quiet spot at the bar and was immediately found by an attentive and kind bartender. I ordered the parpadelle at the recommendation of the bartender and the Italian salad. I was impressed at how fresh the veggies in the salad were and the perfect amount of vinaigrette dressing. I was offered fresh ground pepper and it took the salad over the top. My pasta was tasty too! Shrimp was cooked to perfection and was of good size! There was plenty of shrimp in the dish and the tomato sauce was flavorful too.Overall I highly recommend swinging through. Not sure why this place only has 3 stars-definitely deserves 4!,A really nice restaurant attached tied to the HGI.   Breakfast is also served here.    This is a combined dinner and breakfast review.   Ample seating and a full bar with decent seating.   Lots of tall tops in the bar and 4 tops in the main room.  There is a stage for bands or shows.   There is a wine room for groups.    The food is good to very good.   I had the cavatelli after reviewing the menu for a good 10 min.   I juts couldn't make up my mind.  I spiced up the cavatelli with Parm and black pepper.   I wish the sausage would have been spicier. Order the lemon caper sauce for your bread.   Wow is it good.   Bread also comes with 3 different options. Oil peppermix and butter.   My colleagues were both clean plate rangers on their seafood parapadelle dish.  Neither stopped eating until it was gone.    Breakfast is hot and cold for $14.95.   I asked for poached eggs.  They were runny instead of the medium I expected.   I should have had the omelet.  Turkey and pork sausage options.  Bacon of course.  They also do Pancakes.   Normal fruit and breads.    Worth the money if you don't have status at Hilton.   We will be back to the HGI and this restaurant,Very nice establishment for an evening meal. Was staying next door at the Hampton Inn and didn't want to jump into an Uber. Took the short walk over to Lorenzo's and was treated like royalty. Had the linguine and vodka sauce. Very nice. Could have used a meatball with it however I'll remember in my next visit. There's also a ver is impressive 9/11 memorial next to the Hampton and is worth checking out.,"Lorenzo's Restaurant, Bar & Cabaret"
140,"Ordered a cheesesteak with wiz. Decent. My two issues with this place is the following:1)After i placed my order and paid, i asked to use the restroom and was told they do not have a restroom, but i am more than welcome to go next door (to another restaurant) and use theirs. Oh, ok.2)They have a self serve soda machine displaying COCA COLA PRODUCTS. Which is why i bought a fountain drink instead of a bottle. To my surprise, what came out of that machine was ANYTHING BUT coca-cola. Not only was the syrup/taste disgusting, but there was hardly any carbonation. Honestly this is a disgusting business practice, and i placed a call to Coca-Cola to have their machine removed.Will never step foot in here again.",The f...ing lady with the tattoo have a bad attitude I will not return good luck to the owner...,This place should get closed down. I placed an order only to receive 2 phone calls saying they don't have the items I ordered. How are they still in business? How do you not have items on your own menu? Absolutely unacceptable.,"This location is small but the cashier was very friendly and the food was super good! Greasy but those garlic fries were fantastic! Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs because the portions were large and we couldn't finish it all. 3 of us shared 2 sandwiches, rice balls, and garlic fries. The soda machine wasn't working but it was Pepsi anyway (yuck). Would definitely recommend.","Maybe a 2.5 :(. Called in an order for pickup - ordered vodka parm rice balls, vodka chicken parm hero, and the Fat Goomba Boy, which had chicken tenders, mozz sticks, maple bacon, bbq sauce, and mayo with whiz.Had the hubby ask to make sure all the cheeses were pasteurized and was told ""they should be"" which was very comforting.The vodka parm rice balls were teeny tiny - four of them for $7ish, didn't seem worth it. The flavor was decent, and it actually had some vodka sauce, but nothing to write home about. Both sandwiches seemed super skinny (though they were long), so at first glance didn't seem worth the price (was a little over $33 for the three items). The Fat Goomba was actually pretty good - it had a decent amount of sauce and filling, though it was so saucy and oily, and the wax paper they used was super thin that it stuck onto the sandwich and ripped when you tried to peel it off so you had to carefully pull it off, which was annoying. Was a pretty good sandwich overall, but still a bit pricey for the size.The vodka chicken parm however was incredibly disappointing. The chicken was dry, the cheese was hard, and there was absolutely no sauce on the sandwich (see photo). No one would've guessed it was supposed to be a vodka sauce chicken parm. Was so sad about this because I was the most excited to try this. It could be my fault that I didn't order a cheesesteak (since they're called G Knows Cheesesteaks), but I would think everything on the menu should be at least decent. There are a lot of different items on the menu so it's possible some of the other items would've been better. Had such high hopes given the rave reviews, but super disappointed. Would probably not return :(",Yummy rice balls with parmigiana cheese. I have never had anything like it. I tell you it had so much sauce and you can tell it's homemade. I called my husband and told him. Wow! The serving was perfect too.Yeah I went to a cheesesteak place for rice balls. But I was glad I did.I would recommend going to G-Knows Cheesesteaks,G-Knows Cheesesteaks

I asked her to repeat the total nicely because I couldn't understand her well and she was so rude,Ordered sushi for myself and son. Went to open the container and I noticed there was a roach crawling around the food. Put the lid back on and brought everything back for a full refund. I will never be ordering from them again.,Helpful staff .Quick service  .Tasty sushi and clean and fresh.  Plentiful parking. Prices are decent.,"Genki has a pretty standard selection of sushi when compared to other sushi restaurants- offering combination specials, specialty dishes, or if you prefer, a la carte orders of sushi rolls so that you can make your own combination.The food is pretty good, however it feels a little bit more expensive than some of their neighboring sushi restaurants in the NY/NJ area. For example, for a salmon roll, I've seen some restaurants offer a dollar cheaper per roll for the same size.The restaurant itself is pretty dim and dark, but in an inviting way for a more modern sushi restaurant. The food also came out FAST considering the amount of food that my party ordered (around 13 rolls).I had a good experience overall, and if you're willing to dish out a few extra dollars, you'll have a good meal.","Genki had a dining room with no gents- actually I was treated to a private dining experience when trying this place out for lunch  There were some take out orders. I found this restaurant while grocery shopping in the same plaza and am glad that I did! They don't skimp on the fish- some of the most generous sizes in rolls that I've ever seen!

Came here with a friend during weekday and the food was good, but the experience was completely thrown after we were about to leave. As the restaurant was closing, the chefs left, and the lights were switched off in the kitchen area. As we were about to leave we heard a symphony of rats/mice squeaking behind the kitchen counter area. It was loud and piercing. The waitress was seen to run to the manager and they had a giggle in their language. I am not one to make a fuss, but i HAD to mention it to them. This was completely unacceptable and frankly, disgusting. It was evident that they knew as they tried to cover it up and said that it was the heating pipe. it was not. they need to do an overhaul --- QUICK !","Sushi is always delicious here, just a bit overprice. It's nicely decor, light music, good for family, group or a date.1. Butter lobster roll taste just like the name and it had real lobster meat2. Mummy roll, the tuna melted in your mouth, crispy shrimp tempura and the mango sauce gave it a sweet taste3. American roll is a typical shrimp tempura roll - pretty basic and can't go wrong with this4. King crab and shrimp roll, was refreshing, a mix of flavor and stuffed, the guacamole tasted fresh",Recently quality has changed. Really gone downhill. They must have sold the place. The service isn't good. The food has gotten worse. And they are very cheap. Nickel and dime you for anything extra you ask. A bottle of lychee sake is $35. I googled it and it's an $8-10 bottle! It's not even real lychee. Wtf?! It also wasn't cold. We asked them to chill it. They declined and gave us a cup of ice. Ok. The tuna tar tar was just ok. It used to be so good. It was so bland. And came w 2 stale garlic bread pieces. We asked for more. They wanted to know how many we wanted and then charged us $1 for 4For stale bread. Like what?!The risotto used to be delicious. It was so bland. We asked for more cheese and the waitress looked at us like she had never heard the word cheese before. We literally had to explain it to her. Weird. The mummy roll had like zero lobster. We thought they forgot it. It's just shrimp tempura w like a tiny piece of tuna and some avocado. It wasn't much different than a shrimp tempura roll. Don't order special rolls. It's a waste. My sister asked for a few more pieces of broccoli and they wanted $6 for it. The drinks are bland. We tried lychee sake Bellini. Lychee martiniAnd passion martini All weak and tastelessWe returned a drink we didn't like and it was still on bill. Waitress said no but I didn't charge you for this other drink. They were not same price though. Shady. Check ur bill. Ask prices. Especially before asking for any modifications.,"The zagat review posted by the door inside says this place is as close to a Manhattan experience as you'll get on SI. But you'll pay for it as if you were in Manhattan. Very true. So this place is more of a special occassion, once in a while, night out kind of place. Probably won't turn into your go to order take out place. The service is ok. Good enough. The food is pretty good, but don't expect authentic japanese. The whole place is fusion.It's quality but the prices are a bit much, even for SI. The tuna pizza is yummy. So are their soups. If you go on a Fri/Sat night, it's very crowded and people are there to be seen (which is funny I think for SI, but anyway).

Chicken was undercooked. Steak was over cooked. Some of the meats were not even edible. I am a good eater, can eat things even if I don't like it but could not do it with some of the meats here. The mashed potatoes and the salad were the best part. Shrimp was good first time they came around second time was not as good. Creamed spinach had no taste. Was looking forward to coming here but I guess came on a bad night because I was very disappointed.",The food was amazing specially the shrimps and filet mignon The service was greatVery friendly staff Highly recommended,"A few things about this place.  Service: very slow and unprofessional. They take such a long time to bring the meats around, possibly done on purpose so people get full faster. Wait time: we had reservations; however took about 15 minutes to get the table ""ready."" The place was half emptyPrice: we went for Mother's Day. They charges $68 for less food than what they give on the regular menu, which is $42. They also reduced the sides from 3 to 2, even though they charged more. Pretty ironic. Food: they only have 5-6 kinds of meats. All cheap cuts. Their filet tasted like London broil. Shrimp and chicken were good.  Sauces:  were good but they should give you more when you ask for.  Alcohol: pitcher of sangria was $35. Come on!!Dessert: probably bought frozen cheesecake from shop rite. Bill was $500, they include gratuity on the bill, which is a pretty cheap move.",Since my last review I have came back to Chef Mikes' two other times. This visit was for my Mothers Birthday.

Most people come here for rodizio but we decided on ala carte tonight. We started off with a main entree as an app . The vegetable risotto and asked to add shrimp.  This dish was a perfect dish to share. I found it well seasoned. It was creamy and the vegetables was carrots and string beans. The shrimp was 6 to an order. For dinner I order the hazelnut encrusted salmon with blood oranges reduction. Rice pilaf baby carrots and cippolini onions. Salmon was juicy and the reductions was tart and sweet from the orange.  We also ordered the short rib burger that came with fried provolone roasted tomato on brioche and tater tots. We asked for the truffle mayo on the side. I found this to be very unique and super tasty. For dessert we decided to share the peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream. The cobbler was delicious. Not to sweet. What ever menu you order from you Def won't go wrong here. The staff is super nice and they def aim to please. This is a def must try!,Chef Mike's Rodizio Grill
144,"I've eaten at and from R.A. Deli for a couple of years. Although I've run into problems with staff forgetting to pack paid for food or having to reorder food after telephoning in, I've never had a complaint abrsterout their food. Yesterday was the first time I ever got poor tasting food. Family Combo 2 was picked up for me and I discovered that all 3 fried pork chops were over cooked. They were very fried hard and was completely tasteless. Thank goodness for the chicken soup I bought or I would have gone to bed hungry. Are there different cooks now? I'm now afraid to place an order by telephone. What a shame I'll miss having there meals.","I ordered food for my Daughters birthday party and I regret it 100%. First the catering for beef stew is 140 for a full try (large,)). I didn't care how much it cost but when I opened up the train at the dinner the meat was black. Nobody in the party served themselves this $140.00 beef stew. I had to throw the whole thing out. They cut the meet in giant square cubes and it was dry hard and the color of it was horrid. Full tray of rice, garbage, it looked good, but I guess it wasn't. I personally don't know because I was so pissed off I didn't even try it. Never again!","So I've been taking lunch from this place for over 10 years.  I've watch them grow and get passed down the family tree.  Unfortunately with time came less attention to the way the food tastes, attitude of the staff and upkeep of the place.  The only thing that didn't failed to deteriorate are the prices, those are on a steady unrelenting clime.  It all culminated today when I stopped by for a light lunch of fish and salad.  It started with me browsing the selection of food alone in an empty place for more then ten minutes, empty of costumes and staff... at noon!  When finely I get service, refuse mandatory rice and ask for pice of fish alone she stuffs the plate with FIVE Tilapia files.  My plea about the overabundance of fish go ignored, instead she asked what else would I like.  I should of quit right there but I didn't and I ended up with plate full of fish topped with cabbage and radish salad.  Then came the ""squeeze"" and presto, fish cabbage sandwich!!! And how much you ask I paid for this culinary marvel....?  $10 ...no rice no soda.  So I'm sitting here eating my warm bitter salad and fishy dried file trying to justify two stars, ....fine! for old time sake.","Given the price, food quality, quantity, and consistency, you really cannot go wrong with this place.  I've been going here for years, have never been disappointed, and doubt you will be.  Comfort food at its best.  Give this place a try...","Did you ever walk into a restaurant or deli and everything smells and looks so good.....so much so that you can't wait another moment to eat their delicious food? That's how I felt walking in, the beautiful smells of their Latin delights.....like a teenager on prom night...This location has a huge case of hot prepared food, soups, stews, roasted pork, roasted chicken, 3 different types of rice, at least 2 different types of beans....it was a festival of sight and smell.Unfortunately the festival was rained out.....I ordered a plate with Pernil (roasted pork shoulder) and arroz con gandules (rice with pigeon peas)I added a Papa Rellena (stuffed potato croquet)The food looked beautiful however it did not deliver on flavor, what a let down!The pork had zero seasoning, the rice again no seasoning. Thankfully we have adobo at my office and that helped. The Papa Rellena was solid.Price for the plate was in the $12 range.I'll be honest, As an Italian I make a pretty mean pernil with arroz con gandules and quite frankly my Latin cooking blows theirs away and for me it's a hobby.","Three stars based solely on taste. The food here is very good, don't get me wrong. But they could do a little bit of a better job at preparing the food. I've picked excess chicken skin and fat out of my BBQ chicken, the skin has also fallen off the chicken and has laid in the broth of chicken soup, as well as it's visible that the vegetables haven't been shaved or properly cleaned. Overall, the taste is there. There is good parking, as well as good prices.",R A Deli Dominican Food
145,This place is great! Gem of a spot if you're looking for something different! Ceviche is to kill for OMG!,"Food is delicious. I was new to the area and decided to give this place a try. Reasonably priced for the most part. However their hours are not consistent. At this point we had visited plenty of times. We came by an hour before closing and we weren't able to be served. Very frustrating. Walked in, waited to be seated and the host and server said we couldn't dine in. At this point it was a little past 8. We asked when they closed and they said 9. I was in awe that they openly stated they're open until 9 but we weren't able to eat at 8pm...","Some of the food was quite good (jalea, papa huancaina), unfortunately some was mediocre (ceviche). Service was really awful, waiter disappeared for long stretches, and someone in our party was served 15 minutes after everyone else. When I saw the automatic 15% tip i understood why the waiter was not attentive. Very clean, nice ambiance, but we won't be coming back.",Found this place off of Google maps when we were coming from Newark. The menu was decently priced and the ambiance was very nicely decorated. It's clean and the staff was friendly! My only complaint would just be the wait for the food. We were one of 2 families that were in the restaurant and it took awhile for our food to come to us. They gave us something to munch on (I think they were corn nuts?) while we waited. The place still gets 5 stars though because all of our food was delicious! The beef was a little tough but seasoned nicely. The snapper was delicious and easily fed 2-3 people. The flavor was THERE. And that's why I will be back and bringing more friends whenever I'm in the area.,"Truly Peruvian food in a nice and clean restaurant  the best,try the ceviche and the parrilladas.","Very good experience. Amazing service and pretty good food. I was waited by Miller, very attentive and made very good recommendations. I ordered the combo Marino, made of four different foods, Ceviche, chicharrón de calamar, causa de atún y arroz con mariscos. Very good overall. Only one that I didn't find great was the ceviche. I love the traditional ceviche. I think that by not using as much lemon and instead making it in their sauce, the fish is not being fully ""cooked"" on lemon and it comes out a bit hard for my taste, although I think some people may like it better like this. Definitely will come back. Miller made the experience even better.",Stancia Peruvian Fusion Restaurant
146,"Grandma...nuff said.best pizza on the island, if you stop by this place you HAVE TO GET the grandma.  chicken roll is good too if you have room but chances are grandma will make you go back for more.","Let me start by saying If I find a cheese pizza that is good , I am like a kid in a candy store.  I found this place by spot and stop. Meaning I was on my way to another place, I spotted this one and decided to stop. I gave them a 5 based on the cheese pizza and he crust. OMG!!!!  The slices are huge. I got 2 but the other one went to a guy who had fallen on hard times. He asked for a Dollar to get something to eat.  I thought hmmmm, I'm not going to eat this other slice. I gave him the slice and gave him a buck so that he didn't think I was trying to get out of giving him cash. Anyways back to the food. They have a variety of pie's and stuffed itmes on display. Now I'm not being funny when I say this but it is located in Staten Island, and not in the best part of town. But hey it's good pizza.","Brothers was where me and my coworkers would pick up food every friday for lunch. It was nearby, pizza was okay and it was easy. We gave them a ton of business for about 3 years now. However, upon my recent visit last week, as the man rang up 2 slices, he asked for $8 although the register said $6. When we pointed this out, since a slice is usually $3. He immediately said ""oh, next week the prices are changing to $4 a slice."" Another employee chimed in that yes, next week prices are changing. So basically they tried to overcharge us but we noticed the register said differently. And now its gonna be $4 a slice? Yeah, no thanks, your pizza isnt that good. And its cash only anyway which is annoying. We will all start ordering from Deninos and that will be that.","I came here on a Monday when Denino's was closed, but I thought it was a hearty if not a gigantic delightful pizza. We split a pepperoni pizza, and even for 3 people we couldn't finish it. It's really not something that's easy to eat with one's hands. The slices are huge and it's heavy from the cheese, but if you use a knife and fork, that's easy to overcome. It was overloaded with pepperoni and had a great flavor to it. Definitely don't need to ask for extra cheese. Service was good. We did start with calamari which was good but nothing amazing. If you enjoy pizza leftovers, this is good one or if you go with 4 people it would be enough. There's a small parking lot in back, but if that's full, there should be street parking nearby.","Damnnnn bro.Still my favorite pizza in New York (ok, maybe Ben's near NYU)... Definitely on Staten Island, and one of my favorite in the entire country... Still the best place late night or Friday or Saturday... Still the best place to go grab a plain slice or a Sicilian or something else any other day of the week. The prices have gone up a little bit over the years and it's not really the brothers that run it anymore... It's one of their sons and a bunch of random dudes, but they still maintain the flavor pretty well. The slices aren't as cheesy or as big as they used to be years ago, but they're still one of the best.","Oh no what happened Brother's? I used to love your mozzarella sticks and today I had no idea what I was eating.Brother's has been a long Staten Island pizzeria since God knows when. They have the best grandma slice/pie hands down and their other pizzas are not bad either. Their other usual go to is their chicken roll which is almost a must get when you stop by.Today I wasn't in the mood for a chicken roll but I really wanted a couple of grandma slices and mozzarella sticks. The slices as always were on point.  The crust just a bit crispy with a nice chew to it while the sauce, cheese and basil compliment each other. My mozzarella sticks were not good. They had no stringy-ness to them and the breading felt almost commercial.Overall I would recommend Brother's for a quick bite but stick to the grandma and chicken rolls. I would probably recommend skipping the rest.",Brother's Pizzeria
147,"I've been eating here for 15ish years now, and the pizza quality has held up somewhat but I see darker times ahead. Delivery or phone service was never there to begin with, but now the general quality has started to dip slightly on certain food items. You really have to know what to order beforehand. **ALWAYS PICK IT UP** Cannot stress that hard enough unless you're dining in.  DO NOT order salads or anything that requires ""expert"" preparation however. It's a hit or miss, although lately it's been a miss. My last caesar salad was not worth the money. The lettuce was NOT washed or cleaned as I could taste the dirt and grime, while the chicken was burned and dry.  Good place to grab a pie if you want a change of pace from the usual NY or Brooklyn style pizza. Nothing artisanal, but it does its job. Ultimately, to each their own. Everyone has different tastes and preferences, so you should try this place at least once to get an idea.",Attended a large party here. Food is bland.  Bathroom is gross. Service is mediocre. The servers should really carry a pen and paper around when they are working a 40 guest party.,"HORRIBLE!  Had to give it one star or I couldn't post.  ZERO STARS more like it.  The restaurant was mostly empty on a Sunday night  at 6 pm which was a clue we should have turned around and walked out.  Years ago had to wait on line at Goodfellas but not anymore. The restaurant looks dirty. Floors are dirty and there were crumbs on the chair that I had to brush off before I sat down.  Brought us 3 tiny slices of bread for 4 people with a tiny cup of oil. The staff is horrible.  Waited 1 hour for appetizers which were  baked clams and  fried calamari. The calamari was cold and not good. I ordered  a grilled eggplant hero with roasted peppers with Dijon dressing. How difficult is that? Brought out fried eggplant with sauce . I sent it back. More waiting. Then brought me a soggy sloppy hero with what looked like raw eggplant. Sent it back again and didn't eat.  My husband ordered pizza. The dough was soggy.  The manager didn't come over to apologize for ruining our dinner and didn't  offer to get me something else. When we left, the person who we thought was the manager said thanks for coming....G'nite!  Yep g'nite to you too.","Feels like home when you enter.  The staff is very nice and attentive.  In addition, they actually have senses of humor as well!  LolFor the food, where do I start. I haven't had a bad meal yet and believe me I go often!  By far the best pizza crust and pizza around.  The baked clams are delicious and the Ceasar salad is very well made.  Pasta is always cooked perfectly and no matter how you have it, it is always delicious!  I highly recommend it!","The pizza at Goodfella's is exceptional and superb. A solid five stars. Ordered it with a little char on the edges. The blend of cheese, sauce and wonderful oil was perfect. The cheese stayed on the pizza and did not pull off even when the pizza was hot from the oven. The crust was beyond fine. The taste was full and heavenly. Good blend of everything. Top quality ingredients and a reasonable price. Salmon was perfectly cooked for an entree. Also the spinach was perfectly cooked. The salad was large. All five stars.Chicken parmesan entree was bland (if that). Three stars.Angel hair pasta with tomato sauce had almost no taste. Two stars. Soft drinks were included with the two entrees and to their credit-FREE REFILLS. Would like to see that in more New York area restaurants as it is the usual policy in the rest of the country. Our wairtress was Matti. She was warm and helpful. We appreciated how she served us. We were able to eat an unhurried meal. The bathrooms were clean and seem to be maintained well.We plan to return often but just for the pizza. The pizza is worth a long trip to Goodfella's.","The best pizza in NY and that's a strong statement! Multiple award winners for their vodka sauce, the famous pizza ala vodka is so worth it! The salads and pasta are fantastic too, this place is always worth a visit, even from NYC. Very highly recommended",The Original Goodfella's Brick Oven Pizza
148,"Never have I had a more horrendous experience ordering from a restaurant. One of the orders was not delivered, and I called the restaurant to see if it can be delivered or otherwise refunded. I was given the run-around by the person answering the phone, telling me to call the driver. I called driver out of courtesy who told me exactly what I knew-that the restaurant had to either refund me or deliver the food. I called back requesting to speak to the manager. In the background you can hear that he wanted nothing to do with taking the call. The lady had told me he was ""really busy and couldn't talk"". After explaining that it is their responsibility to either deliver or to refund, I was hung up on. In short, don't order from here. The food is good but the service left a horrible taste in my mouth. Never again.",HORRIBLE service omg came here for some polish food because they don't have a lot on the island. Little did I know the service is horrendous here !!! First we waited for over an hour for a table meanwhile I saw EMPTY tables. The server approached us with a bad attitude to begin with. No smile or anything. Then we had to wait over 2 hours for our food. She took around 30 mins to an hour for just WATER. And there was barely anyone in the restaurant so seriously ... what y'all even DOING. I'm never coming back forreal,This is probably only one polish place on SI.visited again on Thursday food was very good but our waitress Justina was on different planet.she mistake our order and smelled like pack of cigarettes and no shower .ugh other then no hygiene she didnt know why she was there,I went here with very high expectations. Pierogies are one of my favorite foods. Yes they were fresh and delicious perhaps my standards were a bit too high. I did enjoy the beet soup that came with a little bit of dumplings inside. The owners and the wait staff were very very nice. I really liked the Decour as well. It's definitely worth checking out. Perhaps next time I will try the pierogies to be fried.,I only order online from this place through DoorDash. I get the impression they don't really care about their customers because After three times of the same order (yes I gave them several chances before writing this review) I kept getting potato pancakes burnt to a crisp and stinking of bad grease. My hope is if the owner will read this And pay attention to his chefs and servers and make sure they offer quality food to the people who order out as well as the people who eat in.  I know for sure if I was serving this to my customers in the restaurant it would be sent back repeatedly. They seem to feel it because it's a DoorDash and we can't return it they don't give a crap and that's just unacceptable. My two favorite Polish restaurants were Chris's and terminal one. Terminal one started serving crap like this so I started using Chris's... please don't tell me that the only option for Polish are these 2 disgustingly burned ideas.,"Polish platter was really tasty. I ate all of it. There was a huge pile of grease from the fried pierogis that somehow landed on the plate (like maybe they weren't laid on a napkin first to soak in some of the grease), and it got mixed with the cabbage roll sauce, so that was a bummer. Overall, everything on the plate was still really good. Best sauerkraut I've ever had. We decided to try the beef tartare. We've had it once before at a super fancy restaurant in Florida and it was good. I'm sad to say it was not what we expected from here. The presentation was...interesting...like raw hamburger patties...and the meat was warm. That was the worst part...it was warm. When we'd had it before, it was served in a metal dish over ice and wasn't mashed together like that. The flavor was very good, but the served temp was bad lol. This has potential but it was definitely a bust for us. Luckily, the main course and service were great so we would eat here again and recommend to others.",Chris's Restaurant
149,"Not bad , good price, almost across the street from the courthouse. I had the ropa vieja lunch specialwith rice and beans. I followed it up with a cafe con leche. The place is attractive and the staff are nice. If you're in the area , I'd say it's a good stop but it's not a destination place.",This restaurant has changed ownership and it's not the same. The decor and quality of food has changed. I went in with a friend we put in an order and we waited about 45 minutes. The waitress never bought out our food so we left and told her to cancel our order. The place looks definitely different and not for the good and the service is terrible.,The posted time states it is open until 2:30 AM.  I went there at midnight and it was closed.,"Solid Cuban food! Empanadas were delicious, probably my favorite dish on the menu. I had the tilapia platter with fried yuca, and my husband had the steak platter with plantains. The tilapia was cooked well but was fairly simple to taste. Yuca fries were amazing, especially the garlic sauce they came with. My husband's steak was a bit on the dry side but plantains and rice and black beans sides were delicious. Tres leches dessert was also solid.The service was excellent. Our waiter was super friendly, and the manager did not charge us for the steak because my husband barely ate it. She seemed genuinely dedicated to making sure we left full and happy. Just really warm vibes from the staff. High value meal!","I've been wanting to stop in for some time now, my wife and I were in the area and we took a chance... I didnt realize that ownership had changed till I read a few reviews...My wife ordered the lunch special for 7.99 which was the Congri (black beans and rice) with Pernil (roasted pork) and tostones... I ordered the cuban sandwiche with a side of yuca...My wife's meal came out cold, the only hot part was the tostones... My Cuban sandwich wasn't pressed long enough, so it was cold on the inside... The yuca was mediocre, I had way better at smaller dives...We were disappointed having heard so many good things about this place... But if ownership has changed, then that explains a lot...I hope this place turns it around, but I won't be returning... I'd rather take a ride further down on Elizabeth Ave or further out to North Bergen for Cuban food...","I went for lunch and had a Cuban sandwich, ropa vieja empanada and a bacalaito (cod fritter). The food was ok. Bland and nothing to write home about. The staff is very nice, and the space looks like they have bands and other acts play there. Might be a fun place at night.",Yoly's Cuban Cafe
150,"I'm unfortunately not surprised. There are about 5 authentic-tasting Italian restaurants on Staten Island - this is not one of them. My pizza tasted like it came from Costco. It was so unseasoned and doughy. When you picked up a slice, it flopped over. I had to shake pepper and extra cheese on the pizza for it to taste like SOMETHING. I couldn't believe it. You can taste the sauce and cheese in Starbucks pizza, but not in a supposedly authentic Italian restaurant. HOW? Our waitress read the specials to every table but ours. Within a minute of taking our order, she moved to the table next to us and read them the specials. Did we look young and incapable of paying the prices of special dishes? We're 25. Our waitress was much younger than us. Overall, unfortunately this restaurant is another Italian restaurant copy-cat. There are dozens and dozens of them on the island.","I gave this place a second try after not liking it a year ago and they let me down again. My appetizer of calamari was probably a day or two past its shelf life. My pasta was overcooked and soggy. At least I can find solace in alcohol, right?  No! My sangria was loaded with ice!!!  Never again. Too many good choices on SI-- I have paid my last visit to this overpriced and underwhelming place.","This is the first time I have been to this Restaurant and I must say , It is a well written menu !The next step is to execute and deliver this wellwritten menu and filling a plate with Angel hair pasta is not the answer.What happened to the salt and spices?","As of writing this review, I've been to Eat 5x and every time it's gotten better. Luckily for me, compared to other reviewers, I've never been disappointed with my food or service. Yes, the first time the service was clunky but they had just opened so it was to be expected. It seems now they've finally gotten the swing of things and service is fine and food is good.There are hundreds, if not thousands, of pizzerias and Italian restaurants on Staten Island -- from ""authentic"" to Brooklyn replicas. They all have pizza; they all have sauce (or gravy); and they all have pasta. After a while, they all blend. Yes, there are standouts; we all have our go-tos; and we can debate all day and night over which is best, better, and good. They each have their goods and bads, and some of them just suck. Some are over-priced and others are questionably cheap and inexpensive. Many have gimmicks and tricks and others just focus on the food and wine. A few recycle the same servers recommending the same dishes from Arthur Kill to Amboy to Hylan, the Margarita Pie, the Penne Vodka, the Ravioli, the Scampi, the Scaloppine...blah blah blah. All the same all over the island - sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not. Throw a quarter in the air while standing anywhere on Staten Island and you'll hit a pizzeria or an Italian restaurant with more of the same. And on Yelp, they have good reviews and bad reviews. Big deal.Eat isn't breaking the mold, and the menu doesn't boast anything fancy, exotic, or overly unique, and that's okay because the food it does offer is consistently delicious -- and that's all you can ask for when going to an Italian restaurant on Staten Island these days (unless, of course, your intention is to sit at the bar, get drunk, play bocce, and wait for the DJ or band to start -- in that case, you're in luck because there are other places for that, and they're multiplying).You're not going to Eat for it's rare game meat, unique gastro-dish, or an international fusion meal. You're going for good, consistent food with decent service at a local spot. That's Eat Italian, so curb your expectations as a fancy pants-y Italian restaurant connoisseur and recognize this place for what it is -- a simple neighborhood spot with consistent flavors. And a welcomed one for Woodrow Plaza at that. The Food:Parmigiana - perfectly cooked with great taste.Frittura Mista - well done fried mix.Caponata - tasty and flavorful.The Bufolata pizza was so good I ordered it twice. The ingredients taste fresh and mix well together. I usually half this pie with the Paesana - fried eggplant and ricotta. Together they compliment each other. Either way together or not, both pies are robust with flavor, complimenting the pizza dough and crust perfectly. The bread is delicious. And if you're expecting the pie to be crispy, like Denino's, Lee's or Campania's, you're going to be disappointed. Eat's pizza is more like the pizza of Naples rather than Rome's, thick crust instead of thin. So if you want it crispy - ask for it. Don't leave a negative review because you didn't know the difference.There's a whole other section on the menu that needs recognition for one reason, whether you think it's authentically Italian or not - the Panini section. Made up of items from a burger to a grilled chicken chaser wrap. But the only dish I've tried is the Steak Sliders, which, in my opinion, is DELICIOUS. I'd order it again and again. The quality of the steak they use is impressive - extremely tender, seasoned and cooked perfectly, and perfect for sliders with soft brioche buns. This dish is a win for Eat, authentically Italian or not. It's perfect.For entree, I've only ordered two dishes multiple times: Paccheri Norma and Genovese Classica. The first is handmade rigatoni with roasted eggplant and the second is pappardelle with pulled short ribs. Done well and delicious. I would order both again and again. Both have unique qualities with fairly common ingredients and combinations for pasta dishes. They're done right, offering great flavors and perfectly cooked al dente homemade pastas. While I'm sure Franco, the owner, takes pride in all his dishes, judging from the quality and flavor of these two menu choices, I expect he's put a lot of time perfecting his pasta and sauces. And that should be enough to make you want to go back.It's tough for Italian restaurants and pizzerias to stand out on Staten Island, and it's tough for any of them and their chefs to win awards and become instant celebrities, so the most they can hope for is lasting power and so far Eat has it. Staff is friendly. Service is consistent. And food is good. That's a win for Woodrow since the South Shore is saturated with one copy after another.",Chose this place for my birthday dinner because I heard good things. We were a party of 6. Made reservations. Sat quickly. Place is cute with a nice outdoor eating area which is covered   I have to say I thought everything was just mediocre. We ordered a lot. I eat out very frequently and like trying new places. Margarita pizza wasn't great. Rice ball wasn't great. Stuffed artichoke was good. Cold antipasto was very good. Nice selection of meat. Mozz cheese was delicious  My soft shell crab was good. Nice that you can have it prepared any way you wish. Shrimp and salmon (together) was salty. I was told the pork chop was good. My side rigatoni was cooked perfectly but it may be too al dente for some. I requested a red sauce but it was just eh Best part was desert. We ordered what they called beignets but they aren't. They were cream filled pastry topped with gelato. Delicious never the less  The Nutella filled pastry was also amazing. A large order. Good cappuccino. Good service. Just didn't knock my socks off in the least. Even the bread on the table was just plain - nothing special,"In the area doing some food shopping, but of course needed to eat dinner first. So decided to try  Eat Italian, what a good choice. It's in Woodrow shopping center so plenty of parking. It was packed at 8:30pm but was seated immediately. Not such a big dining area but they also have outside seating as well.We ordered a few apps to sample a little bit of everything. Grilled calamari with octopus (my favorite! not chewy), antipasto, Arancini (big and tasty), fritto Misto, cream puffs with vanilla gelato, and espresso. Everything was delicious. The service was attentive and friendly. What a nice little casual hidden gem on Staten Island!",Eat Italian
151,"Personally i like the new management. Theres new dishes in the menu that includes thai food! def try their pad thai, cant get it anywhere else in staten island.",I get very offended when the chicken pieces in the sesame chicken is not cooked right. Some pieces are hard to chew and some taste like they are not cooked.,Nasty manger can not take order does not know how always give wrong delivery orderFood is good,"Can I give this place a 6 stars?!?!Usually I dont give 5 stars unless it really deserves all the stars. Peking Taste deserves an extraordinary amount stars for their quality in food.I dont visit Staten Island often(maybe once or twice a month) but when i do, i MUST stop by Peking Taste. This place is the definition of hidden gem! Its inside this plaza, right next to cold stone. I've been going here for the past two years, I think my long distance relationship with Peking is getting pretty serious.The dishes are jam packed with flavor and tenderness in all the dishes! Tonight I ordered the Eggplant with Chicken (my favorite meal), on my ride back home I was daydreaming about how mouthwatering this meal would be. My fantasy could not even compare at how delicately rich the meal was. The eggplant was smothered in sauce and the chicken(!!). Usually I'm a beef girl, but the chicken is cooked to its perfect tenderness.I know, this is a lot of admiration for a fast food chain. But trust me, Peking Taste's food is just as good as any fancy Chinese restaurant if not even better. If I were to go on a date, at a family gathering, or just having a girls get together, and I was in Staten Island, THIS is the place you'll find me eating in.","It's our favorite Chinese restaurant in our neighborhood. Food always fresh and taste, reasonable prices And very friendly staff!","Peking taste is in the middle of a plaza so it can be hard to find especially since it's mostly just a kitchen, counter and 2 tables. It's not welcoming looking and you wouldn't want to eat in there but the food is very good for Asian takeout. It's much better than any other Asian in the area defiantly better then Oriental Plaza. The Buddhist delight and the Pad Thai are what I get usually. It's a bit cheaper then other places near here too. If you get delivery, have your money in hand the minute you hang up the phone because they come so so so fast. It seems impossibly fast.",Peking Taste Restaurant
152,"Small place with big booths on the side. Staff was nice and the sushi came out pretty quickly. Not too bad, but nothing crazy delicious in this case. Price point is a little higher than the others on the island, but probably pay more for the ambiance.",,,"I'd been looking for a reliable sushi spot after being disappointed by other places on the island. Sushi Wen delivered 100%! The restaurant was quiet at 6 pm on Saturday, but I could tell they were filling lots of to-go orders. Once seated, service was super quick and friendly. Our server answered our questions, gave us our drinks (they have tea and soda, BYOB if you want alcohol), and took our order within 5 minutes. Our appetizer and sushi came out quickly as well! Everything was super fresh, carefully plated, and tasty. Perfect melt-in-your-mouth cuts of fish and tender sushi rice. The snapper carpaccio appetizer was my favorite, but the sushi dinner and specialty roll were great too. I could tell all our rolls and nigiri were made to order, and handled with care. This place respects the fish and the chefs know their craft. We were in and out within 40 minutes, the meal was affordable given the Hugh quality, and fish portions were generous!","We ordered a few times and ditched our previous sushi spot because they're better and the price is not bad.So we decided to have dinner there and WOW! Ordered their Hibachi and this is my Favorite local spot. It was delicious and filling!The service is good, my daughter went for lunch previously and said (concerning the service) that she was kinda rushed.Overall the small new spot is Great for what it is!",UPDATE: It just gets better. They use top quality ingredients. Food is fresh. No post Sushi/Sashimi fishy or heavy fried taste. Agedashi Tofu was nice and fried - their tempura appetizer was lightly fried. Naruto Roll a d Summer Roll were top notch. Had a great experience here. Their sashimi melts in your mouth. The owner/chef is wonderful. He studied in Japan for 7 years.The entire staff is extremely friend. I will be back!,Sushi Wen
153,"This place is so trash.food is low quality,and the cooked shrimp was hideous.please don't come here for your benefit not mine.",I had the worst experience there. I was passing by the desert and I saw a big fly in the pudding  I could not eat after that and I handed  them the cup. Ofcourse they said nothing about it,"When they first opened... everything was fresh, clean, and delicious. I didn't mind coming in here for my family day, try out new food and make a pig out of myself. A few months later, I got sick twice from eating their food and I never went back. Ice cream station is disgusting. Everyone is scooping out ice cream and it's a mess. About a month or two later, they got shut down by the board of health. Bathrooms are disgusting. That alone tells me a lot. Avoid this place.","If the prices were any higher, it would be a one- two stars. But for the price, its definitely worth it. We got there at 3:20 (10 minutes before lunch ends) the prices are about $10 for lunch and $14 for dinner. Waitresses convinced us to pay for the dinner price cause for dinner time, they bring out about 10 new dishes that are for dinner time only.  So we agreed to pay for the dinner price.At 3:30, they bring out the dinner exclusive dishes like oysters, crabs, shrimps etc and they put a sign that says "" for dinner customers only"" in front of the pot but tbh I'm pretty sure a lot of people ignore the sign and just get it- nobody's looking. Didnt get a chance to try the hibachi cause no one was at the station. I think they were on lunch break. And the floors feel gross- like very oily, sticky, slippery.Also the cups the ice water came in was a little dirty on the outside....But- they do have a pretty decent variety of food for just $14! The quality is not amazing, its not even good- its average at best. But for the price I would say that's pretty good","A mediocre all you can eat buffet featuring Asian and Western food. The highlight was definitely the green tea and red bean hard ice creams. The sushi looked good but was rather tasteless (except the wasabi that had a real kick to it!). I did not try the Western food. The plantains and the spring rolls were pretty good but almost all the other choices I tried...and I tried a lot of them...were rather bland. The physical layout is nice because dividers help you to feel you are in a bit more intimate of a setting and while I did not visit the restrooms or kitchen, the dining area appeared clean (I learned on Yelp after the fact that they have a C sanitary rating...oops!I can see why many reviewers bagged the service but I think the serve staff's fascination with my butchering the tones of Mandarin earned us better service than Han some time ther tables might have received. The Yelp check-in offer of $1.50 off one adult lunch buffet and one drink sounds like you should get $3 off but they only subtract $1.50. Well that's it unless I'm in the bathroom a few hours later today! :-)Final score: 2.5","They have a lot of variety, especially with the sushi. They have a lot of raw fish. However, the wasabi was a bit disappointing. The wasabi seemed cheap and authentic. They had a lot of desserts and fruit, which is always a plus. I went on a weekday and it only came to about $9 per person, which is super affordable for buffets. I had a pretty nice time with my friends.",Flaming Grill & Supreme Buffet
154,The owner himself was rude to my father when my father tried to order. He could hardly speak due to his Parkinson's and he was being extremely rude on taking the order. My dad felt embarrassed and left. The fact that it was the owner made it worse,Terrible atmosphere. So plain and tacky. And worse of all the only employee there was the so called Owner who in all honesty was very rude and unfriendly.  He seemed annoyed that we even walked in to an Empty restaurant with no music and not 1 single employee other then him. The food was not as i expected even made me sick to my stomach. I don't like to post bad reviews but this one restaurant deserves not even 1 star. Avoid at all cost. Not worth the time or money spend here.  Terrible terrible.,"Where do I start! Horrible horrible service! I order from here twice and they got my orders always wrong. I call them to explain im allergic to mushroom and lady on phone was extremely rude and annoyed I call and didn't once say sorry. Customer service is horrible from ordering to calling them. First time around  I order chicken and was so dry and cold and my fries were burned.I figure let me give them another chance maybe they was having a bad day. Which is wrong ,seem like they hate there job there. They get annoyed with people ordering and  The delivery guy is so rude and has an attitude problem bringing the food to my house which I don't know why I always give him $10 dollars. Mind you my house isn't far. What a nightmare, this will be my last ordering from this place. If i can give a zero stars tp them  I would. My chicken today which is my second time ordering was dry again and cold so Food isn't that great. You off going to El Patron 2. There service is way better and they happy to serve you with no attitude problems.","Where do I start .. Service: The  server was very attentive and friendly. Always checking on us.Food: The salsa verde chilaquiles are bomb. Also, the lomo saltado de carne one of the best we ever had. The strawberry dessert special  very unique and tasty, not overly sweet and what's the best they're home made!! We came all the way from Queens and the little trip was worth it! The owner is very nice and always attentive as well. We will be back soon.",Food is always good! Authentic and good portions for the price. Quick and good service!,"Wish I didn't need to write this but I woke up at 5 am after eating dinner here tonight and had nothing else but water with terrible stomach cramps and the need to use the bathroom. It's a shame because food tasted great, service was good and portions were big. Its great they gave free chips before hand as well.",Zabrosura
155,"Sketchy, plain, and boring. The patrons seemed high and unsocial. Some were zombified on their laptops or phones. The decor is plain and did not have a Mediterranean feel at all. I guess if you wanna go here after your ""smoke session"" then it's your place.","Came here on a weekend and the Service was terrible, to start off the waiter was very rude, took him a long time to get our order because of him insisting on texting once we received our hookas they had a disgusting taste of burned charcol. The pipes were very dirty, had to even tip the waiter to get him to even fix our hookah and took atleast a half hour to receive our first coal change which they apparently charged us exta for, waiter came back to our table and told us we had to order more even though we had two hookahs and a boat load of drinks for three people, would never come here again. Id rather pay the toll to go over the bridge to get some quality food and hookah. Come here if you wnat to ruin your night","Horrible service takes forever to get coal or your hookah in general. Bad ambiance, not a night life hookah spot. It's very bright inside with really loud obnoxious Arabic music. No parking. Hookah dies very quickly. Take your business elsewhere.","Perfect chill spot , after a long day of work i feel very comfortable going there to relax & smoke some hookah , staff is very friendly always checking up on me if i need anything. Food is phenomenal amazing . Love the environment",Their hookah and appetizers are amazing ! We had the mozzarella sticks and French fries! Super friendly staff and the manager/owner was even changing our coals for us and really friendly! He also told us there's an outside seating area as well that people can enjoy! Everything is reasonably priced as well! I wish they were open all day!,Dope time laughing and playing cards for fun (no money allowed obviously) . Had some legit sheehsa with tea and sweets. The grapefruit last longer so we invested couple $ more and we enjoyed. I wouldn't share it - def get your own cuz your friends will burn it. Took my boys out after a meeting. Chill spot to probably do some work and smoke. Server is fast too. Love her. I'll be back Fridays with the fellas n wives.,Reazon Cafe & Lounge
156,Cute little french cafe in the middle of Staten island off of hyland blvd. Open till late. Only thing is they don't have almond milk or half & half only whole milk. We ordered Nutella crepe and tea,"The food here is excellent, a real homemade Burek. We at least eat or order from here once a week but tonight It was unbelievable, they have girl name silvana that works there she is horrible get ready for your order to be messed up. She is always to be busy being on her phone. I called in advance to order my food and she still messes It up. Now I have learned my lesson when I call and she answer the phone I won't order, if I go in person and she is there I will leave. It just sucks when you like the place but people that don't know what there doing work there",,"I cannot say that I *love* many spots on Hylan Blvd, but I love this place! They have a great atmosphere with nice music. The owner is an awesome guy who makes everyone feel at home!I usually come here to work during the day (and they make me feel right at home) or for drinks with friends after work It helps that the food is awesome (I haven't tried anything that I didn't like).",This place is absolutely delicious!  Had the shrimp Appetizer and chicken latte.. so good!!,"One of my favorite restaurants on the island! They have amazing food and great service, all at an extremely reasonable price. My favorites are the fried calamari, skirt steak, and creamy saganaki. They also have delicious homemade iced tea that will quench your thirst on a hot summer day. And it's even better when enjoyed on their cozy outdoor patio. The service here is always great as well, they check up on you but don't bother you too much. And I always see the owner walking around to introduce himself and thank the patrons. It's a very cozy spot and everyone acts like one big family. Give them a try and you won't be disappointed!",Café Latté
157,"We made the trek back to Staten Island after being away a few months to see what's been going onStopped at Daddy O's-WowI want everyone to read the owners responses to all the reviewsHe is an arrogant, nasty individualThere are reasons why his establishment is always empty-He states they are all fakeWhy would we lie?The food sucksThe staff is terrible The owner - read and decide for yourself!Dry meat dishes Dry Mac and CheeseFlat beerThe owner needs to stop being nasty and actually caring about what people write if he is going to be somewhat successful",Food is trash and most bartenders can't multitask in an empty bar and seem pretty arrogant. The space is great but that's about it. The atmosphere is pretty boring as well. I won't recommend.,DaddyO's wasn't as good as people make it out to be. The wings were small and dry thought Mac and cheese would be baked more or if at all. I the positive the food that we had delivered came in a timely manor.,Another fantastic experience today during the Jets gameNice hostessGreat serviceGreat fresh beerGreat pricesGreat kids menuSuper kid friendly in factBrisket entree was delishIt was a lovely experienceWill definitely be back again!!,We literally walked in randomly to order some fries quick. Hostess and bartender were very friendly and observant of their surroundings. Fries were made super quick and they gave me a bag of fries. Literally. They tasted deeeelish and super crispy. My boys gobbled them up. I'd come back for some grub. Especially after a few drinks in next door at Flagship brewery. It's he perfect combo. Definetly recommend.,"I miss the South shore location. This one started with similar quality but over the past year or two I noticed a massive decline in rib quality. Every order at the original location would always be perfect. The meat easily came off the bone, even slipped off entirely if you wanted it to. That's how tender and well cooked they were.Now every order if ribs is tough or only somewhat soft. I have to always use a knife to separate them, which never was required originally. I don't know what changed but the lack of consistent quality makes these dishes just overpriced.  Aside from the food, there's this one waitress that I just fear being served by. She makes too many jokes and tries to be a part of the experience and it just is no fun. I love friendly staff, maybe a crack a joke or two every once in a while. But coming up to the table, commenting on everything, sitting at the table and acting like you are one of us... it's just uncomfortable. We didn't come here to hang out with you. I don't want to put her down for being positive and friendly but it's just too much.",DaddyO's BBQ & Sports Bar
158,"I would say this place is overrated but looking at some of the other reviews, my review is just about right. If we were here any longer we would be either fixtures on the wall or furniture. The dinner that never ended is what it was known as. 2 1/2 hours for really good fries. We saw the waiter once when we ordered and then he made a brief cameo at some point later on. The food mediocre the service bad and the night in this place never ended",Always was a good experience except for Last  party this weekend that I was their  I found it rude that when we asked the chef to make grill chicken except of one of the choices that was on the menue because I can not have salt I was told the chef disnt want to make bbn it. Very very rude  the person sitting next to me could not eat gluten asked for grilled piece of fish with no sauce on it was told no also the sauce comes on the fish. Customer service not good at all. To top it off  the food had absolutely no taste at all .  The waiters were great gentlemen,We went to this restaurant for a bereavement luncheon after my Mom's funeral. Great service and food,"Very good food and good service. We are all happy everytime we go here.We'll be back, this is one of our favorite restaurants in Staten Island.","This feels like a restaurant to go to for special occasions.  Well, at least I do since that's when I come here.The food is good and the service is excellent.  They also have space upstairs for private event.","My wife and I went to Bocelli for a College graduation party.  They have a very nice Party Room on the second floor.  Started with a Very Good combination of appetizers, then a Pasta dish.  the main course was a Filet Mignon.  It was a big disappointment, dry and tastless.  Dessert was bland.  Not at all what I expected.",Bocelli
159,"I used to come here for the food and atmosphere but since they're regular chef Carlos quit I haven't stepped foot in the door. After ordering for lunch and receiving low quality sushi I inquired only to find out Carlos was no longer there. I have witnessed frozen fish being shipped to the restaurant, something I never dealt with as a customer and saw spicy tuna that looked like dog food delivered with my lunch. The photos I have posted are no longer available as many of them were chef specials that this restaurant can no longer deliver as they don't have knowledge of the ingredients used to produce it. What used to be my go to spot for lunch or dinner is now what I pass by regretfully. With the new year approaching, Carlos usually delivered our sushi platter order we will be going elsewhere this year and every year until they make the right decision and get Carlos back. Otherwise I can guarantee they will close much like the previous owner had to when Carlos quit!",I've been going to Sayori since it was osaka. Before it had closed I had only stopped going because of the change in chefs. However upon opening I went and realized the old chef Carlos was back and instantly they gained my business as a customer once again. There is no better spicy tuna to be found. No better age tofu and countless other menu items that are just untouched by many other Japanese restaurants I have been to.,"This was the best sushi on the island hands down. Spicy tuna hand rolls with ghost pepper added made them even better. Unfortunately Carlos who was the main sushi chef is now gone. Since the new owners took over the actual quality of the food has gone down. My mom got sick after eating there one day, and I had mussels that tasted old. The owner told me they changed where they get their fish. This was actually the only sushi place I went to on the island mainly for Carlos. Carlos knows sushi very well so losing him and his recipes, in turn now loses me as a customer. It's always a sign when you make the items on your menu cheaper, I should have known the quality would be different. I'll be looking for a new sushi spot now.","I really think this is a hidden gem in Staten Island. I went here with my family in the afternoon and my first impression was that it was beautiful. The place looked stunning and had a Japanese inspired theme. The restaurant even has a small zashiki seating. It's where you remove your shoes and sit on a tatami platform. The place was very clean, as well. One of my pet peeves is when the table is sticky, and boy was I happy when it wasn't. The bathrooms were very clean too. Our server was a middle-aged lady and she was wonderful. She was welcoming and personable. She was also attentive (although, that may be because there wasn't a lot of people during the time we were there). Unfortunately, I never got her name.Foodwise, there is a complimentary miso soup or salad, your choice. I had the miso soup and it was alright, nothing special, just the regular. For appetizers, I had the white tuna roll and shrimp tempura roll, which were really amazing. I loved it. I also got bubble tea (boba) and it was subpar, so I don't recommend it, there are other better places for boba. Lastly, I got the tonkatsu ramen and it was really good. After eating, we had fried ice cream which was pretty regular. In the end, our server even gave us a small complimentary pineapple bits.This place really took me by surprise. I highly recommend Sayori, and I will be a returning costumer.","Highlights: cute decor (Sakura trees), friendly waitress, big portions I only gave this place 3 stars because I found my entree to be mediocre and the bubble tea arrived at the end of our meal and the tapioca balls were bland and hard.There was only one waitress when me and my friend came on a Friday night. She immediately greeted us with a friendly smile and welcomed us to sit. She seemed a little antsy but I would imagine it is because she was too busy running around managing all the tables. My favorite item of the night was the volcano roll. It was delicious but I must warn you that the kani salad in the middle is super spicy. My stomach was burning afterwards (but I love spicy so I'd still eat it again without hesitation). I also ordered the bulgogi rice bowl and they really packed it with rice, cabbage, japchae and bulgogi. Unfortunately, the bulgogi was dry and underwhelming. I would not order this meat again.My friend got a tonokatsu and she seemed to enjoy it as she did finish the majority of it!I do not recommend the bubble tea because the tapioca was hard and bland. The flavor is ok but it is very sweet and tasted like a powder formula.","Very nice staff and owner ! Started off with a shrimp appetizer that was so crispy and flavorful! The amount of shrimp given was so worth it! Then, had the purple yam spring roll which was so good! This dish is hard to find and when you can find it, you must try it! The spring roll wrapper they used was so crispy and delicious! We also got their salmon tartar which gave generous amount of small salmon pieces and slices of avocados on top. Then, had their three special rolls (a deal they have all day). The rolls were very filling and authentic. Will be back for more sushi and purple yam spring roll!",Sayori Japanese Restaurant
160,"Waited an hour and 10 minutes to get an appetizer, then another 47 minutes to get our entrees. The chicken was over cooked and under flavored, and they charged $6 for a side of hot peppers...I can get a goddamn burrito for $6. This place is incredibly overrated and overpriced.If you're looking for a good Italian restaurant with this kind of ambience near Staten Island, try Positanos in Bay Ridge Brooklyn. Worlds past this place.","My go to place !! Never disappoints. Amazing service, amazing food. Thank you rob for all you did for our bereavement lunch and all you continue to do! The food takes me back to Italy, so authentic!!","Been wanting to eat here since it opened. I've heard some good and some bad things. We arrived and were greeted and seated immediately. We chose not to over eat and just get a couple main courses off the standard menu. The menu was very disappointing with a very limited selection of basic Italian dishes. We ordered the salmon and a chicken dish. Bread was served and ice cold and a bit stale. The salmon was a very small portion and a bit too ""fishy"" for my liking. The chicken dish was ok but nothing that made me want to come back for more. I'd have to give it 3 stars based on price and taste factor of the limited dishes we had. Not impressed","Excellent service -phenomenal drinks and our meals were amazing .I was waiting for my girlfriend and was kindly greeted at the entrance by the owner. I sat at the bar and unbeknownst to me, the bartender wound up being our server as well. I wish I got the gentlemen's name - well, he was on top of his A game. All our food came out in a timely fashion and he was extremely attentive .The owner came prior to our dinner being served and at the end . Wonderful experience from the moment we stepped in to leaving.",We heard this place was good for couples. Unfortunately  it is not! The hands off service is perfect for a good groups but don't ask for anything once the  food is served or when you need the check.The food was kind of ok. Bill was ~$300 for four people and we each had one drink.,The first thing when walking in that you notice is the friendly service which is such a delight. We have been here twice now and both times we enjoyed the zucchini flowers that were on special. The chicken parm is some of the best I've had.The meatballs were good but nothing special- I personally thought there were a bit too soft for my liking. We ate so much that we didn't have room for dessert- can't wait to try it next time!,Deluca's Italian Restaurant
161,"Tonight around 8:30pm we walked in to sit by the bar to eat. The 3 people at the front desk told us 15 min wait. We said ok and walked in to see a table with no one sitting there. 5 mins passed and still no one sitting there. Ask someone if I could sit there, they said NO. I was like ok. Waiting for the table as another 5 mins pass. Still no one sitting there. My husband went up to the bar to get a drink, bartender look like he didn't know what he was doing! The table to sit and have a drink was filthy dirty! I look at my husband and said 15 mins has past and the table is still empty! I saidLet's go I'm not waiting anymore as I keepLooking at an empty table set for 2! I feltLike we walk is to a sweat shop too it was disgusting inside! So so hot! No Ac - I'll think again before I go there again- the owner should be a shamed to run a dirty place like that! Where's the board of health??","The Brooklyn Bridge. Totally different from what it used to be. If you've ordered this dish before you would know how beautiful it used to look. It was actually displayed on a mini wooden bridge with lights and decorations. Now it's just on a normal plate with small pieces of sushi and sashimi. I'd say I go to Arirang pretty often at this point, and for the most part I don't have a bad thing to say.  However, I was very disappointed tonight. Not only was there no effort put into it, half of the dish did not taste fresh. Definitely not worth the $37. With that being said I was sent home with a terrible stomach ache on my birthday.","Nice Hibachi spot, very spacious. But an extremely long wait to be seated! Service wasn't all that great, taking into consideration it was a Saturday night. Waited 20 minutes for my drink plus another 45 for my sushi. Sadly the waiter messed up my drink 3 times bringing me the Incorrect drink. Despite the cons, it was a nice. Food was worth the wait. Nice family oriented place restaurant. Would come back just on not such a busy day.",This place does Hibachi right. Best hibachi ever and the fried rice is legendary. I love coming here. The wait can be long and it's on the expensive side but you get a lot of food and it's very entertaining to watch how they cook everything.,"Ok, Greeter a bit cold, made us sit in her assigned seats at Hibachi table (yep she made my 15 yr old daughter move from one seat to another same table). And the damn valet moved my seat to drive 4 feet (Man that grinds my gears! BUT WHY FOR FOUR FEET!) I'm 5'7 not tall moved seat up close for his 4 foot drive (I don't get it) ok on to positives, food great Had salads soup, fried rice, Filet Mignon, Shrimp, Chicken, a couple of bar drinks fed 5 people for $156 (a bargain for real) was too stuffed for Ice Cream offered as desert, table chef was a pleasure.... Would I run back? Ehh hate my seat being adjusted to move four feet (hate it)","The worst dinner experiences of my life.  My husband has dietary restrictions (gluten-free).  Told at least 5 people that he could not eat gluten.  He has certified celiac disease. We were assured they had gluten free soy sauce. However,  when it came to cooking the food on the grill the chef didn't use the gluten free soy sauce.  In fact he looked confused.   I became irate and asked how many people do we need to inform that he is gluten free. We told the hostess, the waiter, the manager, the chef and even the guy who gives the hot towels.  To no avail the gluten soy sauce was used.  The chef even asked us does anyone have food allergies....yes we can't have gluten. He smiled and went on to using the gluten soy sauce.Yes, I was angry and asked why bother asking if you are not going to accommodate if you have gluten free soy sauce.   They tried to charge us for the meal but we refused to pay.  A better manager would have asked us to please sit down and let us make this right for you.   However, he was totally happy to see us go.  Please don't ask if you don't want to accommodate.  Food allergies and dietary restrictions are no joke and should be handled with respect.   Ignorance and miscommuication is not an excuse in this day.  Serious ramifications for dietary restrictions must be addressed and not ignored.",Arirang Hibachi Steakhouse
162,"Ohhhh Ruby, what's going on here??? I actually walked out. I was meeting some friends at the bar and after sitting there a few short minutes with no acknowledgment from the bartender, a young lady, we tried to get her attention and her response was ""yeah give me a minute"", and not friendly at all. I think the real problem is the management, but she still needs to know how to respond to a guest even if she's been stuck with the entire bar. She finally got a glass of water over to me and then the menu. And after watching her for a bit more I could tell it was going to be a long night and I just wasn't feeling like I wanted to eat there. I'd rather have IHOP for dinner. The service was bad three years ago, and it's worse now! No more chances, See ya!","Very good salad bar. Slow service albeit friendly. Paid extra $1.50 to ""upgrade"" from string beans to asparagus but never got it and still got charged. They removed it once I pointed it out. Have had similar service in the past and won't likely go back if there's anywhere I have to be in a hurry.","Pretty horrible service all around. My husband and I went to eat after a long, hot day at the fields for one of our children's sporting events. After getting a seat in the bar area almost immediately we were greeted by our server fairly quickly.This is where things went bad...after ordering a tall Miller Lite and coffee we didn't see our server for 16 mins before I got my cold beer. Our server brought the beer to the table assuming it was my husbands and then turned to me to ask what I ordered again? We corrected him and then reminded him it was a black coffee that we were missing. Our server did apologize profusely stating that he was also  serving a large party in the other room. Ok, no big deal - let's order food. We proceeded to order for the table, chips and queso with 2 to-go orders. Chips and queso came out an add'l 15 mins later and was luke warm but at this point It didn't matter, we were starving. Finally, when we did receive our to go orders the crispy mac and cheese was room temperature on the outside. So I stuck my finger in the middle and to my surprise it was ice cold!Needless to say we will not visit this location again.","what can I say this is probably the best meal I ate in New Jersey side for last two weeks!!!it is near four major hotels, across from shopping mall and accessible by public bus, by way near airport!I had blackened tilapia with mashed potatoes, salad and coke;- tilapia was fantastic, tasted good and cooked good ($14)- mashed potatoes were great as well, I got double portion - salad was especially good; first of all it's a buffet type so you get it yourself and choose what you want ($4)- even coke tasted good, not watered as at few other similar type establishments in this areaall together it was ($18), which is cheaper than other places (Applebee's or TGI Fridays and few others)atmosphere good here, it's clean and inviting, employees are friendly unlike few other places.they have free internet and some tables have power outlet accessible so you can power up phone/laptop",Lord the service is really in need of help here.

163,it was my first time ordering from this place and i looked at the reviews and it seem like it was a pretty good place and when i got the sushi it looked fine so i ate it. but the next morning i was sick and throwing up all day. i would not recommend this place to anyone not to mention is is very pricey,"We had always ordered from this restaurant because of the quality, taste and price for the sushi. Very good.","Late review , figured I would attach photos of some items that were delicious !Not pictured , but my boyfriend and I ordered the sashimi for a second time (as this isn't the first visit to Nori)",First time here.

The waiters are also super friendly. A great place for a night out!,Thank goodness I only ordered 4 pieces of salmon Sushi. 1st the veining looked like belly salmon. Then the coloring was darkish red orange. Usually salmon is orange color.  The salmon sushi was tender but I didn't care for the taste.  Yep I said taste. Salmon doesn't have much of a taste..  perhaps its the Taste from the salty seasoned rice underneath.  Either way it was horrid!  The one star is the lowest I can enter and does not reflect the uneatable dish.  Thank goodness for the ginger!! Which was very plentiful and delish! After this review I saw the bill 3 bux each piece!!  Rip offPlease don't waste your money like I did. Ck my reviews...,Nori Sushi

It's one thing to be born with physical issues you cannot change but personality can be worked on and he needs to work on that. I would avoid this bar there are tons on Staten Island don't waste your time with this trash hole in the wall,"I think we found our new go to place for wings and football.  My husband loves wings, and Football Sundays are really his days, so I suggested we check this place out. I really like the feel of Joe's. There are cozy booths along the wall and hightop tables around the bar.  It's open, airy and clean. They play all the games, at least it seems, even Redskins which is our team (native Virginians here). The wings are the best we've had on the Island.  They are really big and cooked perfectly, says my wing expert husband. I think they have at least ten or twelve different flavors and all of them sound good. We got buffalo and teriyaki, both excellent and we'll certainly be back to try the spicy peanut butter and the garlic parmesan flavors. Nachos were pretty standard bar fare but the chili on top stood out. Staff was really nice! We will definitely be back!","Great place for a casual drink.  Always friendly staff. Great atmosphere. Warm and inviting. Bartender, Erik is the man!","I had a rough week and wanted to have a drink, this place is local so we walked there only to be disappointed by the lack of service. We walked in and the two bartenders were helping customers, so we waited and the female bartender was done first not only did she not ask us what we'd like to drink, she proceeded to take a sip from her drink she had at the bar and looked at herself in the mirror. At that point, we decided that we wouldn't want to give our money to a place that didn't even attempt to acknowledge us.  I guess I should thank them for saving me money considering we drove so I could drink all I wanted. Would not recommend, but if you go best of luck with getting served.",Joe Broadway's Billiards & Sports Pub
165,"I ordered a t bone steak meal and I ordered thru door dash. I wrote in the notes to add garlic sauce to my rice and to send extra butter. Since there were no options to order the extras in the menu selection, I called the restaurant to make sure that they follow my request. The woman who answered the phone was VERY RUDE and said that I had to pay extra which wasn't an issue if those options were available on the door dash app. After spending $33.25 On lunch I figured I can at least get some extra butter and some Nice customer service NEVER AGAIN I'll cook and bring my own lunch next time I SWEAR THIS FOOD BETTER BE GOOD ONCE IT FINALLY ARRIVE","Came here last Saturday night with another couple. Had reservations. There were three large parties already seated and the noise was deafening!  Waiters and staff had to bump into our chairs in order to get by our table. Fortunately we were moved to another table which eliminated this problem. However the onion soup was completely tasteless.  True, the rolls and salad were tasty. The paella for two was so dry that you had to scrape the rice off the side of the pot. The mussels were gigantic and chewy, the lobster pieces had a peculiar taste and the whole thing was not seasoned at all.  Thoroughly disappointed.  The other couple had two kinds of steak which were ok. Service was sketchy. The noise level never improved and everyone left swearing to eliminate the restaurant from the GPS. Not a pleasant experience!","We went there tonight and it was absolutely terrible.  We ordered shrimp and scallops in green sauce.  The shrimp and scallops were like rubber, obviously frozen.  The green sauce was like water and nothing had any taste including the rice, a complete disaster!",The food here is amazing and the people are even better! Very friendly environment and just a nice place to hang out at.,"This is the hardest question we all ask our selves as a reviewer. Should the service out weigh the food?I was running late to diner, of course, and the appetizers were ordered at least 15 minutes prior to my arrival. And I still waited another 15 minutes for the apps to arrive when I finally did show up. One waiter serving possibly 5 other tables. But he was also prepping for the ""later dinner""rush (utensils, cleaning glassware, etc.)? The plan was to meet at 5, but I showed up at 5:15.So the start of the night started to annoy my table. Water refill took forever in this 15 minute wait. Ate all the bread and had maybe 4 butter packets. We can see were this night service was headed.But once the food started to arrive, everything was delicious. The clams casino, the calamari, and the chorizo. And was the hunger just making it all taste good?But once the entres came out, there was no complaints, nor were there any conversations at all. We were all just submerged at our own meals. Everyone was just asking each other to taste how delicious each respective dish was. I am big on service, because great service to me can make bland meals acceptable. Bad service can be made up with outstanding food.We all want great service with great food. But if the intention is to have a great meal, you just have to look past the slow service.","What a find!  Authentic Spanish food in a small neighborhood joint in Carteret.  Great service, special flair in how they presented fire grilled chorizo app and a paella for 2 that could have served 4.  Sangria at happy hour prices and a lively bar scene with music and people watching.  Next time I will bring a gang and go in to the elegant dining room.",Chateau Madrid Restaurant & Bar
166,This used to be my go to mexican restaurant on staten Island. My last visit there i was very disappointed. The quality and taste of their dishes was not the same. The dishes were bland and tasteless. Shrimp burrito bowl the shrimp seemed it was just defrosted and microwaved no flavor. The veggie bowl barely had anything in the dish except unseasoned rice and beans and the prices are to much for such poor quality food. Hopefully they step up and start severing better food.,"So I originally banned this place because it's just overpriced, not good Mexican food but my friend made me give them another try. Slow night for them, and yet couldn't even get my order right. I ordered a veggie burrito and they gave me a shrimp one instead. I didn't realize until I was half way through the rice and lettuce burrito (cause that's what 99% of it consisted of) that it was in fact shrimp, not vegetable. Good thing I don't have a food allergy. I was over it at that point and full off of rice, I then told the waitress when she decided to come by the table and she gave me a veggie burrito to go. Drinks were good, but the food was not. The little bit of burrito that I did get to eat wasn't even flavorful, it was bland. Not only did they mess up my order, but they charged me for the shrimp dish. Needless to say, I won't be giving them another try.","My friend and I decided to try this restaurant because I saw good review on it, the service was slow even though there were only 2 other couples dining.  We ordered the shrimp burritos and the shrimp was barely cooked, more raw that cooked, and it had no flavor/seasoning.  We didn't even finish our meal, we asked for the check and left.  Wouldn't recommend to anyone.","Was looking for a Mexican restaurant that was more authentic than Taco Bell type and found this one. I am fir supporting people owned rather than corporate owned places when i can do we tried it. Small, cozy atmosphere with a nice staff. The one thing that caught my eye was freshly made Guac and it was. Has choice of 1 or 2 avocados as well as spiciness to taste cane with tortilla chips and we had an order of  Mexican corn delish. I had enchiladas with green sauce and it came with rice, black beans and a small salad for a very reasonable price. You had choice of vegetable, 3 types of meat or cheese....I love cheese enchiladas so I chose that. I was full. My husband had paella and he said it was very good as well. We each had drinks ( vodka lemonade .....was good and he had a martini of some kind). ALL FOOD WAS NICE AND HOT WHEN BROUGHT OUT. Ended meal with coffee and churros with caramel sauce (could also get with ice cream). Prices were reasonable. Only downside is parking. Give it a try.....they also do Grubhub and DoorDash . Also enjoyed listening to some Richie Valens...not to soft and not too loud. Give it a try if your in the mood for Mexican food!","Went for the first time. Sat outside.. super cute; Great atmosphere, music was good, food was good, very happy.Definitely be back!","Maizal never disappoints. They have the best guacamole on the island and their drinks are always delicious as well. We got empanadas off the regular menu, and the special menu as well as their stuffed sweet plantain which was delicious. I ordered the lamb on special that night and it was absolutely falling off the bone tender and flavorful! Highly recommend.",Maizal Restaurant
167,"I am disappointed! We were told about this place from a co worker. To begin with, the prices advertised on their menu online was outdated. The gyro was not great. The falafel was dry and messy. The spinach pie tasted as though the spinach was canned. It was not fresh at all. The prices definitely did not match the quality.",The rotisserie chicken was puny and had 10 or more feathers on it. I was so disgusted. None of their food is good but this was the last straw never again.,"I shop the grocery every now and then. Selections and prices are just fine. I've tried the chicken shawarma sandwich and found it to be very tasty. The beef shawarma was a bit dry. All in all, worth going back.",Very good food they treat you nice.Good prices nice selection.Makes you  feel like your in Islam.,"Decided to try this place based off of the reviews. Ordered a variety of grilled prepared meat a few days back; roughly 10lbs. Order was excellent, no complaints. Fast forward a few days later purchased the same order today; preparation was very sloppy, everything was randomly bunched together, food was extremely dry, burnt and very over cooked. Needless to say very dissapointed especially being the fact that it was a large purchase of food. I will be bringing my regular purchases back to Makkah Market; being that I never experienced such disappointment and there consistency is fabulous.",If I can describe this food with one word I would say authentic and also delicious but that's two words. It reminds me of me being back home and Egypt the chicken and the beef the rice was just spot on portions were great and the tahini was also very tasteful. For a very decent price you get a pretty big meal. My food was ready in 3 minutes and I cleaned the plate. It finally good to see an authentic arabic restaurant here in Staten Island. This place is a gem.,Lebanese Eatery
168,Mary Grace Horrible service and manager refused to speak with me.   3 people had food and 2 people had to wait for sushi for about 30 minutes.   I never will frequent the restaurant again.  The place was deserted.  Now I understand why,"Very bad service, it was the most unhappy dinner in my life ever! Nothing to say more. The worst restaurant in my neighborhood. Food are normal, worst service.","Ordered take out. I ordered Cold Sesame Noodles. Luke warm Noodles, a drop of sauce, no Scallions, small portion-poor. The dish my daughter ordered was unidentifiable! The  'sauce' was 'goo' and the 'Tofu ' was inedible. She threw it in the garbage. Never again.","Excellent service, fresh food.  The best wonton soup on the island.  Very authentic food and now have sushi.  Definitely worth trying.","This place is consistently inconsistent. They have really good food but the quality is hit or miss.The shredded general tsos chicken is a game changer. Their cashew chicken is also a must order. Good won-ton soup that comes with pieces of roasted pork. They have good portion sizes and their prices are pretty comparable to other restaurants in its bracket. However, like I said sometimes the quality just isn't there. I recently ordered pan fried chicken dumplings and a chicken with rice soup. The dumplings were luke warm at best and the ""soup"" was literally a pint of white rice that was rinsed with broth because there was barely any broth or pieces of chicken.Hopefully you will experience a meal when it's on an upswing because if so you'll enjoy your food. Cheers and good luck.","Best the island has to offer. Fun Food Family Great people, service, staff , food !",Jac Mao
169,"Ordered from this restaurant two times so far. First time zero complaints. Food came in a timely manner and everything was delicious!

Just wish things were handled a different way!","I have been ordering from Pizza Parlor through Grubhub for over a year now.  Although a bit expensive, I always found their food very good.  The delivery service however is horrendous.  Tonight, the driver was menacing toward my wife because he did not like the tip he was given.  He placed his foot inside the door so she could not close it, and did not give her the food, saying he needed a bigger tip.  Just know also, they have a $3 delivery charge which is higher than ANY other delivery service I have used on Grub Hub.  He finally left when he saw me drive up, and she threatened to call the police if he did not leave.  We called the restaurant and complained.  We were told the manager would call us back, but he never did.  I will never be ordering from this restaurant again, and will be sure to share this experience.",They're very overpriced for mediocre food.

I've been wanting to try this place for months after hearing so many good things about it. Finally decided to give it a try this weekend. I've read many reviewers complain about the delivery time, but honestly, that seems to be the only thing they managed to get right. I waited about 20-30 minutes, which really isn't bad for a weekend. I guess I just got lucky. Once I opened up my food, it was a continuous disappointment. First off, the round pizza was extremely greasy, with a terribly dry, hard crust. The sauce was flavorless. Overall, the pizza was just barely edible. When I called to complain I explained that I could go to any pizza joint in NJ or down south & get the same or better. Sad really, for a NY place. My spinach roll was even more of a let down! It was absolutely flavorless, and I soon discovered that what I thought was melted mozzarella, was actually raw dough! Their excuse for that little mishap was that everything is made fresh to order. Well, that's good, but it should be cooked. The calzone, while it had a respectable flavor, was way too greasy. Obviously, the oil wasn't hot enough when the calzone was dropped in for frying. To top it all off, when reviewing my receipt, I noticed they tacked on a delivery fee without telling me when I called in my order. No mention of a delivery fee on the menu I found via a google search either. When I called, after being placed on hold several times, I was offered another spinach roll, which I declined.  The young lady told me she would credit my account $7 for the roll, if I ever decided to give them another chance, which is extremely unlikely.  In short, save your money. This place is so not worth it. I threw the majority of an almost $40 order right into my trash can.","First time eating here. The food was delicious , the waitress was very attentive and I absolutely loved the cozy feeling. We will definitely be going back.",The Pizza Parlor
170,Subpar sushi at best. Not bad but not great. Wouldn't take the time to give it a second chance.,Rude staff. Ok food. But what's very concerning is my delivery orders always smell like cigarette smoke . I guess the delivery person smokes in there car but I find that unsanitary.,In my opinion you won't get a better deal than the Roll special for dinner. $9.25 gets you one of four possible combos of three different rolls. My choice included Philadelphia and Boston rolls and I'll vouch that both were well made.,"Best sushi on SI, hands down. I always order the dragon roll, fried rice, and philadelphia rolls.","I've eaten in a few times and ordered out as well, which was FAST delivery. The service has always been extremely good.The atmosphere is good, well lit and decorated, with country music that's a bit of a surprise for a sushi place, but I like country so it's a pleasant change. The food hasn't disappointed, from appetizers to soup and salads, mains, rice and noodles, and sashimi...nothing has blown me away, but the Spicy Tuna Sandwiches are a pretty solid go to!","We found this place by accident one night. Drinks were terrific as was the menu. The gyoza was great as were the spicy kani rolls, shrimp tempura rolls and California rolls . Going back to try more soon .",Misaki Sushi
171,Food is underwhelming fast food with table service Trying to be Irish Pub.....well you can put lipstick on a pig but.....Unfriendly towards LE MCNo truth be it I've been there several times had the Irish nachos not impressedWings ....yawnCould have gotten them from dominos,"So I waited about an hour and 45 min for corned beef which was literally cold cuts fried. Seems like a local pub where locals go regularly so we didn't fit in which didn't stop the bartender from completely ignoring us the whole night. Not one "" do you want another drink"" this place seems like a very down to earth atmosphere so it's upsetting that the experience didn't meet expectations. 1 star for service, food, and wait time.","Just walked out of this restaurant after almost 20 minutes of sitting at a table waiting to have our orders taken. The place wasn't even close to busy, either. The waitress, some young girl that looked like she was still in high school, took the order of the two tables right next to us within 5 minutes of them sitting down. We sat and watched as she checked on tables, chit chatted with ppl who worked there, and hung out behind the bar. It's a shame, we were looking forward to trying this place after seeing such good reviews. They just lost potential customers with appalling service.",Great little place with the most amazing food! Ruben egg rolls are a wonderfully tasty menu item!,"Where do I begin...found this pub surfing on Yelp again. I was out and about on a Sunday afternoon.  As soon as we walked in, we were greeted right away. We were invited to sit anywhere we wanted. We decided to sit at the bar. The vibe was friendly,  casual,  cool, laid back. Just how I like it. It was $.50 wing Sunday. And the wings were very good. We then proceeded to order the cheeseburger and prime rib sandwich.  Seasoned, tender and just great bar food. The drinks were good and the bartender was super friendly.  Excellent customer service. The added bonus was that the other patrons were also interactive and engaging.A definite gem to come visit. Cool/laid back.  And they have a theme each day.

172,"I ordered here for the first time tonight. Ordered a 1/4 white chicken and when I started to cut it up, it was red.. I checked the bones and it was bloody, like dark red blood. I am disgusted and I will never order here again.",A shame. This place had great chicken when they opened. Its now an overpriced lump of salt. Threw it out!,"Delivery took right at about an hour. We got a family meal (whole chicken with 2 sides & cornbread). I thought it was expensive for what it was. The chicken was well seasoned and not overly cooked. The sweet potatoes were ok (borderline too watery) until I found a long strand of blonde/brown hair in it (I have black hair). I know accidents happen, but this thoroughly grossed me out. I know sweet potatoes can get that stringy affect sometimes and this was not that. Cucumber salad was not fresh. The pieces of cucumber were discolored and see-thru, which tells me it has been marinating for way too long. Couldn't really eat it. For the price, the quality, and how long the food took to be delivered, I don't know that I want to order from here again...even with a coupon. From the horror stories of customer service in other reviews here, I don't think I want to call to voice any complaints. Would rather take the experience, learn, and move on. First and last time.","Best chicken on the Island really enjoyed crispy chickenfriendly  staff, very clean place","Food is really  good,  staff is very  friendly,  place  is very  clean plannin  to have a birthday  party,  Thank you",I stopped by la Rosa chicken $ grill for quick bite have to say i was a bit disappointed the service was very nice restaurant was clean but food was either cold or warm i had the Mac and cheese it was kinda cold the spinach was warm the chicken was like room temperature.

173,"We picked this restaurant because of the great reviews online. We had ordered the dry rub wings as our appetizer and were very disappointed. The wings were doused in the seasoning and it just wasn't flavorful. For our entree we had ordered the Texas Dunk burger, the Gringo burger and the Delmonico. The Texas Dunk burger was supposed to have Texas toast as the bread, but it just tasted like a bland over charred piece of white bread. No garlic flavor whatsoever. I was expecting the au jus sauce to be very flavorful but it tasted like water. The Delmonic, which is a steak sandwich, looked questionable. You couldn't tell if it was pork, chicken or steak because of it's gray color. The fries that came with all of these meals were very under seasoned. And lastly the Gringo Burger was just a basic burger to me that had some avocado and chipotle mayo on it. I personally would not recommend this place.","Yooooo chicken wings should never be served cold, no matter how many chicken wings you are serving for the night! There are definitely better choices when it comes to wings on Staten Island. There wasn't anything really special here. As I was digging into my food, the wings just get colder and colder, let refrigerator temperature and that is just depressing. I was full, but not satisfied.",Imagine my dismay when my friend from Atlanta Georgia comes to New York to visit and she is denied entry to the kettle Black for merely having an out-of-state ID mind you this was a completely real ID she was 22 years old. I am livid. I don't understand how an establishment can make up a rule when no other bar that I've ever been to has had such a rule. I will never be giving this place my business again. I am disgusted. Maybe they should get a scanner and up their game if they really want to be strict on IDs should have called the police. I would give it no stars if I could,"Great Decor, service is good, Great food for Lunch!Bar is always jumping!Had the burger , it was great, the fries were good! Chicken wings were great also!",Stopped in last night for some drinks with a friend who just moved to the neighborhood. I actually liked this location better than the one in Bay Ridge. Younger crowd and not as crowded. All the employees were friendly and approachable much like the Brooklyn location but just felt like a different vibe. We grabbed some take out on the way out and the food is the same as Brooklyn which is a good thing because I love the bar food. I will definitely be back!,"Local hangout with a nice bar, and on the other side is the restaurant section. It was poppin with good music, and crowd. The bartender knows how to make a drink.

174,"My wife and I went to this restaurant on a Sunday for a late dinner, the appetizer was ok , BUT the dinner was really bad, we had the Linguini de mar and it taste like they just pour some seafood stock over the pasta and that's all, and the service was not that great, perhaps they need to hire more staff, can't really think of leaving anything positive about this restaurant.","The taste was excellent. But in the other hand, the service was terrible. I sat for 20 minutes before anyone came to my table, my food was ordered and it took a half hour. Not to mention the appetizer that I ordered in the beginning was forgotten and came to me when my dinner was complete. For the price they charge for entrees the portions are very small, and entrees do not come with pasta nor a salad and bread, just an fyi.","It is a bold move to open a pizza place across the street to the neighborhood pizza institution, but Il Forno has exceeded my expectations. The meatballs were tasty and filled with cheese and their pizza was saucy and the crust thick.  They even bring you some sauce to dip your crust in.  Give this place a try!","Five star for a deliciously crafted pizza, good prices and great customer service.Came her for a quick dinner while on a business trip , place was busy but was created and seated right away.The interior is nicely setup and clean. Each table had your pizza topping essentials: grated Parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, oregano, salt and pepper. Before your pizza arrived they bring a warm cup of marinara sauce, perfect for dipping your crust.The pizza is delicious!!! Perfectly cooked with a semi-thin crust that has the perfect crunch and flavor from the wood fired oven. I ordered the Vodka and completely loved it!!!Definitely recommend this place!!",I just tried this place out for the first time last night. I was in the mood for Italian and saw how good the reviews were so I stopped in. The gentlemen (wish I got his name) at the front door was so sweet. Might of been a manager not sure but he mentioned his favorite dish to me so I tried it out. I think it was the Piccata ... something something  chicken breast with veggies and potato's in a lemon and white wine sauce. It was about $16 and change.You guys know I like to eat so I wish there would have been more food in the container. As you can see in the image attached there wasn't that much in it. Also I wish the potatoes were an actual potato the 3 potato wedges weren't cutting it Taste wise the dish was great it was a nice light flavor. So I was pleasantly surprised and the chicken was moist!!!! Everyone was friendly and the place looked really clean. Someone's crazy ass baby ran up on me other than that it was a good pick up experience. Even offered us water while we waited. I did however notice that everyone seemed to be ordering the pizza. That's what I would like to try and review next time!I will definitely be back.,"We've been back a few times and it really only has gotten better. I'd try the garlic bread app and ask for marinara on the side, the pizza we really have fallen in love with was the Napoli with kalamata olives and other great toppings.

175,the pizza was basically tasteless and the calzone was horrible,The food is delicious but everyone who works there has an attitude problem. They have sent out orders super late after closing so your only choice is to hope it shows up because the restaurant is unreachable. There have been time I have ordered food and things have been missing and the restaurant is closed and I was already charged. I got into an argument with the older women who works there because her driver didn't bring a slice I ordered. When I called she yelled at me but said she would send it. An hour later she called back saying someone els took it and she would refund my credit card for food I paid for and never got. I was never refunded and the owner said my boyfriend was a lier when bringing it up after yet more problems with the lack of professionalism in that place cause then to take orders without telling customers there system is down and they would only be accepting cash. They have no atm and he had to go on a wild goose chase for cash by the time he got the food he had to go back to work and could not eat. Never again mr pizza,"This place is usually our families to-go to place for pizza and most of the time, dinner. Not anymore. After waiting an hour and a half for an order, WE HAD TO CALL THEM; to then find out that our card was ""declined"". - Which is odd since we made a purchase several minutes before.Wouldnt a courtsey call been appropriate? Instead, my family waited rougly about an hour and a half for absolutely nothing? Highly disapointed. They lost a loyal customer due to a disloyal unethical/underpaid worker.Highly reccomend Barios. Called them and my card went through, instantaneously.","One of my favorite pizzeria in Staten IslandStaff and service are always greatPizza is always amazing I would suggest to order ahead, even if you decide to eat at the pizzeria because they are usually busy with other orders.

I'm guessing all these reviews come from non sushi eaters. Sushi isn't something that you should play around with eating and I wouldn't come back here. I gave it two tries because it's convenient and nothing about it was enjoyable either time. Didn't taste super old but definitely not fresh. Everything was bland. Service was bad as well and it could be a bit cleaner in the restaurant,"This place is awesome. Fast delivery. Friendly delivery men. And the menu is extensive. Soups, salads, fried rice, sushi burritos, sashimi.

Even if you don't eat fish, you'll have to order again and again, just to ATTEMPT to eat all the rolls you can get. Its a sushi place that mainly sells fish, but it's good for vegans and vegetarians too. All my fish eating pals liked the menu as well So, its been a real crowd pleaser.Their clove rolls are absolutely divine (and big too!), another fave of mine is the veggie dragon roll. Fried veggies topped with avocado and mango sauce. So good! Also, the prices are fair. Espcially if you order a combo menu. Miso soup, small salad, AND sushi for less than 20 dollars. Obviosuly, I  couldn't pass. My friends and I order here at least twice a month.Here's a bonus too, if you'd rather order off yelp. But you don't want to do it on the phone, since this is the 21st century and phones only exist for texting and apps. They have an online order form on their website,  you can even pay cash if you order directly through them! If you want to have a sushi night, I believe you found the place.","Went for dinner and had the summer salad which was delicious. Their sushi rolls as always are very fresh. We had the house special rice and Beef Negimaki dinner box, everything was flavorful and savory. The Japanese sodas were a plus. Ended with the green tea and red bean ice cream tempura. Loved everything and service was great!",the Master/owner I assume?is So friendly and nice!! I asked him for direction and it was couple next door lol.So I decided to go back and eat for lunch!And omg the best JapaneseFood I've had specially the tempura freshly fried yummmm!!! Pork Katsu also was good!I only dislike the lady at register not so friendly :/ her face expression and vibe not feeling it!I hope they deliver around my area!,SoGoGooGo Sushi
177,"Never really cared for this place especially the situation with parking. They never improve on this as they find it easier to use valet which I hate using. The seafood was subpar for the price and the service was a six on a scale of 1 to 10.There are about 25 better seafood restaurants to eat on Staten Island yet we live and learn..Oh,if you like the smell of salt water then this is the place for you",Ate lunch outside - not worth the money. Service is slooowwwww. Ordered drinks and waited and waited. Finally the drinks arrive and we can order some lunch! Well food is just not that good. It was not hot. The attitude of the workers are meh! They are young and don't care. The  first time I attempted to eat there we were seated and ignored- I left and when I mentioned this to the hostess- she giggled. Shocked at the drink prices - what a rip off!. What a shame - it has such a lovely view which is the reason for the 2 stars also food was edible not great.,I got roofie there... I'm still sick.Sick of bad bartender and bad service.Good luck to everyone who goes there.,First time back here since 2009 and since it was rebuilt after Hurricane Sandy...Still good service and good food...,"Went here for a lunch with some lady friends. Prices service and food was all amazing. A very nice spot down by Great Hills Harbor and what a view. The restaurant is clean bright and gorgeous. Will definitely be back and will recommend to family,friends and coworkers.","Went tonight with my family to the tiki bar outside. It was a nice cool end of summer breeze. Food was great, we had the crab lobster sliders, then the shrimp and fish tacos . So good, attentive service , music playing, a few drinks, peach sangria was awesome, mai tai , and special drinks so good. Will try to come back again before fall comes calling .",Marina Cafe
178,i placed an order directly on doordash. when dasher driver waited more than 30min the driver and myself grewly impatient not prepping on time and skipped my order. but the dasher driver gave the assigned order to another driver to delivered my house.thats for 1hrs for waiting,"**BEWARE** They are not a friendly with Doordash Or Gruhub .  While I was waiting for the food to be ready, I when to use the bathroom and when I came out, they lady at the cash register told me/ point to a sign that the bathroom  is for customer only .  She told me that the owner told her to said that. I never have a problem with other restaurant. We r here to help you promote your business, so you can make more money.    I understand if a customer is waiting to use the bathroom but  there is no customer inside the store.  **SO BEWARE TO ALL DELIVERY DRIVERS**","Usually love their chicken but today was horrible! Chicken was over fried and dried out, cold and I asked for blue cheese and was given ranch which I didn't realize until I got all the way home. $24 wasted!!! Smh","truth is, my bf and i only came here because of rhett and link (their youtube show on wings rated wingstop at the top during the taste test). and we were stunned by how satisfying their wings were. the flavors of the sauces were multi layered, savory, and brought the heat with a hint of acidity. we experienced a delightful meltdown on the spot. it was 100% worth the 25 min drive each way. service was on point. we'll be back.","These Wingstop locations have been popping up all over the tri-state area. I've tried one over in Jersey and had my share of opinions. One thing that stood out most was the size of the wing for the price. Decided to give them another try in Staten Island. I've been using your competitor down the road since 2015. On today's visit the price jumped out at me more than ever. I'll go through some things they're doing well compared to them. I ordered the 10 Bone in wing combo. For starters they offer 10 wings (any flavor), side of fries or veggie sticks, sauce, and a drink for $14.99. With tax that's over $16 dollars. Down the road you can get the same combo deal plus fries for less than $14. However, since the last time I've visited them, I know their wings are much smaller. They do look like they're dehydrated. These wings are now much meatier and juicy. If you recently changed that, thank you. Before I was left hungry. Your veggie sticks are a nice size portion and the side of blue cheese is the perfect size for the serving. The negative thing I have to say about the wings is you have to make sure they come out covered in sauce or else they don't look appetizing. Your competitor also offers 20 different ways to have your wings. Sometimes less is better anyways. I attached a picture so you can see what I mean about the covering of the sauce. Overall, at first I was like wow that's a lot for wing combo but after tasting the finished product and leaving full. I won't mind paying a little more for them. Your competitor stopped put prices on their menu for wings only until you actually create an order can you see the prices. If they advertise that you might lose business at first but if they step up their wing game you might get a run for your money. In the end your establishment is clean and your employees are nice. The wings are scheduled to take about 15 minutes to come out but I don't mind waiting for hot fresh food. You lost an additional star for something I saw in your restaurant but I won't mention it here. You can reach out to me via private message if you'd like to know more.

Also looked like they had some good interesting flavors I did medium and the Louisiana flavors $13 with a side and a soda ....Only issue is was only 8 wings 4 and 4 on the flavors wouldn't have minded 10 wings keep it a nice number. But I'll go back.Wish their was a mother location on SI closer to my house on the south shore I'd visit more often,Wingstop
179,Food is good but the service is terrible. Don't come here unless you want to wait a long time for your food. It's good but not worth the wait.,Really like the food and the view! I'm not giving it 5 stars because the service was really slow. Other than that everything was deli!,"There is a reason why this place have 2.5  Service is not the best, I also been told by the waiter ""we don't get enough money so we decided to add 18% tip to any table that looks tourist"" I mentioned I'm not a tourist and I believe you should say somewhere that your going to add that % to the bill, especially that we are only 2 people at that table. Not going back and will share that experience with anyone I can, to make sure everyone know that River dock cafe - rip off his costumers.",Went there one night last week can't remember what night but the service was pretty incredible Donna our server couldn't do enough or be more pleasant !!The food was great We had the Southwest pot that was amazing and Thai mussels !! Both were exceptional We'll be back Thanks Donna !,"I live in Staten and went to visit the new outlets by the ferry. There's no restaurants open there yet and we wanted something to eat. River Dock is more a part of the ferry terminal with added tables outside in the summer. The best thing about this place is the view!  I had the impression that since it was in the ferry terminal it wasn't going to be good but that really doesn't have to be true. Unfortunately i was right. The menu looks great and loaded with seafood but I ordered a southwest salad and my friend had the shaved steak sandwich. We waited 40 minutes for the food. Besides the tiny tortilla chips that looked like Chinese noodles , there was nothing southwest about my salad. Wheres the black beans and corn?? Onion? Trader Joe's makes a better southwest salad. At least serve it in a tortilla shell so it appears a bit larger than the slightly larger side salad that it was. My friends steak sandwich was under whelming. After this we ran to Hagan Daaz to have something satisfying. They have a good drink and beer selection and I was actually able to get a bottled beer for $4.(The black olives seen in the photo of my salad came from my friends side salad)","I went with a group of friends and because we didn't have time to explore Staten Island, we decided to give this spot a try. It was a large group but the place was not super busy. It took awhile for us to get served. Our server was okay but very structured in her method of taking orders. My friend was really hungry and wanted her meal with the appetizers and she told her no and that she has to wait. Then my friend wanted dessert early, again a no. Finally ordered calamari, lobster ravioli and crab cakes. The calamari wasn't bad. Nor the best, not the worse.  After time, I forgot I order crab cakes. The food came out including the crab cakes. The lobster ravioli was okay. My friends had issues with their food, especially the lobster mac and cheese which was like it came from the box. My friend did finally say something. I didn't eat all my crab cakes but overall they were okay. I ended up leaving two of the three there on accident. I would probably not return since there are so many other restaurants in NYC to try out. It served its purpose for the group that night.",River Dock Cafe
180,"Guess I ordered the wrong items on the menu because I wasn't impressed.  The mozzarella on the pizza was very thick almost chewy, the stuff meatball was huge, pasta with mixed seafood tasted fresh, and the cheesecake wrap was amazing. Christmas music was playing and the staff was attentive. I would give it a 2.5 but will go back to try other items","Not a bad option. Not the best either.They certainly skimp on their sandwiches. When there is more arugula than meat, there's a problem. Also, their ""fresh"" mozzarella leaves a lot to be desired. Sliced thin and it's dry.  If you're looking for a thick slab of spongy, milky goodness dripping down your sandwich you're in the wrong place. They get an extra star for good deserts and coffee.","If I could eat at aunt butchies everyday I would . Everything is delish, I give them5 stars all day long","Aunt Butchies is my go to neighborhood restaurant and where I take my family when they are in from out of town and want delicious,  homestyle Italian.  Always fresh, great specials that are thoughtfully prepared and served. Pete and his staff are the absolute best.","This place just went from a 5 star sandwich place to a generic Italian restaurant. They ruined their most unique aspect, which was their unique sandwich assortment with 4 bread options: hero, ciabatta, panina, or wrap. They completely removed their sandwiches like the fried chicken BLT, or the sandwich with fried chicken, prosciutto, mozzarella, arugula, and delicious pesto. Now the only sandwich options are the standard Italian/pizza joint staples. I get it, restaurants change their menus. But among everyone I know who's eaten at this restaurant, we all agree it is known for the sandwiches. Now it's been converted to Staten Island Italian Restaurant/Bakery #659. The food is not bad, but it's nothing standout like their sandwich menu was. I'd say 3.5 stars for their current food, but I'm giving it 1 because it's such a detrimental change, as there is no reason for me to ever visit the restaurant again.","We go to Aunt Butchies for desserts all the time in Brooklyn but I happened to stumble on their restaurant/bar on Staten Island on a Sunday afternoon.  There wasA large party going on and I sat at the bar for a quick bite.  Amber my bartender was attentive and friendly.  I got my Bloody Mary ( good but I would like more garnish on it) and a Pete's salad with grilled shrimps.  The salad was good, Amber's suggestion, and the grilled stumps was just right and the size was jumbo size. The dressing is ample with good amount of piece oil, I like it but for those who doesn't like heavy dressing you may want to have the dressing on the side . It has slice apples, Gorgonzola cheese, cranberries on a bed of mixed greens, perfect for this spring weather.  Overall it was great.  Haven't try their entrees so for what I got I give 5 star",Aunt Butchies of Brooklyn
181,Place was dirtyDirty tables Dirty bathrooms Dirty floors  so disappointed Food good Staff friendly but we had to ask for everythingWater forks salt pepper I'm come on,"After a gym work out we wanted to stop here for dinner.  We parked right in front of Millie's, as we get out we see a family walking out and two waiters running out after them saying excuse me we forgot to charge you for something!! We found this super bizarre! We walked in and she must have been the manager she acknowledged us with a Hi, then turned to a young lady and was literally scolding her at the hostess stand saying you need to pay more attention!  Well what's that saying ""do as I say not as I do"" because she just ignored us to yell at her employees!  After yelling at her employee in front of everyone, She wanted to seat us in front of a wall so we asked to be seated somewhere we can see the outside. Two waitresses come over to a computer terminal while we were looking at the menu and started talking. They were cursing and speaking terrible of the restaurant. We both looked at each other like, this is a joke!  We picked up and just left. Super unprofessional and they couldn't care less! In summary this place is a joke with customer service. Who ever trained the staff didn't do a great job. They have no respect for management and management has no respect for the staff.  The first time we came was unprofessional and this time was ten times worse. Get someone to train your staff properly or find new staff!","NEVER AGAIN.. FAMILIES STAY AWAY!! We ate here tonight 4 adults. 5 kids under 2yrs old the waiter brought over seltzer drinks for everyone when only 2 asked for them when the bill came 9 seltzers were charged for. We order a pie of pizza half pepperoni half soppasate They charged us for a FULL pie and FULL pie even know it was half and halfTHE WAITER was horrible that at the end of the night after a $300 bill for 2 pizzas 1 calzone a kids penne n butter a salad 4 beers 2 sangrias and 2 drinks and the extra 9 seltzers that NOONE ordered  he didnt even have the decency to buy the last round of 2 beers we ordered, then the manager comes out and says sorry this is our policy we dont buy our customers a drink or take anything off the bill.   AS for that millies is a POS place to dine with your family and are not a business that should be honored with customers","The meatballs in marinara sauce were great. Mom, dad and kids all loved it.The Millie's signature pie was very good. Plenty of sauce which was nice. The vegetarian pie was just ok. Wouldn't order again. Seemed under-cooked. The toppings made the pizza heavy and the crust was mushy. Needed a knife and fork. Wouldn't stop us from going back. Nice place and other pies to try!","$$$$, food was average, cost was high,,,$3.00 for a cup of coffee!!Calazone $19.00, Really!!!The Calazone might be fresh, but a 35 minute wait isn't worth the average quality,,it was a spinach calazone with raw spinach,,,,it would have been nice if it was sauteed in garlic to give some flavor to the calazone,,,but it wasn't...meatballs were just average,,,,I won't be back!!! For 2 the bill was $44.00,,,just a expensive pizza place!!!","How is this place still making money and breaking even to pay rent?!My family and I came here to celebrate my mom's job promotion for an early dinner. Easy parking (it's a parking lot) and immediate seating (place was pretty empty since we came here around 3p on a Sunday). We were all excited to come here and at first glance of the menu it looked pretty promising. We ordered a few appetizers and a couple of pizzas (coal and wood) to share. This is the part where I don't even know where to begin on how disgusting the food is. The only ""ok"" food we ate was the salads but, I wouldn't even come here for the salads again. There was absolutely no difference to both of their wood burning vs. coal burning pizzas. You would think that being this establishment is mainly pizza heavy based that their pizzas are all pretty solid and speaks for themselves. The pizzas were sloppy, soggy, and tasted like some of the ingredient were spoiled. The clam pizza we got had sand in it and def didn't not taste fresh. 99 cents pizza in BK/Manhattan is wayyy better than this place. I'd rather eat at the mini Pizza Hut stand inside Target than come here again. I cannot stress enough about the Chargrilled Oysters...oh my JESUS!! It tasted and looked like it has been microwaved and it's tasted off-putting.  I wouldn't even come back here if I got a free coupon meal. If you like spoiled food and overpriced menu then this is 100% your place.",Millie's Old World Meatballs & Pizza
182,How does this restaurant have four stars???  They served me soup that had gone sour. Worst Italian deli on Staten Island,I lived near by and love the ham hero there. But each time as I go back the meat get less and less that was Prepared by the older man. It's not worth it for 9 bucks. The younger man gave much more ham compared to the older one. Too bad I rarely see the younger one behind the counter. I'm disappointed and felt cheated.,Nice try but this is not Italian. These sandwiches need to be called junk panini. Why can't you guys call it something else? Why ruin the Italian cuisine reputation?,"Old-School neighborhood Italian sandwich spot.  This place has been a Staten Island institution for like 50 years and has sandwiches from $5 - $20.  In the $5-$6 range you have all your classic sandwiches including the famous ""Chicken Lu-Lu"" Parms & Subs.  Other options and sandwiches include all the favorite Italian heavy-hitter ingredients.  I live in Queens and pass through SI about twice a month and I ALWAYS make a stop here",Was passing by nearby and found this place on yelp. It was exactly as they described it. It was literally a hole in the wall that takes you back in time to a old school Italian Eatery. They have tons of specials and the pricing is great I got the chicken Lulu and it was a large grinder type of sub with chicken cutlet which wasn't too thick and it wasn't overly breaded so it was actually pretty good and it was covered in gravy with cheese on top. Pretty good sandwich. Next timeI will  try something different but honestly a great place to get lunch or a quick bite.The family that works there is honestly super nice!!,"Can't go wrong for their excellent price! $5 subs? Hell yeah im down! Chicken lulu, chicken parm, eggplant parm! All very good! Got the $3.50 breakfast sub too ! Italian sausage (homemade fresh) with mozzarella and eggs! Totally in love with this place!Owner and staff is very friendly also!",Ariemma's Italian Deli
183,Pizza was great. Which is all I can say. Filet of sole was over cooked. Steak was horrible. Veal parm...no good.  Dessert... sorbet was great. I ordered an apple crumble and it tasted as it someone put Parmesan cheese in it!!! Ugh!!! The manager never came over to check on us.  Would never ever go here again!!! Should be zeroStars- but yelp won't allow me to post with no stars selected.,This has the be the worst customer service I've ever experienced in my life. I have celiac and called ahead to book a party for my mom's birthday. They said they had gluten free options for me. When I got there there was not a single person working in the restaurant that even knew what gluten was and told me I wouldn't be able to eat there. I asked to speak to the chef and he was so rude and actually threw a package of gluten free spaghetti at me and told me he didn't know how to cook it. We were a party of 10 and we all left. I can assure you that no one I know will ever be eating there again. The restaurant was empty and now and can see why.,Rip off. Offered a Moms day special menu that had inflated prices and crappy food. For example the kids menu had penne and butter for 15$ and chick fingers was 17$. Chick parm was 30$ when it's 20$ on regular menu. Also charge 3 1/2 % on cards. Stay away,Excellence from food to service. Hostess made me and my wife feel very welcomed. My waiter Adam absolutely crushed explaining everything I had questions for. I'm a picky eater and I would definitely come back and recommend to a friend!!!,Very reasonable lunch special on Hylan Blvd! Coworkers ordered eggplant parm which came with a sautéed spinach on the side. I ordered a chicken frances which paired with spinach on the side as well. Portion for the eggplant parm looked huge and it tasted good but my chicken portion was smaller than another image I saw on yelp. It was nice that they had bread to start off.,My sister had my nieces communion here. The staff was very accommodating to children and adults.   Food was delicious and they kept everything moving like clock work. I have to say they were quiet amazing. The ambiance is nice and great for a date night.,Cafe Luna
184,"I like quick grill. The food is decent. Better than the mall hibachi place but they should change their name to slow grill. For a supposed ""quick"" place, they take forever. I placed an order through seamless which said pickup in 20 minutes. I walked in after 20 minutes, I get to the counter and the guy behind the counter couldn't even be bothered to address me. He ignored me until I called his attention. I asked him how long until my order would be ready. He takes a look at the order tickets and tells me 30 min. He hasn't even looked at my order let alone cook it! Ridiculous! I have to place an order an hour in advance for pickup?!","If I could give them 0 stars I would. I called them up for a delivery and they asked for my address. I literally said 1 number before I could even finish giving them my address the guy on the phone is saying very rude/mean with a nasty attitude ""WHAT DO YOU WANT? WHAT DO YOU WANT? WHAT DO YOU WANT? WHAT DO YOU WANT?"" So I hung up right away before I went off on the guy. And that is how you lose customers. Being a stupid nasty fuck.",If you like Stop & Shop Sushi you'll love this place. They should change the name to bodega sushi. Another one of  Staten islands crappy food spots! Staten island has the worst food known to man!! Awful people behind the counter look like viat-Congs! just saying,"I have ordered pickup from here only a few times, so don't have a basis for delivery yet. However service and food has been really good for the times I have ordered takeout! It's definitely not ""gourmet"" or authentic Japanese by any means, but it is still tasty for its price point and hits the spot. I like the California roll. It is different from a traditional California roll but unique and has a good flavor. Avocado could be fresher. The salmon teriyaki is tasty and has a good texture, is prepared the way I like it and similar to more expensive Japanese spots. If I'm craving salmon teriyaki I'd definitely order here again.","Food; i loved their quickgrill sushi roll! It had shrimp tempura, spicy crab meat, avocado, and spicy mayo sauce. (Would get again)We also got their California roll which was decent. The spicy Kani salad was alright, tasted more like cold slaw with a few pieces of avocado. It was $6 and I didn't know until I ordered it. I definitely would not get that again. I want to try their teriyaki chicken though! Service: the servers were nice and wait was about 5-7 minute pretty average.Price; the quickgrill was $8 and Cali roll was $4-5. I would go during happy hour 2:30-5:30 to get the regular rolls. Again my kani salad was a purchase I regret getting. Vibe; casual interior, you go up to order and then wait for it. I think it's a good sushi spot on the island, and definitely would come back for that chicken (saw others have it and smelled bomb!!!)","My office orders from Quick Grill Japan at least 3 times a week. The food is good and delivery is fast. I highly recommend the bento box. It is larger than I thought: it is a fantastic deal for the amount of food you get and I enjoyed every piece. There a dine-in/pick up coupons on the menu just FYI.Without coupons the food is inexpensive anyway, and completely worth it.",Quick Grill Japan
185,I order the hibachi chicken and steak with fried rice on the side and it didn't meet my expectations. Firstly they messed up the rice order. Secondly they hibachi chicken was not that get. It was very chewy. The steak was good. Wish there was more of it.,Ordered the bento box. It was ok. I've had other bento boxes before from other places and found that avocados makes there's very greasy.,Got food poisoning from here! Lettuce tasted a little off I should have known better.,"Sushi is good get what you pay for delivery super fast, Philadelphia roll could be better.","When they first opened they were excellent. But maybe there got to comfortable or too cocky. The last time I went there I was alone so it was a table for one. I got a cold greeting and was seated not one waitress brought me water or came to the table for at least 15 mins to take my order. And please note that it was 1pm on a Monday. So there only 2 tables seated including mine and staff was just hanging out at the register. Anyway, I ordered a seaweed salad tasted old I should've known better than to go on a Monday. Then i ordered tofu pad Thai had a bad smell. I only had a bite and couldn't even look at it as it made me nauseous. I will not go back nor ever order from this place. Do not recommend to anyone.","Avocado this avocado that! I would think that for a restaurant named avocado, there would be more avocado items on the menu. Felt like I kinda got tricked into coming in for my love of avocado but this place did not disappoint! Lunch specials are great! $13 for a special roll and regular for $10 for 3 regular rolls. My friend and I got one of each, of course had to get avocado in the rolls! It was so fresh and avocado was fully riped without browning. Soup and salad to start off the meal is always great! I will be back!",Avocado Sushi
186,"The staff was nice, but the food was overpriced for its low quality. The tacos were soggy and the burrito was mostly made of peppers. Overall, I would never go back. Very disappointing and a waste of money.","I have never had such a terrible food experience. I've never had worse food. I know I sound dramatic but it was awful. It tasted like everything was fake and canned. The nachos tasted like they had fake queso on it and even the ""cheese"" and lettuce tasted canned! This was just our appetizers. For our entrees we got vegetable tacos and jalapeño poppers. The jalapeño poppers tasted worse than shop-rite mozzarella sticks. They were of lesser quality than the wawa gas station brand. I am so utterly disappointed in the food I had today. I didn't even finish my food. The tacos, along with their fake cheese and lettuce, were indigestible. I'm not over exaggerating. Do not go here if you want good food--seriously.","I've gone here a few times for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and the young men that take our order always mess it up.   We order steak tacos and they bring us beef, we order steak salad and they forget the steak.  Not to mention the salad was warm today. And not room temperature- it was warm and the guacamole tasted spoiled or old.  I didn't eat the salad and set it on the edge of the table and they didn't even ask what was wrong with it.  We left without tipping. We won't be going back.",I really enjoyed this place. It is so affordable and the quality of food is great. I got a salad taco bowl and it kept me full all day long. The quesadillas are definitely worth trying. I really enjoyed the Decour of all the different hot sauces in the background. I came here with a party of eight people and they were very accommodating.,"Ok so here's the thing  - it's kinda like a sold 3 star place. It's ok. It's not super high quality and not authentic at all. They sometimes mess up your order or forget stuff. Service isn't always the best. But the staff is always very nice, portions are generous, the prices are decent, there is a tiny parking lot but tons of street parking - I think that's why people love it here. The free chips and salsa - chips are thin and salty. Salsa tastes like jarred tomato sauce - it's sweet. Ask for the warm hot sauce - it's green and much better. Or you can dip your chips in hot sauce. There are a few to choose from. The nachos are huge and honestly have to be shared. It's just too much food. But sometimes they forget stuff like beans or sour cream. It's ok. It's a huge messy pile of nachos w/ like velveeta cheese and tons of it.The drinks are ok. Sometimes weaker than other times. Depends on bar tender that day. And they blend drinks to order so sometimes the blender goes off a few times during our meal. The tacos are ok. Good portion. Order anything from brunch menu and get 2 hours unlimited drinks for $15. Good deal.It's a little dark inside and very basic. It's usually pretty busy.","Finally hit this Mexican taco restaurant after passing it for the last 6 to 8 years ..... what can I say we were always booking back home to Brooklyn... traffic lol !!! Always noticed that this place was packed on a Friday & Saturday night, we always looked in through the window.... It's was Tuesday 3/19/19 around 3:30pm we just finished running errands so we decided to give this place a go ....Of course we had this place to our self's; we were greeted with smiles & very friendly servers...........Great music playing which takes you on a vacation when dining here ..... Fresh warm nachos served with homemade salsa ...Then we order a small side of home made guacamole with of course I save some to top my steak tacos....My steak tacos were off the chain delicious very authentic tasting loved their green sauce !!!The wife went with their chicken fajita which she loved; both plates served with Mexican rice along with re-fried beans ....  I tried the wife's chicken which was on the money !!! Desert we went with the fried vanilla ice cream !!!Omg also delicious!!!No disappoints here everything we had was spot on .... we have a lot of family on this island so we are going to do our best to get them to eat over here ....Much thanks to Arturo & our server Syliva for a fantastic food experience.... we will be back again with friends & family ....Also, we like to offer our condolences to this owner's family & staff !!!!  Keep making him proud .....",Paco's Mexican Bistro
187,"I really enjoyed the okra, which went well with the pita. The biryani was tasty and so was a spicy rice dish.","The owner lady is a crook. She cheated on our order first time by more than 50%. When we followed up and went a few months later to collect food to make up the amount she shorted, she gave 50% of what we ordered and filled up the order with whatever she wanted, perhaps left over stuff. She speaks very sweetly, but she is a snake of a woman! Be aware!!","A no frill authentic restaurant. We had the string hoppers, crab curry, kothumai roti and mutton curry. Well spiced, good portions and affordable.  Sadly they did not have watlapam or hoppers which I was hoping for.  But knowing how much work is required for both dishes,  I understand why they weren't available just like that.   The nice lady at the counter told me she can make it if I call her a few days before.  Planning on doing just that.","Nestled in a small area of Staten Island stands this little treasure. Can be easily missed it is by a Bus stop however if you go at the right time you will find street parking. I fall short of words to describe the food here. It is as authentic as it gets, no frills, no nonsense...just good old fashioned food. This happy, chirpy owner is bound to cheer you up. Check your expectations at the door and be prepared to be amazed. This is why I love small mom and pop businesses. They cook from the soul. They put in so much heart, you get to experience it in their food. Just fantastic! Go here and come back to thank me","Going to New Asha is like going to an auntie's home for home-cooked Sri Lankan food. The hostess warmly welcomed us into the small establishment, where a live cricket game was playing on TV. We ordered a veggie platter with rice. The sides included yellow lentils, green beans, and eggplant. Richly spiced but not actually spicy, this combination was my favorite. I especially loved the dal and the green bean dish, both of which were slightly sweet. In addition, we ordered fish and chicken curry with roti. Both were very spicy but provided nice balance with the milder vegetarian selection. My main criticism is that the roti was a bit and the fish and chicken tough; these were lukewarm and could have been heated more.For dessert, we ordered a falooda, which was sweet and creamy, with basil seeds, ice cream, and a refreshingly strong rose taste. In total the meal came out to $23.50--not bad for a good amount of food and wonderful service and hospitality.To note: string hoppers were not available for lunch while we were there.","As I've come to realize, Staten Island's Tompkinsville houses a pretty large Sri Lankan community, and therefore some great Sri Lankan restaurants. The fantastic food and even more fantastic service from the owner herself at New Asha makes this more of a 4.5-star review.The six of us practically filled up the restaurant when we entered. Luckily the owner and other customers eating there were very gracious and allowed us to move tables and chairs together to accommodate our group.Appetizers were ridiculously affordable and delicious. The fish egg roll and fish roti were $1.75 each, and they were packed with a spicy fish mixture. I saw ""egg roll"" and my mind immediately jumped to the Chinese version, but it's quite different. There was an actual hard-boiled egg inside, and the filling was well-spiced and very flavorful.They didn't have the crab curry when I went, so I opted for the squid curry. It was a dry variety, not steeped in a stew or sauce, and it was a bit too firm and dry for me, but still tasty and came with a few pieces of roti. To remedy this, the owner actually brought over a container of dhal and some fish curry gravy on the house. She also gave us additional portions of squid curry and roti. What a sweetheart.I tried my friend's mutton curry platter, and it was quite spicy but very flavorful, with plenty of dhal and various dipping sauces and veggies. The mutton came in nice meaty cubes with no fattiness whatsoever. They were a bit tough, but I've come to realize that most mutton dishes are like that and I'm just not a big fan.At the very end, the owner gave us some vegan tapioca pudding for free. It was a bit too sweet for me, but my friend absolutely loved it. The golden raisins inside add a bit of refreshing tanginess to the creaminess.The food was just the right amount of spicy for me, but too much to handle for a few people in our group. A bunch of us ordered the deliciously sweet, thick mango lassis to dull the tingle a bit. I really enjoyed my meal here and I'm determined to make the trip back.",New Asha Sri Lanka Restaurant
188,Went there for dinner at about 7 pm and the place was padlocked. Prior to going there I tried calling both sites and no answer and no message request. I can only assume they are closed.,"We drive paste this place almost every day.  We impulsively decided to stop because we were both starving!  The head waiter didn't give us the time of day.  He's at our table and was constantly turning to look at another table.  He never gave us 100% of his attention.  I do not feel like a customer.  I felt as though we were annoying him and he had more important customers to deal with.  We overlooked the poor service.  The the food came! There was Sand in the clams & linguini! The pasta special bathed in butter and no real taste.  Thank goodness we only ordered mains!  We left 90 percent of food on the plate.  Never once did our waiter check on us!  We waived him down to get the bill and he came over asked if we wanted our food to go, we said no there is sand in my clams and linguini.  Did he apologize?  No!  Offer a refund?  No!  To be fair I didn't ask for one either.  Bad service and bad food.  One is bad enough but to have a combination is lethal.  #nevergoingbackOne good note, The singer was refreshing!",Food was ok at best everything was smothered with sauce very dated menu. Price was right for what we got $145 for 2 people. Drinks were on point but we got the check handed to us with our after dinner drinks at the bar.,"This place is the tits. Best Italian food on the island and honestly hard to beat anywhere else.The only critique I would have of this place is the desert menu but that's my preference. Wish they would make a fluffy esq cake instead of the brownie type cake that's so heavy and thick . The staff 10/10The parking 5/10 (if you have a low car be careful, you will bottom out at the entrance into their parking otherwise park elsewhere and walk) Bartender .she cool af. Very friendly and inviting when you walk in. Manager or owner always greets you with a smile .Over all great dining experience and atmosphere. (I dine here once a week)  and feltThe need to write something nice after coming to other shitty places on Staten Island. This place a gem.",Very good food nice.people. They have a good selection.They treat you nicely and respectful.One of the best places in Staten Island.,"The atmosphere was nice and not to noisy. I went for a going away party with co workers. The food was yummy, but the portions were a little small for the prices. I'm not sure if I would go again, bit if u like Italian this place could be for u.",Da Noi Downtown Staten Island
189,The service was non existent. I saw the waitress twice. To place the order and to get the check. I mean really? They were actually moving chairs and tables over my head during the entire dinner. The food was very average especially for the price.Edit: somehow yelp added a star to this review so im updating it back to 1 star,The service was non existent. I saw the waitress twice. To place the order and to get the check. I mean really? They were actually moving chairs and tables over my head during the entire dinner. The food was very average especially for the price.,"Right to the point they have a limited menu with no specials, started out with the PIE mussels that were the smallest I ever saw then I ordered hanger steak that was priced at $32 which came with a basket of fries lol, more like diner food and your paying for the view and nothing else.","Decent food & nicest public patio in the area! Don't come here for fast service, amazing food or a solid bang for your buck. Come here for the beautiful patio on the Boardwalk facing the Verrazano! If you're too lazy to drive down the Garden State Parkway, this place will get you that nice Ocean breeze without leaving the island.The food is solidly mediocre here for lunch, its like eating at any diner on the island. The prices aren't a bargain but they really aren't expensive when you account for overhead, rent here is expensive & its got a monopoly in the area if you want to eat along the Boardwalk. The burger is probably the best deal on the lunch menu, its a healthy size and comes with a generous basket of fries (all lunch combos are under $20). The breakfast plates are underwhelming but they do the job.","We chose this restaurant mainly because of their fantastic view in the patio. Waitress was great and food was decent though choice were limited and we were provided an outdated menu initially.I could have given them 4-star if the host didn't ruin the day. As we came here for the view, I asked the host if can we sit closer to the beach. I was told all those table were reserved. But shortly after, at least two other parties asked for different tables and were told to sit wherever they like. Not sure why but clearly we were victims of discrimination.","Just meh. Looks are deceiving. You'd expect it to be so good and have high quality seafood. We got the seafood tower which is $100, perfect to share with a group of people. The lobster wasn't even cleaned fully of all the gunk inside. I crave crab legs veryyyyy often and these were the worst I've ever had! The smell was so awful - like some kind of ammonia and rot. Oysters were okay, clams were fresh. Service was eh. I used to come years ago and it was great, I'm not sure what changed. Too bad. I won't be coming back for seafood here again. 1 star for good drinks 1 star for decent service.",South Fin Grill
190,Had a friend go into this place first time. The food was okay but that wasn't the problem. It was the attitude recieved from the men working there. Not very welcoming. Makes me not want to go in myself.,"Pizza is decent, nothing more nothing less. Workers all have rude attitudes. Will not be back though because it's too expensive, there's better pizza for cheaper on every block on Staten Island. NEXT!!!!!!","Hands down, the best pizza I've had in my life. Crispy bottom, but chewy where it needs to be. Browned cheese, but not burnt. Tangy sauce, and not too much. Even the pizzas with more complicated toppings are sublime.And then there is the hospitality. It's trite to say that a business treats you like family, but I felt like a long lost cousin here. The owner and employees broke every negative stereotype of New Yorkers that I had.If you are visiting NYC, it's worth going out to Staten Island for DOUGH. Even if it takes up a solid chunk of your day to get out there. Legit.",I drive by this location all the time when I go to the SIUH or doctor offices near SIUH and I thought wow what a cute place for a pizza shop. I do not even remember what was there before Dough took over.I ordered two pies from them and I found it delicious for modern style of pizza. Pistachio Pesto Pie and Margarita PieMy parents are old fashioned and they were not a fan of this place That is ok! Just means more for me. :) Cannot wait to come back here to try more of their specialty pies.,"Horrible service wouldn't order againOverhyped, stick with another Island favorite like Lees or Brothers$45 min for delivery yeah ok","Not your average pizza! Hands down one of the best the island has to offer. Ingredients are fresh and menu is creative. This is not a ""sold by the slice"" joint. Dough is no joke and if you haven't tried it. What are you waiting for ?!",DOUGH By Licastri
191,"I am extremely disappointed that I have to write this review with only 3 stars. Within the last 5 months my family has had over 6 parties at the Staaten. Last night I had my rehearsal dinner here. There were fruit flies ALL over the room. One was in my dads cup of water, they were all over my dessert table. Our waiter Jose was clapping the fruit flies ALL NIGHT. At the end of the night when we had to pay our bill Gary sat with us and when we told him about the fruit flies he said ""I guess my exterminating guy needs to do a better job"" is that really how you conduct a business by saying something like that? The entire hall was booked. Every room had a party going on. We ended up having 35 dinners and not 40 dinners. They only took off 3 of the dinners and charged us for an extra two but yet as I said the entire hall had a party in every single room. It's extremely sad that we will never come here again. My parents got married here and as I said my family has had SO many functions here in the recent months. As a business owner I would never sit there and handle business that way when their were bugs everywhere.",I don't know what to say... chicken francaise? More like unseasoned chicken in chicken flavored water.,"The owner of this place is a real class act. One of his valets(who I doubt even as a license. Looked like he was 12) some how smashed the front end of a car. Don't know how fast they were going in a small parking lot to pull that off. They had her the car and don't even say it was damaged. I guess they wanted her not to notice. And then the owner screams at her like it's her fault. He then wants says it's ""NO BIG DEAL! IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. WELL TAKE CARE OF IT."" If you care about your car, don't valet it at this place. In fact just go somewhere else. I really can't get over how big of an ass that guy was. I already shared this story with everyone I know in Staten Island.  I understand mistakes happen, but you should be upfront with them and not be an ass about it.",My daughters first birthday party was at the Staaten this weekend. They have recently renovated it and it's stunning inside. We had a breakfast brunch. Everything was delicious. Everyone was up for 2nds. Their sangrias and mimosas and blood Mary's were so good too.It was a great party. The owner was very helpful and kind when booking her party. He even came in to check on us. Always making sure we are happy and everything is running smoothly. Our servers and Maître d' were  very helpful through the whole party. They did a great job. I highly recommend them. My guest were happy too. Two of my friends that attend the party plan on booking them for their next event. You won't be disappointed. Hope this helps,"The Staaten is a Staten Island catering institution.The Li Greci family has proudly operated this fine facility for decades. Ask anyone who grew up on Staten Island I will guarantee they have attended a communion, wedding, sweet sixteen or some combination of those at the Staaten.The food and service are always top notch.The decor can use some help as it's dated.","We had a private party in the downstairs room and everything was great including the service, the food, the drinks, setup and decor.  They helped us make planning this party very simple and quick.  They even offered us extra time to extend our party if needed.  We had the Cannoli Cake and it was delicious.",Li Greci's Staaten
192,"Found this nice Mexican restaurant while lost in Newark. The outside of the building was appealing and looked fairly new compared to other restaurants we seen. The inside was decorated nicely as well with a full bar.Food: They give you free chips and salsa before your entree comes. The salsa was very good. We also ordered nachos which came out burnt, but we didn't want to go through the trouble of sending them back. I had the El tradicion which is a traditional quesadilla with chicken. It was pretty good along with the guac.Drink: The blue sangria is to die for. I ordered 2 because they were so good.Service: Our server for the night wasn't very pleasant. He came to the table and seemed to be rushing us to order and we couldn't even get questions in because he was moving so fast. He would go missing and we would have to ask someone for him and when he came to the table he was like a thief in the night.",First time at this location and the quality of the food was outstanding.  I am so glad for the new space. Plenty of bar space. By 7:00 p.m. there was a wait for a table in a Saturday night.  Our server was a bit pushy with the drink specials but otherwise service was promt and attentive.  Will be back again and again.,Horrible customer service. The waiter had such a bad attitude as though he was serving us some free food.The food too was way too mediocre. It took 45 mins for the food to come and that too cold!! The food had odor of bad and used up oil.,"Wonderful Mexican place and a small town gem. Step through their large wooden doors into a beautifully festive and bustling dinner spot! Fun and casual atmosphere with an authentic Mexican menu. Everything's good from the tacos to the sandwiches to the appetizers, with prices they won't break the bank.The bar situation is also pretty nice. They have a nice variety of tequilas and draft and bottled beer options. Word is they'll be opening their back patio soon.. can't wait to check it  out! Check out the newest hotspot in town!!","This place is a mixed bag. Short review:-Drinks are good and large.-Food ranges from not edible to really good.-Service is nice.-Ambiance is great, but empty.Longer review:Upon entering, we got seated and got served chips and salsa. The salsa was flavorful. Only ""drink"" we ordered was a pina colada, and it was big and tasty. So far so good. Things took a nose dive with the honey glazed calamari for appetizer. It was so salty that it literally wasn't edible. We opted not to get it replaced as our entrees were almost ready. However, they did let us sample a new  batch which was OK. The explanation was that the wrong sauce was used accidentally. Could be an honest mistake, but to me the replacement tasted similar but diluted. We got a complimentary tres leches, and it was a good old average tres leches. My finacee got the chicken enchiladas with mole, which was pretty damn good. Well cooked, flavor tasted authentic Mexican. It's a 4 star entree. I on the other hand got three tacos. The first taco, Al Pastor, was great. The other two, slow cooked pork and grilled steak, were very poor. They were dry, and I needed to drench it with a hot sauce. What struck me was that these tacos were loaded with cilantro and onion, but I couldn't taste the cilantro. On the plus side, the veggies that came with the meal were good (grilled cactucs).","It's the old ""big Apple bar"" redone with nice modern Mexican decor. The same owners as the other location on the north side of BAYONNE. It's the same great chips and sauce; overall the same food. They did down size the menu compared to the original location and added a few more. The place is loaded up with TVs for sports, also added buffalo wings (which the other location doesn't have). Overall great, you can't go wrong for the right price CC: my review for the other location. Same restaurant name, different address (both on broadway)",El Aguila Dorada
193,"The food is terrible, typical Italian fare.  Meh.And, if they get your phone number for any reason, they will spam you until the end of time.  Text spam, email spam, they are the WORST.  Do not do business with Panini Grill on Forest Ave. Staten Island.","I've been getting spam texts from this place for so long. I've never even eaten here. Even though I try to cancel, the texts don't stop. What kind of garbage place has to spam customers to get business?","I go here frequently and love their salads, however, my last visit for lunch with a coworker was just not a good experience. I ordered my salad with dressing on the side, and when it came out it not only had the dressing on it but it had ONE piece of lonely chicken in it. I did not order chicken, my friend did not order chicken, so where did one piece of meat come from? I do not eat meat, so it was even more annoying to me. I just hope I wasn't eating leftovers from someone else's salad.","I've been coming to Panini Grill for a few years now and still can never decide what to order every time I go! The menu is filled with variety and always has new additions. The specials get better and better every time. The meal always starts with delicious garlic bread on the table - this time they even had a dollop of ricotta on the plate which was the perfect addition to the panini grill staple. Along with the bread, my family ordered a hot antipasto to share. The appetizer came with eggplant rollatini, fried calamari, fried shrimp, baked clams, and stuffed mushroom. My favorites were definitely the eggplant, fried calamari, and shrimp. The appetizer was quite large and there was enough for about 4-6 people to share as an appetizer.As always, for the main course, I could not deicide what to order. This time I was adventurous and decided on the salmon special which was pan-seared and served over a bed of pesto risotto. The waitress Linda, who was wonderful, highly recommended the dish and it did not let me down. The salmon and risotto melted in my mouth and were cooked to perfection. I ended the filling meal with a decaf cappuccino and thoughts about what I was going to order during my next visit to the local panini joint ;)","I have to admit my expectations were not high originally when my friends suggested this place. The moment I sat down to have the garlic bread, I finished it all without giving anyone else to opportunity to try it. This bread was addictively delicious. Then we ordered appetizers: calamari and the artichoke. As an main dish, I was in the mood for shrimp scampi. It was a very good experience. The staff was really good and attentive. I want to come back.",I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Everything we had tasted fresh and great. My only criticism would be that they should more crab in there stuffing.  Penne ala vodka was tasty as well.,Panini Grill
194,"This is the worst place to host a party I have ever been too. I attended a baby shower yesterday for about 100 people. It started first with no valet parking had to park across the street. No handicap spaces either. The affair was a Buffett They ran out of food after calling the second table up. The carver had nothing to carve, only had one dish to serve. The host ordered veal cutlet parmigiana steak and salad and guess what it took them over 30 minutes to get more food. They had one waiter one server and I think a bartender who was never at the bar, I write reviews all the time and this place should be closed The hosts were so inbarrassed to say the least The only good thing was the 100 people will never book a party there. Management should be firedFrank V","We stayed in their BnB across from the restaurant for 6 days & are lucky to have survived. We nearly froze in the room the first night, someone left the storm windows up & the draft was horrendous. Night 2 was better we only stayed up all night with a roof leak. The electric outlets worked half the time and we had everything plugged in one bathroom outlet. On day 1 my wife bought new towels cause the ones provided were very frayed & yellowed. There's an odor of mold throughout the 200 year old house and if any room was available on the island we would have left in a heartbeat. Be forewarned about this, don't say I didn't tell you.","Sunday brunch - very bad service , waitress did not work at all.Food - no additional food items served at buffet  since there were not too many people","Beautiful. Spectacular. Marvelous. I performed here for the first time at Jonathon's Graduation party last night. Gorgeous venue! The staff was polite and friendly, and the building itself is truly remarkable.

It's a big place, very nice, and suitable for weddings and other big events. The food was ok, but just ok. The service was good and the flow / ambiance was very good.

Having said that the wedding was fun.","Do you remember when The Historic Old Bermuda Inn was just The Bermuda Inn?Neither do I. It's always been old. This place smells like a cheap hotel lobby with an indoor swimming pool. I don't understand why people are still having parties at this place. Is it because it only costs $32 / person instead of an average $75 at a decent place?Why don't you just have your guests meet at a McDonald's for Big Macs instead of a this wretched buffet?The food at their buffet and carving stations  taste like 3-day old mush that they try to pass as shrimp, filet, or turkey. The mac and cheese tastes like one of their ""chefs"" chewed it and spit it out. And I have it on good authority that their desserts are store bought. In fact, they're popcorn machine doesn't work.

I ordered their poke bowl and I asked for the eel, she told me it was a dollar more I said no problem. I get home and open my food and find 2 slices of eel the size of my pinky!!! I call them up I told her about it and her response was eel is too expensive and basically didn't care she charged me almost 11$ for zucchini noodles, mango,some nasty crab meat and TWO slices of eel!!! On top of that it took them 20 min to get the order together. SAVE YOUR MONEY and go to Hawaii poke bowl down Richmond ave.","Portions were small and the price was high. I realized it after I ordered: small portion of fried rice, chicken broccoli (salty) and lomei (salty), and fried vegetable dumpling. $50.00   My jaw dropped! Never again. Btw the dumpling went in the garbage the dumpling dough we RAW and the content was spicy. If I could give zero star I would!","CHECK !CHECK ! CHECK the prices on your order. Several times I noticed the bill seemed high. As it turns out they charge you different prices than what is on the menu, hoping you won't question it. To add insult to injury the woman at the front desk needs to be FIRED. She is rude. The waitress was not much better. We used to come to this place before the fire, the waitress we had was usually nice and the food decent. After the fire the few good points about this place are GONE!!!!!!!!!!!! They padded the bill and when confronted when I asked them to get a menu and showed them what they did they were not apologetic but had an absolute attitude. It is no wonder on a lunch time on a weekend we were the only ones in this place . There are so many better places to eat without the thievery and bad attitude.

Sushi rolls are light on the rice which is great.So fas Ive tried: Spicy tuna, spicy salmon rolls: GreatShrimp tempura: also greatShrimp shumai: yumPork dumplings: had a strange smell to it. Not so great. Salmon teriyaki: light on the fish, but their pineapple fried rice is delicious! Lo mein: extremely oily. Just noodles marinated and fried in oil.

Love that sushi on Staten Island is a lot more affordable in general than those in Manhattan..","Like i said in my initial review, this place is garbage. Save your money, look at the owners response. Your manners are just as gross as your food. Your dish tasted like it was left in our sewage system, that might explain why your in the business of sewage treatment. You sound like your feelings are hurt from an honest review. Also, judging by your reviews it looks like you and your business need to leave Staten Island. Your unsatisfying, tasteless, diarrhea inducing food is polluting our sewage and waste lands on the island. Also, I'll gladly spend the money on food...as long as it's worth it. I wouldn't serve your food to a starving person, even if their life depended on it. Good day sir!","I got to try ramen for the first time and I must say, I'm very satisfied with the results.

196,"I was extremely disappointed by my experience here (food and service) such that I will never go again. Prior to going this past Sunday, my husband called to make reservations stating that it was our wedding anniversary and that we would like a nice table. The person who answered the phone, an older man, was rude and brushed him off. When we arrived, we noticed a nice six-seat table near the patio and asked if we could sit there. The restaurant was barely crowded but the maitre d (likely the same person who answered the phone) said we could not be seated there in case a party of 6 came. This would have been a reasonable response if it were a Friday or Saturday night, but at 3 PM on a Sunday afternoon? Not to mention, there were many empty tables... Our waiter was very unenthusiastic in his greeting. He stated the specials. We ordered baked clams as an appetizer. My mother ordered the halibut oreganata (on special), my aunt and husband ordered the prawns with saffron risotto (on special) and I ordered the linguine nero with seafood. Our clams arrived and for $15 they were shameful- overcooked to the point of being rubbery. A very rookie mistake. We did not say anything because the service was so disinterested, we did not think it would make a difference. We awaited our entrees with bated breath, but were extremely disappointed for the following reasons:1) My mother's halibut was so, so dry- it was beyond well done. There was insufficient sauce and lemon to redeem the fish. 2) The prawns were inconsistently cooked- some parts were dry and others were under-cooked.3) At NO point did any member of the staff come over to see how we were faring with our dishes. 4) My pasta dish was the best-tasting, but it was one note.The best part of the meal was dessert, namely the tartufo. For the same amount of money, I regret not going to Bocelli's.","Went out to dinner with some friends. Upon arrival Fiore seemed like a nice fine dining establishment. From the look of things I was expecting an enjoyable, yet pricey meal. The place seemed to be busy. To my surprise things seemed to take a turn for the worse.After we were seated we asked our server 3 times for a cocktail menu to start. He seemed to ignore us. As we sat and read the menu we ""enjoyed"" a basket of cold bread. To start we ordered appetizers. They seemed to be satisfying. We ordered the baked clams, oysters, calamari and octopus. Throughout the course of our dinner, I started to get irritated with the way the waiters were serving us. The server kept putting his arms over my shoulders and in my face in order to provide me with water and collect my plates. When he served me another clean plate he plopped it in front of me. It was very uncomfortable having someone on top of you with no etiquette.As we sat there waiting for our dinner, the table was a mess. I remember waiting a while for our food and saying to myself, it would be nice if someone came and cleaned up. Minutes later the server comes over, reaches over my shoulder and using his tool scrapes all the crumbs and junk in my lap and on my white shirt. I looked at him in complete SHOCK. Never have I ever dealt with a staff that was so careless and stupid.For dinner I ordered the veal martini. Needless to say when it came out it was paper thin, cold and overly drenched in lemon juice.Overall the service ruined my time, the food wasn't terrible. Advice to management, teach your employees etiquette. No one wants to spend that type of money and have to deal with that.","We went there for dinner a few back we were 6 people. I will the food was very good l, however the prices for food and drinks was that if Manhattan.  And they did buy us a drink or at least offer as a after dinner cordial or dessert. Nothing. The bill with tip was 634.00. And we had 12 drinks.","Make reservations! We were lucky to reserve a table for two for 7pm by calling on a Saturday at 6pm. When we arrived, we chose a table inside and were seated right away. The place filled up pretty quickly, and by 8pm there were no available tables, remaining that way late into the night. Most of the tables seat 4-6 people, so if you have a large party, you definitely need to plan ahead and reserve two tables that possibly might be joined together.Outdoor seating is available, but it gets windy by the water, so we decided to stay warm inside. However, the AC/fans inside were working at a demon speed, so I had to put on my coat, tights, and scarf to keep warm. Bring something warm with you, just in case. The ambiance is casual, old style American-Italian. A fireplace in the center of the room, dimmed lighting, white linens and live rose centerpieces on every table. Great for a casual friend/family outing or a relaxed date. The demographics of diners is predominantly white American and 40+. My bf and I were the only non-American couple in our 20's. Our waiter seemed slightly uncomfortable serving us. He was way into his 60's, and seemed so friendly and warm with guests who were in his age group. To us, he was impatient and finicky. My bf couldn't understand his accent, so that visibly annoyed him. We were presented only with an expensive wine menu--no other alcoholic drinks were listed. When my bf asked for alcoholic selection beyond wine, our waiter didn't react. Did he expect us to go to the bar and get the drinks ourselves? My bf asked for any cocktails--the waiter remained unresponsive. Then my bf asked for beer. He was informed that draft beer was available. My bf ordered Stella, but some other draft beer was brought. My bf knows beer, so he tasted right away that the beer wasn't Stella. We called our waiter and told him of the difference and only then he said that they were out of Stella. So it was okay to serve us a random beer when we ordered Stella and not even inform us? Did he think that it didn't matter and that we wouldn't know the difference anyway? At least he didn't give us any issues over replacing the beer with Artois, which indeed was the correct beer. After that beer snafu and throughout our meal, our food was delivered by busboys, who were actually friendly. Our waiter didn't check in on us until we asked for the check. My bf was not happy with the service.Now to the food. Yelpers were divided between those who really liked the food and those who thought it was mediocre. I was a bit anxious, but also very hopeful because I wanted our anniversary diner to be a positive experience.The complementary bread was delicious! Freshly baked, still warm, served with sweet pepper and tomato paste. I devoured it all, I was so hungry and that was a perfect start of my meal. As always, I stuffed myself too full of delicious bread even before appetizers arrived, so strongly recommend to pace yourself, because you might be tempted to go heavy on the bread, but then you'll be too full to enjoy anything beyond appetizers.Burrata ($15) served with sun dried tomatoes was too chilled for my liking. It was served straight out of the fridge/freezer, so all I could taste was the cold dairy. Maybe I was still too cold and was craving something warm to warm me up, but I did not enjoy this as much as I usually enjoy burrata.Skip the Crab cake ($15). The portion was generous, and was even served with a side of greens, but the patty contained too little crab chunks and too much bread and stuffing. Forgettable and not worth the money or your stomach real estate. My bf got the Chicken Valdostana ($23): stuffed breast of chicken with prosciutto, mozzarella, porcini mushroom sauce, truffle oil, served with mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables. Have to say the chicken breast was on point--tender, flavorful, and well-seasoned. Loved the stuffing--really great combination that I'd love to try at home. Two chicken breasts were served, the portion is definitely huge and enough to fill anyone up. The truffle and porcini mushroom sauce were to die for--serious standouts that I can still remember. A very unusual rendition of a simple classic done right. Definitely recommend!I don't eat pasta except for squid ink linguine with seafood. Linguine Nero ($28) with white wine and plum tomato sauce did not disappoint. A humongous portion, with a good proportion of seafood to pasta. No fishy taste to it at all, like some Yelpers described. Took leftovers home, and they were surprisingly delicious three days later--now that's quality ingredients!We were too stuffed for dessert. The bill came to $100 without the tip.Their weekday Mon-Fri dinner price fix three course dinner for $25 looks like a great deal, so I'm hoping to return to try it out.","(Pros) Fiore Di Mare is a lovely little restaurant right by the Marina. I noticed they have a pre fixe menu mon-fri 3pm-7pm for $25, that's one of the reasons I wanted to check it out and sample some dishes. Had 6pm reservations for party of three. Was seated right away outside, very nice. (Cons) We were handed the regular menu not the pre fixe (I had to ask).  If you are going to advertise this on your website then you should automatically give ALL the menus whether new customers OR regular. I shouldn't have to ask. They also didn't have a drink menu. I understand you have a full bar and can make anything BUT sometimes I'm undecided on what to order and would like to look at a drink menu. First time dining at a restaurant where they don't give you the full dining and drink menus. We started off with two appetizers off the regular menu: Stuffed zucchini flower and calamari (nice and crispy). Not bad. Portion was a good size.  For dinner we tried the pre fixe. First course all had the baked clams(very good) Second course: me & mom had the gnocchi (it was just okay). Hubby had the veal which he enjoyed. We also had drinks. Mom and I had a glass of wine each and hubby had 2 beers. Overall the service was friendly and the food was not bad. I may give it another try and order off the regular menu but was a little turned off. If you don't want customers to order the pre fixe then don't offer it. It's not because they forgot I seen them hand other customers just the regular menu.","We came to Fiore Di Mare on Mother's Day for an early dinner. Valet was on their game from the second we pulled up which was much appreciate since it was pouring out. Once we all arrived, we were seated immediately and given the special Mother's Day menu.For apps, we ordered:-fried calamari-seafood salad with calamari, mussels, and octopus-baked clams (SO good!)-portobello mushrooms with fresh mozzarella-a couple of different saladsThey also gave us tons of hot bread with a sun dried tomato pesto that we devoured. So good.The apps were enough to feed a small army so we barely had room for our mains, but we already ordered so tried to stuff ourselves as much as we could.For my main, I ordered the Linguine Nero with seafood which was a huge portion but delicious. I had to take this home because I couldn't put a dent in it. My mom got the Bistecca alla Griglia which was perfectly cooked and medium. I got to steal a few bites and I'm happy I did.We each ordered a different dessert even though no one could really move at this point lol. I went with the Lava Cake which, disappointingly, was just chocolate cake with chocolate sauce on top... no actual ""lava"" in the middle. Not the worst thing in the world, but definitely not a lava cake by definition.Overall, we had a lovely experience here and I'd definitely come back for another dinner party.",Fiore Di Mare
197,"Came in for breakfast and was told about 10-15 min wait. We waited about 20 min to sit and ordered about 10 min after that. After 30 minutes passed and we still didn't have our french toast, I asked the waiter what was taking so long. He said he just checked on it and should be a few more minutes. A few minutes goes by and  I told him to cancel it. There's no reason to wait 45 min for French toast and his reply was "" Your ticket is only 30 minutes old""  First and last time I will be there. Parking is horrendous, servers are slow- not even dressed in uniform or even close- regular street clothes.",Usually Marie's is decent but after they sent this I've had enough. The Philly roll which should be renamed to the Philly spring roll. #RippedOff,The wings and the garlic breadsticks are next level. Totally worth stopping in! Don't pass this place up.,"I was pleasantly surprised by brunch at this place! Servers are friendly and remember their regulars. They're able to accommodate gluten and dairy allergy modifications or seemingly any changes as long as they have the alternative ingredients on their menu. I ordered a coffee and the banana walnut waffle (gf/df) which came with two little jars of maple syrup. The waffle is sweet enough without syrup, and the texture was crunchy on the outside and gooey inside as they cook the banana and walnut into the batter. This comes with a few pieces of fruit on the side. If you're ravenous, order some eggs, hash or bacon on the side to make it a complete meal or bring someone along. My tía ordered the eggs and hash, and that hash serving is definitely shareable. My tío made up his own breakfast wrap (bacon, egg and cheese, which you would think would already be there) which he enjoyed.Side note: I said ""pleasantly surprised"" at the beginning because my family has had meals catered from this place before. These were mainly pasta dishes and a chicken marsala, none of which got raving reviews from the fam. No one took leftovers home. The chicken was something out of a NYC public school lunch- weirdly spongey and flavorless. The pasta was over cooked. At the time (December '17) they couldn't (or wouldn't) make a gluten free/vegan catered pasta dish which screwed over some of us with ""alternative"" diets. I'd personally stick to breakfast at this place (because in the end it's hard to fuck up eggs).","My last two visits here have been nothing but fabulous. I always order the same thing because I know it's a smash. The aroma of pizza in the air is tempting. But, I can't have pizza at the moment. I would love to try it though.  The salad I get is called Frutta Di Mare. It's a combination of spring greens, diced peppers & celery,  lobster, calamari with a vinagrete dressing. Garnished with a lemon cartwheel and additional lemon to squeeze on top. Disclaimer: this salad is served cold. The portion is huge for $19. You can get all this for the price of a Lobster roll. I just finished off my salad and it's still as great as the first time. My waitress was friendly and happy to be at work. If I had to say something about the fish, next time I'll go easy on the lemon. I might have went overboard.

198,Place was good years ago. I walked in today and it was just me and I didnt feel very welcome the guy kaking my burrito seemed irritated and he put some weird proportions of what I wanted and 5 pieces of lettuce and a whole cup of impossible meat. I dont know I usually dont mind but I didnt even enjoy my food. Place was clean though. The lady at the register was very nice who took my order. That last time I came here with my brother there was a piece of hair  and they did give me a free meal card which I gave to my brother to use at a different Qdoba and I couldnt eat there anymore but I decided to come here again to give it another try today. My burrito was not wrapped properly and I told him to give me a bowl he just put it in the bowl so I asked him if I could have it in foil because obviously its a burrito and everything will come out. But I really didnt like his rudeness. I gave it another try but didnt like it here once again so I will avoid this place in the future.,"I was there on a Sunday around 6pm. Once you walk in everything is fairly clean, the service was terrible.  The staff seems to not really care and just dumbed whatever they wanted into a bowl. I order a steak bowl and there was only 8 pieces of meat, they gave me a ton of different sauces and a ton of vegs. I threw up twice in two hours, I wouldn't say it's due to food poisoning but I think the food wasn't fresh. I only say it's not fresh because the rice and meat wasn't hot, the food isn't covered with any lids or plastic and the staff wasn't wearing any gloves. There is a Chipotle around this area, I would never come here again.","Trash go spend your money somewhere else this place used to be amazing now eight he new management it's horrible, management is a joke should go back to the old everyone is disrespectful and racist and scammers they try to over charge you I will be reporting this to the department of health of his unsanitary this place is I seen rat stool in the bathroom which is disgusting save your money elsewear!!!!!! I heard one of the managers called the cops on a 10 year old... loser... rice is always bland gross chicken is dry cheese is hard guacamole is brown chips are baked cookies are chips ahoy terrible soda is syrup they should have cans but whatever this place is gonna go out of business in a few months that's not myProblem hahahahahahahahHhahahahahahahahagahahhahhahhahhhah­ahahahahhhhhhhahhHhHhhahahahahahahh","Stopped in for lunch today for first time. Enjoyed the gladiator taco, son enjoyed burrito & chips and salsa. Lunch for us both was $20! I'll be back!","This place is awesome, I love the food here they make it very well. I must say the cook does a great job. They are hard working people especially the head chef. I like that their food is freshly made from scratch and you can tell too. I would definitely come here again and recommend my friends and family. The price is reasonable and it really fills me up. Comparing it to chipotle, Qdoba is way better!!",My review is based on a solid 4 stars. The extra star could of been earned if the meat would of been fresh maybe more hot. But since I ordered so many items they all were good and made properly. Chicken quesadilla huge enough to split came with guacamole (which was mehh nothing to rave on about) I ordered a chicken bowl with the lime rice very good. Oh and the chips and queso you can't go here and not have the chips and dip. 2 steak tacos and a chicken burrito I had enough food to confirm this review is accurate,QDOBA Mexican Eats
199,"I have no idea if the owner ever taste their own food. It is worst than poor. We ordered delivery for 3 items and all of them taste bad and cost us more than $40. How could you open a restaurant with this low quality of food taste, I rather make myself a instant noodle than this if I know the food is taste bad. We not trying to waste food and we do appreciate food. But this is not acceptable for $40+ of food and you will expect something taste better. It destroyed our appetite completely. If you ever open a restaurant, please give some respect for the food and make them tasty before serving your customer. Making bad tasty food is waste of food and not respecting your customer.",Love the food unfortunately can't be a loyal customer because although  I live less than five minutes away they wont deliver based on my zip code ....,Called and placed an order as soon as they opened. Delivery was suppose to be 45 minutes food showed up and hour and 20 minutes after I placed the order. Driver yelled at me when he arrived and wouldn't give me the food bc he wanted a better tip.,"Here's another empire east location that never fails me! Born in Manhattan Chinatown, Breed in Brooklyn Chinatown, I'm always looking for Chinese food (like authentic Chinese food). I seem to have a fifth sense when I want to locate one. So then, I decided to give this place a try. In reality my coworkers recommended this place, they call it ""sister"". Walked in, oh boy looks like an American Chinese. I wonder if this place would fail me, was my 1st instinct. Then I looked over the menu, and saw it's more like fusion asian: cantonese, schichuan, Thai, Vietnamese. So I decided to go for the spicy shredded beef noodle soup. I wanted to see how authentic they were so I decided to go for hor fun noodles. To my surprise, they had it. My first sip into the noodles I was surprised and covered in joy. Perhaps it's the overloaded msg, hot oil, delicious broth, or it may be my craving for authentic Chinese on the island. Either way, it was good. Since then I've been going to Empire East (there are a few on the island) for Cantonese food. I've tried their eggplant chicken over rice, wonton noodle soup, Thai chicken wrap, Dan Dan noodles, etc. they never disappoint and it satisfies my craving when I'm on the island.",I come here all the time so I'm not a one time wonder who is eating your food for the first time.I don't mind eating your food as long as everything comes out on time and it's hot that is a requirement of mineUnfortunately somebody needs to tell the coordinator who takes the orders that panfried dumplings take 20 minutes so if you have an order of chicken and broccoli please wait to make it because that takes five minutes or so and then the chicken and broccoli gets cold while I have hot pan fried dumplings so the coordination of a whole meal being served hot needs to be worked onOther than that I do enjoy going there but hopefully this was just a one time fluke.,Pros:Shrimp dumplings - the best!All dumplings and wontons - good for a dumpling fix. Spring rolls - yummyEgg rolls - yummyChicken Pad Thai - very yummy.  Pineapple chicken - deliciousNoodle soups - yummy and filling. It can be a two meals. Sweet and sour soup - just right. Cons:Overpriced!  But it's so damn good! It's a treat when we order food from this place. Regular wonton soup - not a fan.,Empire East NY
200,Food was good but the waiter was so rude to us. He should be grateful that I was so patient with him even though he made so many rude comments to us...I regret giving him the  (18%) tip...I still left him the tip bec. I know that waiters don't get paid well...,This was our first trip to the Longhorn steakhouse in Bayonne. We should've left before even being seated. The hostess would not give us a decent table and we waited at least 10 minutes before anyone showed up at all.It only got worse after that. The waiter was extremely slow and did not bring us our salad until the meal arrived.The steak was over seasoned and had too much salt.Even the bill was wrong.I should have read the yelp reviews before going there.,"Upon entering this uninviting dark den of a wanna be steakhouse the mood is rather depressing.  The staff walks around without a smile and the general atmosphere is that the diners seem unhappy and the staff seems like they all would rather be somewhere else.Friday night we arrived with a table of 8 and the waiter handled our table like we all had the ebola virus.  No happy greeting or recommending items from the unamusing menu ....my brother just wanted us to leave but we stayed.  The waiter was unfriendly and seemed very pensive throughout his service which made us all question ""what the hell is he even doing here"".  There was no bread brought to our table or water.   Most of us ordered coke with lemons....they arrived without the lemon.We gave our orders and my brother suggested that the  waiter come back later because he was undecided; as a result my brother sat there throughout our meal unattended and ignored by this horrible waiter. My brother was so turned off by the waiters ignorance he decided not to eat at all.The waiter became very friendly upon the bill arriving (hence.....tip time).This staff needs to undergo quality training and turn those damn lights up a little brighter......the funeral home like atmosphere is not a recipe for a fun family night out.  This place is a DOWNER without DEBBIE!!!!!The food is sun-standard and just not that interesting.   In other words do not go here.","I've visited this place a few times and this rating is based on my hubby's love for the way they cook their steaks.It's a chain restaurant so of course, I don't expect too much. Came in and the hostess was M.I.A. for a good 5-10mins. But, when she came back, she was pretty nonchalant by the way she greeted and led us to our table. Our server was friendlier and we can tell that she was working her hardest to attend to all her tables, including ours. Seemed like they were short-staffed.Ordered the white cheddar stuffed mushrooms,  parmesan crusted chicken, outlaw ribeye, and kids' mac & cheese. I had the mushrooms and the chicken and it was delish and filling. Hubby was beyond satisfied how they cooked his ribeye as medium rare. He raves about his cooked steaks here everytime he stops by. Overall, it was a good and stuffy meal. Wish they were more proactive about keeping our table neat and picked up our empty dishes. Also, the hostess, please do re-train.","Went here a couple of weeks ago. My family and I have been frequenting this location for many years. We've never had any issues, this is why we travel here from Brooklyn N.YOur last visit left us with a change of heart. All of our steaks were BURNT. We ordered medium WELL. We sent them ALL back. A female manager came and apologize and offered us FREE desert. We like ok, well it happened, THANK YOU! When it was time for desert she came to ask us which dessert we wanted. ""Come to find out"" we were expected to share ONE dessert amongst to four of us, despite the fact that ALL FOUR STEAKS were BURNT beyond  recognition .Not coming back! !","So came in for my husbands bday with family (9 people total). Now granted, it was also Mother's Day so I will let a lot slide for that. To start, we called 10mins prior to arriving to ask if there was a wait. Ricky answered and said No, we could be seated right away. We travelled in two cars so this started off rough. One car arrived, the other didn't arrive for 25 mins. Within this time, people began to arrive after being told, once the party gets here, they already have a table set for us. Ok. No name taken, no time needed and no buzzer given. They had us go to the barAs more people arrive, we get nervous and my husband asks if our table is still ready bc our party is 5mins away. At this point we are told it will be a 40-50 minute wait!!!! What?!? Then we are given a buzzer to keep while at the bar. 1 hr later, we are seated (mind u, buzzer battery apparently died and didn't work so they had to call by name)At this point we already looked at the menu and everyone knew what they were going to order, so we did so right away. The waiter might have been a little overwhelmed bc he forgot to ask How my father in law would even like his steak cooked. I ordered mine Medium, assuming they knew how to cook a steak... I mean, it is a steakhouse. Grandpa ordered his steak well done and my aunt ordered hers medium as well. Needless to say, mine came out a lot more bloody in some spots, over cooked on the outside (burnt), and grandpa got a full on rare, which they apologized, took back and recooked (which still was bright pink after he cut the center again) and my aunt who wanted medium like me, got a full on well done steak. (See photos)Also The first wine glass I got had lipstick on it and I asked for a new one but sadly, judging from what I've seen so far, I wouldn't be surprised if they just poured the wine into another glass. Wine: Cabernet, for a steak house, sucked. No real big options thereDrinks: were pretty good... bartender was Great! And probably the best part of the place. (Only reason they got an extra star)Service: Ok. Guy literally took my aunts steak away while she was in the bathroom without her permission.  They also couldn't remember who got what at all Cleanliness: needs a little work. Dirty forks, glasses and bathroom had toilet paper all over the floor. In comparison to other steakhouses we have been to, this is literally the Applebee's of steakhouses that looks like they microwave their bread. Within 10minutes of the bread coming out, it went from hot to straight hard. Steak: no real flavor, also looks like my husbands prime rib didn't sit long enough at all bc it bled out all its juices in the first cut into the plate and wasn't even tender. In fact, None of the steaks, including my father in laws sirloin, was actually tender now juicy. Broccoli was ok... slight bit over cookedOverall, not a good experience at all",LongHorn Steakhouse
201,"My family and friends went to the Roadhouse after my son's 8th grade graduation at Wagner College.  Atmosphere is great, food was very good but our server seemed a little overwhelmed.  Of the 10 seated, 2 had to send their plates back because it wasn't what they ordered, and one of the two sent it back a third time when they got it wrong again.   All in all though, I'd go back again - their hot pepper, shitake mushroom and sausage pizza is outrageous!",This place should be embarrassed to charge 15.99 for a frozen burger with a slice of cheese and lettuce. The burgers you get at public schools are better. Absolutely no flavor ...  they served it on a martins potato roll and the roll was bigger than the burger!!!! Fries??? Sure for an additional 4.00I don't mind paying good money for good food but this place is horrific! The waitress was pleasant ... I would say more but I have to get some tums for the heartburn,"Ten dollars for two meatballs. This place is expensive vs the quality of their food. With so many other options on the Island, we won't be back to this restaurant anytime soon.","Been coming here for well over 40 years. Actually liked the ""old"" roadhouse better. Like the old world charm and atmosphere. That being said, the service is fine, no complaints there. Food is ok. Nothing really special. Can get Italian food in many places. But $26 for a plate of spaghetti and meatballs? This is Staten Island for Gods sake! Are you kidding me????  I'll seriously reconsider the next time I think about eating here! Totally overpriced!","The food is good here, but in Staten Island there is many more options. The pizza was great, some of the portions were very small and not worth the price at all. The garlic shrimp was very tasty, but 6 pieces for $22 was rather expensive for a fancy pizzeria in Staten Island. Food is made to order, so be prepared to sit for a while, which is fine. We got to listen to the owner screaming at someone in the kitchen while we waited. Sodas are not free refills. Which in a pizzeria, fancy or not, is really kind of ridiculous. So in the end, good food, but I don't see myself returning.","First time here. Heard a bunch of great reviews of this place so I figured I'd check it out. Everything here was great: staff, ambience, food, drinks. Only issue was parking. Maybe because it just snowed a couple days before & a lot of the spots were snowed in. We parked across the street. ""Veronica"" our server, was very friendly and attentive. She even suggested some additional items off the menu that were excellent. I had called ahead to make reservations and ""Yelena"" was super helpful over the phone. Both women were very friendly. Apparently, the clam by is the thing to have here. That and the red sauce are what this place is best known for from the regulars I know. We'll be back.",The RoadHouse
202,"2 stars for how the food tasted . The service was terrible!! I ordered a chicken sandwich and got a wrap instead. The wings came after 1 hour and fifteen minutes. The waitress forgot she retook the order. That was the first thing we asked for.!!!! Lesson learnt, next time ask them to repeat the order when you place it and keep reminding them that it hasn't come !! Also a lesson- come here as less as you can!!",This has been the WORST Buffalo Wild Wings I have ever been too! Wrong order and then they gave us cold wings! The food didn't taste good and the service suck no forks or napkins had to get up to find my own! Don't waste your money coming to this place!,Seated and then we found a majority of the servers at the bar drinking. Service was good but the kitchen served us a few wings that our fork wouldn't even go through.,There are a lot of young people working here. Like young young.. like I watched the workers chase each other in a circle around the restaurant floor. Not sure if the managers weren't around that night or what. Place seemed clean from what I saw. Didn't get a chase to walk around that much. The wings were decent and the bartender was nice. They ran out of ingredients to make the drink I wanted so she made me something else that was delicious so I wasn't upset. I would probably only come back in a wing craving emergency. That's it...,"Came here during happy hour and 50¢ wings. Service was okay, food was good. We ordered traditional wings and fried pickles and each of us were given literally 2 sticks of carrots and one celery. Because if the stinginess with the carrots, I deducted a star.","This has to be the worst Buffalo Wild Wings I have experience , order the simple wings combo , with a yuengling, I got my drink , an hour later , bartender came back and ask me about my order because they've lost the ticket , stuffs happen in restaurant but did it take her an hour to ask me , then she brought the foods 5 minutes after she ask me .  This place is a sad place , last time I'll come here .. buffalo wild wings in Monmouth mall is amazing atleast to me . She brought me the wrong order , didn't dare to ask to change it , no silverware . Only compliment , wings did taste like any other BUFFALO WILD WIngs.  Mediocre at best.",Buffalo Wild Wings
203,"Marie's was one of my reliable go-to spots. I truly hope this recent experience was a one off. I ordered my usual Amici pizza with extra onions. First, I waited an hour, then when I hadn't recieved my order I called back. I was advised that they had ""gotten too busy"" and ""forgotten"" because of a show at the St George theater, so the food was about to arrive. I am literally 6 or 7 blocks away. Most customers LOVE hearing how unimportant their order is when they're spending their hard earned money, right?A couple of minutes later the delivery guy arrives with a cold pizza in hand. Took a bite and it was like eating a salt lick. Now I've had this pizza before, I don't ever recall it being this salty. Prosciutto is usually salty but they added grated cheese, it was disgusting. Between it being cold and too salty I doubt I will order from them again. It had obviously been sitting on the counter for a long time. Their casual disregard for my business was readily apparent in every over salted, cold bite.","This is without a doubt the worst burger I've had in a long time. Comparable to school cafeteria food over something you'd pay 11 dollars for, I could only stand to take 2 bites before I retreated to the waffle fries that were undercooked. Also the gaint slab of greasy meat was slapped between a tiny English muffin. I don't know what that's about...The space was also densely crowded and uncomfortable.This was such a lousy experience thatTruthfully, the only saving grace was the service.",Had a sicilian which was tasty and a iced cafe. There are very few nice places in this area to eat and this is one of them .It is a must pass by and have a bite,"Awesome food! The margherita pizza is so fresh and incredible. The sauce is absolutely delicious. I also tried a grilled chicken & mozzarella sandwich on focaccia bread, which was fantastic, especially with the balsamic glaze. Friendly service and cute atmosphere!","It was tough to find a place to sit and eat off the Staten Island ferry however after visiting a few disappointing options, Marie's finally hit the mark. I admit, the metal wine glasses took me by surprise. However my sausage sandwich transported me back to manhattans little Italy as did my friends pizza roll. Excellent Italian food and service and musica. Prices were a little high.","I live in the neighborhood and love going to another nearby restaurant. I decided to go out for dinner after work and headed over, lo and behold my favorite spot was CLOSED!!!I was bereft, inconsolable, destroyed. I was contemplating personal harm! And then, there it was, like a ray of light..... Marie's. I was dubious. Having lived in Manhattan and Astoria I'm a self proclaimed food snob. I've been to local SI joints and been mystified how anyone could rave about the swill they served.But I was feeling lazy, how bad could it be?I ordered the cheeseburger. I'm a purist, straight up cheddar cooked medium rare with a side of sweet potato waffle fries. Simple order yet so few places get it right. Marie's delivered! The burger was cooked to perfection. Perfectly medium rare. Such a delight. The meat was juicy, bun the exact size needed. Not too doughy, not too crumbly. The sweet potato waffle fries perfectly crispy outside and soft inside.The service was fantastic! If you ever want a good judge of service, ask to sit in a big booth when no one else is in the joint. The waitress seated me exactly as requested, was friendly and on point without being a helicopter. Kudos to Marie's new location. If there were 10 stars, they would deserve it. I'm so glad there's a new restaurant with delivery in my neighborhood. I look forward to going back often",Marie's 2
204,"We walked in and No one greeted us for at least 5 minutes.  The place only had seating for about 30 guests.  Then a lady (probably the cook) came out and pointed to an open table. We waited several more minutes for someone (ANYONE) to acknowledge us as we sat and watched  a man, around 30-ish, dressed in a black jogging suit and a flat top cap.  He appeared to be a server as he was carrying plates and serving others.  He completely ignored us whereby after several minutes I waved to get his attention and finally came over with a menu the size of the Magna Carta.  It was entirely written in long hand with NO prices anywhere..  He asked what we wanted to drink and we ordered 2 glasses of red wine.  He returned with them promptly but they were ICE COLD so we couldn't drink them.  Finally after several more minutes, I flagged him down again and asked if we could have some bread or something to eat.  He then wanted to know what we wanted to order.  I asked about the price of the Veal dish and he said around $30.  And it was CASH only.  We wanted to leave as we were not prepared to pay cash.  He was very belligerent and made a coarse comment to us.   We  continued to sit with 2 glasses of ICE cold wine and NO food.  We ended up leaving the wine and walking out.",What can you say about this place...def an experience .. def worth the extra few bucks -try the salad stay for pizziola and chicken parm..mint,"The first few times I went to this place I loved it. It is such an experience. It is delightfully tacky in decoration and the owner Angelina is very nice and funny. Their menu and their portions were huge. Their clams in red sauce and fresh garlic bread, to die for. Sadly, the last time we went with a huge group of people and two things happened. The portions were much smaller and not that great tasting. When we got the bill I almost fell over. We had ordered a little bit of alcohol, but it looked like we were ripped off. Angelina's son was the bartender and it wasn't top shelf either. There are no prices on their menus, so every time you can get charged a different price. I know alcohol isn't cheap, but we had to have been charged at least $20 a glass.",This place is great.  Best Italian food around PERIOD.  Family run and the owner couldn't be nicer.  It's rare that you find both awesome food and big portions.  Owner cooks everything herself ensuring perfection and consistency.  We ordered 2 chicken parms but really only needed one.  Great taste and cooked to perfection.  Adding a mid meal pic.  Interior kind of reminds me of a movie set.  Cash only and can't wait to go back for some awesome Italian food.,Awesome!!! The eggplant parmigiana is DE-LI-CIOUS! Home cooked Italian food! Thanks Angelina!!,Best chicken parm in NJ.Decor is hysterical and her son should be a stand up comedian.This is a unique adventure so do not go in there expecting five star service.  It's pricey but totally worth it.,Angelina's
205,The food was lackluster.  The Scialatielli had the smallest shrimps I have ever seen and the Vongole dish's pasta was overcooked.   Not a great experience.  Won't be coming back  and cannot recommend.,"Ordered for pick-up of bolognese pasta, spaghetti with meatballs and garlic risotto with scallops. Everything we ordered was mediocre, or shall I say lacking in sauce and flavor. I'm not sure if it would taste the same if we had it in the restaurant or maybe it was just a busy day since it was on a Saturday after thanksgiving. I'll probably not try them again since I had better pasta elsewhere. But, I do give them points for having large scallops.","DON'T come tonight.   Too busy and the staff cant handle it.   People are leaving their tables before their entrees are being served.  I waited a hour and fifty-five minutes for our entrees.  Use to be my local go to spot.  Sorry.   I tip very well.   Not tonight!!!   Nightmare!!!!   The server ""Tony"" was super rude, he kept rolling his eyes at us.  When asked for the manager, the owner Angelo came over and offered free dessert.   We declined and just asked for our check.  First time in our lives we ever left a restaurant and didn't tip.  Well this was the first time we were  ever disrespected and had such horrible service and experience!!!!  We really hope you fix this problem for your business sake because we will never come back again.  Two totally different reviews for this place.  Sad!!!!!   FYI the server was not Tony Spirito.   I wish Mr. Spirito was our server because this would have never happen.","Very good old school Italian Restaurant. Service is very attentive without being intrusive. The food is excellent and most dishes are well prepared. The pork Braciole melted in your mouth and wasn't dry. The cavatelli was a nice choice of pasta with the Braciole. The sole Meunière was fresh but the sauce was a little heavier than expected. A side salad comes with all entrees. The desserts are good the creme brûlée was nice and light and the right amount of crunch!Good place to go with friends, they don't rush you out!","Very good old school Italian Restaurant.

206,"I have been ordering pizza from Goodfellas for many years and this is not the first time I have either had trouble with delivery or pickup of a pizza.  You think I would have learned my lesson.  I came to pick it up, because the app said my order was ready.  I get there waiting ten minutes, because I was told my order would be ready in a little while.  I ask where the order is and then she asks the guys making the pizza and they tell me 10 more minutes.  She should have not told me a ""little while"" when the two pizzas were not even in the oven.  Get your act together Goodfellas.",Ordered meatballs and spaghetti Got chicken parmigiana Called and manager wouldn't replace itAside from that chicken Parmesan was burnt Horrible food don't order hereBy the way this was a replacement for undercooked eggplant parm I ordered last week,Absolutely the worst place ever ... pizza sucked and the customer service was even worse. They gave us the wrong order and refused to give us the money back. Order from the original Goodfella's on hylan !! Pizza is great there !!,"If you like the Goodfellas menu and are looking for a location that can accommodate a dozen people, this Victory Blvd location is the one to use. Staff is friendly and reservations can be made.","The food is delicious but the utensils and cups were .. not clean. I decided to come to this location because it was closer to where I was running my errands. I loved the other location and had a great dining experience. When I got my cup I noticed it had a fine layer of black residue and I tried to wipe it off. It came off but then I noticed the entire cup was covered in it! That turned off my appetite. However; when the food came my appetite returned and the pizza I ordered (a la vodka) and the baked clams were very delicious. I couldn't finish the pizza because it was overloaded with toppings and I ordered the square (6 pieces). The baked clams were seasoned well and I definitely need to learn how to make my own! Overall, I wouldn't return here but I would go back to the other location.","I planned on ordering from Goodfella's tonight, at first I was going to order through Grubhub because I had a coupon, however the coupon didn't work and it was just easier to call. I called at 6:30pm and asked for delivery, I gave my address and the girl I was speaking to told me they do not deliver to me (I live 10 minutes away, and when I was going to order on Grubhub it said that they do deliver to my address) and she continued to tell me that I should call the Goodfella's on Hylan Blvd. Really???After being on hold for 5 minutes and after explaining to the girl that I only live ten minutes away she finally said ""okay we'll deliver to you"". I ordered a small pie, an order of buffalo wings, and a Caesar salad. 1 hour and 20 minutes later I call and speak to the same girl who proceeds to tell me that my driver left and would be there shortly. After another 10 minutes my food arrives. I say to the delivery guy that it has been over an hour and a half, and his response was ""it's because we're short a driver"" no apology or anything. We open the pizza and it looks like it has been sitting in the box for a while and tastes warm at best. And on top of it they put the salad and the wings in the same bag making the salad hot!! I am VERY disappointed with the service and the food. I plan on calling tomorrow to speak to a manager. I DO NOT recommend ordering from here.",Goodfella's
207,I give this place 3 stars for the reason I called in for a cake and after waiting in line for 10 mins they told me they were out. So they told me to come back at 1pm I understand it's the holiday season but don't tell people one thing and when they get there your out after waiting in line. SMH I've gotten stuff from this place before the stuff is good here but this really annoyed me. I'm sorry but you guys messed up on your part telling me you had this cake available. Smh Poor customer service at least tell people you have the cake but they going fast or something instead of making them wait on line and nothing !! And the lady at the counter was trying to get me to get cookies I said no and walked out. I was there for for the cake not the cookies!!! Merry Christmas !,"The service was disappointing. It took my waitress 15 minutes to tell me that they ran out of blue mountain coffee. It took another 15 minutes to take my order for lox and cream cheese on a bagel. The cappuccino I ordered in place of the blue mountain coffee was half full because she spilt half of it. She didn't even off to get me another one. The bagel took 40 minutes to come out. The check took another 20 minutes. You see where this is going. If you want to eat here just order ahead of time and pick it up. Don't dine here, it's the worst service I received in a very long time.",Manhattan prices on Staten Island! Bagel with two eggs and cheese and coffee $9.00. Why?,"My husband and I got a few hours to kill before flying back to SF and a good friend of ours recommended this place. I've got to say, I didn't expect it to be so good! We ordered chocolate cheesecake, regular cheesecake, Rainbow cookies with strawberry on top :D and some lattes. I got a couple bites out of what everyone's orders and I really LOVED my rainbow cookies! Plus their desserts are very instagramable! The staff team is very friendly and I loved the short wait :) We don't typically come to Staten Island but the next time we are in town, we'll definitely come back for their lunch menu!","I'll give it a 3.5, since the waitress wasn't attentive.  Forget about getting a refill on your drink. I went on a Saturday afternoon and yes it was busy, but food was out in about 15 minutes.

208,The worst Bacalhau a braz I ever had!!  I ordered 3 orders of bacalhau a braz and so sorry to have to admit the truth it was awful.  The cod was fiber dry and tasteless and I feel as if I paid for a big tray of mushy frozen French fries.  I never had this dish without black olives included but my order came without them.  I was embarrassed to present this dish to my guests.  Don't think I'll be going there anytime soon.  Total yuk,If I could zero stars I would very disappointed  I wanted to give them a try I ordered a grilled chicken Breast and it tasted like old fish I don't like algarve so maybe I'll just stay in Newark .,"I have given this restaurant a couple of chances but defensively the last.

I love the friendly and loving staff. You feel at home when you go there and take a bite into any of their delicious plates. The Sangria made by ""Sangria Girl"" is the best, her","I'm usually not a fan of Portuguese food. The food never sits well with my stomach. I went here the other day with my date, and I was pleasantly surprised by the location. We each ordered a pitcher of sangria (it was super affordable, and we wanted different colors of sangria). They gave us some fresh bread with some butter, which is always delicious. Then for my meal I ordered some pork chops with rice. While I wasn't a fan of the rice, I really enjoyed the pork chops. The meal was overall extremely delicious, and sat extremely well with my stomach! Out of all the Portuguese restaurants nearby, I have to say that this is one of my favorites!","Great spot for a nice meal and a glass of wine.  They have a nice bar and TV so you can watch TV while you having a nice drink.  They do serve big plates, so be ready to eat a lot.",Portugal Express
209,"I probably should be honest: i don't eat or like german food. So this is really not a review on the food but more about the atmosphere of the restaurant. Upon entering for the first time, I noticed a musty smell. The restaurant has a lot of knick knacks adorning the whole place and it doesnt seem as if they've dusted in a long time. The building itself is old and is in need of a renovation or at least a thorough cleaning. Instead of bread, we were given complimentary pretzels, which were overly salty but still good.Although I don't like german food, my companions did, and I asked if they could make a cheeseburger. It's not on the menu but it was available and i ordered that.It was obviously frozen and not seasoned well at all but thats what I get for ordering something they dont usually make. But you can't season a hamburger? come on.The dining area was empty for the most part. The bar was quite busy however. I don't think I would return but again, not really a fan of german food anyway.",Love that they have bands here outside but when I called earlier the same day I was told no cover charge then was charged $10 per person .. embarrassing for me since I was meeting 10 people there .... also their beer is expired a lot and more than once had a funny taste.  The manager/owner is definitely a nasty little man,1 star and I'm being kind! We've been patrons a few times over the years and each time the quality of food and service has declined. Last visit we were brought a pitcher of water for the table without glasses! The waitress couldn't find any clean ones! Half the menu was unavailable and entrees were brought to the table before appetizers. Never again.,"Been meaning to check this place out for years after since reading about it in some hipster publication. Got a chance to do so last weekend on a random trip to SI.Take a requisite pic outside with the iconic Bavarian boy and a moment to admire this 170-year-old building, first opened before the Civil War. Then proceed into the cozy and inviting, dimly lit tavern where friendly locals will take care of you. We came between lunch and dinner on Saturday so it was nice and quiet. There's a bier garten out back on the patio, so feel free to revel there on a sunny day.The German beer list is extensive and had several bottles I'd never heard of. Can't go wrong with a Celebrator on draft. Fantastic beer, well paired with hearty food.For grub, we knowingly over-ordered. The smoked/salted fish platter was nice though you'll need a friend to help you on the marinated herring (and I say this as a former Soviet). The trout and salmon were on point. The potato pancakes are outstanding and I urge you to save room up front if you're ordering it as an appetizer. As it was, my farmer's feast was impossible to finish, but tasty nonetheless Shout-out to the potato dumpling and bratwurst and apologies to the smoked pork loin and pork roast, which deserved more attention than I could muster. My wife cleaned off her shepher's pie, a daily special.Friendly service and a local crowd recommend this place, and its relative inconvenience for interlopers like me should keep it solid for a long time to come.","Ordered Farmer's FeastPork roast with beer gravy, smoked pork chop, and a grilled bratwurst served with a potato dumpling, red cabbage and sauerkrautFor myself! Loved it . My little one - usually doesn't eat anything got chicken fingers with the best French fries ever !!!!! Schnitzel that my hubby ordered was little dry , perfect bead goulash , but overall really good German food . Worth to visit place ! Nice staff","I've been coming here since the restaurant first opened. Unfortunately the last few times I came it seems like everything I have order isn't as good as it used to be. It just seems like the food all pre prepared and they just microwave it. Also the last few times it seems like they only had one or two tap beers for some reason.Gonna be taking a long break from here, that's if i ever go back.",Killmeyer's
210,"Cockroaches served with your food. I am absolutely furious and disgusted. We have been to Nucci South a few times and cannot believe its roach infested. We saw two Cockroaches crawling on the table next to us. Which was horrifying and gross . What made it worse is a passing waiter saw us looking and to pretend its nothing HE SMASHES THE COCKROACH WITH HIS BARE HAND and the second one runs away. The waiter then just walks away like it's no big deal, he walk around like its nothing and WALKS BACK IN THE KITCHEN and starts serving other patrons their food.ARE YOU KIDDING ME . Horrible and absolutely extremely disgusting. At this point we got up and began to leave, we dint even get our food and we were ready to throw up, nauseated. We made sure to let the owners know and they pretended its water cockroaches, like it's not a big deal. No wonder the food is cheap they don't care about the quality, hygiene and peoples health. If there were two in the dinning room God knows what's in the kitchen. If you like filth and roaches you should continue to eat here. Cockroaches being served with your food.","Homemade Italian cuisine...what's not to love? Amazing food, service and menu options. You will not be disappointed. My family and I love Nucci's.",If I could give this place zero stars I would. Party of 18 we sat down and had bread on the table as our main appetizer for the longest time. 55 bucks a head prix fixe this is what we got and the service: Multiple waiters who were very young and inexperienced having a difficult time getting our wine or beer drinks correct. They finally brought out fried calamari family style at least a half hour or more after we sat. Not good. Rubbery. Next we get mozzarella and tomato with roasted pepper drenched in reduced balsamic. Tomatoes were hard. Pasta wasn't bad a penne a la vodka. Mind you big time gaps between these paltry courses.  Iceberg lettuce salad that looked like garnish taken from the last party. God awful. Who serves iceberg lettuce anymore? The cheapest garbage going. Now for the dinner that took FOREVER to bring out. Cheap wedding food at best.  My wife had the Flank steak drenched in sugary teriyaki sauce. Inedible. Multiple people couldn't eat it. I had the filet. Was average but like I said wedding food. Bottom line: I've been to other places like Patrizias and I'm not a fan of the loud packed crowd but the food there is top notch and plenty of it for the prix fixe. This was a waste of money. They should've kept going to Perth Amboy.UPDATE: My brother-in-law called to complain today and they told him the food was late and terrible because the CHEF PASSED OUT?? What does that even mean??? Also is it a restaurant or sports bar??  Giant Tv's in almost every room.,"Very good food and serviceWe had a post funeral luncheon at Nucci's South a few weeks ago and the Management and Staff were great. We have eaten there many other times and we were glad they were able to arrange this for us at such a difficult time (my dad really loved this place so we knew he would have choose it) They have a great bereavement menu which makes it very easy on the family during a difficult time. We pre-selected a salad, and pasta course which was served to the large group and then each person was asked which entree they would like from 4 different choices and then they each got a great plated dessert. They made it so easy on us and the price was great. I would reccomend this restaurant for any occasion you have and I am sure you will be very satisfied.",Tried it for the first time last night with my son and his girlfriend . Truly a great place .

211,Worst food I ever ate took over 1 hour to deliver and totally not worth the wait foodWas cold sauce was bland dough was rubbery/ chewy stuff mushrooms cost $10 dollars and wasn't even cook on top of tasting horrible and fishy this place shouldn't even be in business stay far far away from them,wish i could give no stars the people are so rude and mean. the staff literally ignored me for fifteen min before i could order nasty girls on the phone too. overall just a bad experience. will not go back and anyone who's considering this establishment should just go to ti amo. they are the better food and the better atmosphere.,Just received my delivery an hour and half after ordering it was supposedly on it's way 45 min after ordering . My food was cold and burnt I ordered a steak wrap and a slice of pizza the steak taste like charcoal  never will I order from here again .,"So I saw the medicore reiews, and HAD to give Bario's a chance. As you can see from my rating. I agree with what most people had to say here. It took a very long time for them to actually get here. Two hours and thirty minutes, counting fron when I got a call that the pizza was out to delivery. And when it eventually arrived, it was nothing special.First off, my pizza's box was bent, and the pizza was squished in. So presentation wise, they kinda failed. I dont know what they do with the toppings. But I feel as though it's lightly boiled? I don't know why so many pizza places on Staten Island does that. But I guess someone must like it. Personally I'm a traditionalist in pizza. I like my toppings roasted.I ordered from here due to the extensive vegan menu. And numbers wise, its impressive! But in taste, its. Okay. Just okay. I guess it all comes down to personal perfrences at this point. If you love Violife cheese, order here. This was my first time eating Violife cheese, but I came in expecting good things. Since every vegan online talks up Violife. Turns out, Violife is gross. It looked weird, and tasted like raw dough. I did not enjoy it.I also ordered buffalo cauliflower,  and it was good. Much wetter than I usually have (didn't help that it came cold) but not bad.Overall though, I can't see myself ordering from this store again. If you're a vegan craving pizza. We have a Blaze Pizza on the island, and their vegan pizza is AMAZING. What we should do is encourage them to open more stores, really","This place is local to my sisters house. When we are here it's our go for a family meal. It comes with anti pasto, pasta ,salad and a dish ( we usually get the combo of shrimp parm and chicken parm) all family style for $36.  It's a great deal and the food is always good. They close at 10 and we called at 9:30 and asked them if we could still come to eat and they said sure. We were actually there until 10:30.","Very pleased!! Found out they had a FULL vegan menu and couldn't pass up trying the pie + tofu buffalo wrap. Now this is one of my favorite spots on the Island! Can't wait to try more of your vegan options! Probably going to try the beyond sausage & peppers next time. Sounds next level! Thanks, keep it up!!",Bario's Restaurant
212,Come here pretty often. Food is really good but not happy about the valet attendant. He got into my car while smoking a cigarette.,"I've been here a few times with friends and my cousin...apparently I need to always come with my cousin who knows some of the waiters and owner because I came with my family for a special birthday without her and it was completely different atmosphere and food not good at all. Portions way smaller than when I came the other times.  We got the prix fix which we have gotten before and it was always good and plentiful.....this time the sauce for the calamari was way too bland no taste at all!!! My husband ordered the stuffed filet of sole and he was lucky to get three bites out of it and paper thin he didn't even know what kind of fish it actually was.  I had the pork chop which I've had before and was terrific NOT this time it looked like fake pork and was covered in thyme spice which I hate and way too much of it. The broccoli was right out of the pot no seasoning at all and the mashed potatoes the same issue no taste. I had my two grandchildren with us who didn't get dessert but we did - Tortoni no choice here!!! and coffee never asked if we wanted cappuccino instead (I would have paid extra)  so I asked for ice cream for the kids they had the nerve to charge 16.00 for two scoops of ice cream for the two of them.....really!!!! As usually, it's who you know at some of these restaurants on Staten Island and this is definitely one of them......","This is a favorite for for one of my friends. She is a sucker for a Prix-Fix menu which they offer. She called last minute to meet her there on a Wednesday night. By the time o arrived they had already started the 4 course dinner. So I just ordered  the Bolognese since everything else had olives (my most hated food). My friend liked her lentil soup and the other app was the zucchini blossom and bbq Meatball ??? Meatball was gross and the blossom was good but soggy since it's drenched in sauce. Our reed was so stale you break a tooth. Had to ask repeatedly for butter, silverware, a beverage. I rated the pasta duo of pene vodka and angel hair with garlicky tomato sauce those were cold but served almost cold. As for the entrees my Bolognese was gross. I love Bolognese this was worse then a jar sauce with hamburger. O it was terrible. My friends both had the chicken chicken/shrimp lemon sauce. Ice cold I mean ice my friend even asked them to nuke it. For dessert it came with Tortoni. Apparently Tortoni is ice cream in a paper condiment cup you get at most fast food places. For an extra fee one of them upgraded to Tiramisu. She said it was stale. When the waiter asked why she didn't eat it. He looked so offended. Didn't offer her anything else or to even remove it from the bill. Needless to say I won't be running back here.","Fun GNO, service was good and quick.  Food was very good, Fun night for dinner and a little dancing.","Decided to give it a try after some friends recommended it to us.  Arrived about 4 PM on a weekday and immediately were seated.  My wife ordered the Pollo Scarppariello.  She found it to be flavorful and considered it Very Good.  I ordered the Veal Parmigiana with Pasta.  It was very thin slices of breaded dry Veal that were difficult to slice with a knife and not at all tender to chew.  Sauce was light and flavorful, but did not make up for the poor condition and preparation of the Veal.  Disappointed to say the least.  Came with Linguine which was Good.  Discussed the situation with the Manager for his benefit so he could take the proper action.  Service was Very Good.  Ambiance was comfortable.  The rating would be much higher if my dish were at the level of my wife's.  Unfortunately, it wasn't even close.  Consequently, the rating you see above.","Been there a few times and each time had a delicious, very satisfied meal. Appetizers are tasty and prepared well and the specials we had were delicious.

I walked in, I noticed a cute place and the staff noticed me, the phone won't stop ringing and I couldn't ask one of the girls questions. So I thought this place must be good.First time ordering Greek food from Kuzina and it was a take out. I ordered three big meals and one apps. * a big Horiatiki salad with chicken and beef on the stick. * Chicken Souvlaki Platter with a small Horiatiki salad to take place for French fries.  * Bifteki Platter with Greek French fries. * Loukaniko as apps. I got the order and I took it home without checking. My jeep was smelling really good and I was hungry. I couldn't wait to go home to eat. They got two ordered mixed up and forgot the Horiatiki salad for one of the orders. So I had to give my salad to my mother to complete the meal. I only ate the meat. The salad that was suppose to be mine, I gave it to my mother and the salad were overly wilted with salad dressing. All the meats that we got were flavorful but over cooked. It was very disappointing. It is not worth my $60.00.I will check out the establishment that's the one on Arthur Kill Rd and see if they are any better. How Greek it is! Has my vote!If the owners are on this page, please reach out to me.","We have ordered from this place multiple times, each time thinking it will be different. Alas, here we are, waiting over an hour and half for our food. Mind you, we live 10 minutes away from the resaturant. This is the very last time we will be ordering from Kuzina. I suggest that if you want your dinner before it's time for you to wake up for work the next morning, do not order from here.","I had gyro platter which come with a small salad gyro meat and rice. The portion size is pretty big and they give u extra pita. The gyro was very good as well . Service was a little slow but they were very nice and gave me extra tatziki sauce No charge . Overall I would go back .. oh and the price was pretty good as well . 50$ for a gyro , gyro platter, a large Greek salad with a chicken kabob a soda and 2 frappes..","100 degrees out and no one wanted to cook so we decided to order from this place. Very upset we did ... low quality and not a thoughtful packaging situation. The Lima beans in tomato sauce arrived spilled in the bag....and upon trying to salvage them it turned out they were nothing more than out of the can crapolaaaa .... what balls on these people? Entire order was not flavorful, awful hummus... pita uncooked and soggy ... really a total waste of money. We got bit. But trust us ... we won't get bit again by these guys. Let's just save everyone the time, agony and of course the money and go out of business tomorrow ... thanks ; )",Ive only ordered delivery from here so sit down might be better. Delivery took close to 2 hours with no prior warning of it taking so long By the time my food arrived it was cold and the bag was soaked in oil/ grease. Salad- it was drenched in salad dressing and seems to have been made ages ago as the lettuce was mushy. The cucumbers and olive had no bite and crunch they were all soggy. Grape leaves- absolutely delicious I definitely recommend Oktapodi- im sure it would've tasted better hot but cold gummy octopus was just not appetizing. The season was delicious but cold it was just not good. Chicken gyro platter-  Chicken was seasoned deliciously and the lemon potatoes were phenomenal.,Kuzina

I've had most of there entrees one better then the next.My only complaint ls they charge for the Credit Card fees I go out to eat all the time I've never seen that I explained to the manger or maybe the owner raise your prices no one cares to pay more ( and there prices are cheap def due for an increase) but people don't like to see that it looks like your taking advantage!,"Food is decent Service is lacking. I have given this place three visits now. Both in person visits were about the same. They staff this restaurant with young people but do not give them the skills to be successful at customer service. My most recent experience... I ordered food to be delivered to my community pool. Obviously if it's going to a community pool I NEED utensils. One if the items ordered was a salad with grilled chicken. The lack of utensils prompted me to call. The girl on the phone said"" I thought you had your own since you didn't ask"". Then offered to send them. The salad was packed in the same packaging as the chicken.   Making the lettuce soggy to begin with.  Waiting another half hour would have made for cold chicken and hot soggy salad. I asked for the manger, they said hold on. Then that they had stepped out. Like I said. NO customer service",The worst chicken parmigiana I ever had! The chicken was disgusting not Edible and one little small piece of mozzarella on the top. I called backed to complain told the girl I want to send back my order and was left on hold for 20 minutes. I called back I said you left me on hold for 20 mins  and the girl had the nerve to say they were too busy! I suggest to go to Pronto the food there is always fresh!!,"If I ever had to eat one pizza for the remainder of my life, it would be from Reggiano's. We have been loyal to another Staten Island pizzeria for more than a decade.  However, a colleague told me about this spot.   And, of course, I can't wait for him to recommend other places now, as I know he has fabulous taste in food.   We had the Reggiano's Pie with meatballs, holy pizza pie.Layer by layer, the crust, phenomenal.  Just the right amount of thickness.  The sauce, thick with a hint of sweetness.    The basil, plentiful and so delightful. The parm chunks, just right. For once, I didn't need to add anything, no pepper, no extra parm, it was pure perfection.   We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door.  The friendly service lasted all through dinner.","Food is always very good, service is friendly and even when it's extremely busy, they still do their best to make sure each group is attended to. Many times the manage/owner will walk around and talk to everyone which is nice and shows an appreciation for the people who come in. Highly suggest their seafood dishes and the pizza is just as good. The red sangria is always a good choice to any meal . Can't think of anything I would change except maybe the wait, but that's bc of how good it is and speaks to the positive experience you have there.","This places has some of the best pizza and heros on Staten Island and at some great prices. I got the classic Reggiano pie and it was done just right with a wood fire charred bottom, and the intense flavor of fresh grated Parmesan Reggiano.",Reggiano's
215,"Me and my family were loyal customers of A&C for a long time. Ever since they expanded, the food quality has really declined. After buying products from both the shelf and in the deli that were expired, moldy, and old, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and gave them one more shot. I got stromboli from the deli and the meat inside was so old, the salami was turning gray. Ordered a deli sandwich and the grilled chicken was rubbery and disgusting. I couldn't even eat any of it and this stuff is pricey! Unfortunately this place had so much potential, but i will never buy anything from there again. I go out of my way now to go to another Italian deli in the area. They lost a lot of business from me and my family.","Solid quality Deli, the prices have gone up a bit but considering the expansion and the facts it's the only thing open after 10 around here, I can dig it.","This was my favorite deli-until they made the major renovations. It is strange, the taste of the refrigerated salads do not seem as fresh as they were in the old refrigerator cases. The refrigerator cases have a separation in the glass. One day while waiting for my order, I saw a child put their fingers through the opening towards the food. Made me think if a kid could put their fingers in there, what else could fit through those openings? The deli workers (post construction) are not as skilled, not great at cutting the deli meats. The store has an odd smell, not food like, but odd. My teenager says it stinks. It isn't a pleasant smell. One very annoying thing-the new cashiers. No one says ""next"" or ""can I help you?""  Nope you get an ""are you ready?"" With a questioning look as they look up from their phones. Yes I am ready. I am standing on this line. I am sure the renovations cost a small fortune. But the store doesn't seem as crowded as it once was. I hope the expansion pays off for the deli.","I ordered 2 really good sandwiches from the deli.  The counter man came around and walked me to the breads, where I got to pick what I wanted the sandwich on.  There were 2 soft sub rolls right there, so I went with those. Normally I like a little harder Italian bread, but these were fine. I went with the italian sandwich and got salami and cheese for the wife. Good amount of meat on both sandwiches, I thought the red pepper on the Italian could have had a little more flavor. Really glad I added onions to the sandwich too, because it didn't come with them. 12$ for the Italian, 9$ for the salami and cheese- each sandwich was plenty of food for an entire meal, and wife actually made hers into 2. Ok fine, half for her and half for me a day or 2 later. Sandwich aside, there is a ton of prepared Italian/other food in the counter.  I saw friend shrimp, egg rolls (who knows what they were stuffed with), rice balls, like 4 different meatballs... it was a lot of food to choose from. Don't want to cook (or own a deep fryer), check these guys out.","This place only gets better, the food is fresh, the service is great, and now they have fresh bread. Love this place, I don't know where I would go for my fresh deli meats, tuna, salads, grilled vegetables, o yeah and their amazing grill chicken and eggplant caponata.","I grew up in Brooklyn and when we decided to move to Staten Island I thought ""We're screwed"". Where are we going to eat? Where are we going to find good old fashion Italian food? The first day I stepped in A & C I was amazed how nice everyone was. I ordered a sandwich (Chicken Cutlet, fresh Mozzarella, roasted peppers, oil (olive),  and balsamic vinegar). I sat down at home to eat  and I took a bite from my sandwich, OMG. Since that day all I can do is smile when I go to A & C, because whatever I get for breakfast, lunch, or dinner is gonna bring a smile to my face.  I have been going to this salumeria for approximately 15 years and I have tried all the other places in Staten Island. If you live or have traveled or travel to or through  Staten Island,  don't think twice you have to try this place.",A & C Superette
216,"Terrible place! Waiters are standing around, pretending not to notice when you ask for them! We have a banquet and believe it or not I have to pay $11 for a small cup of tonic!!!! And they told me ginger ale is also not included! I wonder what the tonic with vodka would be-$40?!?! Terrible! Most expensive tonic I ever drank in my life! Go somewhere else!!!","The most unprofessional, a nightmare of a restaurant! We came to break our fast on one of the holiest days of the year. Ordered a head of time and dragged my elderly parents there. The restaurant was packed to capacity with minimal staff, the waitress who later told us she was the manager, kept complaining that she was overwhelmed and understaffed (did I already say unprofessional).  Food arrived in 45 minute intervals for each member of our party, nobody received their entree at the same time. We continued to complain and yet there was no apology or comp for what was the worst meal and service ever provide by a restaurant! I will never go back and I will tell anyone that listens to never patronize this horrible establishment !!! Shame on you!!!!","Had a family gathering here this past weekend. We got a private room in the back, which was nice.Food was good-a lot of fresh salads, apps, crispy potatoes, and well-cooked meats.Service was very attentive.",Excellent management. Phenomenal kitchen. Excellent service. Everyone is so friendly. The food is simply perfection.,"I don't know if this restaurant is related to the one in Brooklyn, but if it is it is giving its big brother a bad name.  But let's start at the beginning.it was Sunday night and we were pretty hungry so we decided to stop by Chinar for dinner.Expecting service and prices akin to similar places across the Verrazano Bridge we were pretty happy with our choice but boy were we wrong.First off.  Normally if you have a place that can seat you for dinner just as a visit but not a scheduled banquet one might expect to have a host(ess) greet you at the entrance and get you to the table.  That was missing, the host were actually talking at the bar so when my wife walked in she just pointed at any table and told her to just pick one.So we sat down.  The girl that was servicing our table was nice and we decided to pick a sampler platter for four, which normally should be sufficient to feed 2 adults and 2 kids but this one was not to be.  The sampler platter for four actually includes 4 kabobs, not 6 or 8 as one might have expected from a place like this but 4.  1 Chicken, 1 Lyulya, 4 lamb chops, and 1 lamb riblets (which basically have some fat but very little meat),  So the platter which was basically the size of half of our table had that in meats and a mountain of french fries.  I mean I love fries as the next guy but that is a side not the main course!So we had to order 4 more kabobs, each one at a price point of something similar one might have at an upscale Manhattan restaurant but at a neighborhood place on Staten Island!  I mean the only saving grace for this place is that food is actually good.  It is tasty, not overdone but I think that they should close down the restaurant and just have the banquet hall.","I have no words to describe how amazing this place is. The food is absolutely delicious, the service was stunning but the best of it was entertaining part I couldn't even believe we could have such an awesome party. I was invited for a bday party in private room where we had terrific singers who made our party unbelievable great. All guests were thrilled with all performers especially Arthur who is adorable fella and sang for us any song we wanted. So friendly and generous! This energy! Noone was sitting at the table everyone was dancing! WOW! I am celebrating my birthday there also and making sure I'm booking performers as well, as I know they will not let my party down! Thank you Chinar on the Island for making my trip from Manhattan worth it 150%",Chinar On The Island
217,"Small owned restaurant. No one was there when we went in and waited around for a few minutes for sometime to realize we were there. After we got our food, the waitress disappeared and never came to check up on us. I'm not a huge fan of Indian food, but figured I'd be adventurous and try something new. My feelings for Indian are unchanged after my meal.","We went in at a time when the place was ""full"". Both the ambience and the food were below par. Good staff though.","I've ordered from Dosa Garden often enough. Food was very good. However last two orders were disappointing. Food used to come complete and within a reasonable time frame. In the last 2 orders -both were extremely late (nearing the 2 hours mark)- in one, items were missing, the other - well, technically order was cancelled due to lateness ( & after driver unbelievably left with the food after I had buzzed him in due to ""many orders"" to deliver). I didn't write anything the first time - just didn't order for a long time- Second time- I wish to make sure to comment on their lack of timeliness. I ordered through Grub Hub whose rep told me that an invite to comment is issued after delivery- no delivery, no invitation to rate. I am sure that there have been quite a few cancellations  not reflected in the reviews then - I base my decisions on where to order based on rating & reviews - timeliness being one of the factors. I see ratings & reviews as incomplete & hope that they could include the cancellations due to lateness in the future. Could have ordered somewhere else.",This place has more then earned their 5th star!  Always good its now great.  Love ordering the chana palak for a veggie option or the markhoni chicken for a meat option.  Quality every time.  Best on staten island and there is a lot of competition for sri lankan/indian here.,"This place is an absolute staple of the community.  I'm really glad that Dosa is still going strong.  It's introduced me to lots of Sri Lankan dishes I would have never had.  As I've begun eating healthier, there are lots of options for that here too.  Great for a sit down meal or take out.  Consistent quality.","Came here on a Sunday night for dinner with my family. It was pretty empty but got packed by the time we were done. Service was exceptional. Our waitress was polite and efficient. The restaurant is small, cute, simple, & clean. No complaints.We got the medhu vada which were probably some of the BEST I've had. Super crispy and light but super soft on the inside. I got the Mysore cheese dosa and needed to eat it in two sittings because it was so filling. It was very good. Overall it was a great experience and will definitely be coming back when I need my dosa fix.",Dosa Garden
218,"Picture speaks a thousand words.  $7 for this small, burnt, clearly old smidge of macaroni gratin.","A small and comfortable restaurant but lack of professionalism & dissapointing in portion size as far as their most expensive dish on the menu like the ""poisson gro sel"" or  the ""lambi"". That kind of explain why at 9pm most of the tables were available. Then, after the waitress finish chatting with her customer she handed us the menu, with attitude of course as if we're disturbing her socializing. Although I have chosen to take one of the dinner options, they still managed to serve us the wrong meal! And that happens everytime we go there. Either they would bring us half the meal missing its main part, or they'll bring it out piece by piece with at least a good five minutes increments. By then,  Our tastes buds gone bad and we no longer have an appetite. Regarding the quality of the food: It was good, but definitely not excellent. May 1, 2018","I love the food but the service is subpar. We ordered 3 griot and was given 3 goat. On top of that, the sizes of the order was taken wrong and when we mentioned it, it was said that they couldn't adjust it. Please do better, your establishment is a prestige spot and should function as such.","I've been here a few times & it's amazing every time. The food is AMAZING (I highly recommend the red snapper), drinks are strong & the service is great. We need more places like First Republic!","This upscale restaurant lounge is a gem.  I was surprised pleasantly by the live jazz band who had tented musicians. The ambiance was classy people were dressed well and there were a few parties reserved. The decor was a modern take using Haitian classic paintings and historical events,people and sayings printed on some walls. The staff was so friendly they found my sister and I a seat with a packed house and we appreciated that. The food was good. We had legumes, goat, du riz avec djon djon, sweet plantain, grios and red bean sauce.  The pork could be better seasoned but everything else was amazing. Good portion enough to take home.  The jazz band was accompanied by a beautiful songstress. After the set the DJ played music for dancing and we swayed to a great mix of Caribbean and other songs. Parties were in full swing and it was a good time had by all.","I use to come here a lot for the Republic Punch, chicken pike, black rice and veggies. The food use to take long because it is made to order, however, now the food still takes long but now its warm instead of hot and they very rarely have veggies. The bartenders are nice, but not nice enough for the price of the food. It seems as if the only time things are on point is if one of the owners are here and it's really tiring. I come so much, that the bartenders know my order and I have not come for a long time because of the food issue. Then they have the nerve to raise the prices. Terroble!!",First Republic Lounge and Restaurant
219,"Hotel restaurant,  not bad,  but nothing to get excited about.   Kinda pricey,  $32 for half a roasted chicken.   My $18 burger was overcooked but edible.   Service was friendly but unnecessarily slow.  All in all,  I wasn't impressed.","Had a salad and added steak to it.  The salad was $14 and to add steak was $10.  $24 for a salad!  Plus $3 for coffee.  The most expensive salad for lunch I've had in a long time.  I'm giving this hotel restaurant 3 stars because the food was prepared well, and the service was friendly.  But you have no other options around the hotel so your stuck eating at the hotel restaurant.  Bottom line is it's good food, but way overpriced.",VERY tiny $20 house salad. It took a long time to have my order placed and even longer to have my food delivered. I ordered coffee and never got a refill on it or my water. Not impressed!!,"I had a really crummy day and missed my flight out of EWR. I really wasn't looking forward to spending the night in Jersey at some airport hotel. I checked in and was immediately impressed and put at ease by the brightness and cleanliness of my room. The rooms are decorated really nicely and are fresh and stylish.The best part was when I went to the restaurant. It's a legit restaurant and a place that I would go to if it was in my neighborhood. The service was spectacular and made my crappy day all better. They seem to really take pride in what they do and clams are legit. I would highly recommend the clams. Stay away from the calamari because they give you a ton of it and you will feel guilty if you eat all of it. They're good, but it's a lot of calamari. If you have somebody to share it with it's awesome, but if you are alone you will be filled with guilt afterwards.My server was really kind and helpful. when I asked about their local ipas, he asked about my preferences and suggested a beer that I really enjoyed.  Other people were constantly coming by and checking on me and asking me if I needed anything. I can't stress how much the service in the restaurant made my day better. Like, sincerely better. When your work in the service industry it's important to keep in mind how much of an effect you can have on someone's day, and this place has it down pat. Thank you!! If you're a weary traveler, this place will take care of you. I'm ready to face EWR.","Dinner Apr 30  Had a Caesar Salad and it was okay....so why the 4 stars you ask?  The Honey Sriracha Chicken Wings were some of the best wings I had had in a while.  The were fried so crispy - not over fried and dried out, but trult crispy!  And the honey with sriracha was such a tasty sauce to just kiss the wings with crazy good flavor! Funny thing was that the Buffalo Wings were NOT crispy - so I am assuming that the lack of crispness had something to do with the buffalo sauce making them soggy - boo!",Business traveler stuck on thanksgiving on the road.

220,"Stopped here yesterday to pick up lunch take out with my boyfriend. He ordered a lamb Gyro - ""Lamb Gyro, no veggies - just lamb and feta Gyro"". I ordered a Greek salad -  ""Greek salad with grilled chicken, no anchovies"".What we received...A container of lamb meat slices with feta cheese sprinkled on top.....not on a Gyro. No gyro lol I received a container of soggy salad... with a big black hair in it and also a 6 inch piece of white string Something told me to check the order before we left, we would have caught the lack of gyro, but would not have picked up on the surprise hair and string in the salad...Obviously will never return to this establishment. I was extremely disgusted","Had the lamb gyro as I do my first visit to all Greek restaurants.  Not much flavor and the pita appeared to be heated in oil.  Not a very tasty sandwich and have tasted many better. Also , I noticed they had pizza also on the counter which struck me as strange: a greek restaurant that serves pizza?  Based on the look of the pizza, it may have been sitting around for a bit.  I was hoping to find a hidden gem in this sleepy strip mall but a gem it is not.","Extremely rude and disrespectful to customer.In my order I specifically mentioned for small pieces of chicken because it is easy for my kid to chew. On the contrary, they sent big pieces of chicken. I have ordered from them around 5 times and one of my previous orders also had issues where the gyro was so dry that I could hardly chew it! When I called the store manager to bring this to his attention, he was rude to me and told me that he is neither replacing the food nor giving me any refund. Also, he rudely told me not to order again from them.WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.",Best Greek food on the island! Food is always fresh and feels home made and a lot of options to choose from on the menu. Owners of this establishment are amazing people and the service is always on point. Highly recommended!,The food is great and the owners are very nice.  I had the chicken gyro platter which is $13 but the chunks of chicken are huge and worth the $$.,"We ordered food tonight and picked it up. We have ordered before and believe me it was very clean or my husband would never let me order again. We had the Olympia (Spanakopita) pie. It was delicious, not greasy and we will be ordering it again The lamb Gyros are delicious as well as the Sparta Gyro platter. The young lady who answered the phone was polite. We will be ordering again and we come from New Springville.",Greek Fellas
221,"This rating has nothing to do with the food. It is all about the manager not honoring the two for one meals during the week. My two adult kids and I got to the restaurant at 8 o'clock during the week. The website said two for one from 4 to 10 PM. The manager said there is a new menu and the two for one ends at 7 PM. Forgive the pun, but it put a bad taste in our mouth's.",Why does Mgmt charge for use of CC?  No rationale for charging.  Many other FINE restaurants offer 2fers and DO NOT or WOULD NOT charge.  No excuse for this type of business dealings - except?  Never to return!,"Something is very different about the Portobello Cafe. Upon arriving I noticed the Department of Healths rating of ""grade Pending"" which means they are appealing the previous rating which would be a failing B or a C. The people I was with  thought that this meant they were merely awaiting the results of a review. Not so- look it up. They were positive I was wrong, they already drove there and parked and didn't see a problem with the grade pending,  so I went with the flow, against my better judgement. Upon entering, the restaurant was almost empty. In the past, It was almost always full on a Saturday evening at 7:30 but not today. The word was out, that this place wasn't as good as it used to be or the poor health dept rating scared the mass's away.  To my dismay, I didn't enjoy this dinner. The appetizer of Italian egg rolls sucked. The menu describes them as Italian meats in an egg roll shell. They neglected to say the few ""bits"" of Italian meats were in a potato like stuffing and that was in the shell. Misleading and not tasty. The other appetizer of Italian rice balls were tasteless. The wine was misleading. I asked the waiter if they had a Riesling.  He brought us a sweet wine that tasted like cheap champagne. Yes it was a Riesling but he should have told ya that is is a sweet one. Finally, the entree. One party has a chicken and melted cheese dish. He left half. Two of us had the lime infused strip steak. Not too bad but not too good either. The 2 of us left at least 1/4 of the dish. The 4th had the Chilean sea bass. Later that night she felt nauseous. No one asked us if everything was all right. The partially eaten food was a sure sign we weren't thrilled. No one seemed to care or notice. The menu is different from what I remembered. Less fish. No swordfish. No tuna. Just salmon and sea bass. The previous menu of months ago included my  favorite choice for dinner which was a dinner  for 2 with appetizer, entree, desert and a bottle of wine is also off the menu.  Now everything is ala carte. Whoever runs this place or bought this place seems to want to go out of business.  The barely filled restaurant with the so-so food will accomplish this soon I fear. The toper of the night was a 3.95% extra charge for using a credit card. They try to sugarcoat it by saying all the dinner prices are reflective of a cash cost built in to menu price and a CC charge is needed to offset. I say Baloney. It's simply a surcharge. I probably won't be back. Sad because I was a regular.",This is a good solid neighborhood eateryThe food and service are consistently goodAnd you can actually enjoy the meal without being rushed. The noise level is conducive to going with a group you can hear the conversation at your table  and best of all the prices are moderate so you walk out Sated  and financially viableGood choice for lunch or dinner,"Portobello is where my co-workers and I take a yearly lunch trip during the summer. With each passing year, the likelihood of our returning decreases, and I think the most recent trip was the end of our series. Unfortunately, the interior can best be described as grungy. The floor and ceiling look like they have been warped from time and heat/humidity.  I think a turn off when you are out to eat is when the bread basket is put down and a few flies start to appear at the table. I thoroughly enjoyed the bread, so this was a bright spot. The buy one get one menu for lunch contains a nice variety and its hard to beat it for the price offered. I had pasta with broccoli rabe and sausage. The dish was large but was swimming in oil, which made the whole meal greasy. Others had the linguini with clams. The clams are on the smaller side, but again the portion was a nice size. The experience was underwhelming and its a shame because the menu always looks appealing. I feel like this place needs a renovation before I decide to dine here again.","Got there just before 5 PM and immediately were seated.  They recently did a refurbishing of the the dining area.  Quite similar to the prior decor but fresher.  I ordered the Veal Parmigiana with Pasta.   (They start you off with a Salad that you can share It was a good portion, which we happily finished.)  My wife had the Pork Chop which was a big Portion.  Mine was even bigger with the Pasta.  We both thought that our entrees were Very Good/Excellent.  Finished with a made-in-house dessert.  Four freshly made Donuts with a cinnamon coating and Vanilla Ice Cream-Excellent.  We were very satisfied with the meal, and even more satisfied with the check.  At certain hours on certain days they have a 2 for 1 Menu!  Literally we walked out with 2 large meals for the cost of 1!  Will be back!",Portobello Cafe

We ordered the three dips and there were salty and guacamole was brown. Then we ordered some tacos and enchiladas the food was just awful there are no words to describe it. I will not be going to place again.,Food was ok I've had real Mexican food and this is not real Mexican food for sure. Service was horrible OMG. I ordered the shrimp fajitas and it did not come out sizzling hot. Not sure if it was sitting in the back waiting I just don't understand. I asked for a side of the pineapple salsa took her 20 minutes to get it. It wasn't crowded. My fountain drink tasted nasty. I ordered a ginger ale it had a nasty after taste. Then I ordered the raspberry ice tea had the same nasty ass taste. OMG. They must don't clean there soda fountain machines. Nasty ass fucks. Then this heffa had the nerves & try to rush me & drop the check on my table. My waiter was so busy kissing those ppl ass the table next to me I didn't leave her no tip. She got her tip. Need to learn to treat everyone equally. They will never ever see me again that's for sure. I wish the health department would shut them down.,"So, I mainly come to Chevys (mind you, I drive almost an hour away to come here) for the chips and salsa! I'm sure theres some type of magic ingredient they put in there bc its sooo dang good.I love all their appetizers. Mainly the flautas and wings is good, too. Love their sizzling fajitas and elote (not sure if they still have it, though). They also have tres leches for dessert and a bunch of selections for drinks. The staff in this location are nice. Cant say anything bad, at all. I just wish they opened up a Chevys in south Jersey.","I've been to other locations of this brand and they were good.  Nice mix of food options and quick service.  First thing I noticed about this one was that the table was sticky.  Then I was given dirty silverware.  Very... obviously... dirty.  I was hoping the food would be as good as expected.  I wanted to give a better score. Had the chicken and steak tacos. It took less than two minutes from order to tacos on my table, so I question the ""fresh"" claim at the door.  The chicken tacos were soaking wet.  Definitely been sitting in a heater of water for a while.  Very unfortunate representation of the brand.","So we ended up here as a last ditch effort before we went and saw a movie in the same complex.  I guess if you don't have a lot of Mexican food options, and you haven't ever had anything really good, then this is alright I guess.The service itself isn't bad.  Staff was friendly.  We were seated very quickly and food came out in a reasonable amount of time as well.  However the general quality and overall meal itself was sub par given that you are sitting in a restaurant.I had a chicken burrito with rice and other sides.  It wasn't the worst burrito ever, but I would have been happier just going to Chipotle.  Rice was bland, refried beans were meh.  Overall I just left assuming that people that love this place are either drinking at the same time, or just haven't found any really good Mexican food otherwise.  I probably wouldn't come by here again.",Chevys Fresh Mex

Not what I expected...,"Always trust an Asian restaurant with a II or III, right? Multiple chains mean good business. I have never physically been to the establishment but I order on a weekly basis during the work week. They are generous with vegetables and broth portions. Consistent taste. No upset stomachs yet. And I would say that taste is on par with Thanh Hoai in Jersey City.",The best AND cheapest pho in New Jersey. Haven't really tried many other dishes here besides the spring rolls which are also delicious. They also deliver for when you need your pho on the comfort of your own couch,"this place is cute, but rather small. service was ok.the grilled pork chops were pretty juicy and delicious, would recommend getting anything with the pork chops whether that be the pork chops over rice or the grilled pork chop pho. everything is pretty inexpensive so that's nice","Getting something other than Pho at a Vietnamese restaurant is a mistake. At least I learned from my mistake. My friend really wanted Pho and I was not in the mood so I got the lunch sautéed chicken and broccoli with fried rice and it was OK. Not bad but nothing spectacular, a little bland and the fried rice was very oily. My friend also tried a lunch special, the Chicken Sate and it tasted nothing like the normal peanut Satay we were thinking of- mostly bland and oily as well. The chicken Pho on the other hand was delicious and came with extra vegetables like broccoli which I love! The pork spring rolls were also yummy just a little pricey for how small the portion was. A good reminder to stick to whatever the restaurant's specialty dish is.",Binh Duong II
225,"Well, this place is trash and I will NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN. I ordered a Poke Bowl with Nachos and guess what I received DORITOS NACHOS. (Please see picture) - Are you shocked? Yup. I was completely. In all my years ordering a poke bowl, I never received it with disgusting CHIPS. I called to change the order and the woman on the phone kept yelling at me, saying she is going to lose money. She then hung up the phone on me and issued the delivery guy to take ALL OUR FOOD BACK. What trash. I mean, how will we give the REST food back!? We are already eating it. I then called back to explain although she hung up on me, that I wanted an even exchange and they would not answer my call. I have never in my life received this type of treatment from a business. I will NEVER ORDERED from this trash place again. Save your self the energy and don't eat here. There are better places to spend your money.","Ordered a Chicken Teriyaki Dinner and straight to the garbage it went. The chicken tasted gummy and tough, as if; eating cartilage.

226,Absoulty disgusted with this restaurants costumer service . They took a reservation over the phone for 830 and when we got there they said they the closed the kitchen early no phone no nothing ! Absolutely ridiculous we drove 1 hr to go here and this is how the run there business just close and not notify there costumers . Never ever again,"Food ...... terrible, everything was terrible, except the pizza bread wasn't bad but it was cold","My family went there for Mothers Day. 7 of us.  IllTry to sum  up our experience in a few descriptions: my mushrooms were thicker that my veal, my wifes son ordered the lobster. About 5 inches long, the granddaughter had baked clams ( 4 little necks). It was totally pathetic and a complete waste of $60 per person. We were hoping for at least a mealBut we got appetizers. Never going back. I had some hope trying a new place.","Haven't been to Italianissimo in a long while. So went for an early dinner.I started off with Panzerotti and Zucchini-Good.  My wife had the Shrimp Oreganata-Very Good/Excellent.  She then had Linguine with Mussels in a Red Sauce-Very Good/Excellent.  I had Ravioli-Very Good.  Her main course was the Pork Chop with Red Sauce and Mushrooms and  Onions-Very Good.  I had the Veal Parmigiana with Spaghetti-Good. For Dessert She had Pistachio Ice Cream-Very Good/Excellent.  I had the Italian Cheese Cake-Good/Very Good.  Prices are very reasonable for the fixed price menu.  Seating was comfortable, and Service was Very Good/Excellent.  There is a small lot for parking in front of the restaurant.  My wife rates it a 5 and I rate it a 4. I put my rating for this review, but you decide. Is it a 4 or a 5?","Me, my wife and and a neighbor decided to again try Italianissimo on a weekday afternoon.  It was so good the first time we went. We ordered from the Four Course Menu. Very much the same as our first trip. We started with Caesar Salad-Good, and the Mussels-2 relatively large orders-Very Good. All three of us ordered the Cheese Ravioli in a Tomato Sauce. The made-in-house Ravioli was Excellent and the Tomato Sauce was Good/Very Good.  For the main course two of us ordered the Veal Marsala, 2 medallions of Veal in a flavorful Marsala Sauce-Very Good.

227,"If you don't know better you'd give 5 stars. If you've been shopping there for decades you can not. The skill level of some of the workers is way below what it once was. The speed and pride and knowledge are just not the same. Not enough training, watching the clock, only working here part time, who can say? Even the attitude of the cashiers is inconsistent. From warm to cold, even rude. Before the expansion, when the old man was around more, these things would have been corrected instantly.   I have heard whispers about these things for a while which I have ignored. And writing this in hopes that it gets back to the old world family experience it always was,It was one of the last of a dying breed. Please Pastosa don't lose that.","For the 3rd time in a row was given more salad then ordered, therefore, was charged more. The person serving didn't even bother to say the order was over. Because this has happened before and I never said anything I decided to say something was given a lame explanation what an insult. When I order a pound I want a pound NOT a dollar twenty-five OVER.","Well I am bringing the stars down bc I had Pastosa cater a party in my home . I ordered with Vin Jr. Approx 30 sandwiches ( no side condiments ) Penne alla Vodka ( tasted like marinara only) and he talked me into some salad called Salute. I asked him, ""what's in the salad""? He tells me Frisee salad with Apple and oranges. So I agree only to find that this $39 dollar half tray of salad is overloaded with beets!! I am allergic to beets so you can imagine I was so pissed! 2 of my guests were also allergic so I ended throwing the who pan out. That's right, I threw my money in the garbage .. NEVER AGAIN.",Their grilled artichokes are the best. A lot of good fresh foods by the piece.  Friendly staff too. Would definitely recommend.,"Whenever I visit S.I. I stop in for the Seafood Salad, which is so fresh and so good. Today, I also picked up Roasted Garlic & Herb, cheddar cheese spread.  Very good butter.They are a bit on the pricier side.","I go out of my way to visit Pastosa once a month. The Pastosa on New Utrecht Avenue has been in business since 1966, and will probably be in business long after I'm dead. If you go, ask for Dominick. He is an older, diminutive man, who is polite and cheery.  My feeling is that everything that I purchase at Pastosa tastes better here  than every other place that I purchase it at. Cold cuts, Sausage's and Ravioli in particular. Their house Olive oil is excellent as well. Bensonhurst is under rapid fire change, but the store owners are committed to keeping their new neighbors welcome. I think they will love this place as much as I do.",Pastosa Ravioli
228,Pizza wasn't fresh AT ALL. Seating in the middle blows hot air right on top of your head giving you a headache. Cheese sticks were disgusting. Terrible place overall. No napkins,Vegan ice cream was delicious  and deserves five stars.  but when we inquired about the gf pizza or the daiya cheese they said they didn't have any so we were disappointed with the cafe  options,The breads and pitas are to die for. Great place for a snack or light meal. Highly recommend.,"BS""D   I hate to try new restaurants, but the menu looked great--varied and lots of dishes--so I went with some foodie family members. The menu was extensive, including salads, pasta, wraps, pizza and fish. Every dish we ordered was a winner and the service was friendly and good. The warm, enthusiastic owner even offered to make a special middle-Eastern dish for us if we gave her 2 days notice!","The only thing that I really liked about this place was that it was quiet and it had seating available. Unfortunately I only brought a credit card so my friend has to pay for my meal because only he had cash. It's not often that you go to a restaurant that doesn't accept credit cards. I had a lox and cream cheese wrap and an avocado sushi roll with brown rice. I have had the same lox and cream cheese wrap elsewhere and it tasted much better. But it was nice that they have an option to have a whole wheat wrap. The sushi was disgusting and mushy. The rice tasted wet. I hate sushi like that. To me good quality fresh sushi the rice isn't wet and mushy. And to add to that I thought there should have been more avocado in the sushi, and less rice. Plus they charged extra for brown rice, which is not something I am used to paying extra for. They add a 10% gratuity to the bill as well. Not a fan of places who do that. And my friend wanted to leave a tip because he thought he should tip more but the waiter was like that's ok don't bother. That was kind of weird and awkward. ****I think this place's name has changed. My reciept showed this address but listed the business name as ""Sushi Corner"". Pictures on this Yelp account match what the inside of the restaurant looked like.","Maybe I came during a weird time. The lighting was dim, the store had a funky smell to it, and things looked kinda..filthy. Looked like I was more likely to get murdered than get food.At the time there was only two people. I assume one was a sushi chef during his break, and the other was the cashier. The cashier was friendly, and answered my questions well. So, I really DO feel bad about giving a bad review, but...I can't in good consciousness give a good one after going through that atmosphere. (Seriously, and it's not like I came around closing time, it was mid day on a Tuesday)For what it's worth, I did like the ice cream? It was nice and creamy and so on. I went there specifically to get vegan ice cream, and I was hoping they'd be a variety of flavors. But here's the thing, if you want vegan ice cream, you're better off buying it from a supermarket. They have exactly three flavors, vanilla, chocolate, and snickerdoodle. Basically, what you can buy in any supermarket.",Island Cafe
229,"I went to Sunday brunch, which was a couple dollars more than lunch. Good food and BYOB! I loved the sweet and sour chicken, homestyle fried chicken, ginger fish, and veggie chow mei fun. I took a star off because 1) food turnover was slow (not a dealbreaker if you have time to kill because they don't try to push you out the door) and 2) some classic buffet items weren't good - despite other chicken dishes being tasty, the chicken quality was poor in General Tso's and Sesame styles, and the pork potstickers were gross. But who else even does Chinese buffet around these parts? This place is a gem.",In correction with someone's comment....Their are no crab legs during lunch and raw clams....There is a carving station during dinner.   Lunch is less because there is less than dinner...The food is good...1 problem...You have to stand around all the time waiting for them to bring out the crab legs during dinner.,"Good food and good staff except for the pushy waitress that DEMAND you to tip her. Unbelievable. She didn't even care that the meal was paid for!!! So heads up, don't go if you don't have extra money to tip smh..","A dated Chinese American buffets. The staff was very friendly, for $8.99 you can eat unlimited chinese take out food. They have a lot of variety, but I noticed the food was very limited; for example if one dish (Stir fried clam) was finished it would take them awhile to bring it out again. The sushi isn't very fresh, you can tell all of the sushi are pre-made and kept in the fridge. -At the door you would see they have A rating but I noticed they allow pets. One guys was carrying this dog around the buffet. I don't think it was a service dog or emotional support, maybe next time I'll bring a dog too.","Crab Legs, 3 different types, all delicious and surprisingly fresh. The raw bar was not great, the Oysters were a bit dry but hey, this isn't exactly Portland Maine. This is the best Chinese Buffet on the Island, very good quality and prices. I just wish they would offer new recipes, its the same stuff every time I go.","This is a surprise hidden jem!  Was looking for some Chinese food after shopping in Staten Island Mall.. Although is 20 min away from the mall, was hesitant at first with the amount of time to get there.. plus hungry kids in the car.. Finally made up my mind and head over to give it a try.  I don't live in Staten Island.. so is all based on Yelps pop up of nearest Chinese buffet in the area.. The section where they put the foods are not in great space, but they do have many varieties of selections that outshines the ""normal"" buffet foods I had in the past.  The one thing WOW me is they offer many seafood varieties and they have 3 different kinds of crab.. stone crab, dungeness crab and snow crab legs.. mostly buffet restaurant only offer one kind.. max 2.. I am very impressed!!! And all taste super yummy!!!  I was too busy working on my crabs and didn't ge the stomach to try out all their food offerings.. I will definitely be back even though I live in jersey, the other side of the town.. hope next time when I am back, all quality of foods remain the same!  Highly recommend to give a try!!! Especially you love seafood and love crab!!",New China Buffet
230,"We ate here on a Saturday, St Patrick's weekend. It was very busy as we figured it would be. The hostess was very nice and we were seated immediately. But we were never handed a menu and the waiter was very slow, not the greatest service. My mom had the corned beef and cabbage, and the cabbage was under cooked as well as my husband's burger, he had to send back to cook a little more. My burger was okay not the best. The bun was stale and the onions rings were so oily. We won't ever eat here again. The minute I left I felt extremely nauseous and ended up throwing up about 5x when I got home .",Worst meal I've had there. Fried pickles were 6 bux and you maybe had 10 to 15 on the plate. The oil actually hurt my stomach. I'm not going here for a long while. It's unfortunate that restaurants on this island get comfortable with serving shit because no one says anything.,Came with some buddy's for a quick beer last week. Asked the bartender if they have an ipa he said no.But their were cans of Guinness nitro IPA on the wall... Guess he didn't know. It was a Sunday afternoon place was empty got our first beer quick but couldn't get a second round he stayed at the other end of the bar.,Excellent service. Samantha was my waitress and she was honestly a doll! Will definitely go again,"Someone strongly suggested that I go in for a hamburger and fries and boy they must've been drunk when they ordered..No, I don't drink yet I really thought it would be a lot better than a slab of meat thrown on the grill and some undercooked fries.. The place looks nice and they have a decent seating area yet it is a bar opposed to a restaurant so it is partially my fault yet the person who suggested it paid for the bill.

231,"I ordered lamb over rice. The rice had this weird seasoning, and the lamb was way overcooked. It was tough, and I could barely eat it. I ordered through Grubhub, and Grubhub for some reason will not let me leave a review, so I'm leaving it here. I cannot recommend this place. FYI, tzatziki sauce is not white sauce. You would think a halal restaurant would know the differenceResponse to business reply, This customer does not like lamb well done, as lamb is NOT a meat that should ever be cooked well done. It cooks much faster and is leaner than beef, and once over cooked becomes much tougher and harder to chew. I do like tzatziki sauce, but it is Greek and it is not white sauce. The rice I usually get from the halal trucks is very different from the rice I was given. I will call to see what can be done to remedy the situation.","Gyro King is very clean, the folks who work there are very kind and the food is fresh.Reason for the 3 stars? I didn't like the food at all.I am a falafel junkie, falafel on a gyro with lettuce tomatoes white sauce or tahini and I am a happy guy. Unfortunately their falafel and white sauce was not my cup of tea. For some reason which no one could explain why would there be Cilantro in the white sauce or falafel?I detest cilantro and it killed it for me....","Food is pretty good, and prepared fresh.  I usually get the lamb gyro or the lamb over rice.  It's conveniently located on Forest Avenue near a bunch of other stores and there's parking.  The rating would be 5 stars, but the drinks are too small, the staff isn't the nicest, they impose a $15 credit card minimum which is ILLEGAL (by law credit card minimums cannot be higher than $10!), and they don't take AmEx or Discover.",was looking for a good gyro place on the island and finally found it !food is good. service is quick  people are nice. what more do you want ?...oh yeah...the prices are great ! and they deliver. .,From any gyro spot I usually order chicken over rice..... I came here twice and ordered the same thing. They always disappoint. It taste so blahhh. It was rice and chicken with no flavor but covered with white sauce. I feel like the chicken was old. I thought they would be as good as the gyro king in Brooklyn (foster ave or bayridge) but they're just wannabes. Another thing it cost almost 20 for 2 plates. I never usually pay more than 12-13$.

232,"I ordered my meal without Cilantro and Onions because I am allergic to them. My meal came with both and it was clearly stated in the notes which was also on the receipt for my delivery. In addition, my order took over an hour to deliver when I'm down the lane from the restaurant. Customers with allergies beware. Never ordering from here again.","I was so excited to eat here.  Could it be a good authentic Mexican restaurant in Staten Island?  Well, no!  This place is just awful.  We ordered guacamole and got a green guacamole sauce because we didn't ask for it chunky.   When we finally got the ""chunky guacamole"" it was flavorless.  I ordered Huaraches (not even close to being authentic) chorizo and spicy pork. My girlfriend ordered tacos, beef, chicken and spicy pork.  They charged us extra for mixing which was no big deal but everything was tasteless.  The rice and beans lacked salt and the texture of the rice was mushy.  I didn't finish my food which is not my style. It's  a shame that it was so bad, because the place is cute and festive.  I'm not never going back. Just simply bad food.",Had a hair in my food .. and i waited like an hour and ten minutes for a delivery on a tuesday ... like your kidding . Terrible and they charge mucho mucho dinero,"So after my break from La Iguana, I've tried them again a few times. Every time so far, no issues, good customer service, and most important, amazing tasting food. Highly recommend giving them a try.Leaving 1 star off for two reasons, prices are still a bit high compared to other places and it's 2019...they're not on Grubhub, UberEats, etc. so I'm usually ordering for pickup 9/10 times.","I originally had a 5-star review for La Iguana, amazing food, prices, and service; however I'm getting a little sick of the management's attitude problem. I like to think of myself as a regular customer of there's, you could find me ordering from there a few times a week. One of the main dishes I order is the breakfast platter of Chorizo and Eggs, Pico De Gallo, and Red Sauce. The only special request I make is having it prepared Mexican Style with peppers and onions, yet it seems like every time I'm there, I'm charged something different; it could be anywhere from $9.50 to $15. Today I brought this up to the woman behind the counter, who I assume was the manager/owner, and got nothing but hostility. This place is becoming a hit or miss with me lately. Prices went up, yet quality/quantity control of orders and customer service has not improved.I'll be taking a break from La Iguana for a bit.","Cheap, mouth-watering food with great service! I'm addicted to this place, so many great things to try here but I highly recommend the Mexican eggs for breakfast or the Chorizo sandwich for lunch. The eggs come with peppers, rice and beans and they taste amazing at a low price! I usually ask them to add chorizo to this with their red sauce and pico de gallo too, so delicious, flavorful and filling. If you're not a breakfast person though, you can't go wrong with their lunch/dinner options. Nachos, tostadas, sandwiches; anything here will satisfy your palate and your wallet.",La Iguana Azul

They have good service and very friendly delivery people.,In an area with a lot good pizzerias Paesano's holds it's own. I was in the mood for a good Sicilian Pie and was not disappointed. Yum!,"Prime Cracker CrustAs far as pizza style, it is in direct competition with Joe & Pat's . But for Paesano's, other than the lighting accents, you would never guess this is one of the best on Staten Island from walking by. Joe & Pat's has the rotating oven and pretty walls. They've both got great pizza.Excellent cracker crust. Not extremely thin, but still a cracker. If you were to tell God you've made a cracker crust pizza, this is something you'd be proud to present. On top, it's saucy and strong with a cheese that holds it own.

235,"First timer to this establishment. I have say we were disappointed with the food for the prices. The service was outstanding. The staff were friendly and attentive. However, the appetizers and pizza were disappointing- Family style portions were too small and the sauces did not taste fresh. Staten Islanders take their pizza very seriously and I have to say their Margarita pie was too watery making the pizza soggy. 4 stars for the staff!!!","I'm a HUGE fan of the location in bay ridge, Brooklyn. This location I will not be returning to. The staff has an attitude and simple things seemed to be a major inconvenience. My mom got an eggplant parm appetizer and requested very little cheese. The waiter assured her he didn't need to add that bc there was not a lot of cheese. The plate comes filled with cheese. He came to check on us while I had a mouth full of food, I held up my hand to give me a second because I wanted something to go. He was visibly irritated. Again, the request of no ricotta on something was met with an attitude. I asked if it could possibly go on a separate check, but no worries if it couldn't. He said, ""I guess"" and walked away. I realize being part of a wait staff is a very difficult job but this was uncalled for. I felt unwelcome. The food was good the service was garbage. From hostess to waiter. If you're in Brooklyn try the original location which is much smaller, more intimate and much more friendly as a whole.","Came here for dinner on a Saturday evening.I was  surprised at the beautiful decor and set up. 8 big screen TV's to keep you busy. They do not have a a kids menu, so I had to order them chicken fingers and fries. Unfortunately they were burnt to a crisp, so we asked for a new order. They came out again and almost as burned. They couldn't be eaten, there were chewy and gross. Speaking of gross, we had to regular pies, and that were not good. I don't know if it's the coal pizza cooking or what, but it was probably one of the worst pizza I ever ate. The appetizer, which was calamari was cold and soggy. They backed clams were amazing though. The server was very good, if it wasn't for her, I would give this place 1 star. Definitely didn't live up to my expectations. I will never come here again.",the food is so fresh and delicious. large menu. prices are great. the wait staff very attentive.(TED). also home delivery is exceptional.Laura L.,Strong 3. Campania pizza is pretty good. Not amazing but pretty good considering the amount of pizza on Staten Island. I had their margherita pie and wasn't disappointed. The fresh mozzarella was on point but the sauce lacked depth. Maybe a hint of oil or garlic in the sauce would've taken it up a notch.The ambiance here is nice. I'd say they're going for an old school NY look with pictures of frank Sinatra and vintage fixtures throughout. Most importantly it looks fresh and clean here.I probably won't return but I suggest you try them out for yourself!Next!,"This is by far the best restaurant on Staten Island!!!  I had a birthday party for my son and we were a party of 10 on a Saturday night and the quality and the service was perfect as if we were perfection.  Two of our favorites were the shrimp oreganata and the fried calamari.  The seasoning for the shrimp was the best I ever had in a restaurant or even at home.  As for the calamari, it was so tender and the marina sauce tasted like my mom cooked it.  We had family style of fried zucchini, rice balls, apple and pecan salad, fried calamari and shrimp oreganata and everything was delicious.  Our second course just consisted of a few regular pies of the table.  It was great because we were not rushed and everyone who worked there made sure we had everything we needed.  We then had a third course of their special of crabs and macaroni (excellent) and linguine Pescatori whcih not only was delicious but presented so beautiful.  After a little break we went on to have a few of their specialty sandwiches (chicken Napoli and chicken parm) which was also very, very good.  We ended off with espresso and coffee.  It was such a great time because not only was the food EXCELLENT but the service was beyond excellent.  Our main server was Theresa and she is warm and attentive and made my son's birthday extra special.  The rest of the staff was also very attentive and we could not have asked for a more perfect night.  I have been here many times and it as always been perfection!",Campania Coal Fired Pizza
236,Incredibly slow service -- took an hour and a half to get in and out. Was given dirty dishes. Unpainted plywood along the wall isn't a great look.,"I'm sorry to say I had a very disappointing meal the other night. The wait staff and bartenders are great BUT the food is just not what it used to be.  I had a seafood pasta dish the other night that was very bland.  I don't even think there was salt in it, much less garlic.  My friend had the lamb chops - which we've both had a million times - and she said they were not good.  She had to send them back to be heated thoroughly.  It's sad - this was my neighborhood go-to place for a LONG time.","I will never return to 120 Bay Cafe, formerly Cargo. The food is sub par, the service is far below standard. Waitress was repulsive, and blatantly disrespectful to my mother. Management was out of touch, and the feel of the restaurant is far under developed. They're trying really hard to hold on to the location, however, they won't last. They show no signs of adapting.",Love this place. Nice funky bar Good peeps great music and vibe. Neighborhood gem. Food is always delicious.,"We were wowed from first entering the door. We were greeted by the owner and sat immediately. Our server, Sara, couldn't of been more attentive and friendly. We let her know we were in from out of town and on our honeymoon. She made some great suggestions of things to do and see in the city. The food was insanely good. We've been eating out our entire trip and this is elevated, elevated pub food. We had the crab stuffed shrimp appetizer and it was phenomenal, light and flavorful. Our entrees were even better. The chicken sandwich was perfect, the mashed potatoes were seasoned excellently, according to my wife. I had the jerk wings with a side of Cajun fries and both exceeded my expectations. Infact, that's what I'd say about this place, it exceeded our expectations throughout our experience.","You will scarcely find a bar that's home such a wide breadth of people.Here you will find a collection of hipsters, rockers, office workers, elderly Staten Islanders, surly construction workers and that one guy who just talks to almost everyone with an innocent, borderline annoying enthusiasm.The food is great, the door isn't staffed by a roided up goon, the prices are far below any city offering and it's located conveniently by the Manhattan Ferry. You can do a lot worse on a Saturday night than spend it here at this bar.As for myself, I come here for the burgers and the occasional drink while people watching. It's not my style to chat up strangers, but I can say that this place has a great crowd.",120 Bay Cafe
237,Been their twice. First time I had the pulled pork sandwich. It was better than I expected. Had it with mild sauce.Second time I had the rib diner with hot sauce. It was awesome.I owe it to myself to go back for the trifecta and get a chicken.,I wish I didn't drive all the way just because of the reviews. Ordered chicken barbecue and I have to say it was not just cold but it was stale. He didn't even had courtesy to heat up a little at least. Will never go again.,Went here again the other day and Todd is still crushing it with his legendary ribs.  Don't take my word for it.  Try em!!!,"Can't believe this place isn't more popular,  it's hands down the BEST bbq spot around. I usually wont go for bbq spots bc a lot of times they just throw sauce on the meat and thats it. This is a different experience.  Here, the meat is well seasoned and flavorful. You can taste the spices. It tastes even better than it smells, and the aroma of the food catches you as you pull into the lot. It's a pretty unassuming spot, not fancy at all. Then again, the best food spots tend to be simple but damn effective at putting everything into their meals! The Spanish rice is so fresh, this man knows how to use aceitunas and cilantro! The greens are well balanced to where you can taste the Turkey but it doesn't take away from the collards. Prices are solid for what you get: the dinner averages around $13-16 for the meat, 2 sides and a cornbread. Customer service is on point. Todd is the owner and cook. I believe his son is also there. Both are friendly, approachable and willing to answer any questions. Didn't take long for the food at all. I'd say maybe look the menu over before you get there so you have an idea of what you want. And get there before the mac and cheese runs out. Dope spot. Good people. Bangin food. I'll be back!",I was in town visiting from Boston and ate at Rodgers Real BBQ. The food was amazing. I ordered the BBQ chicken meal and it was delicious. I will definitely come here every time I visit New Jersey!,"Been wanting to try this food truck for a little while but hadn't been able to catch it when it's open. However, today was the day!I had the BBQ Chicken, collards and baked beans. I originally wanted Mac and cheese but they were out (insert tears..) deducts star for running out.BBQ Chicken - great sauce, huge portion (not sure the cut), tender and juicy. Could be cooked a tad longer I had a little pink near the bone but that happens. Great amount of sauce on the outside but I could've used a side of sauce because once you dig in, there's lots of meat, not enough sauce to go around. There was an area where the spices seemed to congregate but I ain't mad at it...Collards - mixture of collards and cabbage. Decent flavor, kind of light but it was pleasurable. I think vegetable or canola oil is used and I'm not a big fan. Olive oil might make this side mixture even better.Baked Beans - I begrudgingly took the beans as they were out of Mac and cheese.... The beans are tasty. Slightly too sweet but overall a solid side dish.Here's my biggest gripe, your containers have no separators! I almost had a heart attack when I opened my dish to see baked beans commingling with my collards . I know I'm not the only person that doesn't like their food holding hands.I wish this guy tons of success from one entrepreneur to another but I just would like to see some minor improvements to the food and the containers to which they are housed. Will try again soon.",Rodgers Real BBQ
238,Service was good . Not the cleanest sticky table dirty utensils . Food was freshly prepared and tasty.,"I never been disrespected like this in my whole life. The service was the older women working at the bar. As we were ordering; she just left out of no where. So I just got up and left. This is truly racial stereotyping, and I hope Applebee's manger will do something about this. This isn't right!Living in Staten Island racial profiling is very typical, but this wasn't right at all. This older lady didn't even ask if we wanted anything to drink and if you're going to leave at least say ""excuse me"". I would have said it if you came back. I been to this location a few time but this is truly my last time. Very disappointed, I know Applebee's won't do anything about this but it's just truly upsetting how I was treated.",I'm sitting here waiting for 20 minutes to be served!!! I'm a regular customer who wants the decency to atleast be asked what I want to drink  I'm disgusted and angered and I hope Applebee's realizes they lost their best customer,Went to applebee  at the mall last Tues  night  with my stepdaughter  after a long shopping  spree for school  clothes  shopping  it was a awsome  experience  and great service  by Meghan  she made my experience   so wonderful  that I left applebees so happy  with the whole  time that I was there thank  u Meghan  for the awsome  services that u did,"Come here all the time, all I gotta say is Great burger, great food, great service. I always love to come here!","We decided to come here yesterday when chili's was packed. I came with a party of five four adults and one baby and we managed to get seated in less than five minutes. I am actually very pleased with the selection of food they have available in the 2 for 20 option it is comparable to chili's and I might like them better because they offered fish option which chili's didn't. Unfortunately that is about the only good thing about this restaurant. Our appetizer and food took close to an hour to come out and the spinach and artichoke dip appetizer, the chips itself was bathed in salt. It was so salty we were left speechless that they would serve this to us. They were either really poorly managed or under staffed because an appetizer should never take close to an hour to come out... mozerella sticks and spinach and artichoke dip... really??? I am pretty sure they aren't making he dip on the spot. And if they are they are doing a terrible job with the chips. Our waiter was quite forgetful as well he forgot the cup of water for the baby and we had to remind him a few times just for water. My tilapia was charred to the point where all I tasted was burnt, my friend who ordered the same dish as me managed to get a better piece and had meat on her fish. We also really wanted dessert but he told us it would be a 15-20 minute wait and the baby was getting restless so we passed on it and just asked for the bill. On a good day I can see this place being better than chili's, my friends sister got the chicken and pasta and she said it was delicious, however I didn't have the fortune of coming on a good day so minus one star for the food, minus one star for the service and minus one star for the long wait",Applebee's Grill + Bar
239,"Food was good and I called to see what time the lunch specials end and the man who answered the phone called me ""fucking stupid"" never eating at this establishment ever again. What worker calls you fucking stupid when you are paying them money to make food?.","The Best Chinese food on staten island.l have moved ,but when in NYC l stop in.The food is on the money",First of all the restaurant was empty there was one table with 10 people they sat me 2 feet away from this table.  It was so loud I was able to listen to their whole conversations.  I started getting an earache the people were drinking and loud.  Then a party of 4 came in it consisted of 2 small children they sat them in the booth right behind me that added to the discomfort.  The children where jumping and kicking.  And again having to listen to their conversation.  Why do they pack people in in one corner like cattle when the place is empty.  The chicken and vegetable was  very salty.  It was the worst dinning experience of my life.,"Had wonton soup, egg roll, Cantonese mei fun, and shrimp with broccoli.  All were excellent.",Excellent food the waters are very nice.Nice atmosphere never grip about tips.Prices are res enable.Good selection very authentic Chinatown style.Service is excellent.,Very affordable and delicious food.

240,"The quantity of food is a lot but the quality is not up to par.uncooked cod,Dry turkey etc. I will spend my money elsewhere","Food is decent but they charge $2 per plate to do take out AND they don't indicate in on the online menu (even specifically the takeout menu). A little ridiculous, I unfortunately will not be back and neither will my coworkers.","Food was not bad, but the service was horrible! The dishes were dirty and my wife found a butter wrapper floating in her soup. When the server was shown, she shrugged her shoulders, grabbed the bowl, and walked off. No attempt to rectify the situation or apologize. The entire table was out of water/drinks for over 10 minutes while she sat and talked to the owners daughter instead of serving guest. This was my first and last time at this establishment!",Everytime I have come here over the years I had a great experience. Andrew and his son are the nicest folks. I will always stop by here when I am in town.

241,"I'm usually very happy with everything I get from here...until today. I order a grilled chicken Caesar salad frequently, but when I saw what they gave me I was greatly disappointed. It was a very little amount!! When I asked why, the cashier said it was because they are not serving romaine lettuce. I get it, we are in a romaine lettuce crisis. Thanks for looking out in regards to that. However, the size of this one was just shocking, the grilled chicken was hard and crunchy, and who knew broken pretzel pieces were the equivalent of croutons?! I could go to a place farther up Forest Ave and get more bang for my buck (and I paid 9.00 and change for this thing)So, that is what I will be doing moving forward.",don't see what the hype is about this place is. food is way too expensive for how little they put in your meal. it's just disappointing. i'll stick with going across the street for anything i want unless it's a salad.,True 5 Star New York Borough Grocery Market Deli on that Corner.#YouFoundITPlace#ThanksLeo,"I love this sandwich shop. For a while I've been dying to get here and try their #6 which is fried eggs, cheddar, bacon, avocado, caramelized onions and mayo. I can't even stress enough how delicious it is. I also had the chorizo, eggs and cheese on a roll. It was good but I wasn't as wowed as the #6. The menu is quite extensive for breakfast and lunch, definitely coming back to hit up their lunch menu. The girl behind the counter is so sweet and helpful. All the customers who walk in are warmly greeted by her and seemed to be regulars. Prices are reasonable, I highly recommend taking a stop in.","After a failed attempt at getting a salad from Better (ironic name), hiked it over to Leo's for the first time because waiting 30 minutes for a salad made me even more hungry! Happy to say that Leo's was quick and the staff are nice. It's a no frills deli, but holy cannoli were they getting so many food orders over the phone. Got the dubois salad- substituted chicken cutlet with grilled chicken. Has tomatoes and cucumbers as well with balsamic dressing.",The food was amazing I had the Emma sandwich the lady who served us was so nice she made our experience there one to remember,Leo's Deli Sandwich Shop
242,"The food was dank.  Not hipster good dank.. rather the dank that leaves a nasty taste in the back of your throat that gets even more dank with each successive burp.  On the bright side, the tap water was clean and the chips and salsa were good.  The Caesar salad tasted like it came right out of a plastic bag.  The seafood in the paella had a dank fishy aftertaste.  The coffee was ok.","The food here is terrible. We went today and the rice looked like rice-a-roni  and tasted like it too. Everything was bland.  the enchilada and tacos were also bad, We hardly touched it.  My 16y old daughter even said it tasted like it came out of a box and a freezer before I even made any comments to her. When We told the staff we didn't want to wrap anything up it's almost like the waiter/manager knew the food was bad and didn't hesitate or ask any questions. They did however reduce our bill significantly and we only paid for drinks.  Better than $70 for boxed garbage.",We went here for the first time last Sunday. The food has no flavor. The only thing that was good was the jalapeño poppers and that's because they are out of a box. Don't waste your money.,"Haven't been here in years and I don't know why.  Food is pretty good and the give you very generous sizes. Shared a pitcher of sangria with the hubby. Sangria is nice because it's not too sweet. I had the seafood paella which is mostly in my fridge right now simply bc I was full Mixed feelings on the paella... good, but I've had better. Very filling especially after the chips with salsa which had a nice spice to it. And like I said generous portions. Inexpensive also. I'd definitely give it another try soon.","I've lived on Staten Island for almost 14 years and I'm questioning myself why haven't I been here sooner? I found a Groupon from local flavor so I figured I would give them a shot and boy I am happy! Let me start off with the staff, how dang cute, attentive and considerate are they?! I wanted to hug them, these guys are so sweet. Kudos to the staff. Now onto the food. The staff should have cut me off but kept bringing me salsa and chips which are delicious and so fresh. This is the real deal authentic Mexican style food. I had the #5 and my hubs had the #1. The portions are huge (hence why I should have been cut off with the chips). You start with a salad as well, so I was super stuffed mid way through my meal. For how much food you get the price is worth it. With your entree you get rice and beans and a potato (not sure what they were called but oh so good).I would definitely return as many of their customers do it seems. The 2 couples who walked in after us the staff seemed to know pretty well which I love. Gives you that feel good family vibe.",This place is consistently good as far as 20 yearsAgo when my family always come here to dine... I had their sangria which is still by far the BEST anywhere!  I'm going to bring my team here for dinner/team meeting this week!,La Candela Espanola
243,"some friends we are all in our mid 20s and there was a small line in front of us the group looked to be in their 40s two members of the group ahead had sneakers on and got in no problem we approach the door to get in and the bouncer says to one of my friends sorry pal you're not getting in with sneakers on, we asked why you let those people in with sneakers and that fat fucking slob of a bouncer smoking a cig laughed and closed the door maybe they don't like a young crowd? Anyway stay away from this shit hole hope they go out of business soon","Place doesn't know what it is. The food is not good. I would prefer if the entire menu was overhauled due to the fact that the name is misleading, the decor is substandard and it's really overpriced.","This is not a restaurant, this is a night club. There was hardly anyone eating. The music was blasting and the bar was full. The menu is very limited and the food was not good at all.  We ordered appetizers and our meals. The waiter brought everything out at the same time. It took long considering there was only 3 tables for dinner. When he brought the food, the appetizers were cold. My daughter had shoe string potatoes. I tried one and it was cold and hard; probably from sitting for so long and previously frozen. The prices are very high. I wish we never chose this place. It was so much better when it was Buddha Lounge. Then to top it all off; the waiter spilled a bowl of marinara sauce all over the table. It hit the floor and was all over my husbands shoe. Horrible service and meal.","A little confused at the theme as it serves Italian food and sushi but hey it's Staten Island so it works! Nevertheless, the food was good and so was service. Not too many veggie and vegan options, which is why I am giving it a three- a restaurant should be able to accommodate all diets. Nice interior and rooftop seating- but view of the parking lot isn't that great. Overall good food good service good atmosphere.","Came here for a private party on a weekend. If you follow them on Instagram, you know that Mr. Ciao is a city type of venue placed at the end of Staten Island... a much needed party and dinner space that the suburbs can definitely use more of. I was excited to try it out.The party space was held upstairs. You'll walk in, head to the elevator, and go upstairs to actually get to the venue space. Once the doors open, you're basically in an upscale lounge with the signature mustache adorning the wall. The space is chic and the bar area is spacious, but I'm not sure how this works at night because the tables with seating are in the next room, where the main party I went to was held.The food was... interesting. First, there was a sushi bar with a lot of different rolls to choose from. The sushi was good but not great. Just takeout quality sushi, but tasty. I'll say that the spicy tuna wasn't an appetizing color though so I passed on that. We were served a variety of other apps - grilled chicken skewers (literally grilled chicken strips on a stick) with peanut sauce (this wasn't anything special), lamb chops, rice balls, and then egg rolls. The food here is kind of all over the place when it comes to cuisine type because they're doing their best to fuse Italian cuisine with Asian flavors. The idea is good, but in practice, it's really kinda weird.The main buffet had a large selection... cauliflower fried ""rice"" I believe, and then a bunch of other Italian selections. My palate was like 'wth' because I was going from tomato sauce to soy sauce. Again, like I said, the food selection is really all over the place.I think it's a great party space but I wouldn't just pop in for a dinner like this on a regular night... just because I wouldn't even know what to order. Would I want Italian? Would I want sushi? Why would I want to mix the 2?With that being said, I just saw on their Instagram that they will be introducing more Italian items to the menu. If they're moving towards one cuisine only, I think they're on the right track.Parking is easy since there is a lot attached. The staff was also friendly. Overall I think this place has potential.","I recently had my engagement party at Mr. Ciao and it truly exceeded all expectations. When I envisioned the type of party I wanted, I knew I wanted something different. I wanted a daytime celebration and didn't want a mini wedding at a venue with a DJ and dancing, but I also didn't want it to feel like I was just taking 87 people out to a boring dinner. Mr. Ciao really made my vision come to life! First off, the place is absolutely stunning. Every guest who walked in was in awe and couldn't stop raving about how gorgeous it was. It's really unlike any other place on Staten Island. I loved how everyone was still able to mingle between the dining room, the bar area, and the outdoor terrace. And this place makes for really beautiful photos! We did a buffet style lunch/dinner. Honestly, I never expect buffet style food to be all that great when I go anywhere. So I was really surprised when the food was so phenomenal. The line for seconds was almost as long as when everyone was initially called! Everyone kept talking about how great the food was, especially the skirt steak and eggplant rollatini. The chocolate cake with cannoli cream was also one of the best I've ever had! I really want to thank Steve and his staff for making our day so amazing. He went above and beyond to accommodate every request, no matter how big or small. We were initially supposed to be a smaller group and when I was in a panic that we had so many extra people at the last minute, he simply rearranged the dining room with narrower tables and beautiful silver banquet chairs that fit everyone so comfortably and looked even more stunning than I had originally planned. He even let me deliver a massive donut wall in advance because we had so much stuff to set up. Steve was such a pleasure to work with and always so responsive any time I had questions or concerns. Steve and his staff really took care of absolutely everything. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to host a private event. From the gorgeous modern & chic decor, the delicious food, the amazing customer service, to even the fun/trendy music playing in the background, Mr. Ciao will transform your event to a truly over the top celebration that will impress all of your guests!",Mr. Ciao

But hey, at least they added the cheese.Pasta was lacklusterSandwiches are damn good tho.Idt I'll be back, even for a $16 sandwich",Gave it another try. Ordered a fried eggplant sandwich and it came ice cold? I just don't understand why this place has trouble making decent vegetarian sandwiches,"I used to love Filoncino and come all the time the girls, sandwiches and old manager were worth the prices but it's gone completely down the drain with its lack of management the only thing that held that store together was the original girls and even the cooks. not surprised their all gone, I don't know how they deal with the owners throwing them to the wolves. No consistency with 30 different menus printed in 3 pt font literally a joke and impossible to read, the cooks can't get their act together, zero costumer service they don't accommodate anyone for anything, just a money hungry owner who literally charges you for grated cheese for your pasta! I'd say go to Royal Crown but at this point I'd rather give someone else my money. They are probably gonna charge 22 cents extra for this review.",Very good food good service and friendly staffAnother good place for Royal Crown.Not sure why not same name.Food quality is just as good,"Vegans REJOICE!  The authenticity and perfection only a Staten Island Italian bakery can offer, prepared in the kindest way possible: sans animal products.  A generous variety of both savory and sweet vegan options.  The grasshopper sandwich was incredible, served on crusty and hearty Italian bread.  I brought home treats for dessert: an apple crumble hand pie, a rainbow cookie, and a yoddle.  All vegan.  All out of this world.  Would return absolutely!","Second time I've been here and I've been let down for two different reasons. The first time being I was given completely black avocados on my sandwich. This time because I paid $15 for the skimpiest sandwich of my life. I understand nuts, avocados, vegan cream cheese, etc can be expensive ingredients, however, I was given two measly chunks of avocado and two measly slivers of eggplant. The bread was good I guess...it was essentially the entire sandwich lol.",Filoncino
245,"Stopped here on the way to compete in a Spartan Race at the West Point Military Academy in NY.  The Fried Chicken was Crazy good.  So good, we finished our meal and an extra order to go.Super crispy and seasoned just right. Not greasy !","Went for a late night meal here after a movie at Jersey Gardens. It's definitely a convenient location as it's right off of 1&9. It's close to Newark airport and Jersey Gardens mall/cinema. They have halal food available but their fried chicken didn't taste that well. It was dry and didn't seem that fresh. Basing off the other reviews, it might be I had a bad experience but my friends didn't care much for the pizza they tried either. Go down another 10-15 minutes and try the fried chicken in Jersey city if you are looking for halal fried chicken.","I had the Gyro platter. A good value at 10 bucks, includes a can of soda. The lamb in the platter was good, the rice was good, but the salad had no dressing and none was put in the bag and no tzazaki sauce. But they did put catchup and hot sauce in the bag??? By the time I got back to the hotel room and discovered the error, it was too late to do anything about it.","Based on Yelp reviews decided to try the food. I must admit, I was not disappointed. Philly cheesesteak, Gyro sandwich and wings were made to perfection. Will try other items on the menu soon. It's a 24 hour opened location though right off route 1 and 9 and parking is available in the rear.","This is the best late night food spot in the Elizabeth area! Don't go to Banana Kings or Sonics when you can grab a fresh slice of pizza, fries, and a coke for less than $6 here! Conveniently located next to Barcode off route 21. Gas station right across the street and parking available! My only complaint was that the restrooms were not the cleanest, but what restroom is after midnight?!?","The Gyro Platter portion size is HUGE! I ate off of it twice. The fried chicken is good and I loved the hot wings. The hot wings have a nice amount of heat to them. They came with a huge portion size of French fries cooked to perfection. Be sure to get a lot of the Tzatziki sauce(it's free) for your gyro platter. It comes with a lot of salad, so you may want some salt & pepper too. They even offer hot sauce as well for your chicken. All in all, it's good food! Pay attention in the restaurant though if there's a lot of people, because people stand all over even if they've already ordered. So ask people if they have ordered already or are waiting so that you don't get skipped in line. Just pay attention for your order to be called because it gets a little hectic in there when it's busy.",New York Fried Chicken & Pizza
246,"We made our first weekend visit there Sunday.  Unfortunately, the rain closed the deck and the inside was packed and very, very loud. The weekend menu is much more extensive. The roast chicken, arroz con pollo and fish in yellow pepper sauce were big hits and the coriander rice, french fries and calamari were great sides. prices and portions were good.Sadly, there were serious service issues--the appetizer came out with the mains, one entree arrived 15 minutes after the others and the busboy, after nodding his head when I said we wanted to take the leftovers home, threw them out and the replacement we were given was less than half of what was thrown out. The staff is very nice but not fluent in English.","This small, plain Peruvian place wowed us on our first visit: the rotisserie chicken and accompanying salad were scrumptious, large and very reasonably priced.  It is BYO and has outdoor seating in good weather.Our waitress spoke only Spanish (another employee spoke English), but was very attentive and sweet.Only negative: the only water they offer is in a plastic bottle and not free.I look forward to trying other items on their Peruvian menu.",Servers do not speak any English but we managed to work through the menu and the food was excellent.

247,"It was mediocre, but only worth two stars. I had to get the bartenders attention just to get another drink, more than one time.They had a sign proclaiming 16oz beer for $4. I was given a 12oz bottle. The taocs were sloppy, broken moist shell after first bite.",Horrible service order 2 drinks 2 orders of fire and 2 orders of wings during happy hour and it was just my husband and I and the nerve of them charging me 20% gratuity on the bill saying 5 ppl /after 10.,Went to this dive on  Wednesday night for happy hour the drinks SUCKED not to mention they took for  ever when ordered food that took about 45 min ohh did i mention the place was empty then the bar lady over charged us never again Today on April 1 2019 i tried this place once again. So now this dump charges 20 percent  to your bill for gratuity when you have to get up order your food and also charge for carrots and celery extra as well for any sauces this place has gone down hill in more ways then i can image..,"This review for the dining service only: my family enjoyed it. The service was excellent and all waiters/bus boys were kind and attentive. It's a fun atmosphere and my kids like ordering the 3 tacos. I usually order the grilled chicken burrito and it's always been fresh and tasty. On top of all this, the food is definitely reasonably priced. My wife orders the margaritas and kicks back. Burrito Bar has been on Forest Ave forever....not sure if they're under new ownership (or not) but I'm recommending it.","The food was good and our waitress was wonderful BUT the reason I'm giving this place one star is because my chair cushion had a rusty nail exposed and nicked me in my left leg and snagged my brand new pants. I didn't notice until I felt a sharp pain in my leg. I alerted the gentleman who appeared to be the manager and staff and all he said was I'm so sorry and took the chair away. I also emailed the owner who did not get back to me. This could be an extremely serious issue. I may have to go and get a tetanus shot and I had to spend money to buy the same pair of pants again because of all the snags. God forbid a child had sat in that chair! The best I got was a ""I'm so sorry."" I just wanted to let you know how poorly the situation was handled in my opinion.","Came here on a Friday in hopes of a chill happy hour. Didn't get he happy hour prices but definitely stumbled upon one of my new favorite Mexican spots! We started off with drinks. I had the raspberry frozen margarita and my bf had the Brazilian. Very good strong drinks! They provided chips and salsa for free which was very good! The salsa was poppin! The chicken mini chimis were to die for! They came in a cute tostada basket filled with guac and sour cream and they were literal perfection! So flavorful!I had the fish tacos which were hearty, and decent. A little on the dry side but good w the salsa. My bf had the carnitas burrito and it was massive and delicious. The vibe was great! Chill, tropical with plenty of space outside both at the bar area and the dining area! I will def be coming back!",Burrito Bar
248,"This place is terrible, Frank the owner attempts to switch pricing on parties after your locked in.",WARNING - this place is terrible. Shady owner Frank changes agreed upon pricing. Tried to charge full price for children even after meeting minimum headcount. Do not make the same mistake I did and ignore all the negative warnings. Promised to toss in desserts and antipasto which were never received.,This was ok not the best in Staten Island. After a few times visited for birthdays the taste is the same the chicken was hard and the breadcrumb tasted like it was fried in old oil.,"This restaurant s very gd in every possible way .The appetizers were delicious n fresh n well presented ( which a a pet peeve of mine ""persentation"") the drinks were on point from cocktails to wine main entrees were cooked n seasoned to perfection from New York skirt steak to seafood for dialovo  not one complaint in a party of six w in a very diverse age group ,servings were plentiful even for those w huge appetites. Spotless from top to bottom while small s very accommodating from large parties to romantic dinners . Definitely a place to visit if looking for a very gd Italian dinner w family r friends","Came for Easter dinner with a 4:00 reservation for 6.  While waiting for the 2nd 1/2 of our party, I attempted to order drinks. . That was a no... the whole party arrived by 4:07, didn't get to order my cocktail til 4:26... received @ 4:42... ordered 3 apps & a salad (all delicious), received by 5:08.. by 5:47, after table was cleared and the conversation between us had lulled...  still no entrees.   Finally, as we thought we were never eating, asked for the check.  We were all annoyed & ready to go.  They started bringing our food (AFTER I ASKED FOR THE CHECK), we declined it all and got a bill for everything.  After a bit of debate and being told ""it's a holiday & we are busy""...  I finally received the bill with just what we ordered... Beyond annoyed doesn't even begin to describe our 1st eating out holiday experience.   We have all done this restaurant before & enjoyed it.  The wait staff was overwhelmed & I don't blame them at all.  The service was terrible, and waiting an hour for an entree is unacceptable.   I'll find a new place to go.  Staten Island has a million restaurants,  and this one, never again.","DO NOT BOOK YOUR PARTY HERE. I've never written a review but I now feel compelled to - I've never seen someone try to take advantage of a customer like this. Had a party there recently. Staff there was great, I booked the party with the staff, not the owner. If I would've met FRANK the owner previousy I would have never booked. Received a ""contract"" 4 days prior to the party, not when I originally booked and this contract had an inflated number of guests I had to guarantee, not the original amount I agreed to. Frank is a liar, becareful. He charged for the 5 extra guests that did not meet this ""guarantee"" - even though days earlier I mentioned it was not what I agreed to. Secondly, guests were made to feel like they had to leave early so that they could prepare for the next party. Paid for a 4 hour party, after 3 hours tables were beginning to be cleared. Again, staff was great, not the owner. I will NEVER visit this establishment again, I suggest you be very weary while dealing with him.I should've read the previous posts prior to booking this party. Apparently this has happened with Frank the owner on other occassions. Charging for 5 extra guests that was never agreed to and adding beer/wine/soda/sangria charge on top. This guy is a real piece of work. Also, read other reviews about trying to move guests our early.",Cielo Restaurant
249,"I bought a salad from the today only to get home and start eating it and see a bug inside of it. I called them and  GG the manager was very nice in trying to fix the problem. She gave me an order of mushrooms and the bruschetta to replace the salad. I get home to eat that and the toast is burnt smh. At this point I'm over it and highly disappointed. I didn't even bother calling them about it because I wasn't driving back to Bayonne AGAIN, just to be disappointed a third time.","This place has horrible service. Don't go there specially if you have children. You can not sit at the bar if you have small children and you can not enjoy happy hour at the restaurant!  Waiter was completely clueless and rude, manager didn't care that we left instead of accommodating us. Terrible experience, will not be back!",I just ordered a sprite from this restaurant and they have the audacity to give me a dirty cup.,"I love this Houlihans location bc the environment makes it a really fun happy hour spot. The bar area is always lively during HH which is rare among other bars in Bayonne, and their HH food specials are great! The service can be a little slow at times but it's definitely worth the atmosphere, especially if you enjoy getting a drink after work alone or taking yourself out to eat in your own.","The service is consistently pleasant, the food is good or what is expected from chain restaurants. The drinks are a little on the weak side. They have a small outdoor area which is pleasant on a nice day.","This Houlihan's is in a strip mall with a ton of stores, so it's a great option for a quick and easy lunch while running errands. It's also a great opportunity for my husband to have a beer before I make him go to Home Goods with me for 2 hours. Ah... bribery at its finest. I'm a big fan of their french onion soup - a bowl is pretty large and fairly priced at 5 dollars. I also enjoyed a plate of buffalo chicken tenders - crispy, doused in lots of tangy sauce and served with a side of fries. Yum yum. Not a gourmet meal, but a perfectly fine spot to grab some classics like wings, burgers and fries. If you are feeling crazy they also have tropical group drinks. Maybe next time!",Houlihan's
250,"Don't pass this local spot up. CHARCOAL burgers, buffalo wings and craft beer. I consider myself lucky to be within walking distance.  No more downtown JC for burgers when this gem is so close.","They are obnoxious about last call. They yelled ""last call"" and we went up to the bar, made us wait to order our last round of drinks and then denied our order because we were too late... Then they yell for you to leave, obnoxiously loud, repeatedly. We've come here multiple times and it's always the same. They don't show much courtesy to loyal customers.",The grilled chicken wings and cheese fries are to die for! Their kitchen is open till 2-3am. They rock!,Great bar with wonderful service and delicious bar type foods.I love the triple threat burger and the wings.All so delicious and wonderfully made by the kitchen.The atmosphere is right up my alley!The beer selections are varied and there are tons of options for the spirits they carry.,"Lot 13 is a great bar to come to in Bayonne.  The food is really good here. I really enjoy their wings, fried pickles,  burgers, and pizzas.  The wings are my favorite.  They offer many sauce flavors for your wings and even a grilled option.  For drinks,  they have an excellent beer selection.  The best in town.  So many different beers on draft and in bottles. And they charge a fair price.  Their mixed drinks are cheap too and always come out great.  Another thing I like about lot 13 is they have a nice back section with games, a pool table, and darts.  Very fun to play these things while drinking with friends. Certain Friday or Saturday nights, they also have live music performances, which is awesome.  From great food, to great beers, and great music, lot 13 is a must go to in Bayonne on a weekend night.","A diamond in the rough (if you're cool). Walked in, The Smiths were playing, ordered a drink poured strong, amazing bartender named Rich, jukebox full of punk rock music, had some great food (the Lot 13 burger was amazing). This may be a typical in Brooklyn but not in Bayonne, NJ. Oh and taxidermy and a merman at the bar. My favorite things: booze, burgers, taxidermy, mermen. Perfect 10",Lot 13
251,"i was not impressed.  i like the idea of using spring mix lettuce rather than iceberg but cutting my pita bread to half its size than over stuffing it with chopped lamb meat, lettuce and tomato (if you can call it that) was a no go for me.  way too much garlic in the white sauce too so i wont be wasting my trips to seaside.","I should preface this by saying that I was in a bad mood when I went to this restaurant. The service was decent, and any perceived issues I had were probably due to my crappy mood. The maza plate was good. I got a neopolitan pizza and it was extremely bland. The cheese was absolutely tasteless and the sauce was weirdly sweet. I would not get that again. I think some of their actual Turkish dishes would be better.",Cook at grill uses no gloves. Last time I visit here!  Not cool...don't worry. As he sweats over the fire it's going into your food. Will never set foot in there again.,"Finally real Turkish restaurant in the island. New ownership has been good so far. There is a lot improvements with the food and interior design. They have good amount of Turkish alcoholic drinks. I really liked their lahmacun. I used to go Paterson for lahmacun, now no more toll to pay for good food. Definitely will go again.",Never again I used to eat always in this place was amazing Today will be my last for sure Food delay to much I ordered lamb mixed grill came cold and order lamb ali was the worest i cant touch it after first bit,Went for the first time Saturday and This is my new favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Staten Island! Will definitely be a regular here,Seaside Turkish Restaurant
252,"Walked in to see what the specials of the day were. As the woman behind the corner was showing me the specials, I saw a roach walking along the corner between the food. Yup, I walked out.","I happen to love oxtail and there aren't many places you can find it in Bayonne so I have been getting it from Mojito Tropical (for several years now.) Unfortunately though, the quality of the oxtail meat is hit or miss i.e. many times it has not been tender meat but quite tough. Too bad because the actual flavor is always good.",I came in here with my friend and everything was good except for the lady working there such a bad attitude. Today I ordered a picadillo and it was the most disgusting thing I ever had the ground beef tasted old. Like it was sitting there for weeks. The papa rellena was delicious til I got to the ground beef which also tasted old and disgusting. Yuck never coming here again.,"I moved here from Miami a few weeks back and was found myself in NJ craving some Cuban food. The pictures had me sold and I'm glad I took a chance on this place! I got my tried and true lunch special with grilled chicken, rice & beans, and added a small side of sweet plantains. The rice and beans were excellent and seasoned well. The chicken was bone-in and perfectly crispy on the outside while remaining tender on the inside. The sweet plantains were also very tasty! I capped off my delicious meal with a cortadito to go. The coffee was a little weak for my taste, dropping the rating down just a bit. Overall, this place is amazing! Great food, huge portions, and friendly service. I will definitely be back next time I'm in town.","Given I previously lived in what once was a predominately Cuban community, I was missing the various options for local Cuban food since moving to Bayonne.  Although I don't know if the cooks are Cuban and highly doubt it, they have nonetheless done a decent job of executing Cuban food.The Cuban sandwich was on point.   Pork was moist, bread was well toasted and the sandwich tasted fresh.The ropa vieja sandwich was flavorful and again the bread was well toasted just how I like it.  They did add mayo to the sandwich and thankfully I like mayo but that is NOT typical of a ropa vieja sandwich and I could do without it.I was also relieved to find materva and ironbeer! Yay!What is a Cuban sandwich without either soft drink? Blasphemy! *Pictures added to review.It's a shame they don't make mariquitas as I was really in a mood for those but we had tostones which were fried to perfection and the mojo garlic sauce was on the thick side but absolutely delicious.  They did forget the tostones but were able to fry and serve before we were were completely finished eating our sandwiches.   The place was empty but they were clearly busy preparing delivery orders.  The next time, I might be inclined to repeat my order in hopes that everything is brought out at once.The service, although a bit slow, was very pleasant.   Both women working last night were attentive and very charming.I will definitely be visiting again and trying other items on the menu!**Edited to say that I ordered for delivery and the order took over an hour and the food was cold by the time it was delivered!  After that I went back again in person and ate in AGAIN and that is definitely the way to go.  It still took a bit to get served but at least the food was HOT!",Walked in to grab some lunch. Wasn't sure what to expect exactly. Turned out the food was very good!I had the pan seared chicken special with yellow rice. Lots of flavor and very filling! Great price too!,Mojito Tropical Grill Cafe Restaurant
253,"I came in here today for lunch, my husband and I were seated, given menus, standard restaurant practices. I ordered the Green Curry lunch, my husband ordered the Garlic chicken lunch. We received our food rather quickly it was also piping hot- I made conversation with my husband about the news while waiting for my food to cool down. About 20 minutes into the meal, the host comes by and asks if we are done. I tell her ""No we are not"" I waited a bit more for my food to cool so I basically stuffed all my lunch into my mouth to avoid any more interaction with this girl. The restaurant was empty, there was no one else being serviced. Why were we rushed? I have a feeling the owners of this restaurant also manages the nail salon a block away. Stop rushing people who are giving you business! If she had been more polite the tip I gave her would've been larger. But to teach her a lesson in hospitality I gave her a significantly lesser tip.",Very poor customer service today.  They didn't have a children's menu and wouldn't even make the smallest attempt to provide plain noodles for my 3 year old child. The waitress didn't even attempt to make her chicken tempura. I would have gone above and beyond to provide food for a child.  Especially a paying customers child.,"This rating is primarily for their carelessness with food allergies. My wife and I ordered from here in the past and had overlooked the high prices and long delivery times, due to the fact that it was on Seamless/Grubhub and the food was good. There was also a period of time where the delivery guy would call when he arrived and angrily explain that he was parked in the road and I had to come down to come outside and get the food. After I had tipped. But I digress. We placed an order on Grubhub last week and wrote in the ""Special Instructions"" area that I had extremely severe allergies to sesame seeds and to please make sure none of the food/sushi we had ordered contained any. I wrote part of the request in all caps with multiple exclamation points to try to make it apparent. After eating a few rolls I looked down and saw that the spicy scallops rolls we ordered were covered in sesame seeds. I called and tried to explain my predicament and was met by only was can be explained as extreme apathy. I would really expect an establishment that sent someone to the ER by their carelessness of food preparation in relation to food allergies to be more sympathetic, but it is appallingly laughable how the situation was handled. TLDR: Sociopathic customer service, non-existent food allergy considered and will NEVER order here again unless I want to die.","Food is great, management is clueless and website downright SUCKS! They want you to order online so they give you a 5% discount which is the discount code printed on the menu without any spaces. Does it work...NO! Right at the top of the rolls menu it states that soybean wrappers are 1$ more (a rip off to be sure) but there is no option to select a soybean wrapper so you type in special instructions ""soybean wrapper"" and boom, they call you to add the extra 1$ to your credit card. The menu also states that delivery is a minimum order of $10, so does the website but nope, not so much. You go through the entire order process and then they hit you with a $15 minimum. When you get good and fed up and call, they know nothing about the website. I'll be ordering from Kyoto from now on!","My favorite sushi ever ! Love their lunch special, sushi is always fresh, and during lunch time they are so quick with delivery.","The folks here and their service is great! I've found them to be very friendly and attentive. Personally, I don't come here for their sushi, but rather Pad See Yu and Pad Kee Mao. Pad Thai is everywhere, but not the aforementioned dishes. Pad See Yu and Kee Mao use wider noodles and I feel the flavor is really absorbed by the wider noodles. Anyways, I think they make them very well :)I also like them extra spicy",3 Guys Sushi
254,"I feel very conflicted about giving this review because of the three stars. The food was very filling and delicious- I had a chicken dish and rice. The reason for the 3 stars is below: The mint chutney we were given tasted a little off. I asked my friend to try it since he's had more experience with Indian food. He tried it and agreed with me- interestingly, when he was stirring it, the chutney was bubbling up. I called the server over and said that it tasted bad and that they should check on the batch. She first wasn't sure what I said, but I had motioned over to the chutney and said it was bad. She moved it away from me and placed it at the corner of the table.",Left these guys a well deserved bad review on grubhub and now they suddenly won't deliver to us anymore. Maybe call next time you know you're going to be almost two hours late and don't try to swindle even more money for a tip when you were already getting almost $15? Hmmm.,I wish I could give them zero stars.Ordered at 7:30. Now 9:43 and still no food. 3 calls to the restaurant and each time got a new story about why they arent here yet. Never ordering from here again.,Update: Still order from here. Again some dishes are great. Small place to eat in.,Honestly a 3.5. Some dishes are a pure hit like the mutton briyani and certain curries. Some are ok and more salty. An average to above average place. I just pick up my food. Still needs work to match some of the bay ridge Indian restaurants,"For August 2019. Love this restaurant. Unpretentious, quaint and relaxing. We've been coming here for more than 4 years , the Lunch special is a fave bec it has everything. The food is very good. Close to what I make at home.

255,"Understaffed- overpriced- and overrated Ok- I want to preface that I am writing this review on Mothers day  and we have yet to be served dinner - 2 hours after we sat down.This is an established restaurant and should know that they need to staff up on Mothers Day.They initially refused to sit us when we arrived because we were told they were waiting for two menus-wait what ??Then the appetizers ""for the table""- were enough only for two people and believe me we are not big big eaters.The server took over an hour to come back to see if we needed our second drink - really?   After you gave us only one small plate of olive oil to dip our bread in for 10 people !?  Really?Not only a slow kitchen - but the wait staff is not attentive and understaffed .I'm sure if u have time to burn and a big wallet - with little expectation - this is the place for you.  And we sent back 3 dishes out of 10- tasteless pasta with sausage and broccoli rabe. Awful.  How do u screw that up?  I will say the chef came out to apologize and they made us a platter of desserts.  You decide","Unfortunately, the restaurant was not prepared for the night before mothers day. We waited for over two hours for our meal and when served three meals out of ten went back. They were tasteless pasta water flavored and inedible. The the chief apologized and compensated us for the meals. Not sure if I would go back.",Had to wait an excessively long time for the entrees to arrive.  Out with my parents-  you shouldn't have to wait over 2 hours for our meals so far and the clock is ticking... and it took over an hour for the server to come back to ask if we want drinks .  This is an established restaurant and we understand it's busy- but they are so understaffed - for the price,"I've been here 3 times and always enjoy it.It's a cute spot with a romantic atmosphere. The staff is friendly and they clearly take their jobs seriously which is always a plus.My friend had the margarita pizza and said it was ok but she didn't love it. However, I loved their lamb chop lollipops and the 3 cheese pizza. We also got the chicken parmigiana which was a great portion and very flavorful, leaving us with leftovers for the following day. I see a handful of negative reviews for the wait time and service, but I didn't experience any of that. Each time I've gone here they sat us immediately and served us very quickly.Definitely recommend!",We arrived at 7:30 for 7:45 reservations and sat at 8:15.  We didn't get the waitress to give us the specials and drinks for 30-45 minutes.  It is now 9:15 meal has just arrived.  Fra Diavalo arrived and it was too Spicey to eat and very little pasta in the dish.   Even though i paid extra for gluten free. I reach over to my husband meal and his spaghetti looks like soup.Parking ticket on top of this for $54 -hhmmmm,"The ambiance is top notch. I came in starving, but I did really enjoy the setting and feeling relaxed and left the place happy and full. Servers are really good too. They are very attentive and helpful. Will definitely go back on a regular basis.",Luciano's Ristorante
256,Just placed an order it was ready on time. We got it home and it was awful. The chicken cutlets were horribly filleted and the Angel Hair Melanzana was awful.. no flavor and was definitely not pleasing to the eye. The Pizza was decent. Probably won't order from there again. The two stars was only because the pizza was okay.,"Good food. Just don't order delivery, cause it will take forever. I'm 1.1 miles away, yet took 2 hours to get food",Food is good but the delivery is absolutely horrendous. Minimum hour and a half to get your food. It has been over two hours before. It's so bad i think they should just make it pick up only because they have no clue what they are doing when it comes to delivery.,"LaPiazza is my go to pizza spot always. I've cheated on them before (shhh don't tell) and paid the price for pretty crappy pizza. The staff is always friendly, I've been coming here for more than 13 years and the quality of food is always spot on. Last night I ordered a large pie, half pepperoni and half plain with one bbq chicken slice. The total was $22 which I think is fairly reasonable for good pizza. The buffalo chicken slice is amazing with big chunks of chicken. You can skimp and go to other places with specials and all but it's pretty sub par. You get what you pay for when it comes to pizza.",Pizza is delicious thin crust with a generous amount of cheese. Sauce is excellent. Saw some tables with entree's & they looked fabulous. Pizzeria &  bathrooms are kept very clean. Four stars instead of five because they're cheapskates with the air conditioning. Will definitely be back when the weather gets cooler.,"La Piazza is a great place in Staten Island for a true pizzeria experience!  We stopped in on a Friday evening around 830pm.  I say that because after we ate in house, we ordered some pizza rolls to go....and got scolded for doing so!  I've had this happen in NY before, and this case was the owner not liking that we bought him out of his remaining rolls for a to-go order.  Granted it was 830pm, it was guaranteed sales, and yet in NY they'll get upset cause they're always ""saving face"" for their next customer! Whaaaat?Anyway, the food is delicious and quite reasonable!  The chicken parm roll is out of this world!  The sausage and peppers roll is taking that concept to the next level!  And finally, my favorite, the rice balls are fantastic!  Just enough cheese and meat inside, and the breading is light tasting but yet holds it all together!The food is delicious, I'd certainly return, but be careful of taking the last of anything!",La Piazza Pizzeria and Restaurant
257,Creative food and Chill vibe for an eveningOut with the lady.Only advice isTo change the menu font sinceIt's unreadable.,Saturday 1:00 PM and they were out of scallion pancakes and Char Siu.It wasn't busy and food was slow.Bacon & Veg Dumplings were ok - 4 pieces for $7.50Coconut Curry with rice was good but chicken was dryBeef Bolognese with udon was terrible - watery tomato sauceMushroom Fried Rice was salty - should include bite size mushrooms.Would not I go out of my way to try againBathroom door doesn't lockWalked into a group of flies to the bathroomStaff was friendly,"This has been the worst experience ever in any restaurant. Just came back from this terrible place that I recommend no one to visit. Bad food is one thing but not professionalism is what you cannot solve for.First of all the service is really really slow. We ordered the pancake for appetizer and it came to our table after 45 minutes. Not just that, it was burnt when it came to our table. And secondly, they taste really bad. Like frozen Malaysian paranthas.Another 30 minutes later we got our food - ramen and the coconut curry. That is where things got even worse. I had specifically requested ramen noodles since I cannot eat the udon. Now I had to wait another 15 minutes to get the lady's attention. When I told her this was not what I wanted, her response was: why don't you taste it and see if you like it. On telling that I do not like it, she said she can get them to make a new one. We specifically asked if it would take another 45 minutes. She conveniently said she will get it out in 10 minutes and took the bowl away.15 minutes later she comes back and says it was her fault and that the chef is not listening to her so the food won't be ready in another 30 minutes. We asked if we could get something else instead that will be ready sooner. Her answer was no. And that is it - no offer to bring a dessert - something that they pull right from the refrigerator. So that was my meal. No meal. No apologies, no effort to make up. Nothing.Pathetic to say the least. The ramen was equally disappointing. I must also point out that no one in the kitchen had covered their head with a cap or anything. Makes me question the sanitation as well.Stay away. It looks fancy but don't fall for itUpdate:Based on what the owner says here, I want to make it clear once again that nothing was offered at all. And not only that, the lady happily charged us for rest of the meal without any apology whatsoever. It is disappointing Steve that by the time we left the place was empty and you did not bother to personally look into the matter even when it was no longer busy and you knew about it! So please do not use this medium to cover up something that did not have the right intent.",Probably the best Asian place around JC!Delicious food and it's a BYOB place!! Great place to hangout with excellent service.The dumplings were OK but the scallion pancake was out of the world! We had coconut curry ramen with chicken and veggie udon and both were really goood! Would definitively come back!!,"The good:The udon noodles! I get the coconut curry noodles with the lemon grass chicken and they always have the perfect bite to them. The sauce is perfectly balanced somewhere between savory and sweet the way a coconut curry should be. The scallion pancakes! Perfectly crispy and fresh. I also had the spinach pie dumplings which are also good, but perhaps in small doses as I find them to be a little too ""green"" tasting. The bad:No AC so it can get pretty hot!","We went on a nice Saturday afternoon and were quickly seated by a nice lady. The place is small and well decorated. Seats about 20-30 people. The kitchen is semi open so you can hear them cook. We ordered the dumplings to start. Coconut curry on udon and the bolognese also over udon for our main dishes. The bolognese came with an optional pesto sauce we agreed to be added. A sarsaparilla and iced tea for drinks.The dumplings came out first. They were a bit overdone but tender and full of taste. The coconut curry and bolognese came out next. The bolognese was good. I didnt think meat sauce over udon would work but it did. We liked the coconut curry more. It worked very well with the udon with enough heat and curry for a balanced taste. Both dishes were very well done.We ordered the green tea mochi to for dessert. Again, well made, not too sweet. We relayed to the owner how much we enjoyed the food and the restaurant. I was confused and intrigued about the fusion of East Asian, European and Southeast Asian food but it works. We found our favorite spot and will definitely come back. Thank you for opening this unique spot. Pinwheel gets a super recommendation.",Pinwheel Garden Dumpling & Noodle Bar
258,Ordered 2 large roast beef heros to go. More fat and grizzle than meat. Disgusting! Big waste of money. Right in the garbage.,"After hearing about this place on an episode of #RoyalPains I was excited to check it out. I guess I should have assumed it was made up since it was on a TV show and it was falsely reported to be in red Hook. Their hours are odd (close at 4pm), and inside it's very bare bones. They have almost no selection of sandwich toppings. No bacon, no sauces/dressings, not even a steak sauce. The lady making my sandwich barely spoke English, making the conversation difficult. She was enough tho. The sandwich was alrighy. I bought some sauce at the real deli next door. I might give them 1.5 stars if half stars were an option.I will not be returning, ever. Wish I could say the same about following TV show suggestions on dining.",Wasn't impressed. It was a sandwich. Nothing special. I also got a tomato and cucumber salad because they overcharged my card so I had to make up the difference. I make better at home.,My turkey sandwich was amazing friendly staff everything is fresh and home made with a smile I love little deli shops like this !,"My brooklyn sandwich crush moved into Staten Island and boy was I jumping in joy when my friend told me. I had to end my conversation with my friend early just because I had a feeling that it would be packed around 12 pm. The store felt a lot more modern compared to the Brooklyn location. I went for the eggplant parm sandwich, large size of course. Had to go vegetarian that day after my guilt of eating so much meat in Texas. It was delicious as expected. When I finally was able to eat meat again, I went again to get the Sinatra special. That's definitely my favorite sandwich, as I've gotten it multiple times the last month.",Delicious I love the sandwiches here. My mom is really picky and always wants her cold cuts extremely thin and she loved her sandwich and that says a lot. It's also very good because all they make the food there and it's fresh. Only thing I'd say is it's a little pricey but I feel like it's worth it for a good quality sandwich.,Defonte's of Staten Island
259,"Really delicious Peruvian and Chinese-Peruvian food!(There's chinese food, and then there's Peruvian Chinese food!! Big difference in taste!) But don't take my word for it, try it for yourselves.The place itself is low key, so I wouldn't recommend you come here on a first date.  There's only off street parking, so you may need to park around the block. However these shouldn't deter you from trying this place.",Not a good experience tonight... Very disappointed.. I think the regular cook is on vacation.... The food was plain,"The food is good but the service is horrible. Someone told us to sit anywhere and when we did, another server came up and said ""you have to move this table is too big for you"". Completely rude. She never checked on us if we needed refills or if we were alright. It's too bad cause I liked the food but I won't go back because of her","This is by far and away my favorite restaurant in New Jersey. While I'm sure that everything that they serve is equally delicious, I almost always end up getting the lomo saltado every time I come here. The staff are prompt and respectful, and i absolutely love the way the decor calls upon the unique culture of Peru. One of my favorite things to do with y friends when we do feel like eating outdoors though is to get some food to go (with a to go pitcher of their delicious limeade of course) and sit across the street in the park as we watch the barges come in. You truly cannot go wrong with this restaurant; and after all my years of coming here it has earned a very special place in my heart.","Tasty food  and excellent service!!

Don Julio's serves as an excellent example of the diverse cuisine of Peru. Owned and operated by a Chinese family from Peru, the menu is reflective of typical Peruvian dishes, Peruvian-Chifa dishes, as well as a separate Chinese menu.Your best bet here is to order the famous Peruvian-Chifa dishes such as lomo saltado or chaufa (fried rice).They even have a Peruvian charcoal rotisserie oven for delicious pollo a la brasa. The prices here are a bit high for the area, but you're sure to get a consistently delicious meal!",Don Julio Restaurant & Chifa Men Wha

It was a good five minutes before anyone even made eye contact with me. I told them my order and she acted like it was almost ready... it was just shrimp, rice & beans. Fast forward almost an hour later I'm still sitting there waiting... I also watched them handle and cut the bread with with no gloves on... Meanwhile they're also answering the phone and touching everything. I know this is an old-school place but it was still uncomfortable to watch. When I finally got my food there was no apology, explanation or anything..wont return","I ordered my food online and at 10:42pm and received a confirmation email that my food would be ready for pick up at 11:15pm, the restaurant closes at midnight. I normally pay with credit card but I selected cash this time (luckily). I get to the restaurant at 11:25pm and the lights are off and the door is locked. I called and no answer. What if I would've paid with a card?? I would have been charged $35 for a meal I would have never been able to eat. I grew up in Elizabeth and have eaten at Alvarez cafe since I was a kid. Very disappointed!","We just ordered from there, and they claimed they didn't take debit cards, which is false. Furthermore, they don't speak English. We had to get someone that speaks Spanish to order, and they barely understood each other. This place is extremely unprofessional. They have not changed nor improved since I left my last review.

261,The food wasn't good at all. The chicken soup was more like hen soup. No flavor. Seasoning was bland.,"The rice was cold, the server forgot my pastele and my ""fried"" steak was so rubbery and chewy that it was inedible. The music was really loud and the server never even checked on us to pay our bill or anything. Overall not a good experience at all. I used to love this place but I won't be returning. The manager didn't seem to be concerned about my steak but at least he removed it off the bill.","I placed an order for pick up. The food wasn't very good. I got the Cuban sandwich. It was cheaply made, way to greasy, and made me sick to my stomach. I ate 1/4 of it, and ended up throwing the rest out because my stomach still hurt 6 hours later.

262,Got take out for first time.Not good at all. Chorizo oldGuacamole not freshly made like advertised.Burritos just rice and beans barley any meat.Just over bad. Just had to let people know do t spend your money here,"Got new staff, kinda sucks now. And are cutting corners with their food (instead of pineapple sauce they put honey mustard on a burrito, old guac on plates etc,)","The food here is really bad. Waiter was so nice but that really can't make up for the bad food. I got the Yolanda enchiladas and it was literally shredded chicken with no seasoning, inside a tortilla covered is cheese sauce with brown guacamole and rice on the side. No seasoning, no tomatoes, and BROWN gauc. Like, put some red sauce on this or something! The dish was entirely beige and brown - so unappetizing. The chips were stale but somehow looked like they were just cooked - they weren't. I'm cringing thinking about my dinner.","Friendly people who use fresh ingredients and serve generous portions. Not the cheapest, but definitely the best Mexican food on the south shore.","Had a good meal, but ordered chicken empanadas.. the empanadas were empty!! They only had sangria and beer wishing they had margaritas being a Mexican food place they should! Chicken quesadillas were good, and so was the guacamole. But would love some upgrades. And maybe better empanadas lol","I tried this place with a Groupon from local flavor. They give you unlimited chips and salsa which I should have known I would fill up on, but they're so good. We shared the fajitas for 2, which really should have been fajitas for 4 since they give you so much. They mix chicken, steak, pork and shrimp with it. It's so hearty and the onions and peppers were grilled to perfection. We also ordered a pitcher of Sangria of which we got a good 10 glasses from, however just know it's pricey! $32.99 for a pitcher, I think is a little outrageous for a Staten Island spot. While it was delicious I'm still shell shocked over the price. All in all it was definitely good food and I would return, but maybe have 1 glass of sangria as opposed to a whole pitcher.",Don Cesar Restaurant & Bar
263,"Beajtiful and elegante restaurant. They have a Tesla Charging Station outside, so you can charge while eating.  But, Their seafood options were not impressive.

She said ""of course, do you want to sit outside?"" We said we'd love to, as long as it was okay.   (I've waitressed and bartended for years, so I understand when some tables are for meals only). The place was a bit empty, so all seemed good at first....At first the waiter was nice. We ordered our wine, and then our oysters...  when he asked if we were ordering anything else, we said ""no thank you, just doing some oysters and wine."" He said ""okay"" but it felt like he was annoyed with our presence. He asked us two more times if we were ordering anything else. We politely said, ""no, just a quick snack of oysters and wine thank you...""Then another random waiter asked if we were ordering anything else..We asked for the bill TWICE and the second time he said, ""would you like to order anything else?""The whole experience was just awkward. We felt uncomfortable, as if we were inconveniencing them... like we were cheap for not getting meals. It was really bizarre.  I wish the hostess gave him a heads up. Maybe she did and he was still annoyed that even though there was basically no one there, we weren't about to have a $200 lunch. Oh but we were half way there! When we got the bill we were blown away. $44 for 12 oysters  (price not on the menu- our fault for not asking - the most I've ever paid is $2.75-3.00 per oyster)$14 x 2 glasses of wine  (the wine I ordered was $12 and he rang in a more expensive one but it wasn't worth it at this point)Dozen oysters and 2 glasses of wine...

266,"We chose this place as it was close by but we deeply regret our dining experience and food. We ordered shrimp tempura roll, spicy tuna roll and sushi dinner. The sushi dinner which came with a miso soup was lukewarm and extremely salty. The salad that was also part of the sushi dinner had a dressing and that tasted like part French dressing with a blend of oil. (Yuck!)To make things worse, the sushi was just as awful as with the rest of the meal. The rice was hard and the rolls fells apart. The shrimp tempura's batter in the roll was not cooked all the way and soggy. The fish on the sushi tasted frozen and it was chewy. (Not fresh at all!)We were both very hungry and ate most of it and now regretting. (Hoping we don't get the runs)Service was just as bad. I was drinking my tea and the bag was pulled out and the server decided to pour water into the cup without even asking. I gave it one star for exotic looking tables. Otherwise it's a zero star if I could.","Enjoyed my dinner here. A little smaller portion than what I usually receive at hibachi grills, but this may be because I ate at the bar. Other than that everything was spot on.","Always good when we dine in and order for take out. From the rolls to hibachi to the drinks. Last time we ordered take out though, the soy sauce was extra, extra salty which was weird. Normally I dip my rolls in it, but I had to use my own soy sauce at home. That's just how salty it was.","I was craving for sushi and this was the nearest restaurant with good reviews. I actually realized that I've been here before and it was actually really good the last time I went as well. The price isn't that bad. Table for two ordered veggie gyoza, Spicy tuna sushi roll, spicy salmon roll, ell roll, and chicken yaki soba, came up to about $40. All of their sushi rolls are yummy and fresh; the veggie gyoza is great as well. Yaki soba was ok for me but my fiancé loved it (I'm not a big fan of green peppers).We were sitting outside cuz the weather was great (to me anyways). Our server was very attentive and great! Didn't have any problems with the service.Overall great experience and I will definitely be back for more.","Came here for lunch and had a great time. The chef was entertaining and knew what he was doing. I ordered their shrimp and steak hibachi combo. The steak was okay but the shrimp was really good. Overall, great experience and good food.","I did not know this place in Bayonne existed! Came here for a date night with my bf. Parking was not a problem as there is a huge lot surrounded by TJ Max, Stop and Shop, Home Goods, etc. Walked in and asked for a seat for 2 for hibachi; 20 minute wait which wasn't bad at 6:30pm on a Saturday. They have a waiting area at the front so you can take a seat, read the menu, etc. We were seated with 2 other groups and sat at a table that was half booth half seats. They had about maybe 17 hibachi grills throughout the restaurant. If you have a big group they have booths with one grill. I saw a lot of birthdays there too! They have a semi secluded back area where a girl brought balloons and had her group of friends sit so definitely birthday friendly (they come out with a drum to sing happy birthday). The waitress came around and got everyone's food and drink order. There was a lady and a child next to me in which the child could not eat anything with wheat in it and the waitress was super accommodating. They even cooked his food separately from the rest of ours. The hibachi chef was entertaining and quick. He spoke so fast we all didn't get to process what he said lol. He did the typical hibachi routine; catching a vegetable in your mouth, squirting sake into your mouth (water for the kids), smoke coming out the onions, etc.Now, I am a vegetarian for dietary needs. If you do not like your food being cooked with meat you definitely should tell your waiter as they use the same spatulas on meat then they do on seafood... just a heads up! The food was great, I ordered the combination dinner of shrimp and salmon. My boyfriend ordered the combination dinner of chicken and steak. The chef even gave him two complimentary shrimp. Once we were done, it did take a while to get the check. It was $51 for two combination dinners plus 15% tip which was a little over $7. They also have dessert if you want to take it to go or eat it there.My boyfriend and I had a great time! He was impressed with the place as he's been living in Bayonne for years and excited they finally have a nice place like this!",Otaiko Hibachi & Sushi Lounge
267,"I came right before the St. Patrick's day parade started. There parking lot was charging $5 parking which was totally ridiculous for customers. The Oreo pancakes were decent. I didn't love them but they were generally acceptable. However, even though the parking situation was annoying and the pancakes were dry, the reason I love this place is the coffee. Quality in a cup. It's so good especially if you're a coffee person you need to have the coffee. I will always return because I love Bruno's coffee. Bruno's makes the best coffee on Staten Island. I know that's a bold statement but the coffee is incredible and the design with the foam is everything.","This is a neighborhood favorite that is not as good as it used to be.  This place was always packed, even on a Monday night.  After eating here tonight with my husband and son I know why there were plenty of tables available.  We ordered eggplant parm appetizer and a small house salad to start. The parm was over floured and it was served with a pink sauce.  WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?  The salad was an old wilted mesculin salad. We sent it back. When we told the waiter he was apologetic, but we watched him tell the manager who proceeded to roll him eyes.  REALLY?  That is not a good manager.  He never visited the table. Never apologized or even check in on us.  The only reason they got 2 stars is because my entree was good.  My son and husbands was mediocre.","Its unfortunate how diagusting your customer service is .. I really had hope for this place. My wife, father in law and I presented at brunos to grab a quick bite, without knowing we sat down where we were given a menu restricted to brunch options only. WE ALL AGREED! that this was not something we all were interested in so we simply ordered a coffee as a consideration to the waiter for seating us with leaving him damn near a $2 tip. Obviously the waiter told the manager we weren't eating.. the manager had the audacity to watch us and make us feel uncomfortable with the face he had on and the way they were talking and staring at us as if we commited some sort of crime. As we walked out the restaurant the manager and the waiter proceeded to watch us leave and laugh at us while walking out. What bothered me even more was that i went back in because i just had to and once i voiced my opnion it was evident the maneger knew he had made a mistake because even his employee's were laughing. I just wanted to have a good meal that's all and noone should feel the tension or frustration of any business owner who restricts their customers to a menu and they do not find anything appetizing at that time.","Can't say enough positive things about Bruno's. From the owners to the staff to, of course, the food and pastry- Brunos is exceptional.Just when you think they can't get any better at breakfasts, they throw killer lunch dinner menu options which are all executed perfectly and incredibly delicious. Please do yourself the great favor of visiting Brunos for meals at all times throughout the day and eve.   And take some of their amazing pastry or cakes home ! Keep up the great work!","08.25.2019I order my daughter Sweet 16 cake with Fina. The cake was beautiful and was create and design as best to what we requested. The taste of the cake was great. FINA is very knowledgeable of her works, Understanding and Caring of her customer's. I will sure to order any special occasional cake again with Fina @ Bruno's and I do recommend Bruno's and look for Fina.Thank you so much to Fina & the Baker!","Sorry to say Bruno's on Forrest pales in comparison to Bruno's sister location on Hylan. It looks a bit tired compared to the other recently modernized location. We went with the intention of having an amazing meal like we are accustomed to on Hylan. We always order a pitcher of Sangria or a bottle of Pino Grigio, appetizers,  main course and dessert.First, we were quite well dressed, much more so than all the people in shorts looking like they were hanging out at the park. We were seated at a small table adequate for dessert, not much more. We decided to dial it back after seeing poorly dressed people arriving right after us get a larger table. This happened 2 more times. We ordered a specialty pie with fresh mozzarella, which was okay, frankly pizzeria Giove is far better. I ordered a coke or Pepsi, what I got was a diet version. The waiter never even came back to inquire how our meal was! We got our check & left, never to return to the forrest ave location again. Chef Settepanni would be furious ,but, he's not at that location ,and, believe me it shows!I appreciate management responding to my review, but, really don't understand your snarky comment about not being able to control your customers dress. You sir missed the point completely, a top shelf establishment is so savvy that they have the brains to seat people appropriately, especially people that have the respect to dress appropriately.  Go to Bocelli for example, they even notice the watch a patron is wearing and factor this in, all even before your seated. This is obviously beyond the scope of Bruno's on Forrest. As far as your fantasy of a mere wave if the hand would summon a wait staff person, sorry, we finally flagged down  a sweet Hispanic girl for drink refills after trying in vain to get our waiters attention. There's a saying ""The fish stinks from  the head"" apparently you qualify as a poster boy for this role, since you took a completely offended tone in your response .

Try the empanadas and the deserts!","We were on our way home from plant shopping in New Jersey and realized we needed to eat before we got home.  We saw this place on the side of the road and it was advertising pot pies.  We thought wow, that would hit the spot.  The building is quite unassuming, at best; the inside is a bit more welcoming.  We didn't have high expectations for the food.  However, what we were served was amazing!!!  We weren't able to have the pot pies, since they're frozen and you need to call ahead to have them ready.  But what we ate was absolutely delicious.  My husband had the black bean soup and an empanada, which he loved. I had a salad with rice, black beans, corn and plantains with a lime cilantro dressing. It was crazy good!!!  We enjoyed the food so much we took home 2 frozen pot pies and had them for dinner.  We could easily have shared one with a salad, but decided to eat both--that's how good they are.  This restaurant is nowhere near home, but we will make a point of returning soon.  It will be our destination.  We highly recommend you give it a try--don't be put off by the outward appearance.  Stephanie is a magic cook!!!","If this small establishment was located in a strip mall, it would be the ultimate small hole in the wall place.

Well, the bacon, wild cooked, wasn't fight to the way I like it. But it was good. I left my plate empty. 8-)I wish I was around the area a bit longer, so I could try their lunches.

269,"This is probably the worst Italian food I've ever had, including bad spaghetti from high school cafeteria days. Imagine opening a can of Campbell's Tomato Soup and using that as a sauce for every possible pasta shape. The kitchen here doesn't believe in seasoning or garlic or Italian parsley or anything but a soup as sauce. I ordered a vodka rigatoni that lacked the snap from vodka and no discernible flavor other than sweet stewed tomato soup. My wife's chicken was also flavorless despite serving her a type of pink scrap of meat that here was called prosciutto but in reality was closer to thinly sliced shoe leather. I must hasten to add that shoe leather has more and better flavor. In addition to the worst Italian food in the world, this neighborhood favorite has the worst lighting imaginable--think car wash lobby lighting. It's the opposite of romantic or even welcoming. Music is woefully off tone and further destroys the atmosphere. The wine selections are uniformly insipid. Prices would be reasonable if there was any value to food or drink but alas there is zero redemptive value in either. Service is fine.","I ordered Alfredo Linguine and a Pepperoni and Motz stromboli, both were drowning in olive oil.

270,"I've been here a few times over the years and it's never been anything special. Just ok, but never had any issues until now. Sat there for close to 30 mins without having anyone come try to take our order. There were 3 other tables in the restaurant that were all there before us so it was not busy. Plenty of staff to help but nobody actually does anything. I wound up walking out because the service was awful. The first time I've ever done something like that! I can see from other recent reviews that service here has been a consistent issue. I gave 2 stars only because this was the first time I've had a real bad experience in this otherwise mediocre restaurant.","The nastiest people work here. The food isn't terrible, it's mediocre Japanese food although just because of the people who do work here makes me never want to get food from here ever again.

And that's definitely not the first time I've experienced AWFUL costumer service there. The only good them about this place is the sauce that comes with the fried rice. Would be a little bit of a better rating if the costumer service was better, but they were so incredibly rude to me I was astounded.","I ordered bento sushi & salmon w/salad.

No one is attentive, sashimi was standing by the bar for 20 min at least before they paid attention to me or it. I don't like my raw fish waiting that long. I also saw them clean something off our appetizer plate before serving it to us. I recommend trying some place else. There are tons In the area.  I can't say the food was bad but I really love good service, it's what makes my experience eating out so much better!","Small and cozy, complete with a fish tank upon entry.The food is fresh, and prices reasonable for sushi. I am a fan of their Bento Box. You get a nice amount of food and variety. Nicely decorated. Service can be on the slower side, but just adds to the enjoyment of a dinner out ( unless you're in a rush :)",Genki Sushi
271,"So 4 stars, really?  Yup! Went here before a concert at the St. George......Let's put the 4 stars into perspective for you!- No, you aren't entering Nobu!- Yes, the place is super small- Yes, the place is ""gently worn""- Yes, the bathroom needs to be blown up (and yes- I said bathroom, not bathrooms!)- Yes, the ""kitchen"" is a 4'x5' hole in the wall, with a small fridge, prep stand, and broiler- Yes, service was spot on/warm/friend- Yes, the burgers were outstanding!- Yes, the pricing is super affordableKeep in mind, cash only!","Bartender rude af, don't know what was her problem or why is she in such bad mood, Asked about a non-alcoholic drink for my wife: ""don't know never tried it..."", ""no idea, it's Steiny's""... cash only and the so mentioned ""happy hour"" is just $1 less each drink, ended up paying $9 dlls for a Sam Adams on tap, not really a deal tbh, ambience was okay and it's close to the ferry, that's the only good thing","Stopped by here for quick cheap lunch as the options in the area are quite limited, and was not impressed. The bar food have no flavor and nothing special. The bartender was nice but didn't really focus on the tables as opposed to her bar guests. The seating is very uncomfortable as they are high stools and everything in the bar looked like it need a make over. Most likely a locals spot but surprised since I saw ads everywhere to try this bar out...","This was the perfect place to go after our ferry ride to Staten Island. Super friendly staff and were very accommodating to our group and friend with sever peanut allergy(picture attached has white bread instead of a sesame bun). Food tasted amazing, by far the best French toast I have ever had.","gimme a hell yeah! nothing like a cozy old-school bar to recoup and re-energize after crushing the Staten Island half marathon - did you expect any less from the Brothers of Destruction, me and Phil H?!my cousin and his wife met up with us here and we snagged a small table. service was a little under pressure due to all the runners refueling, but still friendly. big cold mugs of beer, great buffalo grilled chicken wrap and chips, even some quite tasty pierogies!great little old-school bar. cash only, but that's no problem. rockin' tunes too - plenty of AC/DC, Zeppelin, Rush, Styx, Clapton, and more. definitely worth checking out if you're near the ferry terminal!","This place was awesome! Great culture, great vibe and great server! We came in scrim San Diego to visit NYC and took the Ferry across the way. We found Jimmie Steiny's on a Sunday morning and hoped for the best. It was great!!!! Perfect seating for 8 of us, Laura or Julie I for got her name(so sorry) she was the only one attending to everyone. She's blonde and Is a bartender. She would take our orders didn't have to write nothing down! We played our music and had great food! Grilled cheese was a hit and the chili amazing! Great spot folks!!!!! Thanks for the love Jimmy Steiny's bartender!",Steiny's Pub
272,Pro: Pizza was just ok in flavor.Con: each slice fell apart in pieces as I picked it up.,"Tried it for the first time last night (personal clam pie, chicken parm hero and buffalo wings). Food tasted AMAZING. The reason for two stars is the fact that my husband and I both got horrible food poisoning afterwards. Bummer.",I give them 0 stars that didn't want make me my order. I order through grub hub and was charge $7.00 delivery fee. I get call they were going to be able to make my order. I guess it was because I ordered just dessert and that was it. Bad business practice,"Food is absolutely delicious, however I ordered extra cheese on my pizza and got less cheese than I thought there would be if I got regular cheese. Crust wasn't the best but overall I liked the food!","Stopped in for some pizza before we left the area back to Maryland! My sister and I ordered a cheese pie (should've gotten garlic knots too!). While we sat and waited I checked out their menu, they had some awesome lunch specials, as well. If only we lived closer. In about 15 short minutes our pizza was ready and hand delivered to us at the table. Once we took it out to the car we couldn't even wait to crack open the box and check it out because it filled the whole car up with delicious pizza goodness. Needless to say we shared a slice before we got all the way back home to MD.","Love Dileos- from Cheesesteak, specialty slices, the best wings and buffalo sauce, to friends Oreos and Nutella stuff Zeppoles soo good!!!",DiLeo's Pizzeria
273,Of course it's Friday the 13th and I find not one but two hairs in my pizza. Disgusting. Don't they wear hats???,"I like their small pizzas and their quick service. The location is convenient enough, but can be easy to miss because of a few nearby big buildings blocking out the whole plaza it is in.","Pizza is good for the price, however, the online pick up option is terrible. The staff must not be trained properly for this option seeing as how they've never gotten my order correctly. Please stress the importance of allergens to your staff and do not put regular cheese when I ask for vegan cheese. Also, I drove all the way back and upon request, they refused to fix it or prepare it in front of me which completely defeats the purpose of ordering online. Never again....","Giving this 5 stars for what it is.  You didn't fly to Italy  or even go to some high price authentic pizzeria.  Place has a bunch of options, including GF and vegan, and everything is fresh and tasty.","Food is great. Service is not. Staff was inattentive and moved extremely slow. It took me almost 25 minutes to get my pizza. The drink machine doesn't have working ice so all the fountain drinks were warm, which is disgusting. The cashier failed to mention that to me before I paid for the drink so I was stuck drinking warm soda. I would of purchased a bottle of water if I knew. Good pizza but they need to hire better staff and not teenagers who don't want to be there.","Over a year since my review of Blaze Pizza, and I still like it just as much as I did then. The build your own pizza with unlimited toppings is still a fantastic deal. Since then, they've introduced some new items like their tasty dough knots and the take two deal for $8.25, which is a half pizza (including the build your own pizza) plus either dough knots or a side salad. Since sometimes the pizza is a little too much food for me in one sitting, the take two deal is just right, and I'm really glad they introduced it.",Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza
274,Food was great but the atmosphere and the wait staff were so bad. The decor is very dated and old. Overall it was a very weird vibe going there Friday at 6pm. If it wasn't for the fantastic paella this would be a 2 star. I will not be going back,Thanks again to Jose Sierra for being the hostess to the mostest!;-) #hudsoncountyengineering,"Three strikes your out!!    I walked in, sat, had a beer and ran for the door. Biker party upstairs, toga party at the bar. Seriously not cool to have the public just walk in on that! def not the place for family, date or business. This was my absolute last try at this place. The 2 previous attempts were equally uncomfortable: the place wasn't heated in winter; food served cold; while plentiful it was not tasty and one can, by far, get real tasty and quality entrees if you just take the 20 minutes to drive into Newark.  They seem to cultivate a sports bar like crowd, so they have a nerve charging what they do.",The food was excellent! We got the Mixed Seafood Plate based on another reviewers picture. It was DELISH!!!!!!! We will totally recommend this place. It's also family friendly although the table is set for fine dining with multiple glasses and silverware. We brought our 2-year old daughter. And several other families came in with kids and they didn't give us any trouble. So we wi definitely be back.,"The Mediterraneo has been a restaurant in Bayonne for decades serving great food in a community style atmosphere.  Anyone would have been fortunate to dine or celebrate within their walls.  For those in the know, this establishment has changed hands in the past few years.  That being said...I have never witnessed a transition in ownership that tried to stay as true to the former ambiance and mentality as they did.  Taking the details and minutia that made the first iteration a charm and doing their best to carry over that essence into the new proprietary.The menu has been left largely unchanged.  Staples such as their rack of lamb, shrimp in garlic sauce and steak sandwich are still worthy of five stars.  Be sure to bring an appetite because the servings are gigantic...and come with a big heaping side of rice, vegetables and lovely fresh cut homemade potato chips.  Wash it down with their signature sangria and you are well on your way to a good night.",Comfortable decor . Excellent service . Generous drinks . You will never be disappointed with any dish you order on the menu . Must visit . You will walk out stuffed and satisfied soooooo,Mediterraneo Restaurant
275,"Pros (the only pros): open late, food is usually edibleCons: everyone who works here is a lazy a**hole. Its a low-grade Mexican restaurant, I'm not looking for five star service or food, but don't bother getting delivery if you want to eat within the next 2 hours and don't bother sitting down inside for the same reasons. I've sat at a table and the waitress ignore me for over 20 minutes in a mostly empty restaurant then act pissed off when asked to do her job. Don't worry, its not one waitress in particular you have to avoid, all of them are like that. If you're extra lucky one of the guys that live at the bar will violently harass you while you wait for your pickup that should have been ready 40 minutes ago.  Last time I got food the flan wasn't even edible, someone clearly messed up cooking it and they served it anyway. They might as well taken a dump in a styrofoam container and charged $3.50 for it. Summation: Don't go here unless its 2am and you NEED mediocre tacos and are willing to put up with anything for them.","Bad service and Bad food!!!!!! I ordered the food and waited one hour more. I called them,they told me they didn't cook my food yet!and didn't feel sorry at all!!","VILE PLACE. You've been warned don't order from here. Unless you're interested in someone's hair, drenched bags of chorizo freeze containing a soggy quesadilla, or a mixed up order. Also they don't care about how their customers experience their service and are unwilling to listen or support. AVOID THEM. Message if you want pictures I have them. But don't want to ruin anyone's day of this nasty Sh@t","Incredible nachos, got the pork stomach tacos and they were incredible, best guacamole and pina coladas I've ever had.

Fresh sour cream which I love haha I always get extra . And prices are great and they deliver!!,"Don't understand the low reviews, but they make the best tacos on the island! We tend to order steak and lengua tacos (very hard to find lengua tacos that are good)! Good price point for tacos (3-3.50). If you're looking to branch out, try their gorditas- I swear they fill you up for the rest of the day.",El Patron
276,"I ordered the crunchy french toast and it was not good. It was bland and dry, very dry. I waited a long time for my order longer than 25 minutes when the resturant was not busy. The eggs were cold. It looks good but it was just a let down. I wouldn't spend your money here$16 for 2 slices of bread, beaded in cornflakes.$4 for 1 egg...","If you have problems with digesting gluten/wheat products, don't go near this place.I do not have ciliac disease, but eating a piece of bread will consign me to being near a toilet for the day after eating it. I got an expensive burger here last night, ordering the gluten free bun the menu claims is available. Guess what? The slacker kitchen staff ignored the request. Then I had a flight the next morning. If someone had ciliac, they'd be in the hospital about now. Otherwise, the burger was dry and insipid.","Stayed at the hotel for a business trip and ate here for convenience. Started off with onion soup which was ok, nothing special.  Ordered the NY Strip and it was very bland, the asparagus was mushy and to top it off...there was a fly in my drink.  Service was average as well.","It was a starving person who ate the first olive and declared it food, Im sure. The Greek salad, recommended, was full of them. Finding them all and moving them to the side was a bit of work. But worth it. I was able to enjoy it. I got it with a medium rare beef topping. That sounds not very Greek as I write this. It was made with Persian cucumbers. All very delicious, beautifully prepared and presented!The Aviation Grill, named for the nearness of aviation. It's in the Marriott Newark Airport but you have exit the airport and take a bus to it. Very annoying. Do not dismiss the Aviation Grill as another hotel restaurant. I admit to doing just all the time but Aviator is an exception. That's lucky because if you are trapped in Newark (thanks, United) it is the only restaurant in walking distance around the Marriott. Aviator is open late, serving food until 11pm. And bartender not only knows how to make a Negroni, he told me how I wanted to order it. Did you know ""straight up"" is room temperature but ""up"" is chilled in a shaker with ice?Hey, guy's been tending bar for 30 years? A lot to learn from.","We were staying at the Marriott for a flight out the next day and thought we would just stay at the hotel and eat instead of venturing out.The restaurant is very beautiful, with a great decor.  The staff are friendly and the menus are IPads which is a very cool touch.But the food - the food is just OK.We had a fruit and cheese board which is worth the 3 stars but the rest of the food is a 2.  It was just flavorless.  We had a couple orders of potstickers which we choked down but were pretty plain.  We also had a turkey club which, again, just had no flavor.I think three stars is very generous here.  It's not a horrible meal - but it's just very plain.  The homemade chips were greasy but ok.If you weren't staying at the hotel - it would be crazy to make a special trip here.The staff are very nice and friendly though!","We stayed at the Marriott hotel and this restaurant was located in the lobby area. It looks small, but it's actually quite large with extra back room areas for larger parties. They had no trouble seating out party of 12.Food: The first time I came for lunch and ordered a medium burger. Bad idea! The burger was charred on the outside and I couldn't get past the burnt taste to enjoy it. The next day for dinner I had the buffalo wings which were a winner!Drink: Malibu Bay Breeze was very good! Not on the menu, but with the help of the nice bartender it was made.Dessert: The sorbet was really good. I mixed the raspberry with the lemon and I was a fab of raspberry.Service: The server was so sweet and nice. It was a busy night due to it being the last night of the conference. He communicated with us well and was catering.",Aviation Grill
277,"The only reason I didn't give 1-Star is because I've had decent food from here prior to today. I ordered a Skirt Steak, Medium. I don't even think the steak touched the grill. I tried to cut into it and it looked like red mush inside. The outside was COVERED in vegetables and sauce, so I couldn't see how the outside was seared, but the inside was completely red. I couldn't even cut a fork-ful. My knife just couldn't make it through. I eventually tried to rip a piece off and chew it and I was afraid to throw up if I swallowed it. It just because a giant ball of goop as I chewed.I don't know if they've changed cooks or something, because the burritos I've ordered here were amazing. But this $25 steak, which came leaking in the container and bag was absolutely horrible.","We ordered from here tonight for the first, probably last, time.  The spicing of the meals was odd; too much of some stuff, not enough of others.  The rice was dry and flavorless and the refried beans were soupy and could have used more sofrito and recaido.  We've had better dishes from Aguila Dorada and Casa Lupita.","The food was good and the drinks were okay, however the service was not the best. It was kind of empty (just 3 couples) and the two girls serving seemed that were suffering there, not even a smile or asking us if the food or drinks were good. Every time that I wanted a drink, I needed to call her and it seemed that she was bothered to serve us. If I go back there only because the food.",Amazing tacos and their horchata is to die for!

278,"So I haven't gone to Applebee's for a while. My friend and I saw that they are doing breakfast now so we wanted to give it a try. I got the Mexican omelette with their signature hash brown and silver dollar pancakes and my friend just got a 3stack buttermilk pancakes.Let's talk about the presentation first. For $10, 3 stack pancakes, the presentation was horrible; it looked sloppy and I feel like they didn't give any thought to it. There was no whipped cream on top or anything. When I asked for the fruit on the side, the strawberries doesn't look fresh at all and I don't know why there was sliced apples instead of blueberries. The server didn't say anything to us about it.And for the omelette platter, the omelette itself was very greasy and it was a little burnt. It didn't look look like an omelette at all it was basically scrambled eggs, fried with vegetables. The hash brown had no taste nor crispness to it. The silver dollar pancakes was very batter-y and it didn't taste good.I understand that this is new for Applebee's but there is no excuse for the lack of presentation and flavor. I'm sorry but I don't think I will be back for more.","Ordered on the Applebee's app. Spent $96.09.  $8.08 tip for me picking up order. No table service.  Ordered Thai shrimp salad, but where's the shrimp ?  NO shrimp anywhere.  Pouring rain on mother's day, soo wasn't driving back just for shrimp. Tomato basil soup was so small for $6.69. Kid sizeNot good. No wonder this location has bad reviews on yelp","Went into the restaurant at 743 pm by 810 was still sitting at table without a single employee approach our table. Started to walk out, saw an employee at the door and explained why we were leaving, no response. Never again.",The service is good but the food is always terrible . The wings are stale . The best thing on the menu is the artichoke dip . The food tastes like it's nuked in the microwave .,"So on July 11 we ordered from here through DoorDash . When the food got here we were starving and started to dig in to our food. When I bit into the chicken quesadillas there was a gigantic wooden hamburger skewer through the whole thing . I immediately called the restaurant n spoke to the manager n sent him pics through text messages. He kindly offered me a free meal if I was to come in . I accepted however , as you can see from the pics I'm posting , I will probably never go back there again . They did not offer once to refund me . So naturally I threw out the quesadillas and lost my appetite and was out dinner and the money I paid for it . Sucks too cause the waitstaff at this restaurant are awesome and we were regulars ! My daughter and I frequently came in for boneless wings since they r her favorite ! Totally bummed about this !","Only went to this Applebee's because we had a $25.00 gift card.

279,Food is good here but service is horrible.  Ordered for delivery twice.  First time food took a long time but it was good so figured we would try it again.  This time delivery said 2 hours but we ordered early so figured we would wait since the food was decent.  Waited 2 hours only to find out from grub hub they canceled our order.  And only found out because we called the restaurant to find out where our food was.  They hung up on us.  And the. We got a call from grub hub letting us know that our order was canceled.  Sounds to me like they don't really want to do delivery.  If that's the case they need to stop offering or advertising for delivery.  Especially on grub hub!  Will never order from this place again.,Come here for tasty quick bites. I always go for the beef stew with yellow rice and a side of flan. They give a good amount of food and there are lota of options to choose from.,"I come here once in a while.

Great good people and they know how to party!,The food is is great! They have a section for take-out and for eating in. They also have a section for catering  parties.  If you're eating in do not go starving because the wait is long. We waited yesterday for our food at least 45 minutes. As courtesy they should (like other restaurants do) serve some warm bread with butter to munch on as you wait. The portions are big!! I guess from all the waiting they figure you're hungry. The staff is very friendly and very attentive.  Spanish music is playing all the time but not loud that you cannot speak.  I am Spanish so I know about Spanish food and you won't be disappointed.  The only set back is that the restaurant is in a not too great neighborhood.  I've never encountered any problems.  Just be alert.  There is parking in the back of restaurant.,Campo Bello

It was supposed to be buffalo chicken and it was just toasted pizza with chicken...damn.","I have been ordering white pies from Paulie's for almost two years now. Tonight's order was no different, except the pizza is missing mozzarella. Which is kind of an important ingredient in most pizzas. I called Paulie's to let them know (bc sometimes places get new staff). I get put on hold, and when a guy gets on the phone and I say hey just a heads up ordered a white pie it's missing mozzarella, in a not so great tone he just tells me no there is, I made it there's only two of us here making them and I made that one. So I offered to send him a picture of a dry cheeseless excuse for a white pie. He then offers to make me another one if I brought this one back. In the end, really just wanted to say hey this wasn't so great let the kitchen staff know, not be met with an attitude. So won't be ordering from them again. I wanted a white pie. Not a focaccia.","Remember when this place was great? Raised price by $4 for grandma pie and give half as much toppings.

I was in Stapleton so I was expecting typical hood pizza that tasted like the other 1000 places in New York who thinks bland sauce, doughy crust, and mozzarella they bought pre-shredded from restaurant depot is real pizza. I have always been a quality over quantity type of person and this thin crust cooked to perfection slice gets it done. Their pepperoni slice is THE slice to get if you are a pepperoni type of person (like myself) thick cut not some thin sliced pre packaged with a oxygen absorber in it. This is crispy thick cut meat will make anything better. The Sicilian slice was perfect, thick but didn't rip apart the roof of your mouth and actually had its own flavor profile, and the margherita is some of the best I have had, cheese doesn't slide of in a watery mess and you can  eat it without a plate under you to catch the liquid seeping off of it.

A real loss for the neighborhood","I have lived in This neighborhood for 15 years I moved here from NYC, I literally live across the street from Oak. and Pine its a good restaurant not a great restaurant but what annoys me about this place is that suddenly they have decided not to accept cash only credit and debit cards.  For a long time this was a rough neighborhood but now that it is gentrifying  Oak and Pine forgets about the area in which it resides.  Yes I have credit and debit cards but I prefer cash it's my option my choice. And maybe with a little perspective Oak and Pine can look at the history of disadvantaged neighborhoods and why a  cashless society hurts the disadvantaged.  Maybe begin by reading the article below.  Don't be dictated by a Folup  View of Jersey City nytimes.com/2019/03/11/o…",I am a big fan of the Oak on Pine.

Some (maybe all) locally sourced food, humble chef. The chef will say it's the ingredients but I assure you there's a lot of talent behind those ingredients! You can use whatever fresh and locally sourced ingredients you want, but if you can't cook then it won't matter. We got a burger and the crab cake sandwich and it was just beyond words.  The hospitality is beyond amazing. We have a rescue pit who is still learning that all people aren't bad and decided to bring her out to eat with us for the first time (we sat outside). And I can't thank the staff enough for being respectful and understanding. When she got agitated the staff just walked away from her and let her get back into a comfortable zone.

282,"This has good food, however the service makes going to this place questionable. I've been here at least 4 times with different customer service issues (mostly just rude customer service). Tonight made me post this review though. I ordered pickup, but had to still pay for it, so I waited on the long line. Finally got asked for help while they were making someone else's burrito and left the other customer to charge me the balance. The employee left the other customer without saying excuse me to him or let him know she was taking care of me. This poor customer had this burrito just sitting out while they helped me. I think they could have at least been polite to him and said they'd be right back instead of letting his shrimp just sit out. Manners can just go a long way (I totally get that maybe they're under staffed, but at least say ""excuse me"").Also, if you order on GrubHub and it's a busy night, expect to pick up your food in double the amount of time that GrubHub suggests.","Worst Tacos I've ever had..  delivered cold and soggy, tasted and looked more like it was made by Chinese People at a Tex Mex place..","This place had the most disgusting employees.  There rude demeanor and grotesque atitude does not satisfy hungered stomachs instead it infuriates the very depths of one's soul.

The rude child on the phone proceeded to yell at my wife that it wasn't her problem, when another employee grabbed the phone and stated it was there problem twice and hung up the phone. Guess where I went next............straight down the block to speak with a manager who was just as rude and disrespectful to the point where he gave me the finger as I left in anger at his blatant lack of respect "" I'm the manager , I'm everything "" .......child you work at a shit burrito place on staten island you are nothing and never will be enjoy your future of shit jobs and no respect your life",CLEAN and DELICIOUS!  Everything looks and tastes fresh and flavorful.  Truly the best Guacamole I ever had other than my own I make at home.The atmosphere is cool and the staff are pleasant and friendly!  Definitely would recommend to all!!!

Even with the pico de gallo and the black beans, its still nice and dry and crispy.All this time, all this time I thought ordering hard shell tacos delivered to me was a pipe dream.The Burrito Spot proved me wrong!My one regret is that I didn't order more. I was a bit scared after seeing some of the reviews here, not gonna lie. And while I can't speak for their experience,  I can say that I highly recommend this restuarant.I promise you, I will be ordering here again everytime I get the urge for tacos. :D","Food's good. They go a little too heavy on the sauce though. And don't provide enough napkinsBy the time I got my burrito, it was soggy. Amazingly enough, the taco shells were nice and dry. One thing though.......the vegetarian option that they have is nothing. By that I mean literally nothing. I assumed it would be something with fried veggies, so I ordered it. And ended up with a taco shell of nothing but onions and lettuce. So, that was weird. I mean, why even call that vegetarian? They should've just called it ""nothing"".But, I DID like the burrito....after drying it out a bit. could've been better wrapped, but nothing fell out. And it's tasty. So I'm happy!I will order again, but I will make sure to order beans or something with my tacos. Cause, again, the vegetarian tab means literally Nothing.",The Burrito Spot
283,First I would like to say that my boyfriend made reservations for a 6:30 Mother's Day dinner. My daughter and I got to the restaurant about 20 min before our time just to be safe and not be late cause Mother's Day can get hectic and a reservation can get taken away if you're late. Anyway when my daughter and I got there not one person even acknowledged us standing there. No one asked if we had a reservation if we would like to sit and wait or a simple hello. Nothing. My boyfriend got to the restaurant at about 6:40 . We got seated at 7pm smh. Our appetizers got to our table quick and so did my daughters dinner which that's what I'm giving the 2 stars for. Otherwise it would have been 0 if I could . We ordered our entree at 7:15 . While every single table around us received their food ate it and was already ordering dessert we were still waiting for our entree. Our daughter finished her food and was getting cranky. . The waiter was not even one bit  concerned at the fact that we have been sitting there for over 1 and a half hours waiting for our meal. The food finally got to our table at almost 9pm. The restaurant closes at 9:30. I was so disappointed at this point that I couldn't even enjoy it since my child was super tired at this point and cranky. We did not complain we were not being rude at all. When our bill came I would have thought that they would have done something to make up for this horrible dinner night. But no. Not one person even apologized. My boyfriend paid left a tip and we left when the restaurant was literally about to close. I didn't even finish my food. So disappointed because the restaurant itself is beautiful. I will not be returning,"It is Mother's Day 2018.   Had a 3pm reservation for four adults and one child in a high chair.   The reservation meant absolutely nothing.  The woman who was doing the seating who is also an owner, did not refer to any reservations list, but as people came up to her and requested seating, you may or may nothave a chance for a table.   Reminded me of something out of the Godfather.   Forget making a reservation, and forget this place.","I have frequented this restaurant on multiple occasions and have even had parties here but I will never patronize this establishment again. My child had mozzarella sticks and plain pasta(no sauce no butter) and I was charged $25 and paid extra for her dessert and cappuccino.....meanwhile I had baked clams, salad, entree, coffee and dessert $28. When we questioned the bill they had to the audacity to say it was the Pre fixe price.....and this was after I spoke to the owner who I know on a first name basis....I guess I had to pay for their remodeling bill.","I  had such a nice time at this restaurant this past Sunday. We made reservations for Mothers Day. First of all as soon as you entered the place there was a beautiful chandelier hanging over the stairway. I also observed the elevator to my left for those who chose not to walk up the stairs. I thought that was very considerate for the elderly and handicapped.  In the beggining I was a little annoyed because we had to wait  over 30 minutes to be seated. But it was Mothers Day so that was taking into consideration. As I sat down I observed the beautiful oviance of the restaurant. They had a fire place in the wall and beautiful fixtures as well. The place was clean and so were the bathrooms which are always important.  The food absolutely made up for the late seating and the hostess and manager kept apologizing which I thought was a nice gesture. This was some of the best Italian food I had tasted in a while. We opted for the pre fix menu which included your appetizer, salad, entree, and dessert along with coffee and tea.  Let's not forget the unlimited Italian bread that they are constantly providing to you. The Penne Vodka and pork chop Murphy was delicious and the chocolate roll cake was delicious. I left that place full, fat and happy. I will definitely be back. All staff were very nice and accommodating.",Tonight we celebrated our sons christening at cafe bella vita! The food is always so delicious; they give you so much it's impossible to leave not satisfied ! Not to mention it was for such a great price !The staff were very welcoming and accommodating everything went very smoothly! We had the private room it was so nice and intimate They let us decorate the room which was also a plus!,The food here is very good.   The portions are nice.  The wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  There is a lot of room tables are not very close together like some other places.  They have partitions to divide spaces for parties.   The prices are very reasonable.   I suggest using the price fix menu when possible.  There is an elevator if needed.,Cafe Bella Vita
284,Listen hands down this is the best place to eat. Not only due to Food Quality.. but the Hospitality is like no other. I live two blocks away somedays I'll call an order for pick up and to kill two birds with one stone. i'll walk my dog and they have no problem coming out to serve me my food. Lol great spot,"A pretty small bar/dining area but the staff is nice. The food on the other hand - eh. I had pizza ; wings & fried pickles. Pizza had no salt & the pepperoni was barely melted on . The wings were barely cooked, no type of crunch, the meat was semi pink & the sauce it self wasn't great. The pickles were probably the worst I've had ( i am a huge pickle fan ) - the batter they fry it in has no flavor. They do have a huge beer selection tho .",We've eaten pizza and wings here. Both were delicious. Price is alittle bit high but we have been returning for  over a year and we have yet to be disappointed.,"Spent the summer in Linden and ended up frequenting this place. Such a cozy environment with an interesting history. Tried a ton of different things on the menu and never had a bad meal. My favorite dish is probably the drunken clams (get it with linguini), but the pizza and burgers are excellent as well. They also have a great selection of beers, both craft and domestic.The service is unbeatable. Very laid back servers and bartenders who make you feel right at home. On a few occasions I asked if they would turn my Phillies on one of the TVs (of which there are like 100 in the place) and they were always happy to do so, even in Mets country. Great place to watch a game.Not the cheapest option in town, but definitely worth it based on the quality of the food, the atmosphere, and the service. Hope to visit again whenever I'm back in the area.","Go here!! Paul the bartender is fun and personable! The jerk wings or wingers are awesome! All the wing sauces are made in house. Great beer opens with popular craft beer options. The pizza was really good. All toppings were super fresh, and just damn good! Great place for game night with drink and food specials. The place isn't that big so get there early!","My son and I like wings. Lately, we've been going to Sharkey's in Clifton. While good, our criticism is always the same, too much time in the fryer. You won't find that problem here at the Linwood.My wife grew up in Linden. My son and I visit the area frequently to bird at New Jersey Audubon's Hawk Rise Sanctuary. Visit the Linwood my wife has suggested numerous times. So, we did.Stopped in for lunch. Two orders of hot wings, one chipotle lime. A basket of crinkle cuts. The wings were flavorful, crispy, juicy and delicious. Some of the best we have had. We won't be returning to Sharky's to get our next fix.Two bartenders were working the lunch shift. Both very personable and made us glad we stopped in.A home run.",Linwood Inn Taphouse and Pizza
285,"Ordered a bacon egg and cheese. The eggs where burnt, like how do you burn eggs my guy.","What in the world is going on at this place?I walk in...The guy at the register doesn't want to speak. I have to say to him ""can get a coffee and bagel?"" He goes over to the other guy tells him what I wanted. The guy making food for other people says ""there is a line he's going to have to wait"" I immediately look at the customers standing at his prep counter and I apologize, they tell me ""Oh no we ordered already its ok.""I wait in line 5 more minutes, the first counter person is texting and eating at the counter.Then another gentleman comes from the back and asks me what I needed...I say I need a bagel with butter not toasted and a coffee light & sweet with half and half. The guy who is adamant about standing in line says we don't have any half & half. I just looked at him and said never mind I'll go somewhere else and walked across the street.Where they promptly made me my bagel and was in and out in less than 4 minutes.","Food is dry as hell. Pizza looks like it's been sitting there for days. Had the eggplant Parmesan and it was really dry and no taste to it whatsoever. Atmosphere is depressing. They have TVs going really loud. Total low class vibe. Basically the Italian version of a really nasty Chinese restaurant. I would rank this place #1000 out of the 1000 delis in Staten Island. Let's say if Royal Crown is a 10 then this place is a zero. Also the guy swiped my card and didn't give me a receipt. Just took my card, swiped it behind the register, then gave it back to me and didn't say anything. Shady. Weird. Creepy. Just like their food.","This place is awesome! I didn't know they even had a delivery option until a few days ago, I'm so glad they deliver! The roast beef with mozz is out of this world. I usually get it on a roll cause a hero is too big for me! The gravy is to die for it's the perfect combination! Ham and cheese rice balls are great! Meat rice balls are great! & so are the fried ravioli! One day in the future when I host an event I will 100% get it catered from Johns deli!",We used to super love this place. It was something special on this Island that not give you many opportunities with good food. This spot was something special and good energy before. But our recent visits were very very bad. Place is not the same. It's not the service as before and the sandwiches have significantly smaller portions. Also it was super friendly and good atmosphere and now it's like opposite. I really don't know what's happened. For the price that they charging for their hero's (that now -- nothing special) you can go to ANY random DELI in SI and for cheaper you will get better and bigger portion. But I know for 100% that we will go from now only to their legendary BROOKLYN LOCATION where the portions are huge and super delicious.,"Ordered from here based on just the name. Wished I never had.  Since it was Good Friday, ordered the baked ziti and tomato with mozzarella hero. The baked ziti was ridiculously dry, I had better pasta from a can of chef boyardee. Even without the horrible flavor, it is nowhere worth the price. Next up is the tomato and mozzarella hero, for what they actually put on the sandwich it should cost abt 3 dollars. They put no dressing, no salt , no pepper.  Literally no taste what so ever! Just mozzarella and a few thin slices of tomato. I would be embarrassed to serve that to anyone. But I guess bc you throw the name johns deli on the place and you can do whatever you want. Stay away from this place. Go to any corner bodega and save yourself some money and chances are the food would be a 100 times better!",John's Deli
286,"Wings have zero taste , they just slather w.e sauce you order on the wings. Fries wasn't bad tho, but they need to season their chicken.",Not super saucy which to me is a +. When there's to much it over powers the taste of the chicken. I would eat here again over planet wings bc they just out too much sauce. There fries are so good and when I do the take out option. The fries when I'm finally home are not  Soggy!! Do you know how rare that is when you pick up or even get food delivered. The fries would be soggy from the condensation build up. I should've tried this place sooner since it is actually close to my apartment.,Went there last night and ordered a ten piece buffalo wings with the bone. The wings had absolutely no flavor and were slightly undercooked. The mild sauce wasn't very good either and lacked good flavor. The staff is very very nice despite the taste of the food. I wouldn't go back.,"It's a great place with awesome food, however, the wait time is a bit much especially since it took 20 minutes for my small order. Also delivery takes about an hour which can be annoying since my curly fries got soggy very quickly which sucks. I wanted a refund and the guy at the counter made a tantrum for no reason. At least he gave me $20 but still, I wish service was better. Delivery service is epic though especially the driver since he was a kind and respectful so I tipped him $75. Wing World is a great place for company since you will be satisfied with whatever you buy as the portions are perfect for its price.","This place is a hidden gem. I was introduced to it by a Coworker. I didn't believe the hype. When the food came, it was amazing. I will come back. I really wish they had a bar and was opened late.","Very odd that this place is only 3 stars. Wings are great, tons of sauces. I mix it up between boneless and bone in but usually prefer boneless. Wish they came with carrots! Major standout are the potato skins. Arguably better than skinflints in Brooklyn!",Wing World
287,"Employee was too busy texting to take my order quickly.  Then because of the distractions of the text, luckily she repeated my order because she repeated something totally different from what I had told her.  Just simply get off the phones when behind the counter and customers are waiting.","When this place first open It was awesome. But as time when on they really fell off. The smoothies are so water down, doesn't is taste great anymore. Another place not going to go anymore","We ordered tropical smoothie through ubereats and let me tell you, it was an experience. At first while ordering we thought the prices were mad high, but after we got our meal we were ecstatic. The delivery man came by BIKE, like I would never, it's mad cold outside. Even tho he came by bike our food came quick and that shit was mad GRRR. will be ordering from here again.","I'd like to begin by saying how happy I was to see a member of the staff reach out to me on Yelp about my experience.  As someone who loved coming here, I wasn't ready to let one bad experience turn me away, but having someone reach out about my concerns made me even more eager to come back. When I came in there was a long line, but I didn't wait more than 2 minutes. They kept the line moving, my food was ready pretty fast and the staff was very friendly. I got my usual buffalo chicken wrap and my favorite smoothie, the Bahama Mama.  The wrap was delicious, and the smoothie was perfect. Not only do I love the food there, but it's always great to know that the staff cares about the customers experience.","The food is always delicious, but the smoothies keep me coming back. Unfortunately this time my smoothie was a little more watery than usual.  And, while I was eating they had the music blasted unusually loud.  I usually don't mind loud music, but what they were playing was not kid friendly, and there were kids sitting in the table next to us. Since I usually have a much more pleasant experience, I will be going back to see if it's any better, and I will post an updated review.","I wish there were more locations on Staten Island for this chain! The smoothies are always so delicious. It's a healthy alternative for a ""grab and go"" breakfast for me when I'm on the run before work. I moved to the other side of Staten Island so I haven't been here in a while because it's really out of the way. But if they had one on the other side i would 100% still have this as my daily routine! The food is hit or miss. But it's a smoothie place so what can you expect! Lol",Tropical Smoothie Cafe
288,"Food is good ,service sucks. Such a shame. Rude staff. Food took too long and server had a nasty attitude.","Bayonne Patio Grille is an awesome place eat and grab a few quality drinks. I find a lot of this reviews to be very misleading! I was there the night of the bartender Ryan being accused of being rude. So sad how sensitive our society is these days! With a bar that is so popular with loyal patrons, uber eats and customers ordering food at all times of time, I can say how it gets a little overwhelming for the workers but NO ONE is ever rude. Everyone there is attentive and pleasant. GO SEE YOURSELF,  you'll never be disappointed.","I'm not one to write reviews or complaints about any business, but I am so upset about the experience I just had at Bayonne Patio Bar and Grill that I had to share. My wife and I, along with our 2 kids went to eat here. We come here about twice a month since the food is decent with good portions. We order our food... in 20 minutes, my wife and I receive our entrees, but not our children (chicken fingers and fries). We wait another 15 minutes- nothing, nor do we see our waiter. We ask another server about the food who said he would check on it. Another 10 minutes pass and nothing. We ask the server behind the bar about the food..  he states, ""the cook messed up, he got flustered, it is what it is."" I retorted back as he was walking back to his seat, ""it is what it is is not a great business model."" I was upset by the server's comments and ask to speak to the manager. The server replies, ""the manager isn't here, he'll be back on Monday. I'm sure he'll love to hear you'll bulls*** complaint."" My jaw dropped!! My wife and I got our kids and we left. As we walk out, I tell that server we'll be back Monday to talk to your manager about your bulls*** service."" My wife put the kids in the car, but I stood behind. I didn't want to leave without paying for the food we actually ate. I paid and the server snarkily says if we want to wait for the chicken fingers and fries. Like, are you serious?! We will never go back to place, nor recommend it to anyone. If anyone knows the manager or owner of this place, please have them reach out to me. This was unbelievable. I'm still upset!",Awsome bar restaurant. Nice decor and atmosphere friendly staff food is the best. The outdoor patio is the best. Great place to hangout if you don't have a backyard hehe.,"I went to this place and I have to say, best burger I have ever had, my friend had the strip steak and said it was awesome. We had a pitcher of Patio Punch, holy cow mmmmm. Bartender was super nice and service was great, thank you Patio Bar, great find within Bayonne",I looked on line & this place had a great looking picture of a burger (this is Bayonne gotta hope ) so the surprise is the burger was the best I've had in Bayonne & as good as almost anywhere (JC or NYC) cooked perfect medium rare fries done right & crispy & the black bean corn chowder was excellent...only thing missing was a piece of corn bread. Check it out & enjoy a serious burger......good beer selection too....,Bayonne Patio Bar & Grille
289,"First time ordered delivery from this place, the whole margaritas pizza was black except the topping. All I could taste was a burnt pizza. After two bites, we ended up throwing away the whole pie. I can't believe they would deliver a burnt pizza to customer. I would never order from them again.","I had a very unpleasant experience with who seemed to be the owner of this pizza joint. From what I've read below his name is Angelo.Here it goes.That very day I was given the go ahead by my oral surgeon (I had bone surgery 4 days prior) to eat regular food so on my way home I stopped at Tony's. My mouth was still swollen and I was still unable to make many normal facial expressions, but who cares, I was ordering pizza and garlic knots for my boyfriend and I. I ordered 2 slices from the young man behind the counter and when he stepped away Angelo walked up. I asked Angelo to add 3 garlic knots to my order. Angelo says, ""What order?"". I tell him ""the order I just placed with the man behind you"". Angelo says, ""how am I supposed to know that?"" I'm thinking to myself, JUST GET ME MY GARLIC KNOTS GUY, but I refrain because well, I have manners. Then Angelo puts the pizza box on top of the counter and to call me over says, ""Ok smiley it's $17.75."" Clearly he was being sarcastic, and quite frankly very rude and upsetting, because I PHYSICALLY COULD NOT SMILE. So I pay him and I say, ""I'm not smiling because I just had oral surgery and cannot move my face."" As I was walking out I heard a woman say to him, ""I guess you won't be saying that to anyone else anytime soon"" and Angelo replied, ""why not?""I was only at Tony's on 1 other occasion and was reminded why I never went back there. And to think I paid $17.75 for 2 slices of pizza and 3 garlic knots and I ended up leaving there on the verge of tears. Forget about Tony's and head over to Pizza Mia - everything they have there (pizza, garlic knots, service, price, etc) is better.","That boss tony treats his workers like garbage. He was very unprofessional and stuck up the middle finger at his workers. Also, the food was terrible and came cold. When I asked to speak to tony i was brought a man angelo who then proceeded to give me the middle finger. In addition, the service felt like i was waiting for the next grand theft auto to come out. Do Not Eat At This Esablishment.","My Sicilian pizza was awesome, my meat Stromboli was incredible.  My salad was so good I took a picture of it!  Lory K the singing server is awesome, I think she took some of my olives but I can't prove it!",We needed a quick dinner and Tony's was recommended to us. Glad we went as it was very good. We had garlic knots to start and they were fantastic!! Our meals that followed were each very good. We had subs and a Stromboli. Very generous portions and modestly priced.Staff was friendly and there was plenty of parking.I would definitely go back again.,I absolutely love this place the pizza is great and spaghetti & Meatballs are amazing !I love when I walk into a business and I'm greeted with genuine service also love that the owner Remembers me that I'm from California visiting and this place is my final dinner before I go back home .,Tony's Brick Oven
290,The food is fine whatever but literally it has the most disgusting bathroom ive ever laid my eyes on if you have to pee AVOID.,I wanted to give more stars but I got sick from a slice of pizza but the chicken is on point. Seasoned right and not to grease. I also tried the carrot cake it was good. The slices are big enough for two people to share.,"Very tasty food with very low price.I ordered 10 psc fride checken,french frides, 2 giant Gyro, and 2 double cheese hamburge the price was 36$.Very tasty very clean and cheep halal food.",I always have the chicken gyro fries and a can of soda when I come here. The food tastes fresh always and it's affordable. Highly recommend. The employees are very nice too. Great service and great food what more can you ask for,"Chicken gyro over rice was pretty great, it tasted very fresh however the spicy chicken sandwich tasted like box chicken with tons of hot sauce on it besides that the service was great! I would give the gyro a 10!","Very nice workers. But fried chicken was horrible, and Italian cheeseburger?? We couldn't even taste the burger, they took one SUPER THIN PATTY and cut it in half for each side of the bread. We basically paid for bread and fries. Its supposed to be 2patties for a Italian cheeseburger. Pizza looks great so maybe give that a chance if you ever go there. I am giving 2 stars because of the great nature of the workers. Had good customer service. They have to do something with the cook back there. Have a conference, send him back to school or something. Chicken was not where it's at. It tasted and looked old. Like they had it there and kept we heating with oil. I hate throwing foot away and we couldn't finish the meal. Smh.",Jezif Fried Chicken & Pizza
291,First time trying this cart and I was pleased with the quality and taste of the chicken schnitzel platter which I opted to get with cucumber salad and their potato salad. I got it with a side of sriracha mayo. They have several sauces to choose from. Next time I'll try the others. The sandwich is $8 and the platter is $10. Can't wait to try their other schnitzels.,Bad review due mostly to the inefficient line. It was a short line but still waited 26 minutes to get the food. Just not feasible on a work day.Schnitzel itself was light and tasty.,I had been to the truck but had not visited the restaurant until recently.  I love this place.  Sandwiches are huge and made fresh.  No heat lamp crappy sandwiches here.  I had bratwurst with sauerkraut and mustard.  Yum!  I used to hate sauerkraut now I realize that I hated bad sauerkraut not what is served here.  Frequent purchase card and Level Up as well.  This is my latest obssession.,"Quite good schnitzels. The pork was fried golden brown, and was very thin. Good quality fried meat. The yukon fries tasted quite different than your regular fast food fries, and the sauerkraut was ok.On the expensive side for a food truck though. $10 for 2 sides and a schnitz.",This may be the best food truck in Manhattan. They serve two locations with a cart and truck. Follow them on FB and Twitter to see where they are on any given day. My spot is Tuesday's at Murray and Greenwich Sts. Get there early as the lines are long. You can get sandwich style or platter with terrific condiments. These schnitzels are individually made and pounded thin and oversized. Try it and you will be addicted for sure.,"Finally got a hold of the truck location near my job so I dropped by to try my first schnitzel ever and it did NOT disappoint!I got the chicken schnitzel with mixed greens and Yukon fries. The chicken breast was huge. I want to know what size bra that chicken wore because damn!! Crispy and juicy with a splash of lemon, yum. The mixed greens were a bit wilted but the dressing was good. The fries were a little salty but they were golden and crispy. The highlight of the meal though? That garlic relish. Omg, I wanted to put that sh*t on everything. Aside from the minor things, this was a great first time experience.",Schnitzel & Things
292,"Took over an hour and a half for a pie and calamari delivery and I live 10 mins away.  Pie was a caesar salad pie, was plain had no caeser sauce. They were polite but pizza wasn't great.",The pizza was excellent had a little problem with delivery but I was told it won't happen again.,I always go here after school to get a slice today I'm having my Pepsi and  my slice of plain pizza pie. I have to try other slices .... oh well maybe one day,"I am a pizza traditonilist, I judge a pizzeria on its plain slice, this place knows how to make a pizza!!!! It has been a long time since I have had a good slice like this, the cheese is perfect, reminds me of the old slice shops in Brooklyn the sauce is just right and the crust not too thick not too thin, crisp with a good chewiness, This is traditional new york style pizza! In my opinion this is how pizza is meant to be, New York does it best!","Good price.  Good pizza.  As a baseline for me, dominos is about 3 stars.  4 stars is that I would prefer it over dominos or other chain pizzas, and 5 stars I would prefer over anything else.  Anything under 3 stars would be too expensive for the taste or terrible pizza.  So 4 stars is good as I have had better pizza, but if I lived in the area I would definitely return.    Salad was pretty plain but had lots of chicken so that was a plus.","Great pizza! Crunchy crust and nice guys making it. Who's ever heard of Vodka pizza?? I tried one. A funny spicy flavor - not really like vodka... but tasty and good.

293,"I have ordered from here for a few years and I absolutely loved it. The service, prices, food was great. Today my friend and I ordered from there, which our office usually orders a couple of times a week from here and I could not believe what my friend found in her food. She had little hairs in her dish and when she called to inform them, they wanted us to bring the food with the hairs to show them. The way this place handled the situation was beyond disgusting! So unprofessional to demand for us to bring the food to show them proof. We could not have gone back there since we were on our break and they were NOT understanding and rude. They refused to refund our money. They have lost a lot of customers from our end! Disgusting!",Pretty good. Food is tasty and portions are decent. It's nothing fabulous but it's decent for a fast food type Mexican place.,"I usually order from here about 2/3 times a week for myself and my coworkers. It's fast, reasonably priced and decent. Today, marked my last and final order along with my entire office. I ordered my usual L1; I made and consumed one taco and took a bite of my second when I saw a couple short, black hairs mixed in with the shredded lettuce in the tray of food. I was completely turned off from my food and even more disgusted from the managements response. I called and they were everything but sympathetic. In fact, they did not believe me and refused to refund my one lunch special when I ordered about 30 dollars worth of food. They insisted I bring the food to them to show the hair. They did not care that, that was impossible for me to do nor should it be necessary as a customer, let alone a frequent customer. If you like your food sprinkled with hair and topped with steaming hot bullshit regards for consumers, this place is for you. Enjoy.","One of the BEST taco places I love to go to when I get a chance to! Their chicken cheese quesadillas are filling, cheesy, and reallly good. It's also always got a crisp from the toasted tortilla. I also always get their chicken tacos with guacamole (two hard shells and one soft shell) Fresh  Tortillas & Taco also have fresh and delicious chips and guacamole and crispy mozzarella sticks! I can't wait to go back!!! Also they supply Jarritos and my favorite go to flavors are grapefruit & orange!","I had to be convinced to try this place since most of the places on New Dorp Lane look like back stories for inmates on Orange is the New Black. Multiple reliable sources told me this place was clean so I tried it. Needless to say you receive a quality meal for a reasonable price. The chicken hard-shell tacos have consistently hit the spot whenever a craving for a taco hits. The food is prepared fresh and it is definitely a strong alternative to a Taco Bell meal full of crap. The delivery is super fast and any place with online ordering gets a thumbs up from me; so if you are one of the people who experience anxiety ordering food over the phone (it literally makes no sense but there are so many of us out there), score a point for Fresh Tortillas.",The best. Yea it's weird it's an Asian run Mexican joint. But their food is good. Best tofu fajitas in town,Fresh Tortillas & Taco
294,Had two orders. One a roll that tasted sour and tuna that was runny in texture. I called. They gave me a hard time in remaking something different as I didn't trust the grade of the raw food and would've gotten a cooked order. They refused to give me what I wished. To the owners: I'm a regular customer - 2-3 times a week. Why would you do this to people?,"Not as good as it used to be. Perfect example of a restaurant that slowly decreases portions, slims down sushi with less rice and thinner cuts of fish, and raises prices. The decor is now tiring and old for a restaurant that stays empty. The menu is bland and basic. No longer does Fushimi exemplify the high-end, fashionable sushi restaurant it once did. Sorry Fu but you're just too underwhelming. I don't like rolls so I typically order several types of sushi and Fushimi has nothing special and what they do have (standard options) 'ain't that good no more. There are way too many other, better sushi restaurants to keep going to Fushimi.","Never again!  Long time customers and if I could eat there every night, I would.  The past two times we came with our kids (both were well-behaved) and both times, this one waitress hovers over us worrying about our kids.  Tonight, she took the chopsticks away from my son - he was totally fine with them and it's our choice to take them away from him, not her. He stood up a bit in his chair and the waitress walks over as if he was going to fall.  We had him completely secure and she was acting like we were horrible parents.  We knew we have 45 min max for dinner when we go with our small kids and it was getting close to that time.  We had a few bites of our dinner (after eating our apps and whatnot) and kindly asked to take the food home.  She looked at us like we were covered in feces.  My wife was done at that point and said we are never coming here again.  Waitress said why??  Totally rude and unprofessional.  Our kids were very well-behaved, bothered nobody (the place was empty anyway), and we were very kind to the server.  The gentleman we had was great but she was horrible (wish I knew her name).P.S. Too much butter on the steak as well","I'm not sure why the bad reviews they're great! Their rock shrimp tempura tastes way better than the one at Nobu even. The staff is great and were so nice to my two year old she was getting antsy towards the end of our meal and the staff gave her ballooon and light up ring she loved it. I have been going to Fushimi for more than a decade so happy they opened by me. Favorite thing is salmon lover, yaki udon, anything w spicy tuna, risotto and rice balls.","What can I say about Fushimi, this place is fabulous!!!I visited the Richmond Road location not too long ago, it was outstanding as usual. I couldn't wait to try this spot, and it didn't disappoint (not that I thought it would). The service was just as amazing as their sister restaurant and so was the food. I don't believe the menu is much different but you cannot compete with their quality of food and service. I keep reading their prices are high, but I'm pretty sure they're comparable to every other sushi spot on Staten Island. And by that I mean a restaurant that actually serves good sushi.  Can't wait to go again... and PS if price is an issue they have a Groupon.","Excellent quality, delicious food!I have been to all Fushimi locations many times over the years and I find it amazing that the quality is always the same. Food is fresh, delivered hot and very reasonably priced. The filet mignon with basil is my favorite.The service is good, the place is very well maintained and clean.",Fushimi Tottenville

In my opinion the food was just ok nothing special at all. It was very disappointing I couldn't have a glass of wine with my meal because they have NO LIQUOR license!!!

296,"I don't like reviewing places especially in a negative manner but.....Food is bland and tastes microwaved / edible at bestI ordered the same drink twice and never got it, didn't ask a third time because that would just be sadSo yea I could complain more but for me this place was just a waste of calories / waste of a date night with the wife.",Over priced kinda Mexican food with terrible margaritas came here for lunch few weeks ago with friends margarita gave me a headache which means the mix was pure sugar also asked for patron I'm sure it was well.  Also my first choice was a mojito but bartender informed me they had no mint on a Sunday afternoon which baffles me ... It's still a weekend how does that happen send some one to the super market to get mint ! If worse comes to worse. Not the first time it's happened here just first time complaining. Service was good no complaints there.Food was subpar asked for my burrito to be a changa on the combo meal I said charge me extra if need I understand. He said he has to see if the chef wanted to do it which puzzled me ... Just deep fry it for 2 mins. He said he would do but when I got it wasn't deep deep fried but when the bill came I was charged! Also asked for steak they couldn't do steak in the combo meals but I said charge me extra he said can't do it ... I'm still figuring out what can they do???,i've order the food online from them when i arrived to pick up for me suddenly these staff screwing and stealing my money and they don't even care just hung up and ignored me...,"Crazy so many bad reviews, I love coming here! Thursday-Saturday they have a DJ and it can get pretty crowded. I came on Memorial Day weekend so it was pretty quiet with not much going on. They start you off with their house chips and salsa which are so yummy. I love their chicken tacos, completely to die for, so crunchy and cheesy- just delicious. The beef burrito is outstanding too. The rice and beans are just ok, nothing to rave about, lacks a bit of flavor but I can let that slide. I had their peach sangria which was amazing, but strong! Not complaining because you definitely get what you pay for with that! 1 glass was enough for me. The service is outstanding, very attentive and always makes sure your water is full. Servers are so nice and great personalities. It's always a pleasure to go here when the staff is so friendly, kind and always serve with personality and a smile. Definitely a patron for life here, one of my favs.",Had a great night at cabo. Karaoke was fun.  My friends had guacamole and loved it. Our drinks were perfect.  Always a fun time here.,We went there cause it was my son birthday it was his choice when we first walked in you can smell the cigar smoke from next-door really strong big turnoff not many people in the place away or John was very nice the food was good the portions are nice the prices are fair ... The cigar smell is a big turn off Wow came here tonight for my daughters birthday 3 yrs later  Again her choice .. health dept should really look into the ventilation  ...  can't believe Cabo hasn't done anything about it Can't help his business for no smokers.,Cabo
297,"I do not like to leave negative reviews because I know they really do impact small businesses, and I do not wish to cause harm. However, I am disappointed by my experience... especially because Harry's Daughter looked like a cool place and I went there to celebrate a birthday.I made a reservation for 2 for Sunday brunch. When we arrived, I realized I didn't need to because the restaurant was not busy. First: We were given the wrong menu and chose from it only to find out we could not order what we wanted. Next, our waiter (who I am guessing is very inexperienced... I will give him that much) kept coming over every minute to see if we were ready to order. My man ordered a Bloody Mary. It came in a much smaller glass than a pint glass, and for the same price...not cool.Lastly: I ordered the Nutella waffles (note: plural) $16. I received 1 waffle. It was supposed to be topped with bananas, berries, vanilla gelato, maple syrup and Nutella sauce. The syrup was (cold) hot fudge, not Nutella and there were no berries or gelato. When I mentioned this to the waiter, he looked confused (clearly not knowing the menu) and went back to the kitchen. He told me they were out of these items. Dude, tell me that before I order. Plus... it's brunch. You gotta be prepared for weekend brunch!I could have made the waffle I was given at home for $2, and pointed this out to the waiter. They sort of made it right by taking the waffle off my bill, but overall we were underwhelmed. I would give this place a second chance, but there are also so many places I have yet to try in JC.Saving grace: the DJ was spinning some good deep tracks.","I liked the atmosphere, the drinks and the music they playing, but not so much the food. We have ordered jerk pork bao, red snapper and jerk chicken. The red snapper and pumpkin rice were delicious, but the jerk chicken did not taste like jerk chicken but tasted like just blant grilled chicken with sweet sauce on top.Also it looked that the hostess is being a waitress at the same time so the service was slow. I would go back just for the drinks and appetizer, but probably not for the dinner.","Cool atmosphere, and tasty fries. Very promising.But ... Don't order an off-menu drink.","If this bar was in my neighborhood I would be here twice a week! It's a tiki bar run by an Irishman and it has just the right mix of a cheerful pub atmosphere with a laid back tropical vibe. A great place to forget that winter is coming.Both the drinks and food are excellent here! I always enjoy the craft beer selection, and the rotation of cocktails caters to palates looking for sweet and refreshing drinks.I recently had the Hawaiian Sidestepper cocktail (ok I had 3 of them) with scotch bonnet infused tequila and passion fruit purée. Wow.Thank you Alasdair!","Stopped in for some dinner and drinks at the bar, wow!!!! So happy to finally check this place out! First off, the hospitality was second to none. Everyone from the bartender, bar back, and the owners mother was so warm and welcoming. The bartender recommend us to try the jerk chicken spring rolls, they were delicious. The jerk dipping sauce had a perfect kick and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. For our entree we shared the Oxtails with a side of plantains. It came with cabbage and pumpkin rice, man was this dish amazing!!!! We will be coming back for sure to try the famous Peri Peri shrimp, recommend by Radika ;)Lastly the drinks, so tasty and unique. I had the Jalapeño Watermelon Marg and my fiancé had the passion fruit scotch bonnet cocktail with black lava salt...Both packed a punch!See you soon,Harry's Daughter!!!",You won't find every dish with the same level of spice or seasoning as seen in traditional west Indian cuisine. That's not a bad thing. It is nice to have options for people who aren't accustomed to the heat and can try foods without that concern.I've been 3 times and had different entrees each time. Goat curry is the closest thing to home I've ever tasted.From a Guyanese girl - Mission accomplished.,Harry's Daughter
298,The pizza sauce is too sweet and the crust is too thin. There's too much cheese and whoever cuts the pizza is an idiot. Every single time I get from there the slices are either super big or super small. Everything else is decent. Could be better but there are so many worse pizza places on the island.,"There was a large bug baked into my pizza I ordered, which I understand happens. The issue I had was when I called to complain, the manager I spoke to not only claimed I was lying for free food (when I wasn't even asking for a refund), but failed to take any accountability, and claimed it was utterly impossible that a bug could get onto a pie. This was one of my favorite pizzerias, and this experience really disappointed me. Never experienced service like this in my life. Eventually was offered a free replacement after being called ""bro"" for 15 minutes, with a ton of aggressive language coming at me, but at this point I was done with this laughably irresponsible management stance.","Ordered the cheesecake I was given a completely frozen piece that must have just came out of the freezer and had freezer burn all over it.  Ordered zeppoles and was served raw dough balls (legit completely raw inside) with no powdered dusting on it, and ordered a cannoli that tasted like the filling was sour and old.  If I could give this place zero stars I would. Terrible.",Tastes like back home Highly recommended. Start with plain and work your way to others.,"This was already on my bucket list of places to try so when my friend suggested a pizza  outing and mentioned Nonna's I said ""yeah""So glad we tried this place. Had dining room to ourselves and ordered 3 different types of special slices including pepperoni, buffalo  chicken and lasagna. They were all delicious and got devoured. The staff was friendly and I'll definitely be back with more people next time!","Burnt to a crisp.Eggplant inside the roll was completely annihilated. Dry, tasteless!

Would you serve this to your family?",Nonna's Pizzeria
299,I had way better experience when the owner is working in here and cooking the food. My previous orders were delicious this one mushy and not good. It didn't help that young man working here was really rude and didn't use common sense. He never asked what I wanted exactly and then blamed it on me. They can be very annoying over little things and it makes for a bad time. I doubt I would return.,"Ordered take out - nothing was good.  Spicy tuna tasted old.  Kani salad was weird - very spicy, dry and full of carbs.  The yakitori was not good either.  Even the ginger was old and cheap.  And to top it off, they didn't even bring chopsticks.  I ate sushi with a fork.  Next place",Ordered the Joe burger and my brother got Hibachi. Holy cow they were both out freaking standing. Excited to try everything else!,"I really love the food here. I order quite often. The grilled yakitori appetizer sticks are delicious! I order a variety of them and they're a meal on themselves.Their sushi is fresh, always important.This week I decided to try them for lunch. Their combination bento box lunches are great! My friend ordered the salmon teriyaki & I had the steak.  Fantastic! We truly enjoyed it.I haven't tried the wings or the burgers, but I've enjoyed the sushi, the noodle dishes, and many of the appetizers.They're prompt with their deliveries, too.","This our 2nd time eating at Joe's kitchen and the food is DELICIOUS!! So fresh and the flavors are amazing! We tried the sushi, poke bowls and the cheeseburger and fries- by far the best thing to happen to Bayonne. We are not from here but visit family here and this is our new spot! Thank you for your friendly service! Keep up the great work! Will be back sooooon!","Wasn't expecting much since I'm never sure about restaurants that serve sushi, burgers and wings, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The Spicy Tuna was tasty and not too spicy.  The Salmon Avocado Roll was also good.  The sushi was fresh which is really what you want from sushi.  The wings were crispy and delicious.  I got the Thai Chili Sauce and my husband the blue cheese.  They delivered in the amount of time we were told.  We will be ordering again.",Joe's Kitchen
300,Terrible. Made a 6pm reservation for Mother's Day. Never did they inform us that the reservation would be subject to change because of the holiday. Pure chaos. No real system for who is next. Waiting over an hour for a table. Terrible customer service. Music is way too loud.,roachesroachesroachesroaches!!!!!!! this place is disgusting! este estabecimiento tiene cucarachas!,Out of all the restaurants I have been to this is the least of my favorite the place looks like we were in the middle of a construction there is no host the sevice wasn't very attentive they should be trained better because some of them looked lost. Overall I won't recommend it.,This is the best Peruvian restaurant !! The food is amazing ! !! I wish it was not too far!! You guy need to open another restaurant nearby!! There's no Peruvian restaurants where I live!! I can't wait to go back!!,Super authentic and locals spot. They serve Peruvian food and have live music. The music is Spanish and during soccer events this place gets packed! Good crowd and family friendly. They do have a full bar and serve beer buckets. Prices are $$ but most of their dishes are shareable!! I love coming to this place because I would always hve left over and enjoy if the next day. Customer service isn't the greatest here especially when it's busy. You'll be flagging down waiters to get things but the food is so flavorful and filling!! I would recommend this place if your looking for authentic tasting Peruvian dishes. THEIR CEVICHES ARE A MUST GET ITEM. This place isn't fancy and parking is a bit difficult.,"It's like a gem in the desert , secluded in a residential area, if you looking for a fresh ceviche & a cold drink, this is the spot to be. The seafood is cooked to perfection & the ceviches are refreshing and don't leave without tasting the Pisco",El Tiburon
301,Ordered lunch then waited 30 minutes to be served.I had the Turkey taco bowl it was tasty. My lunch companion had a veggie burger and sweet potato fries both came out cold.Servers were apologetic and said manager would come over. Manager never did! I guess we weren't important enough. They did comp my companion's burger.But what about my 30 minutes I lost?,"Avoid. Came on a Sunday. Waitlist said 20-40 minutes and my party of 2 was seated over an hour. Sat down. Utensils were hella dirty. The napkin wrapped around the utensils were even stained. Had to ask for another set. Ordered two drinks but only one drink came. The drink came after the entree. Dining 101- Drinks come BEFORE food. The server was never around for me to ask where my other drink was. I already gave up on the drink.  Asked for the check but server came with the check 5 minutes later. Had to tell them the drink wasn't received. He fixed the check. Waited another 5 minutes for the server to come get the check and credit card. Actually he didn't come, I had to wave him down. This place is not worth the wait and my time. I'm pissed that I'm writing this review because this place doesn't serve any more of my time. Also, the table behind us came in a few minutes after we came in. While leaving, we save that they still haven't received their food. That's at least a 30 min wait just for food.","This is regarding their delivery via GrubHub.- Delivery Time first estimated 845-855. -915am: started to call restaurant, said extension was busy. Was about to go there myself when we got a notification that order was on its way, should be there 915-930am.- called at 933am and spoke with an associate. Said that it they can't control delivery as some of the delivery guys will wait for another order to take with them. Was advised to rate the driver. I responded to say that unfortunately the driver can't be rated and only the restaurant can be rated. - Food was cold upon arrival at 940amThe driver stated that he just receives a notification to pick it up. PS: Quit GrubHub.","Tried this place for the first time today. And I think it's going to be my favorite place for breakfast and brunch in Staten Island. It does not cost you an arm and a leg to have a good breakfast here. We ordered omelettes and they were very well cooked. Good ambiance, attentive and smiley servers, good food with a good price. Definitely good for kids as the kids menu is pretty rich.",This was my first time here and was a nice place me and my family. I had never heard of this place so it was a treat for me. I love Staten Island! I was not super impressed but it was nice. The hostess was very warm and helpful since we had never been there before. She suggested the text method for our reservation and the time frame she gave us was spot on. We didn't wait long at all considering how crowded it was. I had the chicken and waffle sandwich which I was not a fan of after a few bites but I tried some of my families food and it was good. I honestly do not have any complaints. I will definitely go again but I definitely recommend making a reservation beforehand for sure. The service was great as well.

303,"Currently sitting here for dinner for a 6:30 reservation. It is after 8:30. We JUST received a pizza appetizer after 2 HOURS!! The disrespect or acknowledgement of this awful service is probably more disappointing than the delay itself. There's no empathy it apology for this disgrace. We haven't even received our food but even if it's the best food we have ever had, NOTHING is worth this kind of service and wait time. We are here with 2 little children and no one who works here seems phased by this abominable service. Awful. Will NEVER go back!!","I have never been in a restaurant with such horrible, horrible, inattentive service!And this was not the first time.

I scanned the room and saw at least 4 wait staff mulling around.We were told to sit at which ever table we wanted...ok, great.NO ONE ACKNOWLEDGED OUR PRESENCE - EVER..... we sat there for 15 minutes....not ONE ""I'll be right with you"", not one ""let me get you some water (or a glass for that matter), not one ""would you like to take a look at the menu""....NO HUMAN INTERACTION!!The one waitress was too busy chatting up the older couple next to us & the manager was looking to escape to have a smoke (the cigarette was in his hand as he walked around the patio area) - STILLLLL not acknowledging our existence.As we walked out past the manager, stating that we could not get service, he looked at us like a deer in headlights.What a disaster this place is....NEVERGOINGBACKEVERThird strike....I'm OUT!!",I was in town on business and was taken here by a friend.  The service was very bad and the food was average.  I was there back in 2015 and found this in my draft folder so I hope they have taken it up a notch since then.,"Once again, another fantastic experience at Mulberry Street.  We went early on a Saturday night and enjoyed a delightful meal...scrumptious salad, delicious penne pasta followed by a decadent cannoli.  Yum!

We still highly recommend this place!",We had an excellent experience at Mulberry Street Pub and Restaurant.  Delicious food.Friendly service.Lovely atmosphere.Highly recommended!,I really like the vibe within the restaurant. The decor is very homey. Only have ever been here for dinner and I have zero complaints. Their calamari as appetizer and chicken parm entree is my go to. The one thing that keeps us (me and my girlfriend) coming back is how accommodating they are with their gluten free menu (for my girlfriend). She always leaves here very happy since many Italian restaurants don't always have such vast gluten free options when compared to Mulberry Street. We've done take out once and the food still held up great upon unpackaging. Still crispy and delicious!,Mulberry Street Restaurant

A bug was found in a drink and in the food served. Things happen however management insisted there was no bug and they did not see it and did not offer an apology or any reparation.

Greek taco and burgers are excellent. Issue I have is when taking out, they always forget the sauce or something important to the order.

I have guests sitting in the house hungry because the rolls that we're suppose to arrive are nowhere to be seen.

Such a disappointment. Might as well tell the delivery guy to turn around and bring the rolls back to his boss.","Before I came to Tomo, I was a good kid unlike most people. I studied, said the word nibba, and watched anime. All of that changed after going to Tomo.I soon as I walked in, the owners son pushed me to the ground and stuck a bottle of vodka in my mouth. All the alcohol was going into my body. As it was happening, I started to change. When the bottle was finished, the son called me toxic and gave me a dragon roll. From that point on, I started to get boozed everyday. I didn't play PUBG anymore and stopped saying nibba. I guess u can say that Tomo changed me. For better or worse, that's for you to decide.","Entered with my friends and we were seated right away. The warm rag napkins that the waitress brought over to sanitize our hands smelled like feet. Ordered ten rolls, the sushi was OK. There was too much rice surrounding each roll and some of the rolls were undercooked. The place was dead but yet the staff was very inattentive. Still left a decent tip when the bill arrived and then left to go to the hookah spot next door. The cashier/one of the waitresses FOLLOWED us and appeared INSIDE the hookah spot and approached me asking ""if the bill was charged correctly"" aka wanting more tip money! Mind you, I had left her more than what the calculated percentage for tip was! Not my fault they weren't making much business that day due to the bad weather! So, REALLY?! How unprofessional!","Tomo is my go to sushi place love the Cali roll , Gulianna roll , Godzilla roll , shrimp tempura roll , Kani roll , rock shrimp , chicken nuggets , chicken lettuce wrap !! They never disappointment and the staff there is so kind they know me and my whole family , very welcoming weather we call or go there !!",I have been eating at this place for 20 years.  I learned how to use chopsticks in this place.  And yes management has changed several times.  And no I don't get to go as often as I used to.  But the sushi is still really fresh.  Environment is fun and cozy.  The place is clean.  The special rolls are inventive.  The service is friendly and quick.  Always has been and always will be my go-to sushi joint on Staten Island.,Our fave place !!! Been coming for a long time!! Delicious great food angreat staff .,Tomo Japanese Restaurant
307,"The first time I went there, I requested a special dish, instead of telling me there was an up charge (which was ok) I got a used car salesmen approach. She went in the back and came out and told me the boss said there's an up charge. Just tell me!! I understand!  Anyway, the food was good but I got pizzed off when I went to call the order in and the phone line was perpetually busy. So I drove there to place the order. No problem! Til I got there. The older woman ignored me and the younger girl started to take my order about 4 minutes after standing in front of the two of them.    As I'm giving her my order, the phone rings, instead of telling them to hold. She tells me, the guy standing in her restaurant to wait. I walked out, I had enough of the disrespect when you try to order there. This wasn't the first time I had to wait. But if I'm standing in front of you,  I'm the customer.","Well today I stopped in after a long day to grab something fast. I noticed they did not have any grade  sign noted on the door, so I asked the girl at the counter why.  She didn't seem to know what I was talking about . She said she will ask her manager. I only go to places that have an A rating. The manager comes out with my food and I ask her the same question.  She said to me hesitantly that there are new owners now and that they are waiting for the sign to come. Honestly, I've never heard of such  a crazy story.  I left and went home with my food. The food was just awful. Everything was way over salted . Tasted like the food was not fresh. I had shrimp with black bean sauce.  The shrimp had a fishy taste and smell. My husband had the. Roast pork egg foo young . That was awful too. I had   Scallion pancake appetizer too . They were way too thick and greasy . I will not be going back. I'm still wandering what the real story is abou the grade sign completely missing","The food is ok, but I give it a low rating for service. Aside rude people there, my friend wanted his egg roll on the oily side he just asked to not dry it as much they told him he wasn't allowed to eat it that way. Ok I don't prefer it that way but how they spoke to him was rude and they made him feel obese and terrible and he's 5'8 only 130. He's far from fat and shouldn't feel bad for liking his food a certain way, they could've said it's pre made or said no nicer than how it was handled. Food can be the best but if you have to go deal with rudeness andProblems there's no point. To add to that they charged my bank card twice on two separate occasions after the second timeI stopped eating here.",Probably the best Chinese food I had in years! Everything was very fresh and delivered very hot!The one thing that wasn't on the money was the delivery driver...ringing repeatedly upstairs and downstairs bell on and on ! Enough one time is enough But the food Wowreally outstanding,"I'm so happy that I found a really good Chinese restaurant for takeout. The food is great here. The plus side is that you can dine in as well, they have a few tables. When you walk in you can tell how clean and nice it is inside.  Everyone that works here is friendly. From the person taking your order to the delivery. I tried other takeout places but this one is by far the best! Definitely my go-to spot.","Craving Chinese? Look no further, this little spot locates in an unassuming strip mall serves up some delicious cuisine. Went with friends  and feasted on the Honey Walnut chicken  which is like chicken  candy coated in goodness with a garnish of broccoli on the side. We also ordered cashew chicken  which had a lot more veggies including mushrooms and babu corn. Both were tasty. Fried rice had some small shrimp and pork in it. Spring rolls were hot and fried to perfection. We were hungry  and probably consumed at least 2 dishes of the crispy noodles with duck  sauce that is served prior to the meal",Pacific Kitchen

Pastrami, brisket and latkes in Roselle Park? I would have told you you're nuts. It's a nice place run by a very friendly guy with a great staff.This is not the Second Ave. Deli or Katz's. The pastrami, while tasty and fatty, lacks a kick ass spice crust. The brisket is good but not great. Not as flavorful as Goodmans or Eppes Essen.The potato pancakes are excellent though. My brisket was piled high between two of them. Fun. A Dr. Brown's cream soda, a staple of any Jewish deli, was greatly appreciated.My wife enjoyed her take out beet salad. Like I wrote, an unexpected treat run by an eager to please gentleman with quite a culinary resume. Give it a try.","Found this gem on Yelp and decided to try it out. The place is fairly new to the area. The ladies at the register were helpful in choosing the right sandwich and soup. I had the heavenly roselle and butternut squash soup...delicious! I got a chnCe to taste all the soups rhey have available before making my plans and i got to taste pastrami too! The sandwich was huge! One person cannot finish it. It comes in layers stuffed with cole claw, bacon, pastrami etc Ample parking available on the street. I would recommend this place to anyone.",Pastrami & Pickles
309,The worst pizza on Staten Island.  Disgusting pizza that is overpriced and should close down to make way for something good.,I never had such a disappointing calzone in my life. Where's the cheese? There was none and it was tiny.  We also had a pepperoni pizza which was ok. Plus a 4.00 fee for using a cc give me a break. No other pizzeria in the area does this.,They want over $20 now for a pie delivered to your home. That's totally insane for a thin crust pizza. I ordered two pies for the kids and when he came to the door it was $42. When I went to the door I asked him what happened and he said that they raised the prices So I politely handed the pizza back and ordered from Nonnas Pizzeria where a pie is $17..Greedy greedy,"First time we went here we were disappointed, and thought we would give it one more try.  It was a beautiful summer day and we ordered a pizza and ate it outside on there balcony. Since we took it out it was more reasonably priced (still relatively high).  On Monday and Tuesday the price goes down on takeout.  It had a thin crisp crust and a flavorful sauce with the right amount of mozzarella.  My wife and I both enjoyed it. (We ate the whole pie).  Would do it again.","We were in the neighborhood, and decided to try Ciro Pizza Cafe for the first time.Looked at the menu and was surpised to see a large Plain Pizza was $17 (plus tax and credit card % was over $19-which we only found out when the bill was presented.)  No sign for the credit card %).  Th Pizza had a nice thin crispy crust, and the Mozzarella was Very Good quality.  For me the Sauce is what makes or breaks a pizza.  It was a bit bland, not especially flavorful.  Our server was very nice and accomodating.  Setting is simple and there is parking in their lot.Overall for me a real disappointment.",Really like the thin crust pizza. Especially the special on Monday night. Prices are high though. Should be more affordable and how can you charge $4 for delivery?,Ciro Pizza Cafe
310,Your manager is a bitch and an asshole and he told me oh your here all the time yeah cause the food is good,WTH? Food was pretty good and service adequate! I'll never bring my family here again!!! Bizarro people at the bar and a weird religious sex themed party in the adjacent room. I'm not sure what this really is!  My husband was groped at bar by some slut; and freaky party with religious costumes at next table.  Just NO,"We had been here before and enjoyed it, but the service and food have both gone downhill. The clientele are also crude, loud, and obnoxious. The people who come here don't treat it as if they are eating at a nice restaurant at all. The place has really taken a dive. While we were eating, the wait staff stopped serving us for quite some time. When taking our wine orders, it was clear that the waiter had never heard of some simple types of wine. The appetizers were dry, and everyone agreed that the pasta needed more sauce. We won't be coming back.","Went for a birthday celebration, and stage staff was really friendly, very attentive of our needs. They did not rush us at all even though we stayed a little over their business hours. The food was delicious, everything came out in a timely manner (however we did have to wait a little longer than usual for the meals but given our party size).","My neighbor told my husband about this Restaurant and we decided to go for an early dinner. They offered a pre-fix menu and it was absolutely great. The food was fresh and delicious,  Server was very nice, friendly and attentive. I will go back soon.","Excellent italian food prepared with fresh ingredients and superb staff of waiters. The food is outrageous!

Everytime I come to yaad pit it's a 20 minute wait.,"2 stars for still being in business. Sorry but the food wasnt great. 3 stars for the beef patties, 2 stars for the oxtail and jerk chicken.

The food was fresh and the service was friendly! It will be my new go to place!,Place is good. Service is friendly. Food is good. place us clean. It was nice and hot I could barelycarry it . Portion is generous. Plantains are way too dry though. I could tell from the photos they would be dry but I came for the brown stew chicken and everything else tastes good. 4 stars cause I like my plantains juicy.

313,"Came to Garden State Diner based off a quick ""best food in EWR Terminal C"" Google. Prices here are reasonableish for an airport, honestly, given the portion sizes. We got the chicken tenders with fries, and the burger with fries. They get props for not charging extra to replace chips with fries! And the fries and chicken tenders were hot, tasty, and came out fast. But the burger -- we ordered it medium, and it came out very red on the inside. Also really just one of the worst burgers I've ever tasted. Me and my friend both had one bite and put it down. I feel bad for not telling the innocent woman sitting next to us not to order it, honestly (she also took several bites and left it alone).","Giving 2 starts because there was no one to take our order for take away. Stood here for few minutes, at least 10....Someone had to go look for the cashier. As she approached the register she was unfriendly, unapologetic and unapproachable.","No wonder there wasn't a line. Tables were filthy, no one cleaned them and it took 15 minutes to get acknowledged   by our server. Btw, if your server is JOhn, get up and leave. You will be glad you did. After 15 minutes John came by and seemed angry that we had questions and then decided we weren't ready, so he left again without even taking a drink order. When he did come back he had a very specific way of taking our order and going out of turn, asking a question, or anything outside of this was not allowed. John actually didn't give a crap what we did, because there were 5 of us, he already had a guaranteed tip. Boy was he lucky. He dropped off drinks (with no ice), and didn't ever come back until he gave us his bill, and then he never cam back. 15 minutes later we had to ask another guy to help us cash out. Food was ok, not great, not bad. Would have chosen a different route, even if it were Wendy's if we knew John Hayes his job so much.","As far as airport good goes, it doesn't get much better. The service was very good and quick, the portions were generous and the prices were the same you would see outside the airport. Huge menu with plenty of options including healthy ones.If you have half an hour to sit and eat, I recommend coming here.","Five stars for people servers instead of iPad servers.Five stars for the service.Three stars for the food. Diner food. Not bad, not good.","I've flown through Newark before, but my boyfriend and I recently had a six hour layover there so I had more time to familiarize myself with the dining options. On a long layover, I like to find a sit-down restaurant to tuck away in and kill some time. However, it seems every dining option in terminal C (and possibly the whole airport) features iPad ordering. Look, I welcome our future AI overloads, but I need them to get a lot smarter before I give up on human interaction. Also, the iPads take up table space and are just constantly flashing with ads. It's impossible to forget where you are.Enter Garden State Diner. The food is as unremarkable as you would expect, but the music was not too loud and our order was taken by a person. Breakfast is served all day (you shouldn't even be able to call yourself a diner if it's not) and they have shakes and such. They serve Pepsi products. My boyfriend and I each had a burger. The buns were objectively terrible, but the burgers themselves were adequate. It was a thicker patty than I was expecting. Nothing gourmet, but decent for an airport.Our server was courteous and mostly left us alone without being unavailable, which is pretty much all I expect in an airport restaurant. Probably the best option for a sit-down meal in EWR terminal C. You don't quite escape the madness but the intensity is reduced.",Garden State Diner
314,"I was told this place was a must for ""Greek food"". What I got was a sorry excuse for a gyro platter. I was served hard dried out low quality gyro meat that was barely edible. The salad the meat was on was nothing special either. The feta cheese was way below anything I would expect being a fellow Greek. I honestly knew it wasn't going to be a good meal just by the appearance of how the food was being served. The place obviously depicts a business owner that has given up and lost all drive for making good quality food. Before I forget. If anyone eats here please DO NOT think that real Tzatziki sauce (gyro sauce) is anything like what this place is serving, it was horrible. I'm not asking for Greek food like momma makes but damn how can you call yourself Greek and serve such crap.","Let's start off with green eggs. I placed an order for a salad which came with old lettuce, tomatoes, and old stink green eggs. I called to complain to the manager ,however; the young lady that answered the phone did not care to give the phone to him or reimburse me. I'm giving 3 stars only because I've ordered food from here previously and which was good. Also, the prices are reasonable.","My go to post work out meal. Small place with a big menu. Every type of salad, sandwiches, and wraps you can think of. If you're like me after a big workout you want chicken. I typically order the chicken wrap loaded with veggies and ranch on the side. Teddys has different varieties of wraps to choose from. Go with the whole wheat. They even have while wheat pita.

317,"My family and I finished eating at this restaurant. Of course I didn't see all the bad reviews on Yelp and Google about the fried fish before my dad and I both ordered it. We both ordered red snappers and they were both over fried, not fresh and tasteless. When we complained to the waitress, Tatiana, she apologized and admitted they have an ongoing problem with the fish and people always complain about the fried fish. I don't understand how Tatiana couldn't speak up about the fish problem at the time we ordered red snappers. She continued to apologize and called her manager over. When the miserable manager came over to talk to us he just argued with me to the point that was totally disrespectful. He was proud to say that their restaurant fries ""500"" fishes a week and are all fresh. He explained that when you order a fried fish it's supposed to be fried. He basically tried to make a customer look dumb over a complaint. He didn't even apologize. He's obviously not fit to be a manager and has not one ounce of customer service.","I usually enjoy the food at this place, and I have gotten the fried fish there on many occasions. I ordered the same thing today and I noticed an off taste on it I tried another bite and it literally tasted old rotten and chewy I immediately told the waitress about it and she kindly took the plate. Next thing I know the ""manager"" comes up to me and says how the fish was ordered fresh and they tasted it and it taste fine. First of all I didn't really need an explanation all I said was I understand but it did not taste good it tasted old and weird he kept repeating him self maybe about 5 times about the ordering schedule and how many boxes he received. He didn't even offer to take it off the check after I ordered another different meal. He was extremely rude and unprofessional. Better Colombian place down the block. Someone needs to tell the manager that fighting like a baby and being defensive is not the correct and professional way of treating a client....",I ate at this restaurant with my family food was not what I expected to be.The food orders were fast but not tasty like my other Colombian restaurants that I visit.This place feels like it does better as a bar than a restaurant.Music was very loud and couldn't have a conversation.,"Service was fast! We walked in and was seated promptly at a table. We ordered the Mango Sangria-- it was good! The music, the atmosphere, and the people were a vibe.

I loved it!Located on busy street, we went around 8pm and parking was easy to find! Overall, i truly enjoyed myself and the experience.","Came here for my birthday dinner. Party of 10 and I didn't make a reservation. They sat us immediately upon arriving. We were seated towards the back of the restaurant close to the kitchen. They had live music playing and were surprisingly busy for a Thursday night. We started with a large pitcher of red sangria. We got about 11 cups out of it. We got the empanada as apps with came with about 6. As an entree I got a shared the picadas mateo. Which is a meat platter that comes with steak, ribs, pork, sausage, yuca fries, tostones, maduros, potatoes and arepa. It comes with a salad and we ordered a side of rice. The meal was suppose to be for 3 but it was A lot that we had leftovers. My cousin for a breaded pork steak which was huge and he said was really good. Someone else got a Bandeja paisa, bistec encebollado, and garlic shrimp. Everyone had left over because the portions were huge. We all had a great time there. Everyone enjoyed their meal.

I WOULD! As a mexican trying to find actual mexican food was greatly disappointed with what i was served.

Okay then, one good thing...they did have water.","This place is so stinkin CUTE!When plans at another restaurant fell through we ended up here.(Thanks Yelp!) Upon entry I saw alot locals and I got excited because that's how you know the food is good right?? The decor is super colorful and puts you in a good mood. You're able to sit anywhere you'd like in the restaurant and someone comes over shortly to greet you with a menu. I started off with a margarita, which was pretty standard. The menus is no frills and easy to get through.I ordered chips/guac, tostadas, and chicken tacos. The food here was super authentic. The guac was nothing special..but I really enjoyed my chicken tostadas and chicken tacos. I left here pretty full as the portions are JUST right!

My  go to has always been the chicken enchiladas with green sauce! Comes with 3 enchiladas , rice and real refried beans! Yum. Very filing . They give you salsa , diced onions and jalapeños and also lime on the side! Perfect! Parking is street - metered and usually hard to find especially at night . Area can be sketchy at times around Elizabeth ave.If I'm in the area I will definitely stop by again! If you want Mexican and are in the area- come here !","Delish ... I love going there with family and friends. Even tho it's a small/family restaurant we keep coming back as the Mexican flavor is authentic.Drinks, food and service is great I know the menu by heart. They will accommodate you all the time Took my coworkers and they love this place as well",La Cabaña Restaurant
319,The place was a dump and the area was no so hot . Small place didn't even have room to seat us so we walked out and canceled our Groupon !,"I went for the first time during Easter Sunday lunch.  I was told the all you can eat was $20 even though I read on this site others paid $15.  I thought maybe they raised the prices for Easter.  Okay, no problem. Tried the rice and it was hard. Hard like it was refrigerated and reheated.  I go to pay my bill, and it's more than I anticipated.  I paid with my card and added tip.  I get my receipt and they automatically charged my card 12 percent tip. It was only my husband and I so it wasn't a large party.  I didn't like that I was obligated to pay a tip and wasn't even informed on top of paying more per person. I won't be going back again.","I bought a Groupon― $29 for buffet, soda and dessert for two people. Because the buffet only costs $14.99, you don't save much. The third person in our party didn't use a Groupon so we only realized after he paid the check that we were charged for the sodas that were included with the Groupon...There is a decent variety of sides and salads on the buffet (try the beet salad) but the real star of the show is all the grilled meats. We went on a Sunday at noon so there were plenty of choices. Just take your plate up to the counter and someone will carve the meat right off the spit for you. We enjoyed the grilled sirloin and the beef ribs the most. The chicken wrapped in bacon was nothing special. The pork sausage was alright but I'd rather save room for the better meats. My friends also had the garlic chicken and chicken hearts.We were really looking forward to the pao de queijo (cheese bread) but unfortunately there was none. It sounds like they don't often have it. (One of the carvers said his mom used to bake the bread for the restaurant.)The Groupon comes with a choice of flan, passionfruit mousse or vanilla(?) mousse. Flan has never been my favorite dessert but it was decent. The passionfruit mousse, which had a little chocolate syrup near the bottom, was like a punch to the face. Whether it was a flavor grenade or a flavor bomb, it certainly wasn't ""da bomb"". I don't think I've had passionfruit so concentrated before. It was so strong that even amongst the three of us, we only ate maybe a third of the mousse.The restaurant is more like a deli than a Brazilian steakhouse but it was good value. I don't need someone to carve the meat tableside for me anyway.  There were plenty of other customers so it seemed like a fairly popular place, even if it's not in the best neighborhood.I'd visit again if I was in the area. We drove about 40 minutes to Hillside solely to try the restaurant so I'm not sure if I'd do that again.","Great service. Clearly a primarily Spanish speaking staff and clientele, and I don't speak a word of Spanish... everyone was super friendly and patient.The food was absolutely amazing! Great buffet, but that is a rookie mistake, save room for the Radicchio! The meat was always perfect and practically came out too fast to keep up, almost ;-)Will be going back repeatedly!Plenty of parking... if the lot right next to the restaurant is full you can park in the lot across the street, the entrance is just around the block. Get a ticket from the attendant and have it stamped inside... again, super easy and friendly!","This is gonna be my spot of grilled meat fast place. No need to spend over $25 at RIO on rt 22. For Brazilian.I like the buffet spread. My go to is the beans with the fried flour sprinkled over it, the empanadas, the fried plantains. The everything from the meat counter is great. I even liked the sausage. I think sausages is just filler at AYCE places but the ones here were very tasty.Parking may be an issue because it's a busy road and there's only street parking.","We visited Taste of Brazil because our son purchased a Groupon for 2 meals with a drink and dessert. It was a bit out of the way for us, but worth the trip. The appetizers/salad bar was good with plenty of fresh selections. The meats kept coming out. Sausage, hot sausage, top sirloin, brisket, chicken legs, chicken thighs with garlic and chicken wrapped in bacon. All of the meats were delicious, the top sirloin and garlic chicken were my favorites. For dessert we each had the tres lecces cake. Everything was good and the staff was very friendly. I would return.",The Taste of Brazil
320,"Terrible service over the phone. Terrible service when you pickup your food, terrible food period! Everything was sweet. Food was horrible just horrible! $30 on 2 chicken dinner and still had to order papa johns costing $47. NEVER AGAIN ‍. Gave it two chances WILL NOT be a third!","This place is the most UNPROFESSIONAL place I have ever been to! They are rude and will look at you when you walk in the door like you have 3 heads. I have visited this place a few times trying to give them a chance since they are in my neighborhood, as well as had Uber Eats deliver and no matter the level of contact, it's all the same. Rude, obnoxious, ignorant. There was a problem with my Uber Eats order and I called about the missing items, and they hung the phone up on me. Luckily we he Uber Driver was kind enough to circle back and pick it up. Smh! I tried and tried to give them the chance but I will not be spending another dime at this establishment. DO BETTER!!","Wings are not cooked all the way. I ordered wings and I was already turned off by the floury taste, but once i broke my wing i noticed a lot of blood. I am disgusted. Never ordering their wings again!!!","I love young people when I'm teaching not hungry and expecting great food! The young staff on Saturday seemed out of place and out of sorts. On a fifty fifty recommendation we came hungry. Nice place, more comfortable seating. Smothered turkey wings should be smoothed with hot gravy and not dry and cold to bone....opps...collards were good, yellow rice was...good,,,,corn bread...interesting and good! One piece of fish in a fish sandwich,,,,,,THAT was supposed to be cat fish....not good! Fish fry was greasy and matted coating. I'm a Gordon Ramsey foodie, never underestimate your customers Savannah. All in all, it was a 6 out ten mainly because we waited in an empty restaurant for almost 35 minutes for fried fish and already done smothered turkey wings...We love to support our great restaurants when we find them. Serve great food and attitude and you may have something other than a take out place. It's not difficult and you know what you want when you eat out, why should we want less. Strive for excellence and farm to table soul...","Hmmm...where do I begin with this?!I want to be FAIR of course.But the reviews aren't all wrong. I was very nervous about coming here because I read the reviews and I had a GROUPON that was going to expire soon so I had to use it up or lose my money.So I came here despite all the negative reviews.I will begin by saying the SERVICE is BAD, just BAD.The woman who served us had a sour disposition, sloshing around dragging her feet like she can't be bothered. Sat at the table for 15 minutes before she came with silverware, and a stingy 2 napkins for two people. Took forever for the cornbread and drinks. Had to ask for straws, had to walk up to the counter to get the hot sauce, nobody bought extra napkins that we asked for....just sloppy! And it wasn't even that busy!Ok so now the FOOD:I had a pork chop dinner with Mac and greens. WHY ARE THE GREENS SWEET?Nah.Hot sauce couldn't even save this.Mac was *just OK, wouldn't surprise me if it was stoffers, pork chops were EXCELLENT Daughter had fried red snapper and that was good, but the potato salad was SWEET too! Now I like relish in mine as well but that was way too much, the yams were good. The cornbread was a little bit too thick and cakey to be delicious.Service was so much in disarray that I had to go and pay myself at the register.Idk guys.These were SIMPLE, basic service needs and you failed.It wasn't even BUSY so please help me understand why? Oh and one more thing, y'all really need to do a good detail cleaning bc there was LOTS of DUST on the air vents...GROSS!!I'm glad that I got to visit this establishment but never again","1. Customer service. I'm not even going to explain the level of unprofessionalism the staff holds onto so naturally. How is it that you have customers spending MINIMUM $20 a pop and you can't even ACKNOWLEDGE the customer at the restaurant just to let them know that you see them and will be with them in a moment? Someone who orders a drink to go AFTER he's already paid needs to wait until the next customers who's food is sitting is taken care of. I excused myself and asked the lady if anyone is tending the register..her response was ""Ma'am we will take care of you in a moment there are only three of us here..we'll get to you when we get to you just give us a moment"".  Didn't even have a clue why I was there! My food was already bagged up and sitting on the counter but was SLOTHING her way to making a drink for a customer to go. Customer Service 101...Warmth before cold. Seconds before minutes. Simple as that. You ALWAYS want to take care of things that will only be seconds before things that will take longer. Swiping a card for a customer to sign only takes seconds whilst making a customer a to go tub of drink takes longer. Warm food will get cold whilst a cold drink can sit for a few moments.  Then she comes back while I was signing being a smart ass talking underneath her breath to the cashier lady who took my payment. There was a lady who was so shocked at the server's response and how she unapologetically snailed around the restaurant that she came outside whilst I was leaving to tell me that she knows the owner and will be sure to inform her of the incident. 2. $41 and I got spoiled Mac & Cheese on all three orders. I'm too exhausted to even go back and complain besides having company over whom I bought the food for. It's that taste you get when you eat cereal and the milk is going bad. Well their milk or cheese must have been going bad that they used to make this batch.  I totally understand that things like this are certainly possible. But you catch it. As a chef or cook..you fast your own food and catch the mistake. This place has a great location and great food that is linden residents wouldn't mind paying extra for to support our town business owners. But the customer service is horribly horrendous. I've met the owner and she is a beautiful soul inside and out. I even personally  know her God Son whom is an amazing person himself. I really hope you guys invest into your staff so as to make the experience of being at your what could be positively memorable restaurant the FIRST go to when wanting to enjoy a night out.

321,"I used to love this place. Recently ordered delivery and every single dish was awful. The lentils were extremely underdone, another dish tasted like there was about a cup of salt dissolved in it and we couldn't even eat it. Usually we have leftovers to enjoy for a couple of days but everything wound up in the garbage, very disappointing.",So sad to pay $5 on delivery. This is always my go to Indian place if you crave a nice biryani. Delivery is fast if you are living close in the area. Still a fan but is now hesitating on the delivery charge.,"Ordered lamb curry, they gave us a hand full of white rice, they are trying to be cheap with high price, later ordered a lamb biriyani which is full of bones with no meatWorst Indian restaurant",Awesome place. Great people. Chili chicken and rice is legit....everything is good here,"I order delivery from here often and the food is always great! Favorites are the kothu roti, Channa saag, and most recently the spinach pie! But I have tried quite a few items and I have never been disappointed!","Called in an order. Was very specific on what I wanted. Before any thinks I was difficult or had extreme demands. I ordered a ""chicken tikki masala"" and requested it to be ""extra extra spicy"". I repeated it at least twice and even made a joke that I could handle it as she asked if I was sure when I placed my order. I responded ""yes extra spicy please"". The order arrived roughly 45 minutes later and wasn't even mild spice. It had no heat at all and the food was warm as well. There was barely any flavor and was very disappointing. I called as requested to speak to the manager. Was informed by the same woman that took my order that she had ""just left"" asked for the managers name and she refused to share. Was promised a call back two days ago and nothing. Would not recommend this place as they by their actions do no care about the quality of the food they are serving and the customer service is poor at best. There are better places to eat Indian food!",Spice Rack
322,"I really expected to like this place and drove about 30 minutes from Montclair just based on the 4 stars I saw and the price. This was a mistake. I should have read the reviews and looked at photos of the food. Spicy Salmon Roll- Contained a lot of stuff but very little salmon. I'm not exactly a sushi expert. I typically buy mine from Whole Foods. But even the grocery sushi roll is better than this stuff. You get a hunk of fish you can see and a lot less fluff. Calamari- You know when you eat fried food and it doesn't make you sick but makes you depressed? Imagine I'm in my car facing another 30 minute drive back home, was deflated by the fish-less sushi so I reach for the calamari because now I'm super hungry. Mistake. Not sure what they fried the calamari in but the taste was off and very greasy. Pad Thai- I arrived home tired and disappointed. I tasted the calamari but immediately put it in the fridge and will probably throw it out. I'm mad I wasted time and money. I'm a school teacher. I could have had two packages of salmon rolls from Whole Foods for the same price. Locally sourced. Fresh. Filling. And no GMOs. Never again.","Food is consitent and good, nothing specialDelivery is free and always on time",I'm always suspicious about Asian place that makes both Thai and Japanese or Chinese.  That usually means it's a chinese place in disguise because most real Japanese or Thai only make their own food.  My suspicions were correct this is a fake Thai place.  Drunk man noodle was awful one of the worst I've had.  I also had some sushi and it was mediocre.  I would stay away or maybe stick to the popular items..,"Awesome cozy sushi bar where you can get anything you want from sushi, rolls, Chinese, Malay and Thai foods. I usually go in there for rolls. They make them good and the service is always super friendly. Get some great food and enjoy the atmophere in there with some beer or wine, cause this place is BYOB. P.S.: Green tea is good in there as well.",The food is not bad. Price is great service is excellent. Nice cozy place sushi is spot on.

We made reservations at 6:30 pm. For about 8 people. When we got there the place was empty. We ended up leaving at 9:30 pm. Our food TOOK FOREVER!!! It wasn't like the place was busy so we didn't understand why we waited so long and why they were so unorganized. We didn't even get our appetizers until an hour later. Which were two salads & clams. Nothing special. We had to ask for our entrees more than once. It was so sad especially being that we were there to celebrate a birthday. The waiter at the end apologized for everything taking so long which was nice but it proved he realized how bad it was. Unfortunately, we will not be back",Not for nothing but I thought Italian restaurants served a bunch of food I just ordered this on uber eats and spent $13.00 and got 6 raviolis I could have ordered from a pizzeria and got more smh still hungry after eating this. Should have helped this place before I ate here never again.,"What a wonderful meal we had tonight. The linguine mare e  monti  was so tasty and so was the hot antipasto. My family also enjoyed their meals. Our waiter, Alejandro was attentive and very quick to accommodate our needs. It was our first time there and we would go again. Another waiter, Chris, played a lovely piano piece for us. It was a terrific bonus to our experience.",Great Italian place to dine at !

The rice was cooked perfectly and was full of flavor. I will definitely be back!!!","Note: there is a serious upcharge for eating in. It's like 20%. Ridiculous. The food is meh at best. The meat was bland and the rice and fries are not seasoned at all.Takeout prices are on par with most other places and the people who work here are really nice. I wish the food was better. There are soooo many options for Portuguese in Elizabeth, I'd skip this place.","It's been years since my first visit and I have to say, the most impressive part about Costa's is that very little has changed.  The restaurant still has the feel of a family owned business, but one that can crank out food at a rate that some bigger and more expensive restaurants could only hope to emulate.  When I am in need of a quick meal and don't have the time to cook, I know I can count on Costa's!Among my favorite items to order are their garlic chicken and garlic broccoli.  Both make for a very satisfying meal when put together.  I also love the sausage appetizer but be warned it is salty.  You'll want something like veggies or rice to cut it.I recently tried their ham and cheese empenada for the first time.  It was a *bit* too salty for me but it definitely packed some serious flavor punch!  I will likely try the beef or chicken ones next time.Costa's is dependable and more than worth the price.  I am happy that this spot is still around after all these years.",Costa's BBQ
325,"From the start this place was off. The sushi order had a funky taste! Then, when they presented the meet portion, it was pathetic! I won't be back!",First of all I ordered 4 rolls very basic one California 3 avocado and two fried rice orders with chicken they send the California roll regular style and then send the other 3 hand wrapped EWWWW!!!!! I'm sorry but I don't not enjoy my rolls in that style after seeing the mistake I immediately called and told the host who then proceeded to tell me that my wife chose it that way. So I said it was a accident she's nine months pregnant and dealing with 2 toddlers could u please just exchange the food a simple swap it's a total cost of 9$ he proceeded to tell me that since it was her fault he would not fix it and that the only way I could receive my food the way I wanted it is if I paid again which is ridiculous it was a simple fix and I order from there 10 times a week suffice to say I will no longer order from there or recommend there food to anyone I know.

We ordered our regular miso and edamame. When the waitress came to take our orders i asked her doKids eat free on Mondays?  (I read kids eat free in siparent I think).

331,"A month or so ago, I went to this establishment with my aunt. We ordered takeout because my folks weren't able to meet for a sitdown meal.I ordered about $140 worth of food. My complaint isn't about the food though, it's with the front counter staff. I don't know the name of the woman who charged me, but the name on the receipt was Dewilka.When the food came out, a coworker asked Dewilka if I left a tip in Spanish. Dewilka said ""ni mierda"" (not even sh*t). She then proceeded to tell her coworker that if she would've gone to ""my people's"" restaurant then ""my people"" would've asked her for a tip. Also, when my aunt asked for the containers to be separated into 2 bags, Dewilka gave my aunt the nastiest sideways look. I wish I could've caught it on camera.Anyways, I'm pretty sure she assumed I was Chinese even though I'm not. I'm Korean-Japanese. She also assumed I didn't understand Spanish because of how I looked. Nowadays, you really have to watch what you say around people. You never know what the other person knows.As for the tipping bit, I have never left a tip when I ordered takeout when personally picking it up. I'm in no way obligated to leave a tip if I'm picking it up myself. If anything, if I were to leave a tip, it would go to the person who cooked the food.I know she won't be disciplined for her behavior and loose tongue, but I figured I should share my experience with this Noches de Columbia.

332,"5 stars only because I can't put 6, Great service, you know my nigga work here so he putting in that work, shout out to the homie making that good ass pizza, I mean shit expensive but it's good asf I would've gave this place 10 stars if they let me, matter of fact I forgot iPhone had the star emoji so lemme put 5 more in here  but the plaza is dope and the parking is huge I can fit all 3 of my maybachs in there. But homies be holding it down making my food fast as shit, love ya homies keep the pizza coming extra cheese please!!!!! I even killed time waiting for my food breaking that high score in mortal kombat 3 I spent $5 on that alone",So if I could give no stars .. I would.. currently standing here like an idiot  for about 20 minutes.. waiting on a pie that will probably be mediocre.. I've seen about 6 pies leave to be delivered and 2 people that came in after me were helped and left before me.. customer service is terrible.. and honestly I will not be coming back.. unless this pizza is phenomenal and it probably won't be!,"I stopped in today because I needed a quick spot to grab pizza.  I had been to this place many years ago and maybe under different owners (like 20 years ago).  I ordered a plain and white slice to go with a diet coke.  It came to $8.70!  I was sure she charged me wrong.  After checking the price, I assumed it must be quality pizza to come with that large of a price tag.  I was sadly disappointed.  The dough is thick, cheese is bland and sauce is fine.  I didn't eat the plain slice I ordered because it just wasn't worth it.  The white slice I mostly ate, but it's because it had garlic on it.  I'll eat garlic anything.  They both tasted like they had been sitting out for a while.  I tend to think this shop survives due to it's location near a bus stop and major avenue.","I used to live around the corner from Pizza D'Oro. It was the go-to for me and my wife as well as any visitors. I've returned several times since moving when my job has brought me to Staten Island. I'm happy that they've started to accept credit cards! To me, it's probably the best pizza in Staten Island! The dine-in special is a great deal. I took advantage of it during blizzards when no one wanted to drive and also a day or two after Hurricane Sandy, when it was still open despite all of the issues that occurred in the aftermath of the storm. It's so easy to drive by and not notice. Make sure that you check it out if you live in the area or are visiting.",Best pizza in SI IMO- been going since the early 2000s and nothing has changed which is the best thing about it. That sauce is sweet and the crust is fluffy -- classic pizza spot! Home run every time,"First off I just want to let everyone know I specifically downloaded Yelp just to give this review because this is how ridiculous this order is. Honestly didn't eat the pizza but got the chicken tenders and fries. Was the absolute WORST order of chicken and fries I've ever had in my entire life! How do you mess that up? First off the chicken is not what you think you'd get from a pizza shop, it was the frozen kind you buy from Tyson in the big bag. Also they were barely cooked I had to reheat my whole order and it STILL wasn't good. And the fries? They told me my order would take longer because the steak fries take some time... okay sure. So once I got them they weren't even cooked!! They were legitimately hard and had to go in the over and still weren't cooked right. Never ever ever ever giving them business again, like is this store a front?! So disappointing.... I ended up heating up leftovers from a previous night.",Pizza D'oro
333,The person behind the counter was so rude to my wife. We had take out from there so many times in the past and I can't believe that it happened today. He knows us both. We will never go back. Disrespecting a woman is not acceptable.,"Highly addictive and affordable. A-1 is my go to spot for a falafel and hummus. I usually get the falafel sandwich (there is a hint of lemon which takes it to another level), babaganouj (smoky eggplant dip is flavor insanity in a bowl)  and a side salad (their salad is so light and seasoned perfectly with onions and spices...love that!!) The only bummer is that they do not take card on the phone and I'm sure they have their reasons which is why I have no problem hitting up an ATM to get a $20 for delivery or taking the the trip for a pick up lolol",Food is good and the portions are huge for the price. They take forever to make it though so order wayy ahead. The restroom is so nasty though that always makes me question the cleanliness of a place. Overall it's the only halal restaurant in Bayonne so cant complain,"Highly recommended this place, I'm from Boston and we stopped to A-1 Grill at for late dinner the food was so good everything is homemade. The place is very clean and just renovated, the portion is good.","Good place. Tasty shawarma and nice portion, flavorful tahina and sauces (although I dont like how they charge extra for sauce). Also love how they have traditional Egyptian food like hawashi and koshari, etc.",It's great place to get middle eastern food They have a great service and nice place to set,A-1 Grill
334,Very pricey for take out. Every time I order chicken it's always nervey. You ask for hot oil it like pulling teeth.,I had their shrimp wraps......The wraps tasted like i was actually eating raw shrimp ....never going to come here ever again !,Food is pretty bland. From a Chinese take out standpoint the place is extremely clean. Staff is nice. But for the prices they charge and the taste it's just not worth it. Extremely over priced.,My favorite Asian food restaurant in New York. All my experiences ordering delivery and eating inside have been great and the food is absolutely delicious! I highly recommend the sesame chicken and pineapple fried rice.,"Ordered ribs, pork fried dumplings, and some egg rolls. It all tasted very fresh and hot. It is a bit pricey but it was very good Chinese food. Also the dumplings were very big.",They give you a hearty portion for the lunch special. Quick service and one of the better drunken noodles I've had in SI. Nice interior.,Empire East
335,I ordered two vodka slices which were generally acceptable for my pizza standards. I'm not a fan of a think crust pizza. This was on the thinker side. Wish it was thinner.,The location and the price are good. The pizza is about average. They offer coupon deals through several online discount sources.,"Big letdown, considering I used to visit this property almost daily as a child when it was Villa d'Este. Pizza was dry. Use more olive oil. Prices are reasonable.","Decided to try Ambrosino's after driving by and wasn't disappointed. I was the first one in which was awesome because everything was coming out of the oven. I went and had the chicken marsala slice with mushrooms and a spinach with artichoke slice. The Marsala slice was a knockout of a slice that was loaded with mushroom and Marsala flavor. The spinach slice was amazing with fried garlic and globs cheese. Most of their slices are pan style but don't let that distract you from the fact that they taste great.For an unassuming pizzeria which there are 1000 of on Staten Island, Ambrosino's specialty slices are pretty damn good and worth their price. $7 for two specialty slices these days is a bargain.Try them out!","Ordered a 1/2 mushroom & 1/2 pepperoni pie, chicken wings, and garlic knots. Pizza: Like the experience of some other reviewers, the cheese slid right off the pizza when I picked up the very first slice. This was the recurring theme as we attempted to eat it. The tomato sauce was flat and had no depth or flavor. They also use canned mushrooms, which I found disappointing since almost every other pizza place we've tried around here has used all fresh ingredients. Even more disappointing than the soggy mess this all became was the lack of overall flavor. -2 starsGarlic knots: Decent and tasted fresh. Knots were fluffy and moist. All pieces were generously slathered with butter and seasonings. +1 starChicken wings: The wings were crazy small! Like, they came from tiny baby chickens. However, the breading was good and the wings were browned just right. They also put the buffalo sauce in a small container so you can control how saucy you want them. This kept the wings from becoming soggy, too. +1 starDelivery: Delivery was on time and food was hot. The guy straight up said, ""Here is your order. Thank you for your tip. This has been prepaid already."" We tip through the ordering app, so sometimes we wonder if the drivers actually get them (have been told by a driver for a different restaurant they don't always get the tips from app orders). I really appreciated this acknowledgement. Therefore, this is the only reason this place gets 3 stars instead of 2 from me. +1 starI really expected the ""main dish"" to stand out and was utterly disappointed. While the garlic knots and wings were good, they didn't blow me away. Due to how disappointing the pizza was, we won't be ordering from here again.",My family ordered tonight linguine with calamari in marinara sauce it was amazing . We have been going to Ambrosino's for 5yrs . They have the best pizza. The service is great and the staff are wonderful.,Ambrosino's Pizzeria
336,"This place was a bit of a disappointment.  The outside could use a lot of sprucing up.  The inside is one large dimly lit dining room.  I had called for a reservation and when we got there went to inform the host we had all arrived.  He didn't let me speak and just told me to wait over there.  We waited for 20 mins, were seated and then waited over an hour for our food.  The food was ok nothing amazing.","Ordered the lasagna and the veal parmesan: BOTH were a disaster. The food here tastes like you handed someone a recipe for something they've never made before.. We went for dessert to see if we could at least enjoy that - the tiramisu was soggy and presented like it was dumped on a plate at a prison cafeteria, the coffee was washed was like a tea.I'm surprised they are in business with this low quality food charged at Manhattan prices.. most shocking to see the place was packed - tells you there aren't many good Italian restaurants here.",,"I was a tad reluctant to visit Torna A Sorrento as it looked like a neighborhood place that outsiders may not be all that welcome.  Maybe I just watched too many Soprano's episodes, but wondering in off the street to a quiet Italian restaurant in NJ while dining alone raised a few flags.  However, I am glad that I decided to go.Upon walking in, I saw no Hostess, but the man behind the bar came out and gave me an inquisitive look.  I admit, I am not from around here and I stood out in the crowd.  He asked me if I wanted a table or if I preferred to sit at the bar.  Wanting to go with the flow, I told him that I would sit wherever he wanted me to sit.  I think this helped get off to a good start.After seating me at the bar, the same guy (John) gave me an extensive menu to pick from.  As I looked around there was not many other people in the place, except for another nice couple at the bar and a business meeting of some sort that included a gathering of about 12 men who looked like they meant business.  Again, maybe too many Soprano episodes.As time passed, I began to like the place.  I overheard the couple at the bar mention the beach, so we struck up a conversation.  To prove what a small world it is, I learn their son belongs to the same organization I work for, and I would later learn that the guy (Bob) and I are Fraternity Brothers.  It was an amazing experience.  John, seeing that I had befriended the nice couple joined in the conversations.  It was quite an experience.I walked in with suspicions and apprehension.  I left with friends.  I am reminded about  the Billy Joel lyrics - ""John at the bar is a friend of mine"".  John and Bob made this stop in New Jersey a great one.  I will be back for sure.  Oh yeah,,,,, and the food is pretty good as well!  :-)","Very friendly, my 20 yr old extremely picky eater son said it was the best chicken Parmesan that he's ever had. Great food, if you leave hungry, there is something wrong with you. Lol","Had a pleasant lunch. Chatted with one of the owners. Meal was solid, with a nice Chianti.

337,"As a lifelong customer of Nunzio's, since the 70s, I have yet to have another pizzeria show me that they have surpassed these guys.If you're looking for the best slice of pizza, look no further than here.","We have only ever tried the white clam pie. It's so good, we just keep coming back to it. However, the most recent order had way too much cheese on it (weighed down the pizza badly) and the clams were not even salty. Like, someone rinsed them or soaked them in water and took out all the flavor. I mean, I don't think they were old because I didn't get sick...?Regardless, I was really surprised. Out of all the clam pies we've eaten from Nunzio's in the past year and a half, this was the first bad one. It was so sloppy and bland! What is happening? I'm almost scared to order another one because I really want to preserve my memory of their white clam pie, made the proper way lol.","For the Owner: Went for a third time to try pizza after delicious calzone we had 2x. Called to order 2x and got hung up twice on Saturday before 8pm. Finally they picked up and we a pizza and a calzone, order taker seemed gruff. Arrived 20minutes later and picked up. Asked if busy (didnt mention got hung up on 2x) and nice young fellow said no. Went home immediately and calzone had come with no sauce. Both Pizza and Calzone were very cold. First time we had to wait for calzone and was very very hot. Dont you put the freshly done product on shelf above oven to keep toasty??? Called and line perma busy 8:40pm. Guess closing up. Product other than cold was mediocre after warming up. Wanted this place to be our go-to after first 2 good experiences but very disappointed. Not consistent so why gamble with time.","Nuncios is a Staten Island staple. So I had to try. Unfortunately I wasn't super hungry when I came . So I just ordered 2 slices of pepperoni. And t was good. Crispy crust, good sauce and cheese was nice. I'd say pizza was 3.5/5. He ambiance is very relaxed. I think they could spruce up the place. Make it more of a place to dine instead of a take out spot. Wish I could of tried the other dishes. I'll come back and maybe my thoughts change. LIT","As for the service, I went with a group of friends (5) and the waitress came up to us asking for our order WITHOUT A PAPER OR PEN. She took everyone's order through her memory which I knew would be a problem because 5 minutes later she comes back with a paper and pen trying to ""review"" our order again (she obviously forgot as expected).As for the food, the pasta was hard and flavorless, the pizza was cold, the chicken parm was impossible to bite let alone enjoy, the Alfredo sauce tasted like raw milk & the soda tasted like they went to the dollar tree next door for some off brand soda and watered it to maximize their supplies. Sprite was sugar water at best, & they couldn't even do water right, it tasted like they pulled a pipe from the toilet and served what came out!","Great food in a convenient location. Great slices, amazing rolls, nice calzones & rice balls. Staple for the area, one of those classic multi-generational establishments that never gets old! Moved off the island a decade ago but always rotate between Nunzio's & Brother's off Forest when I am visiting my folks. The food here is always reliable, consistently hitting the spot for decades!",Nunzio's Pizzeria & Restaurant
338,"Since this restaurant has good review, I thought I could expect a good one. Wrong.Pizza was not good at all and cold. My wife got little sick. She is Italian and she said this was unfortunately one of worst one... Customer service was bad also. Really bad. I almost left the restaurant. If you want a good pizza in this neighborhood, try Pizza Master. 10 times better.","Wowzer, we live in jersey city and have recently started to explore Bayonne , a good friend who grew up here recommended this place and on a lazy Tuesday we decided to venture over and what a pleasant surprise. The place is old school fancy and the service speaks this 100%. The wine list mainly Italian wines, we had a $28 dollar primitivo which was excellent and we had it in the city for $55 just two weeks before. I couldn't believe I found it again so close to home.  now to the food- the apps were not expensive and very very good We had clams casino, a raw seafood plate and a Ceasar salad all excellent and for dinner we had a steak and a pasta. Steak very very good but I didn't like the pasta because I don't like cream sauce and I should have read the menu but I was so excited I just ordered Wildly (no fault of theirs) 3 bottles of wine in we had dessert and rolled home to jc stuffed and sleepy af ! I would go back here in the drop of a hat. No wonder this place has been around for decades . I highly suggest checking it out",I used to love this place but it has just gotten god awful. Clams in wine sauce chewing on sand only to have waiter explain how a clam opens an closes. I'm no chef but I do a lot of cooking with clams an have never chewed on sand. Chicken dishes was literally tasteless. I'm so sad cause I will not be returning.,Finally a real Italian joint! Love eating in or even ordering food for pick up. Some of my favorite dishes are the mussels and meatballs! The pizza is decent as well. They do have a bar and it's not BYOB FYI.They can be a bit packed at times and parking in the area can be a bit tricky.,"I don't post much on here anymore, but I made a point to write about a great takeout experience I had last night.  Based on the reviews, pizza (half margherita, half spicy sausage) and the lobster ravioli were the obvious first choices.  First off, my favorite little touch was the situation with the small container of red sauce for the free bread.  Btw, that portion of free bread was pillowy like a cloud. I always forget my butter is in the fridge, so the sauce was the perfect thing for bread dipping. Cafe Bello's pizza made me smile.  9 out of 10 times, I prefer a NY style coal fired oven pizza over a brick oven pie, but this shiz was lit.  Cafe Bello immediately takes the top spot for my favorite pizza in the JC/Bayonne area. I prefer not to cheapen the experience by trying to describe it with the words of man, but I will say this - my drive home was 2 miles and I polished off half the pie before I got home.  The spicy sausage half slightly edges out the margherita.  GET THE PIZZA. The lobster ravioli was good, but it didn't knock my socks off.  I felt like there was a flavor punch I was waiting for that never came.  I'll chalk it up to me being a total lobster snob (snobster) because I spent the last year on Cape Cod and in Maine.  In any event, the brick oven pizza did the heavy lifting and I really look forward to exploring the rest of their menu.  Keep that takeout game strong, CB. You the real MVP.",This little gem of a restaurant is a home run! Excellent service and hospitality to start.,Café Bello
339,"The food was terrible. I went for a birthday party and I ordered the veal saltimbocca. The food tasted good for the first piece, then my mouth started to burn, it tasted like they drenched the food in lighter fluid. Very disgusted.","DO NOT HAVE YOUR EVENT HERE! We had my father in laws 80th birthday here. The service was horrible. The maître d' was annoyed every time we asked for something. They served INSTANT potatoes, the pizza was so mushy that when you picked it up the cheese and sauce just fell off and turned into a mushy mess. The veal was so thin, it was practically see through. And then they bang you out with the bill. Very disappointed, and I would have had better quality food at a diner!",The food was just okay. The service was just okay. My waiter forgot a few things from my order and then my lobster ravioli came cold. I said something to the waiter and he rolled his eyes before taking my plate back. Do not understand how this place gets this packed.,Looking to have an event. Look no further. Zio was perfect. From booking my party with Izzy to the service by all the staff. Party went just as planned and I did not have to worry one bit about a thing. My guests are still talking about the food / service. I couldn't ask for more. Thank you Zio Toto for everything!,"Been here several times. Never too busy.Everything about it is excellent... food, service and convenience. Always recommend it when asked about top Italian places on south shore of island.","If you are looking for atmosphere like Angelinas is the perfect place for you to look good. If you are looking to eat that's a different story. Very overpriced and the food is subpar compared to so many other Italian restaurants on the island..So, put on your best outfit, grab a bottle of Vaseline and I hope you're not too hungry because you'll be very disappointed. Oh, if you're in a hurry There is absolutely no parking whatsoever and they push you to valet your car.They did this to my 74-year-old mother and then proceeded to park her Car on the sidewalk,,..It took her 40 minutes to get out of there. Go elsewhere and save your money",Zio Toto
340,"Overrated . Pizza Crust is thin no doubt but the wait and the portions don't equate to reviews esp incomparison to pricing . They rest on laurels of past rankings but don't strive to surpass or at least uphold their prior ranking. Additionally ordered a spaghetti and meatballs, they hardly gave any spaghetti it was a portion size for a toddler at the price for 2 adults . Very disappointing.  Save ur time and aggravation; and above all ur hard earned money. Go else where in town  esp if u travel a distance to try this highly ranked NJ pizza. U'll be disappointed prob like my family was .","If I could leave a 0 star I would. Horrible customer service. Waitress with dark hair/glasses saw us come in to the restaurant and did not acknowledge us. We sat down at a table, she came by to the table next to us, and same waitress still did not acknowledge us or even look at us. After about 25 minutes we got up and left because no one even looked our way. I will be spreading the word about how sucky the customer service at this place is.","The baked ziti pizza we got only had toppings on 50% of the pizza and the crust was terrible, real disappointing.",I've heard the pizza was good here (if you like thin crust) so I finally made my way over. Went on a Thursday night in the summer and the place was packed ! When we got there we didn't see a host/hostess so after a few minutes of standing around we sat ourselves. It took about 10 minutes just to get the menu then around another 10 minutes to get waters. From what I saw there was only one waitress for the whole place. We weren't in a rush so it was okay ! Ordered pizza and garlic bread as an app and a carafe of wine. I love thin crust so I had zero complaints ! Definitely the thinnest crust pizza i've ever had. Ordered the lasagna as my dinner and it did not disappoint ! Besides the service being on the slower side the food was exceptional. Just don't go if you're in a rush.,"Cozy little spot with some seriously delicious thin crust pizzas. We tried out the zucchini sticks as an appetizer and I was pleasantly surprised by the serving size. They were fresh and hot, they melted as you bit into them. The white pizza was really good, even though I'm typically not into white pizzas. Great service and a nice night out for dinner.",This was a nice little establishment.  The service was friendly and lightning fast.  The super thin cracker New Jersey crust was on point.  The all meat pizza was perfectly loaded and the margherita was incredibly fresh.  All in all a really enjoyable experience.  I wish I had good pics of that bubbly margherita but I rushed it.  I'll be back again someday soon.,Nancy's Towne House

People are inside and they saw me trying t come in but opted to continue to look away and clean up early.  Wouldn't want the food now anyway because they'd likely spit in it if they're so eager to close up.Even worse, I saw two other people walk up as I type and they also are being ignored. Whoever owns this location is losing money. Check your staff right quick.",Very disappointed with this place almost $10.00 for a bacon cheese burger 2 small patties they are small and very thin They taste ok I like the concept but very disappointing When you get here to eat I had to ask for more bacon they only give u 1 piece of bacon split in half Don't think I will be coming back here to againThe burger taste good But portion size is too small for the Money,"I love Five Guys burgers, I've been eating them since college when my school was right across from one, but this location sorely disappoints. The food is fine and meets the five guys standard but the service is truly horrendous. The server taking my boyfriend's and my order was rude and short with us. Just not the friendly atmosphere I am used to.","Delicious bacon cheeseburger with pickles, onions and ketchup! Fries are always great!! Service was professional and fast! Recommend this Five Guy location!",Overpriced burgher in an area where five other establishments serve the same or better burgers at a cheaper price. The fries are overrated and the price is totally insane. Never again will I ever go there and now I head over to Tommy's Tavern work for the same price I can get an appetizer and a great burger,"I like Five Guys because of their customizable burgers and overflowing fries. The food at this Five Guys has always been good, and unlike some branches, they get my burger toppings right. The Cajun fries overflow seemed like a little less on our most recent visit, but at least there still was an overflow. Lots of seats, not too long of a wait before the burgers are ready, friendly staff, clean bathrooms, and plentiful parking also make this a good location to visit.",Five Guys

The grape leaves are so go. I really like  tazickyi sauce deff spelt that wrong.",Never ordering again from here. I was super excited to get some Greek cuisine and ordered a gyro platter... I don't know who got hungry in the way to delivering to my house but looks like someone ate almost the entire plate.  There was barely anything in there and it did not look appetizing at all.  The fries that it came with were soft and soggy. Me and my family were very disappointed. The salad was blan and had no flavor to it. My salad was suppose to have goat cheese and there was barely anything there.,Food is decent portion size for a GYRO platter is decent Nothing special about this place actually very disappointed in the quality of the foodBeing a GREEK restaurant I would expect fresh homemade gyros and white sauce not the case here THE GYRO MEAT IS THE FROZEN ONE White sauce is from a jarAsked for 1 extra cup.of sauce Told me $1.00 extra NOT This is a rip off Never will I return to this place I will go to someplace else for lunch tomorrow,I write this review after ordering twice from Kuzina. Both times the food came quicker then anticipated. The food was hot and tasted great. Look forward to ordering again.,"I order from here on seamless very frequently.

343,"Not good, not bad. Definitely crowded, especially on weekends.The food was okay, some of the food was sitting out for too long, dying under the heat lamps. Where as more popular items are heavily rotated. They do have plenty of options, from hibachi, to sushi, to regular Chinese food, as well as American food. Of course they have plenty of vegetables and fruit too, and lots of choices for dessert. I would say get ice cream for dessert, the cake and pies were bland and stale.",Nasty!!! There was a maggot in my friends food... A MAGGOT !!!!!!!!!!!! 1000% the nastiest shit that I have ever witnessed! Absolutely disgusting!,"Awful food, even by buffet standards. Food looks coagulated, and like it's been warmed up over and over again. The service was awful as well, the waiter spilled water all over the table after seating us, but never brought napkins to dry it up. The sushi was stored in a cooler and every time the tray emptied out they'd plop more into the tray. Worst meal I have ever had.",Amazing restaurant!!!Everything fresh and tasty  My stomach is afraid....The best sushi  Very friendly service!,"We always enjoy coming here.This is definitely not the best quality food you'll ever eat, but that's really never why you go to one of these buffet spots anyway. We usually come here when we're starving and looking for a variety.

I recommend for a good quick fix",Love this buffet so much. The only buffet I go to actually except for this Indian one in Edison. They have good quality food and the service is good. The buffet works for large parties as well as small ones. Today I only went with my boyfriend but I've gone to the buffet with a group of 15 before and it was just as good of an experience.

344,"Out of the many choices in the airport,  i stopped here. The restaurant was clean, lively, and welcoming. I sat at the bar and was directly in front of Rob ( i think this was his name ). I'm not sure if he was having a bad day or he sincerely hates his job. He pouted off and on about having too many orders. He was rude to his coworkers and negligent to his customers. The food was mediocre and the drinks were ok. Hospitality could have helped save this visit. As there are tons of options at this airport, I will not be returning to this restaurant. I am not 100% sure his name was Rob, so I am including a picture. I mean this in the most constructive way, Rob should probably make a career change","Service was Great - though I'd say the iPads idea is cool but not as great as having humans interaction. 3 out of the 4 iPads on my Thor had problems and errors when I tried to order and pay.....definitely not ideal.

The beer and spirits selection is impressive for a terminal C restaurant.","The food was decent, but a tiny portion at an inflated price.All of the restaurants in this terminal seem to be using networked tablets for all ordering, and I think it's a nightmare.

Tables weren't being bussed, and no one checked back in after my food was eventually dropped off at my table.","It's in the NYC area and it's at an airport.  So quit complaining about the prices.  You want low prices, have a staycation and eat frozen dinners.Now, about the restaurant, this is above average airport food.  The tablet ordering system works well, plus you get a 20 percent discount if you have a United credit card (which also gives you priority boarding and free bags).  Nice selection of craft beers, better than I expected.I had the fish and chips, which was a nice portion.  A tiny bit crispier than I would like, but the fish itself was excellent.  My companion had a burger that she enjoyed.",Salad was tasty and the main reason I didn't give a lower rating If i had to eat again at EWR i would not go here. Prices too high. The salad and scallops all in were $50ish. I didn't even order a drink. I realize it's an airport but still too spendy. Maybe I'd get the salad to go.Scallops being scallops they were yummy but for scallops these were some of the worst I've ever had. Want to emphasize i love scallops so even bad scallops are good. Too small. Over cooked. Over seasoned. Way too expensive. My jaw dropped when the dish was served I was hungry from travels and disappointed nothing but a sauce for soaking accompanied the scallops . The orange sauce was good. Tangy. Would like the sauce with more highly rated scallopsSave your money for a different dining experience.,"So this is a tough one. depending on your perspective, it could've been pretty much 5 stars, or could've been no stars at all (read below).I continue to be surprised by the quality of food at the Newark airport. Yes, it is expensive airport food (we paid $93 for dinner for a family of 4), but then it is still a sit-down place, somewhat similar to the restaurant, so then less than $25 per person is not bad. The high point is that the food was very tasty, well prepared and well presented. Burgers were outstanding, big and loaded. Roast beef panini sandwich was also excellent, with very tasty fries. Seared tuna salad was perfectly executed. The food was really 5 stars almost until the end until I saw a hair sticking out of the sandwich - nicely baked in, so it was not one of ours. This definitely brought the whole experience down. As we were close to our flight, there was no time left to bring this to someone's attention, so this was not addressed in any way. If not for that experience, this would be a pretty much a five stars meal, considering the flavor and execution - so yeah, I'm going down to the three stars.I can't really recommend this place, but things happen, so hopefully your experience will be better.",Vesper Tavern
345,"Food is mediocre here, nothing really bad to say about the establishment at all really. Looking forward to trying new things that'll change my opinion on it.",Walked in at 6:55 only to be told that they only were doing takeout because they close at 7:30. Really. Not impressed with my first vegan experience in Bayonne. Doesn't look like a dine in place anyway. Took a menu and it seemed interesting. Like the Latin twist. Might try another day.  Too many new places to try so it will be awhile.,I'm just updating cause I continue to love this place but it's so frustrating when I really want to eat your food and my child is craving your house wings but I can't leave the house and you guys won't deliver or will be available on uber eats or seamless. Please review your delivering options to make it more accessible.,"First time trying vegan food.  We ordered the nachos for my 12 yr old, hoping she wouldn't be able to tell the difference... well.., she didn't and really liked them.  She didn't even realize it wasn't dairy cheese or real beef. I also thought they were delicious. I also ordered the tacos ... extremely impressed with the flavor and taste.  Would never think cauliflower could taste so good in a taco. The mango sauce was the perfect fit. I tried the Mac and cheese... very good.  My friends had the philly ""steak"" sandwich (She really enjoyed it) and the ""chicken"" Mac and cheese burger ( not a bite was left).  French fries are pretty damn good too.  I like that everything is made fresh to order.  Will definitely be back. Service was great also.","This review has been long overdue and so happy to finally get a chance to write it. House of Flavor is a vegan restaurant in Bayonne that incorporates spanish and Caribbean cuisine into their menu. This isn't your ordinary vegan restaurant and be prepared to be impressed.I highly recommend anyone to try their smoothies especially the orange smoothie with carrots. It's nutritious, tasty, and refreshing. Afterwards, try their vegan wings, it's a deep fried cauliflower with a sweet and tangy sauce. Along with the wings, the flatuas were stuffed with saucy jackfruit, vegan cheese, topped with shredded lettuce, and tomatoes. Lastly, my favorite meal of all was definitely their vegan burger and I'm sure you'll like it as well. The patty is made in house and was seasoned very well; the avocado added a nice creamy touch, the vegan mayo was tasty and didn't taste a difference compared to regular mayo; the lettuce was crisp, and lastly the bun was soft. All in all, the food exceeded my expectations and every bite was better than the last.As great as the food was, the service was equally amazing! The owners were so passionate, knowledgeable, and extremely kind.","This was my first time at House of Flavor and I'll definitely be back. The place is super cute and the staff was really friendly. We ordered the cauliflower in sweet chili sauce(it's called Taki Taki on the menu), chipotle mango tacos, the Philly cheese steak, and a falafel salad. Overall everything was quite tasty. The cauliflower and the tacos were my favorite. They were delicious! The salad was yummy too although I didn't much care for the falafel it had in it, as it was too mushy inside for my liking. The Philly was my least favorite. It was pretty bland and the bread was just way too thick in my opinion. It wasn't terrible just wasn't great either. Overall, I'd say this place is really worth trying. They have an entire Latin menu that I intend to try next visit. They also have a bunch of vegan desserts that looked really yummy. I'll definitely be back to try a few of those as well!",House Of Flavor
346,"Went to Popeyes this evening for chicken. While in line, I saw that the manager was off to the side preparing the new chicken sandwiches. She was wearing gloves as she had to touch the bread and chicken in the prep process. A cashier needed change and I watched the manager, Natalie, grab a roll of coins and bills and go back to preparing the chicken sandwiches WITHOUT putting on a new pair of gloves. She handled filthy money and went right back to making the chicken sandwiches touching the bread and chicken in gloved hands that had previously handled money. When I saw that I got out of line and left the restaurant. Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable. Money is full of nasty bacteria. And if the MANAGER is doing this, god only know what other unsanitary shortcuts are being taken here.You need to do better Popeyes. I will never go back.",Waited for 45 minutes for my order before i got my money back. The manager told me that i had to wait for 3 minutes while new chicken was being made. Once chicken was made manager helped the people that were there after me. When i asked where my order was she said i had to wait for more chicken to be made cause they ran out. I got my money back.Staff was very rude and nasty. They helped all the people they knew while regular customers had to wait 45 minutes. Place is dirty. Do not recommend to anyone. Go to the one in jersey.,"I downloaded the app just to leave this review, this is the worst Popeyes I ever been too, we got spicy tenders and on the bone - we see blood in the chicken check photos- check photo, poor manager, I thought they just recovered and renovated after the fire they had, anyway last time in here.By the way I wanted to wash my hand and no soap in the bathroom.Blood in chicken - we ended up throwing it","Always busy but the staff is hard working and friendly, especially the people in charge. The only fast food that my family and I eat.","It is a very good place and the manager and the employees are very good but it has a single defect called Tifanny. It is not the first time it happens to me, with that girl you can not talk because she immediately raises her voice and treats you like an animal.  I do not wish anyone unemployment, so I recommend that you do not put her to deal with clients.","Great spot, maybe new leadership but I saw the woman running the show and she was a boss lady for sure. Ran the place like a tight ship to meet the constantly long line of hungry folks after 5pm. Chicken is always tasty and crunchy, their fries are seasoned and absolutely delicious as well. The only thing I don't like about Popeyes has nothing to do with this location. It's a choice the company made a long while back to get rid of their ORIGINAL honey mustard. Yes you heard me right, and I'm more of a BBQ sauce fanatic (which they have some good bbq sauce still).  Now the company has some Smokey honey mustard or something like that but it doesn't even compare. I mean nothing did to that sauce, it tasted incredible and no other honey mustard ever came close. Whoever made that choice in the company is mad and shouldn't be in charge of any important choices going forward, that sauce was irreplaceable.  Sauce is crucial for chicken and fries this good, hell even the biscuits tasted great dipped in that thick rich honey mustard. Bring it back for the love of god.",Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen
347,Oh yes.After working in Hillside for 5 years I just found this place on Yelp. I never thought of hanging a left on Long ave. I went here and got a steak sandwich that was $5. The meat was tender and I saw the guy cut it fresh off a much larger piece. When you can bite right through some steak in a sub without pulling all the rest out you know it's tender. Meat Cheese Onions and some sauce that I did not even try before I soaked my sub in it.....did not regret that move one bit. It was a spicy garlic sauce that I would probably eat on anything. The guy next to me got a whole chicken meal....I do no think meal is the right word...Feast?! It was half a catering trey portioned off into 1/3 rice 1/3 and entire chicken and 1/3 was a ton of fries (or beans)......$12!!!! I will update after I try more items.,"My go to place for Portuguese BBQ. The portions are great', the prices are good and the people are always friendly.I rotate between the ribs, chicken or garlic chicken and almost always have food for another meal or two when getting a whole order.","Their posted hours is not correct. I stopped by around 8:30pm on monday, their grill was off, chairs were stacked, lights were off. Two waiters were ready to lock up... half an hr before their posted closure time...",You can smell the food a block away. I don't know how anyone lives near this place and doesn't indulge daily. I don't recall seeing the seating. I usually do to go with most places though. Ordered a full order of ribs and half order of chicken cubes. The fries are to die for. Perfect combination of crispy small fries and mush natural texture. So good. The ribs were delicious. The chicken cubes were not what I'm used to. Normally they're in a creamy-ish yellow/orange sauce. These were in a garlic sauce but damn was it good.Very fast and friendly service too. Will be back!,"Really great Churrasqueira! Family owned and managed. I have not eaten in, I usually do take out, but they do offer lots of space if you want to eat in. I usually get the tray with yellow rice, fries, chicken and ribs for less than $20 bucks. It can feed between 2-3 people per tray. Pork cubes are also delicious. Staff is always nice and my food is always ready when I call ahead of time, which is a great time saver. Beware they only take cash so come prepare!",Best place to get food!!!! Hands down best place..  food is sooo good and fries are always sooo good never soggy like other places.. i have tried a few different things and everything is made perfectly and soo delicious. everyone needs to come to this place. So worth it.,Long Avenue BBQ-Churrasqueira
348,Garlic chicken and rice was great. But the sangria is top 5. Even if you don't eat here I recommend sitting at the bar and grabbing a pitcher of sangria!,Everytime I order their chicken francaise the chicken is always tough. Come on already.,I really hate to bring my rating  down to four stars ... but the last few times I've come- I was not that impressed. For so many years-I've raved about this place and was one of my faves - now I'm ehhh about it . Everyone else I came with last night didn't have any complaints but I know that the service and food is not as good as I've known it to be .... This place is always packed. TVs for sports etc. jukebox for music . I'll probably come back again but I'm not as excited as I used to be ....,"I had dinner here last night with a friend of mine after doing some research. Originally, we were looking for a place that had Argentinian and Italian food and we came across City Tavern. I have dined at several places and Elizabeth and I think that this place has the best skirt steaks. The piece was nice and thin with caramelized onions and you can get two sides as well. I cannot forget that we also had ceviche which contained generous portions of shrimp.Drinks are also relatively inexpensive glasses of wine were only four and five dollars! There are many TV screens overhead playing various sporting events. The crowd was very mixed with all different types of ethnicities and people present. Service was very good, quick and attentive. For dessert we had tres leches which was among the best that I've had ever.Overall, I was pleased and I will be back.","Food: this is my second time coming here and to be quite frank, I come for the guacamole. It is absolutely delicious and arguably the BEST guacamole I have ever had. They make it fresh and on the spot. I had their lemon chicken before which was decent but I would not order it Gris second time. This time around I ordered their chicken quesadillas but I was not a fan. My sister enjoyed the pesto breaded chicken sandwich (I forgot the name).Atmosphere: the place is cute and spacious. The music was lovely and there is a bar right in the center. The service was incredible and they were all very kind to us.Parking: there is very limited street parking that has parking meters but there is a parking deck a block or two away if needed.","I always liked coming to this place. It is classic Colombian food- you can have anything from platanos and mofongo to steak and shrimp. It looks pretty small however there is a bigger space in the back for larger parties. They are known to play mainly Spanish music in here and it is very convenient since it is close to downtown Elizabeth. Every time I come in here, I always have the steak with yellow rice and brown beans. If you come in here on a Friday/Saturday, you can always see some hot guys sitting at the bar having conversations and drinks! The staff is always nice and efficient. I've never had a problem with the food and they always serve bread with this strawberry type of butter. Additionally, the drinks are equally as good - I always tend to get a pitcher of sangria when I come here with someone. Overall, it's a great place that I would recommend. There is a small parking lot on the side street- otherwise it's street parking so be prepared to circle the block a few times on the weekends!",City Tavern
349,"I'm not typically out to give negative reviews to restaurants... I normally come to this restaurant once a week... but today made it my final visit.In the service industry I understand that there are times when customers are being difficult and that for the service staff, they can sometimes get angry and lash out at customers... At first when I witnessed our waitress struggling with a set of diners that were asking for ridiculous menu options, i felt bad for her...I can overlook that the waitress ignored me when I was ready to order (we were at the dining side not the hibachi... and there was only 2 tables), I can even over look improper preparation of our meal (was too salty for hibachi steak... ordered medium and got well done... I think they dumped the whole garlic sauce in).   But when my wife who was lactose intolerant asked for a a replacement for our dessert (ice cream) which was a part of our meal was responded with a curt 'no'... I think I've dined my last here.  My wife slightly taken a back asked.. well I can't have ice cream... is it ok to have fruits instead? this waitress just said 'no' your meal is ice cream... thats it and left... I mean... i guess its within the wait staffs right to be assholes... but i'm well within my right to not give them anymore of my business and to make a review that might deter others from doing the same.","I was in Kearny for a business trip and this place came up on Google,  I really wish I had check Yelp.  I can confirm all the bad reviews.  My co-worker's statement, when I asked him about his food was, ""It'll make a terd."" The food was ok but the service was crap, and the topping on the cake: They didn't even have Yum-yum sauce.  It was definitely not worth the money or my time.",15 dollar minimum for card? You guys aren't that good or that important to have such a policy not to mention I think that is illegal. Everytime I order from here the sushi arrives warm at room temperature. This is raw fish that is dangerous! Another time they packed my sushi with a hot plate and my salmon rolls were half cooked. C'mon!,"This is my favorite place to get hibachi on the island!  The food is reasonably priced and absolutely delicious. I've never had to wait for a table, even on some of the more crowded nights. The chefs are always friendly and fun to watch. The only downside, is that some of the waitresses can make you feel a little rushed whether they are crowded or not.  However, if you're looking for a fun dinner night you can't go wrong at Umi.",Three musketeer roll is incredible! Quick friendly phone delivery of delicious and fresh sushi rolls and  chicken tempura entree.,Came here with in law and family found it randomly on Yelp since I figured the 3 year old may enjoy the show. It was empty when we came in at 1pm on Saturday but overall we liked the experience and the food. We would say it's comparable to Benihana in terms of taste and our waitress and chef were both friendly and courteous. The decor is a bit outdated but overall a good experience. Would come back again.,Umi Sushi & Hibachi
350,"There's a new menu!I had the Latin Caribbean Style Oxtails, Rice, and Beans. Very Good!I hope they add Smothered Chicken and Spicy Collard Greens to their menu too. I want more Soul Food Options...","I love the food at this place, but they need to seriously hire new people. The service is terrible and honestly unacceptable. Just ordered takeout that took 50 minutes for a cold ass sandwich and mediocre at best mashed potatoes. Unacceptable.","I've come to this restaurant several times, and although the food and drinks are on point the service is not. You are virtually ignored upon entering and have to go to the bar  to get someone's attention andto get menu's after sitting at a table waiting for a waiter to notice you. Even sitting at the bar one evening, it took the waiter far too long to take our order. There were two bartenders taking food and drink orders, and while one young lady was quite pleasant the other seemed as if she hated her job and everyone in the restaurant. This restaurant has great drinks and good food but the service leaves a very bad impression","Love this spot! The drinks are great, the food is tasty and the staff is friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back.","Came here the other day as a recommendation  with my brother. It's a small bar/cafe where everybody knows your name, and you're always glad you came LOL but seriously, seems like a place where neighbors meet/ hang. We really liked the vibe- clean, and cozy. We were greeted by the bartender (Kris with a K) who was friendly, helpful, and provided great recommendations.Kris mentioned this place was open for a while but ""reopened"" four months ago under new management - therefore new menu. We started with the $20 pitcher of white sangria off the happy hour menu. Wow, very strong and tasty. We definitely got bang for our buck since we couldn't finish it all! For dinner I got the oxtail with mixed vegetables. I'm a sucker for oxtail, so whenever it's on a menu, I'm ordering. The oxtail was so good. The meat was tender, and the stew that the oxtail was cooked in was delicious. The mixed veggies were okay, but that's what you expect with mixed veggies. Portions were large, I really couldn't finish it all. I was told I had to get the rice and beans next time, so I'll have to come back and review that too!My meal + pitcher of sangria + my brother's meal (chicken sandwich with garlic parm fries) came out to roughly $50 ($30 for just the meals), and worth every penny!","Service was on point and very friendly, the food was good and prepared as asked, would rate this place very high on my list and will recommend this to anyone in the jersey City area!",Light Rail Cafe
351,"Bad food, service from iPads, overpriced, bad food, temperature was 54 degrees and they said they couldn't control it. Did I mention the bad food?","Look - away from the hustle and bustle of EWR? Sign me up. It's a quality little oasis that can recharge you after a long day of travel, or before you take off. Service is a little slow so let them know if you in a rush but the staff is phenomenal.","The hype is ridiculous. Basically an invite-only extension of Saison with a few special menu items, and a genuine half-ass effort at ""good"" service.The cabbage is pretty good albeit a tad too buttery, and the curry lobster-- which doesn't seem to have any curry as far as I can tell-- is excellent.I don't necessarily mean to slight the staff with my comment above, but service was half-attentive, half-absent, and half-indifferent. They seem to be trying to provide a level of service that matches the price, but it feels like two-thirds of the staff didn't get the memo, and another half the staff forgets to check on the strange new dining room in the back.Tack on the price, which is not cheap, even after UA discount, and honestly I'm not sure what to make of the place. I suspect another visit or two would solidify my impression, especially of the service, but the ding to the wallet is painful enough that I'm not sure it's worth it.3* sounds right.",A hidden restaurant in the airport. You have to be walked through by a hostess and through another restaurant. I believe you have to have special United perks to even get in.Service was top notch. We got a complimentary app and hot towel. Food was really good for airport food. I tried the steak sandwich and lobster roll. Lobster roll was spicy.They are on the pricier side. They gave us chocolate as a parting gift.,"Definitely give this place 3.5 stars. Love the concept. Speakeasy type of restaurant within Terminal C at Newark. How cool is that? I enjoyed a table for 1, which great views of the tarmac. I was disappointed that all my few diners were offered a hot towel, but I wasn't. Plus. I love this concept of a secret restaurant, but surprised to see the tablets to order.Tablets are definitely not a deal breaker, but little things like getting water never happened. I saw other people getting their own water. My waitress who checked-in to make sure I knew how to use the tablet was super nice. I love the decor and the intentions for this restaurant. I would come back for those reasons.","I have to admit that I was drawn in by the concept of a hidden restaurant at EWR.  Images of Jose Andres' E in Las Vegas flashed through my mind.Classified, dear Yelpers, ain't E.  It is, after all, still Newark Airport.  The food quality and decor are a bit better than being out among the commoners, but the experience is let down by the atmosphere and execution.When you first arrive, there is nobody to greet you in front, so you randomly meander toward the rear of Saison hoping that somebody will reach out to you with an eye gesture or secret sign.  Thankfully, a hostess did manage to find me and take me through a door that looks like you're about to be pressed into service as a dish washer.Through that door is a linear nook that is Classified.   Far from fine dining, the airport feel carries over w/ bench seats and bolted-down tables.  There are, however, some normal chairs that aren't bolted down --- enjoy the liberating freedom.Once seated, the same iPads which seem like a convenience in the rest of the terminal so that you don't have to track down a waitress now become a weirdly offensive way to browse through and order a $40 entree.The dining experience is similarly odd.  While the food is definitely a step above what is available in the rest of the airport and the waitstaff even try to hover around and act ""finer,"" the reality is that when you order your food all at once on the iPad, the kitchen hasn't figure out how to pace the meal, so it all comes out at once.  The poor bastard next to me got his raw oysters, huge salad, AND monster steak all simultaneously from a runner who plainly has no idea how table numbering works.  Said runner would bring out each dish and then walk down the length of the restaurant calling the dishes name hoping that the right customer would raise their hand and claim it.As flight delays kicked in and the night wore on, the restaurant took on the feel of the rest of the airport, with some customers sleeping in their seats or just hanging around in their booths for hours with their shoes off.  Hardly the fine dining experience you might have imagined.Overall, instead of feeling like a fine dining oasis in the middle of the desert, it just felt like you overpaid to sit in a sandbox.",Classified
352,"I've ordered here several times and it's decent but not great. The food is good. The atmosphere is crowded and when you pick up an order, it can be difficult. You have to walk all the way to the back and the people behind the counter aren't always paying attention. Their delivery is sub-par in my opinion. Once I got the wrong order entirely. Another time, the delivery person did not say ""thank you"" after I tipped him. My three stars are for the food and the convenience of this place being nearby.","Ordered Mac and cheese for my kids, a cheeseburger deluxe and a quesadilla. My order was contingent on arriving in less than 45. My food arrived 30 minutes late, cold and worst of all, reeking of cigarette smoke to such a degree that I had to remove the bag from my home. The food is normal diner fare. You will not be impressed. Forego the delivery,they seem to be inconsistent.",I come here every now and then with my kids. The past few times I have been disappointed. I feel the quality of food has declined and also the way it's played served. I ordered a falafel sandwich today and the falafel was hard there was barely any lettuce in it it just looked sad. I sent it back couldn't even eat it. The time before this I ordered spinach pie with Greek salad the salad was pathetic barely any lettuce. They said because of the Romaine issue they were short on Iceberg and wasn't given as much. Well I'm still paying the same price it was just ridiculous. The falafel sandwich was taken off the bill. So that was one perk of today's visit.,"Went here tonight with my husband for an early dinner. We had a very friendly, nice , attentive waiter. He's been there for years. My husband ordered the blue cheese burger, it was cooked perfect. Before dinner the waiter brought out cold slaw , pickles, red beets, and chick peas . So good omg. I ordered a beef barley soup that was just so good. And a chicken wrap with curly fries. Fries were so fresh and yummy. I also got to go black and white cookies and fresh yummy muffins . Everything was great tonight","I honestly feel like after the renovation of this place, everything about it got much better.

Things I didn't like: 1) the service, there was almost no one in the diner and even getting us drinks seemed to take a while and we only saw our waitress at the order and delivery. Before we even finished eating she handed us the check without inquiring if we wanted anything else. We got more of a smile out of the guy washing the windows. 2) the prices, they were high compared to Mike's other diners.",Oakwood Diner

To start, I won't give any chains 5 stars, so we begin with 4. Things this place it has against it: the service is spotty at times, it took a good 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge me. Despite the fact that the menu says they have local craft beer, they did not. The menu is a little on the pricy side, everything about $2 more than the fair price. $6.50 is not the right price for a small Caesar salad- $4.50 would be a more reasonable price. The $14 chicken sandwich should be $12... you get the idea.  They also advertise through posters in the lobby to download the rewards app- which doesn't work at this location since they're not a corporate store. Very confusing. Minus 2 stars. To their credit, they do have a slightly above average beer selection, the menu is a level above a typical chain restaurant, the restaurant is newly renovated, and once you can get the attention of a server, you do get pretty good service. Plus one star. Average: 3 stars.",Avoid this establishment at all cost. I ordered the sizing chicken and shrimp. They bought my plate over and nothing was sizzling. Everything was RAW!!! My peppers wasn't cooked it looked like they grabbed a slice of cheese from the fridge and laid it on my plate. even my chicken was raw. I cut my chicken in the inside to examine and it was completely red inside. I couldn't believe it. I took my brother for his 16th birthday. Luckily enough he ordered boneless wings which were enjoyable for him so I sat and waited for him to be done before I left. As for me I will never return here.,TGI Fridays
354,"Decent but pricey. Got my order wrong, and gave the completely wrong sandwich. Check before you walk out.","The sandwiches are ehh, no thanks.  It was my second time trying this place, the feedback from my coworkers are mixed, so I gave it another chance. Final result for me - no damp sandwiches for me.Sandwich Flaws:- Too much balsamic (and I love having some balsamic on my sandwiches, but this is too much for me and my coworkers).  Some just order it without since they can't seem to understand ""just a little"" when you order. - The mozzarella - left some liquid and made this side of the sandwich damp...gross soggy bread.- The chicken - was wet?.. and added to the damp sandwich... this was in my Nunzio sandwich which was suppose to be a roasted chicken breast...So my sandwich was very damp... one side had too much balsamic and the other had been made soggy by my mozzarella and chicken.","Fast casual order at the counter sandwich spot in an underground food court strip in One NY Plaza.

Very large sandwich, but costed 14$",Great little sandwich shop with amazing traditional Italian sandwiches. Spoke to the owner for a few minutes about the sandwiches and the shop. I will definitely be back!,"Ordered the Nina on semolina and really enjoyed it. Not sure why the line here is always so short compared to all the other places in the basement of this building (probably because everyone wants to grab a salad or something ""healthy""), but don't let that deter you from trying a sandwich here. There was a bit too much balsamic for me, but still a good sandwich. I recommend give Cappone's a shot especially if you're a fan of prosciutto like I am and especially if it's raining and you find every other option to be a 20+ minute wait.","Had a delicious sandwich at Cappone's Salumeria on Tuesday afternoon. Fantastic food, but a little pricey and on the smaller side.Quality: The food options at Cappone's Salumeria look and taste great. I went with the Cappone Hero on Ciabatta bread. It has capicola, soppressata, salami, provolone, arugula, mozzarella, hot peppers, evoo, and crema di balsamico. Each element was great, but it was the rich balsmic that put it over the top. A great spot for a quality sandwich, both hot and cold.Quantity: Sandwich was perfect for lunch, but expected a bit more for the price tag.Value: $14 for the Cappone Hero.Ambiance: Cappone's Salumeria is located in a building basement within Manhattan's FiDi. Sharing a floor with other fast causal options, this place is a gem. Entering you immediately see the fresh bread as well as the meat and cheese selection. The space is modern and sleek. I planned to take my sandwich to go, but the comfortable area makes it a place you want to eat.Crowd: The entire basement food court is a busy spot during weekday lunch and Cappone's was no exception.Service: Kept a long line moving quick. Guys working behind the counter seemed like they were having a great time.Parking: Parking is extremely difficult in the area.",Cappone’s Salumeria
355,Overpriced. The only thing I ever eat is their Sicilian pie. Other than that it's garbage. Why should I walk in after ordering a pie a half hour ago to see it's not even in the oven yet?!,This place has been going downhill for a long time and they have a lot of problems with food quality and service.,Over priced for such poor quality food. I ordered chicken Parm with vodka sauce. That should never be $24.00. FOR ONE!  The chicken Parm was in the small side container and the plain pasta with zero sauce that they forgot to put sauce on? was in the big container. Oh and the threw in 2 hard rolls but the chicken had that old chicken taste. I threw half of it away.,"It's been years since I left my original review and a lot has changed. With that being said, I've been to Villa Monte's a lot since 2009. Their pizza slices and other small goodies on display are always fresh as the turn around is high over here. Their delivery is always fast and is delivered hot.The pizza is decent here. Amazing? Probably not but it's definitely good. Their round pies are a hybrid between deep dish and NY style which is definitely unique to Staten Island. I guess they're in a league of their own.The counter guys here are hilarious. They're always cracking jokes at each other which helps pass time while waiting for your food.I'd recommend this place and will go back","The staff is super sweet and quick, but the food was just plain bland. I was very surprised thinking all the italian places were awesome on the island but I was wrong. Only come if youre super hungry.Our order was a margarita pizza with canned mushroom toppings and fresh eggplant.  Pretty bland.And penne vodka was really disappointing.","Great pizza in Staten Island.  They serve by the slice, but I always prefer to get a fresh whole pie.  They have a pesto pizza that is very good.  But you will never go wrong with old faithful.  The cheese pizza.  There is dine in and counter service here.",Villa Monte Restaurant
356,"I usually order from this place once in a while, they do got some pretty good things but I ordered a falafel wrap,(Im vegan by the way). As I took like my second bite I started tasting a meaty texture instead of the falafel texture, and even the taste tasted meaty, I then took a falafel and compared it to the meatball and the falafel looked green, so that also confirmed it wasn't a falafel. I tore it apart it deff looked, felt and smelled like meat. Idk if it was a mistake, but this place is not fully vegan , so cross contamination can happen. Thats unacceptable! My brother also went there and used the bathroom and found small roaches inside. I really hate to be that person because I loved this place. Just a heads up!  They need to be more careful!EDIT. As you can see the other reviews about it being dirty!","Tip: Don't dine in! I've been coming here for years, and it's getting worse and worse and dirtier and dirtier. The food is usually fantastic, so I ignore the fact that the owner needs Gordon Ramsey to come in and overhaul the place. But yea, it's dirty, needs paint, there are holes in the ceiling, poor service. His son is the main server and he's a teenager now. I figured he would get better from back when he was 12 years old running the front of the place, but apparently when you order a wrap and fries, the fries come as an appetizer before anything else comes out. Oh, and the owner used to steal change. If you ordered something for $9.00, he would charge you like $10.02. My friend asked what the extra fees were for and the owner said ""taxes."" If you do the math on that, it doesn't add up to 7%. Then you have the 5% fee for using a card. This is just another way for him to steal from you. He's a real nickel and dimer. He's just a chef who doesn't know how to run a restaurant. It sucks. So much potential.The saddest thing is, my wrap was burnt, there was hair on the plate and napkin, no utensils, a very long wait, seafood wasn't fresh, etc etc. Idk how he's still in business. He needs to sign up for kitchen nightmares already.","$28 for a Caesar salad with chicken and avocado. Thats crazy. They charge a $6 delivery fee on top of a extra charge for using credit card, like 5%, which is unheard of, especially when you order a lot. One time I had to go in there for a $65.03 bill and the guy literally broke my $100 bill instead of taking $65 exact change because of the 3 cents, CHEAP!They do not listen to instructions, had to be lied to and put words in my mouth, unbelievable. Food came with no spoons,forks, bread for soup, napkins, nothing.",Food was great. I loved the cute and quiet little space. The waiter was timely and very nice. Their menu has plenty of options. Not just vegan food. Which I love. Their fresh fruit juice and carrot cake is to die for. I'm sure u won't be disappointed.,"I've eaten here many times, and the food is decent for the area. The service is horrible - whenever I pick up food, I'm never greeted and have to walk to the back where a child (assuming the owner's kid) will take my payment. The juices and vegetarian options are very over priced - I can get the same juice at a place down the street for $3 less with more ingredients. My hunch is that this spot was the only healthy option in the area, so people paid for the higher prices, but as new healthy options open, they'll need to offer better service and prices to keep customers coming back. I'm more than happy to support a local business, but the customer service here is horrible.","I tried reaching out to the manager before posting this review. I left a detailed voicemail followed by an email. And since I still haven't heard anything back from anyone, maybe this will get their attention. Also, they have a really big fly problem and jars where they keep their cookies needs some TLC. They should really clean up a little more - the place just doesn't look very clean. I only stopped in bc of the positive reviews left on Yelp. But I was a little disgusted by some of the things I saw. This just topped it off. Below is my email to them on Sunday, 7-14-19:-------------------------------Hello,I just left a vm and I know you guys are closed at this time. I just left not long ago after placing a to-go order. And this was our very first time there. I ordered a tuna sandwich, a chicken & avocado salad and a piece of one of your chocolate cakes. The food was good (he loved his tuna sandwich and my salad was okay), but then when we went to take a bite of cake from the fork, there was mildew on the cake. I guess from the heat and being in that glass casing. We just threw it out and didn't even get to try it :-(Please see pictures attached. It's the only white part of the cake.---------------------------------",Andrew's Healthy Foods
357,"Don't think I will order from here again. The fish is beer batter and I'm not a fan of that flavor at all. The shrimp are regular size nothing special on the seasoning side at all. I did enjoy the calm strips and potatoes/chips. Just needed some more flavor or spices on the actual seafood. Funnel cake was too burnt or so I just say over cooked to enjoy. Lil paprika or Larry's saved my night. They delivered the food fast and late. Least I didn't have to cook that night. Was upset ordered extra for lunch the next day. I used cheese and bread make fish sandwich, couldn't let my lunch go to waste now. Wasn't my cup of tea, plus is they deep fry all kinds of treats for dessert if that's what your into",I really enjoyee the food. I was pregnant by the time I was done reading the 2 fish and chips plus a funnel cake. I'll be back,"The food arrived cold and limp. It was over an hour an 15 min late from the grub hub estimated time. Got a call when order was 15 min late apologiIzing for delay saying driver would be leaving soon. All I was told by management and driver was it was a mixup. Got 3 cans of soda and was told that was to make up for it. not coke or Diet Coke but ginger ale and orange soda.Hush puppies are rock hard and inedible. When ordering shrimp, you get SIX TINY shrimp and a handful of chips for $11. That is a rip-off. We wasted close to $80 for our family of 6 and were very disappointed. My youngest fell asleep before even Eating due to their ""mixup "" and the fish for my other kids wasn't very appetizing as it was soggy and cold. All the food was soggy and cold. Every last container!","Stumbled upon this place bc I was in the mood for some fish.  I was in the elizabeth area and the Chippery pos up.  The reviews were good so I tried it.  It's a very small take out fish shack.  That serves a decent fried crispy fish.  Also shrimp and chips as well. Basically anything you can fry it's on the menu; chicken, fries, calamari, homemade Mac and cheese balls and jalapeño poppers with cheddar.   They also fry the sweets too Oreos and candy bars.   I ordered a couple pieces of fish. It's a white fish and it taste like swai Bass.   The lady said the name in Spanish But I forgot.  But it does have the swai bass flavor.  It's a great tasting fish with a nice salty buttery flavor and the flesh is flaky and moist.  I definitely enjoyed the fish a lot with my Tatar sauce and ketchup.   I also tried the homemade Mac and cheese bites and jalapeño poppers .   Mac and cheese bites- same batter as the fish I wish they used a different breading. Like a Panko. But kudos to them making their own and not The frozen ones. Jalapeño poppers- in a pastry type crust and filled with jalapeño and cheddar. They were better then the Mac and cheese bites But when I ate them together They were actually better.  There was more cheese in the jalapeño poppers. Which made the Mac and cheese taste better. This is a great road stop if your in the area. Take home.  The fish does lose its crisp after awhile but worthy tithe trip.   ***They also have a food truck in Jersey City on the corner of Communipaw and 440 in the old Exxon lot.","Harry P. and I were driving around on a chilly Sunday in January and saw the Chippery. I hadn't had fish and chips in awhile so we pulled in and placed in order. It's a small shack with counter seating. It was cold inside.We ordered a triple size fish and chips plus some fried clams. Everything is made to order, so we had to wait. But it was GOOD. The fish and clams were fresh, and fried perfectly. The chips were cut like pickle chips and pretty thick, with a crisp exterior and fluffy interior. Portion sizes are good for the price. Fish and chip shops aren't too common in the area, so this was a nice find.","The food was ok, but I expected bigger shrimp and more of the seafood mix in my dish. I liked the taste, but a bit dry and way too much potato. The Honolulu wings were great, but a little tough. The potatoes were different (which I like), but like I said it was more than the actual seafood. The customer service was very nice, quiet and had a laid back atmosphere.",The Chippery - Elizabeth
358,"We used to love this place. But about a week ago we placed a big order, food was awful. Chicken was dry, vegetables were not fresh.  I ordered a salad, it looked like it was a week old. My husband found a piece of stick in green beans.  I had my friends over, it was embarrassing the serve it. Just awful.","Placed an order for delivery and the order was totally messed up. Ordered a gorgonzola wrap with no mayo and they sent a chicken salad wrap. Also ordered a chicken burger and they sent a cheeseburger. They fixed it when we called and they took back the wrong food they sent us, hope they didn't use it to serve someone else.","I never write reviews on restaurants unless they do something so bad that it makes my blood pressure go up with bad service. In this case I am beyond perturbed. I ordered my food at 6:00pm it is now 8:14 and literally just arrived. I ordered the food online because i find it easier , my order is less likely to be incorrect and it remembers my info. When I called at the hour and ten minute mark they indicated that they got slammed but that my food went out. I understand this and wasn't that pissed because it does happen. But fo it not to be delivered for another 40 min... cmon you have my pjone number you could have called or discounted the delivery.... I will not buy from again..... be ware!!!!",Nice clean establishment with some really good chicken and a lot of sides. Place is very clean and there is ample parking. It's a bit pricey when it comes to chicken yet we don't have a KFC here on the south shore which I'm sure I would make it more competitive.Staff is really nice and that's all I have to say about that,"Fried chicken tasted great.  Good flavor and not too greasy.  The sides were a little too small for a family of four.  When you're ordering a 16 piece family meal, you need bigger sides to feed the family.  It was good that four sides came with it.  Ordered wings that were good, with sauce on the side.  Delivery time was estimated at one hour and fifteen minutes, so I opted to pick it up in a half hour.  Only gripe was that they forgot to give me one of the bags, and called me when I was driving home.  I turned around to retrieve the bag that they forgot to give me.  When I got to the store, they handed me the bag with no apology or any mention of THEIR error.  Regardless, I would still return, although they are a little on the pricey side.",If you love Boston market you'll love the food here just as much. The menu offered is very similar. I ordered the family meal which consisted of 1 whole chicken and a half 3 large sides and 4 pieces of corn bread. I did 2 sides of macaroni and cheese and one of the mashed potatoes. I took my food to go and it was still warm when I got home to eat it. I enjoyed it and would have it again. They also give you a chicken gravy kind of sauce which I put on everything to me which was like crack,La Rosa Chicken & Grill
359,"Would give zero stars if I could. I use to order from this place about once a week, however, their delivery service the last 3 orders has been terrible. This last order was a simple cheese steak sandwich and 5 wings. After waiting 1 hour and 15 mins, I had to contact the store to find out I would be waiting another 15 mins at least for my food. An hr and a half for a simple sandwich and wings is ridiculous. And they cannot follow simple instructions of not toasting the bread. Seems like this places quality and service has taken a drastic turn for the worse.  I will not be ordering from this location any more.","Wings are decent but there are way too many places for wings on the island to tolerate such poor service. Called in advance to make sure they are open since I was getting on the island late. They close at 11, I walk in at 10:55 pm, there patrons in the place eating, sign says ""open"" while the girl from the counter barely looks up from scrolling on her phone to tell me they are closed and cannot serve me wings which takes a few min to prepare. Its bizzare to me to turn away a customer who's standing right in front of you. Girl bye! Another spot that will shut down soon bc of subpar service.",Ordered delivery - Mac & cheese bites were awesome. Big juicy BBQ wings & very cheesy quesadilla.. also lots of drink options ! Wing World has become my go to wing stop,"When I first walked into this place my thoughts were "" this is to pricey "" tonight was my second time going and I ordered a 10 piece wings  ( medium ) , two orders of curly fries, 5 piece ( mild ) and a order of chicken quesadillas! I feel like the food is this price because it's actually GOOD it doesn't taste like it came from a box in the freezer. I have no problem paying for great food. Alsolet me tell you!! I never eat quesadillas because I feel like they taste weird and are always gross when I try them. But this place right here definitely changed my thought on that! The chicken in the quesadilla actually tasted seasoned and was delicious! The wings are great ofcourse and the girl who helped me at the register was so sweet and nice I had no problem speaking to her, keeping conversation. Thank you guys","Wing World's jumbo wings are actually verrrry good. Honey chipotle is the best flavor, by far, with mango habenero following in second place. We have ordered delivery multiple times and have been pleased every time.Delivery always comes faster than expected, and the wings are always piping hot. We always order the original, and the wings are consistently large, juicy, and hot. Flavors we have tried include: honey chipotle, mango habenero, chipotle ranch, sweet & spicy, kickin' bbq (which was way too spicy), lemon pepper dry rub (boring), honey bbq, and who knows what else. If you're trying their wings for the first time, I would definitely recommend honey chipotle.We have had their fries and potato skins before as well, and they were all right. If you're trying Wing World for the first time, get the original jumbo wings (in honey chipotle or mango habenero). It doesn't make sense to order non-wing food items at a restaurant called Wing World - order their wings!","If you're like me and rely on yelp for your next food choice.. please realize the crap reviews for this place are from salty lazy people who ordered for delivery and live a block away, supposedly, and got impatient. Or people who think a delivery driver is a representation of the establishment itself. I mean, if I was a middle aged man trying to get by as a delivery driver being treated like crap, I can't say I'd be a happy go lucky dude either. Sorry, give the guy a break. ANYYYYWAYYYYYDespite the lowly 3 star rating, I went with my instinct and went here today after a long work day expecting the worst (for it to taste like planet wings lolol yuckkkkkk)Customer service: I walked in, and was pleasantly surprised as I was greeted by the two individuals behind the counter as soon as I stepped in the door.  I had never been there before, and grabbed a menu and stepped aside.. i was explained their menu and I was even informed of their lunch specials, very sweet girl behind the counter!Food: I ended up going with 10 traditional (bone in) medium flavored wings and fried pickles for a to-go order. I'm kinda tiny but I love food :) but let me tell you I could not finish my order !!! Their wings are huge and meaty! Crunchy without being dry and generously sauced. I was only able to eat 5 and like half the pickles. Speaking of!! Their fried pickles came in this little container with holes punched in the sides so they didn't steam and become mushy on the way home. What a nice touch!!! It's the little things they do... like how some fried pickles fall flat taste wise... you could see the extra dill they use in their batter for an extra kick. And that sauce that comes with it??? Fuhgetttaaaboutittttttttt. And no. I didn't wait 45 min for my food. Probably because I went in the store and got off my butt :) So, if you're looking for a hearty well cooked wings, over 25 choices of sauce, and some phenomenal sides .. go here!!!",Wing World
360,"Good selection of beer, food was lame, apparently they don't know how to cook fries (at least on a holiday). Somewhat slow service, we had an order taker, and a delivery person. More of a hang out with the fellas then a date night out with the wife kind of place.",The web site says they have great 1 pound burgers when I went there they have 4 or 6 oz burgers they wasted my time and I will never go back they should update the web site,"They said we could not sit with our dog on the patio because they don't allow dogs in the restaurant. If you have been here the patio has its own entrance and we would not be "" in the restaurant "" As you can see it's a small quiet dog and never barks. It was a nice day so we came to this local place. Unfortunately they denied us.Even the guest sitting on the patio had no issues.Poor management.","Great spot for lunch or happy hour. I recently went here with a few coworkers for lunch because we discovered they had outside seating the it was a beautiful day. It was pretty slow, but we were greeted with a smile and seated right away. Our waitress was awesome, she was on point with her recommendations and service. I ordered the Smashburger which they are very proud of and should be, it was delicious! Juicy, flavorful, and filling. The onion rings won be over, they were beer battered and fried to perfection. We also enjoyed a dessert while we were there because we saw someone else's go by and it looked amazing. We got the brownie with ice cream, so good and nice and warm! Overall great place that I'd love to go back!","Suspenders is a pretty standard restaurant and bar- a solid selection of beer and burgers, and some more creative options like short rib tacos. The menu itself has just about anything you want, from flatbread pizzas, to wings, to dessert.The food itself is good. I got a French onion soup and fish and chips. Others my party got burgers and sandwiches. All of the details were correct, and our waitresses were quick and friendly.The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating- the outdoor seating is primarily wooden (with wooden benches, wooden tables) and is actually quite cozy... although the view is of the parking lot.The indoor seating is fine, but dark... and on weekends during football season (because of their abundance of TV's, it can get pretty rowdy, and you can't really hear conversations amongst yourselves, however that is more because of the guests and not the restaurant's fault.",This is a really nice local sports bar but I prefer just coming here for the wings and nachos. It's really family friendly and kid friendly. The patio is really nice when it is warm outside and the weather is kind. I would recommend this spot. It's not my go to or my #1 but the convenience of location is enough. The establishment is very clean and the service is excellent.,Suspenders Restaurant & Pub

I wish I took a photo but I rushed my trash bag outside before it stunk up the whole house. Unfortunate because I love their chicken focaccia but I'll pass on them.

Stop by and you will not regret it,"Unfortunate update to my original review. I've waited too long to update hoping things would improve- nope :/ The food is over all good and the eatery is very nice inside. The issue that has honestly stopped us from ordering are the girls they have answering the phones. It's so unfortunate, and I really, really encourage the ownership to revisit their frontline personnel because to be frank, this is something many of us talk about. The girls answering the phones can be extremely rude and off-putting. I'm someone who is very friendly when I call. But regardless, you get back someone sighing, monotone, miserable etc. Honestly, you have people answering who sound like they hate their lives, their jobs and hate talking to customers. I'm not paying to deal with that when I can call any other place and be treated warmly. I know specific establishments where the food is mediocre, but I'll order from them because of how lovely and genuine they are on the phone. Last time I stopped in for a quick bite to eat, the girls were hanging out, ignored me, while one flirted with an employee and clearly saw me waiting. Fortunately, the guy finally told her to go help the customer and she rolled her eyes and walked over....aaaanndd these people are paid for this? Another time I placed an order- not big mind you, two dinners- and made the mistake of asking the final cost so I had money ready. Oh dear lord- here comes the dragon sigh and major attitude, ""HHHHHHhhhhhh......you need to give me a minute... I gotta add this up"" I said, ""Sure! No problem :)"" She put the phone down, but I can clearly hear her muttering to someone, ""one second, she wants a total now, like really, just add two and two f-ing together already, what the hell...I am having a day with these people..."" And this is why we no longer order from here. I don't keep a menu in front of me, I don't look at prices, just needed to know the total so I can pay and tip without wasting the delivery mans time. Sorry to say but I can't recommend this place anymore :/ Hope the ownership finally takes the issue seriously and addresses it.

They usually don't take too long and have lots of options on their menu from sandwiches, to burgers/ wraps and they also have the typical Colombian platters that we all love!",Had dinner here tonight and really enjoyed my experienced. Food is priced right and servers were super friendly. Enjoyed everything about the meal except the empanadas which were far too greasy. I would comeback though.,Monchy's Colombian Grill
364,Everything is the same. The winelist is not as good as it used to be.Things change.But Laico's doesn't.,A true gem. An old fashioned red sauce Italian place. There is nothing on the menu that I cannot recommend.  And a great winelist.,Called to ask if we can have a reservation and they said no need and we can just come in. Walked to and arrived at Laico's after less than 5 mins after calling. We were told to wait for 45 mins.,The best Italian American food I've had.  Everything is great.  I love getting take out from here.  The brocolli rabe and calamari are my favorites,"What a gem! I would have never guessed that such an authentic Italian restaurant would be tucked away in this residential area, but this location simply adds to Laico's cozy, homey, neighborhood charm.I came with family and everyone loved their meal here. Service was friendly and quick - we started with a complimentary family sized salad and bread to share, and our entrees came shortly after. We shared a variety of dishes, but my favorites were probably the Fettucine Alfredo special and the Sea Scallops with Spinach Risotto special. The fettucine was perfectly al dente, with a simple but creamy alfredo sauce and tasty bites of proscuitto, mushrooms, and peas. The scallop dish both looked and tasted impressive - it had six HUGE scallops sitting over a light spinach risotto. Typically when I order scallop dishes at other restaurants, I usually only see 3-4 scallops (and not always jumbo sized), so this was an unexpected surprise!FYI, this restaurant is situated on a residential street with pretty limited street parking, but luckily there's valet here. I didn't see the valet at first, but he was sitting inside a car towards the front of their parking lot.","I came here with super high expectations since the reviews were so darn good. All the pictures of the seafood and their five star reviews were enough to draw me in. My friend and I arrived on a Sunday around 6, there were a few tables open and a few spaces at the bar. It is a very small space from what I saw. There's a back room but I can't see it holding many tables, it's really a tiny restaurant. When I read on yelp that they have a valet service I still opted to Uber mainly because I don't like driving into JC. I'm so glad I did! The valet has enough space for about 6-7 cars. From what I saw they keep your car double parking on this very narrow one way street. So be weary! Onto the food, the bread for the table was nice, crunchy and fresh. The salad was brought out but I was less than thrilled. There was a ton of red onions and the dressing tasted generic to me. My friend went with the shrimp scampi. I opted for the linguini  in white clam sauce. I think I got about a dozen clams which was nice but the sauce was incredibly lacking. It was basically just oil at a certain point. Wasn't very flavorful and that was disappointing because it's really not too hard to make a nice white sauce with clams. My friend enjoyed his shrimp dinner and ate it all, I left a lot of my pasta since I felt like I was just eating an oily mess. I do have to say service was good, Nicole our waitress was great. I did feel slightly rushed almost, it looked like she was there alone with the bartender and a food runner. She just seemed stressed and took a long time with things but she was very personable and nice. If I'm ever in the area (which I'm sure I won't be since it's literally a residential street) I would give it another try but for now I'm just less than thrilled with my first experience here.",Laico's
365,Salad was large and fresh.. quality salad.. Grilled Chicken Avocado Wrap tasted good but was on the small side ..,"Placed an order for delivery ... arrived 2 hours later.  Granted it was 10 items but 2 hours in unacceptable.  Wraps were fine but the salads were lacking.  Seemed sloppily thrown together.  Needless to say, overall disappointing enough to post a review.",2nd time getting uncooked and soggy sweet potato fries. Thought I would give them another chance but I guess this is how they serve their fries.,"This is a great place if you're looking for a good shake, salad, or wrap! And I have to say that the staff here was really friendly, and helpful! I would really recommend the Nutty Professor shake with Almond Milk and vanilla protein powder. It tastes just like a Reese's peanut butter cup! I think my wish would be for the menu to offer the calorie counts on the menu and maybe some more vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. I tried the buffalo pizza here and it was really saucy. The crust was like a whole wheat wrap though and it made it a little soggy so if you want that crunchy crust, it might not be the right choice. We also tried the Latin lover wrap and it tasted kind of like a burrito. The nutty bowl was very sweet.",This is a very good establishment. I believe they have for locations now and everything on the menu is worth it. Super friendly staff and plenty of parking. I wish I could go more often get my schedule changed but I do miss eating at these locations With their knowledgeable and friendly staff...,Great food.  Big menu. Would like to have the nutritional menu for people who have allergies and are on specific diets.,Better Gourmet Health Kitchen
366,Waited 45 minutes fot a pie then when i went to manager she had an attitude and told me to wait they will start making my pie now.i just canceled my order and walked out,"This place would be a much better place if they hired more ppl! I'm waiting on a line for 20 min for an ice pop because the machine don't work! There is one girl behind the counter and a long line, this girl is doing everything! The mouse didn't come out in the 30, and I asked twice ! This is terrible service every time I come! I had my daughter birthday party here last year and that was TERRIBLE too because the service is always so slow and horrible!! Hire more ppl!!!",Pizza isGreat. Everything is clean. Carpets look new. They even have bumperCars. Kids are having a blast. Lots of things for small and large kids.,This review has probably been a long time coming. I have been coming to Chuck E. Cheese for over 20 years I brought both of my boys here every other weekend and they had a wonderful time the food was always delicious the pizza was slamming and the games are always wonderful.  Because shears are always pleasant and patient especially with dealing with children and trying to get something to eat. The waiters and waitresses are always very nice professional smiling and always made sure that you had what you need.,Came here for a birthday party the location isn't the biggest but it was clean and the staff was friendly they lady helping out with my nephews party was very helpful and made sure we had everything the food was decent and tasted good I wasn't expecting it to be that good they have enough arcade games to keep the kids and adults happy they only thing I wasn't happy with was wit the dipping dot station I paid for a large cup but had to wait about 10 minutes for the kid working the front door to help me he was busy having to stamp everyone coming in and out but he was also the only one that could serve us not sure why the girl behind the register that I payed couldn't serve us since there was no one on line waiting to pay,"Took the kids here for the first time. Much better than previous city experience on Flatbush in Brooklyn. Arrived at 11:15am and for the next hour place wasn't overcrowded. Staff was attentive when there were issues with broken games, etc. we didn't eat but I saw the food coming out and looked like typical pizza, wings etc which I enjoy. I will definitely bring the kids back since they had a fun time.",Chuck E. Cheese
367,"Sadly disappointed. I had really been looking forward to checking out this local spot in our neighborhood. I've been following them on Instagram and was very excited to get the chance to eat there. Frankly the experience was nothing less than disappointing. I had ordered the breakfast pizza and my wife ordered a garden omelette with ham and cheese. After 55 minutes, my pizza finally came out, (we happened to be sitting outside next to the outdoor pizza oven and saw that it only took about 4 minutes to make the pizza). Sadly my wife had to wait another 5 minutes (60 minutes in total) for her omelette. When it did finally come out, it was clear it had no cheese and the ham was merely 2 large slices the were rolled into the omelette. When we pointed out the missing cheese and our displeasure at how long we had to wait the waitress appeared to not really be too concerned about it. We asked for a box for the pizza and she said she would not charge us for the omelette. I really don't want to ""bury"" a restaurant in an online review, the fact is that the pizza slice I did eat was absolutely delicious. However the wait and general lack of concern is what was most disappointing. I would probably try it again, but sadly it would be a table of one, as my wife is not as forgiving.","Js on the bay .... I have heard a lot about this spot why not goin I'm on a Sunday for brunch or lunch... so the sitting is very limited it has a 50s theme which is cool.  The food is reasonably priced. The street corn pizza was good lots of flavor it's big enough to share with 4 people. Their shakes taste exactly how they should taste with according to the flavor you pick. The fruity pebble one is really good the shake was lined with fluff the shake taste exactly how the milk in a bowl of fruity pebbles would taste.... The only thing I would say was one of the complaints from my table was the there was a few things that had some kind of ""kick or spice"" and couldn't figure out what it was...Anyways this is still a nice place to come to but timing is everything because of the limited seating...",This was my first time here. Honestly I had a really bad experience with the food. I ordered an omelette  with mushrooms and spinach. I'm over here thinking it's going to be a decent size looking omelette and since I was trying to go home to eat it. The omelette was so small and flat. It wasn't even filling at all. Definitely the most smallest omelette for the price they made me pay for was unbelievable. I won't be coming back here again anymore.,"Atmosphere is great. Music choice perfect. Friendly staff, old school look inside, great outdoor setup.  Despite the fact that we came in summer heat, the back outdoor seating area was shaded completely and had a nice breeze. I also noticed, in the corner, a heat lamp obviously for the winter months. Staff: 10 out of 10 Very inviting, warm and welcoming. Waitress was Extremely helpful and went back and forth to the kitchen multiple times to make sure there was no ingredient that could possibly cause any allergic reactions for me. That was more appreciated than ever. Drinks: 10 out of 10Review is based on the drinks we had, which included the Not so lucky charm, sangria slushee, and a caramel coffee shake. Husband also tried the s'mores drink and says it was better than the others in his opinion. Food: 9 out of 10The only reason we lost a point here is because I had ordered the famous steakhouse burger. Personally I believe a burger should Fill a sandwich, not just be the center. It truly takes away from the bites around the edges. I also ordered my burger Medium and it came pretty well done, almost dry. Aside from that, the wings appetizer, lobster Rangoon, Mac and cheese and chicken sandwich were amazing!!! The sweet potato fries were nicely seasoned with salt and pepper. Restrooms: 2 out of 10I give it 2 points bc it has a working toilet and sink and had ample toilet paper. Otherwise, it was a little dirty and definitely too small. I would hate to think of any handicapped person or even a child or even any female using it. Males can stand nd splash everything, women have to realize the wall is practically touching the toilet seat. Despite the burger and the restroom, this is a Great little whole in the wall food spot with and I Love that the waitress came out to check on us consistently. Especially since we were the only ones outside and there were also guests inside.",Looking for a brunch decided to come here. Small but busy shop.  Greeted with a smile. Servers are kind. Ordered omelette and French toast. All done perfectly. Coffee was good and service was constant. Most importantly it was not very expensive. What else could you expect.,"This is such a cute little diner with a retro vibe! They have weekly specials and a large breakfast/brunch and regular menu. My family came for breakfast one day and we absolutely loved the service and the food. The French toast is to die for! My sister ordered a lobster roll and it came with large chucks of delicious lobster over buttered toast. The kicker is that they have a large array of decadent milkshakes and my biggest regret is just ordering the coffee. Next time...Note: I'd recommend coming here with a smaller group because the space is more intimate. They also have a bar area if you prefer to sit on a stool. Overall, we loved our experience here, we will be coming back again for brunch.",Js On The Bay
368,"I have ordered and ate at Call It A Warp for many years now. I have never endured anything like this before in regards to their service. I ordered a chicken and rice soup, the distance I traveled to is 0.7 miles... a 4 minute drive. I took the soup out of the bag and due to it being extremely hot the led melted and the soup exploded everywhere, including my leg. I called to explain to them the situation and was mocked and laughed at as whoever answered the phone was discussing it with another co-worker. The girl who I was speaking with said... verbatim ""What would you want us to do? You want a new soup or something, like what? I don't get it."" I will never do business with them again. They need to hire professional individuals who are answering the phones or do a better job training their staff on costumer service. I picked up the new soup, again, explained and attempted to show the girl what the soup led looked like for her to not show any emotion or a care in the world. Only reason I went to get another soup was because it was $ 9.80. My experience left me with a burnt mark on my leg and very unhappy.","When we asked where to pay the woman behind the counter made a joke and basically mocked us saying ""where to pay? You're standing at the counter"" nasty service","I've been going to Call it a Wrap since it opened. I have ordered many, many times. Lately I've been getting my orders messed up. Today, March 11 at 6:50pm I dealt with the nastiest manager I've ever spoken to in any business. Pizza was prepared incorrectly (missing broccoli) and a wrap was missing. We called to let them know that we can accept the wrong item but we need the wrap. The manager asked if someone ""took it"" with out us seeing and I explained that it's just my wife and I here at the moment and that no one took it. She told us she saw the wrap in the bag leave to us. I told her about our loyalty and explained that we're not trying to get a free wrap. She said it would take over an hour to get a new one or we could get a credit. We refused because her nasty attitude lead us to believe she would tamper with the food. Finally I said she could send us the wrap but I want the pizza done correctly too. She told me that the pizza was done right and did have the broccoli on it, again she said she saw it herself, I told her I could send a picture right now and i told her how much she was offending me. She got loud back and told me her boss would call us right away. I'm still waiting on that call. I'll never order from them again.","Call It A Wrap with the quickness, more then a  sandwich shop! Hip healthy food joint, no other location on the Island, SMH why ??!!This place had Swordfish and Ostrich available as a special! I had the Bison and Spinach wrap- warm melted oozing mozzarella cheese- nommm nommm Extensive : Healthy options on menu, open seating area, lunch shift was effective and timely, Next time I will placed order for pickup. The staff was on top of it, phone orders, pick ups, deliveries- I was impressed with how well they all worked together.  No wait time for a healthier lunch option in the  deli dominated and pizza parlor neighborhood.Next time I will have to get a smoothie.","Came here for lunch one Saturday and I got the grilled chicken strip salad, a side of fruit salad, and a water. I ate in and to my surprise my meal was served on paper plates. You know, the ones you purchase at the grocery store for a bbq. The salad was good. I can't complain about that. I didn't eat the fruit because the paper plate was so soggy from the water in the fruit it was falling apart. I HIGHLY recommend investing in better quality dishes to serve food. I eat salad at many places in the city. The salad usually comes in a cardboard or plastic BOWL. My fruit is usually in a bowl or a cup! Not on a paper plate. They have a lot of good options for everyone. Just need to update their dish ware.",They have a wide range of options but it's a little pricey for a wrap but I do recommend if you want to splurge a little.,Call It A Wrap
369,We ordered 3 different dishes. I had the chicken francese and was the worst I ever had. Wanted some lemon taste and there was none . Asked for extra sauce and barely had any.  My cousin had their meat sauce and I have to agree was okay.,"Until now I'd heard great things about this place. A transplant to Bayonne a few years now, I took the opportunity to visit this place with a friend for the first time at prime dinner time on a Saturday night. Long story short: the food was very good, the service - BIG disappoint, and frankly we were both equally shocked at the rude, obnoxious, unethical, and presumptuous behavior and attitude that met and followed us throughout our dining experience. First, when we walked in, at least 3 waitstaff at the front turned to look at us and said nothing (red flag #1). Fortunately a host saw us and we got seated. A little while after being served our food, I ran out of water in my glass. Getting it refilled was not easy, despite the fact that there were 2 other parties in the whole place, and at least 6 waitstaff members standing around basically chatting with each other not looking up once (red flag #2). It took us cranking our heads several times for 1 waitperson to even notice us (we considered walking up to the front bar to ask for water). Now annoyed, my friend and I agreed to get a to-go container and the check and leave. Red flag #3: A bus boy brought us a to-go container, having carried it with his fingers touching the inside of it (disgusting), so we had to ask for another clean container. Lastly, when we got the check (here's the icing on the cake; are you ready for this?) we didn't have exact change but still wanted to pay by cash so we put our larger bills into the bill pocket (or whatever you call it) expecting to get change back, so we could figure tip; they never brought us our change; they just assumed that all of the cash was for them!!! Having dined in many restaurants over many years, NEVER has a waiter taken money and not returned change (WTF!?); isn't this the first rule of service ethics? We had to ask what happened to our change to get it back!!!! By this point, we were livid and wanted to leave as quickly as possible, so we walked out, and on the way out, the whole waitstaff up front tried to say goodbye, which we wanted no part of...we heard them mumbling under their breath snarkily since we didn't respond. We couldn't get out of there fast enough. Going forward Mona Lisa's will be my only go-to place for Italian food in lower Bayonne; Sarelli's could learn a thing or two from them about attitude and customer service.","We went here on a recommendation from family. Nearby home so we decided to try it. We sat at the bar for dinner. The place was nearly empty at 8:30. It smelled funky so it immediately turned me off. There was only one waiter which is fine, but it took a long time for him to ask for our order. I ordered the chicken francese and my husband ordered the chicken parm. The chicken parm was subpar but the chicken francese was good. My major complaint was the entrees didn't come with a salad or even bread. When you go to a Italian restaurant in Bayonne, you usually get something with your meal. Very disappointing !","I always start with the calamari at this place, it's almost like a must have for me. The steak and potatoes are amazing, again, this might be a must for me too. The potato's are thick cuts and made a little crispy. This place can be good for a date night or a causal night. On fridays they have a live band consisting of a couple who sings.",This is my favorite restaurant in Bayonne NJ. We would go there like every other week when we lived there. Now we live in NYC and we still miss it! The seafood linguine is my absolute favorite dish. When I worked in the city and lived in Bayonne I'd bring all my friends there. The owner Sal is also great.,"When you thinking about an environment to have a nice quiet dinner this is the place. The chef the staff the service the quality of the food blend together to provide an enjoyable evening.Even if you want to order off the menu the chef will accommodate. The specials, the menu and the quality of the food served, with a friendly and attentive waiter staff, makes this my go-to place for date night.Each Friday and Saturday local artists perform ""Music on Broadway"" a delightful experience. Music starts at 7pm and the audience partcipates in the music selections.",Sarelli's
370,Absolutely horrible. New ownership! Previous owners would be disgusted! You should change the name and maybe serve Egyptian food instead because you can't make Greek food that's for sure. Salad was brown and soaked in dressing to the point it was soggy. Gyro meat was cold like ice cold had to reheat. I wouldn't have ate any of it if I wasn't starving. Spanakopita was burnt and as hard as a scone. Never ordering from here again. You people should be ashamed of your selves 40$ for crap food. Such a shame this place was so good before.  Never again will I throw my money away to you!,"This is ok for Nassau County , but food was passable no comparison too Greek in Queens or Astoria . It was not busy on our visit took a long time for food too come. All dishes tasted the same not as good as your local diner.My advise go elsewhere.

I got refunded but I'm still mad cause I spent a lot money and the quality is not even that great.,"Oh my goodness, let's just say I'll stick to the drinks. I ordered chicken pad thai, shrimp dumplings and wontons. Absolutely vile. Both the wontons and shrimp ""dumpling"" (quotable because they both look alike) anyhoo, they were both stale... you could taste that the shrimp was off. The pad thai was bland, dry. No peanuts and had onions... ONIONS? Bean sprouts yea but onions.... Needless to say I was credited for the meal by grubhub. Never doing that again. Sorry","Big mistake ordering from here. I was really just sad to have wasted my money. Flavors are lacking and whatever flavor there was honestly made me worry I would get food poisoning. The first thing I noticed was that the styrofoam containers were melted from the heat of the food. I got the pineapple fried rice which is normally one of my favorite foods but their version was very disappointing and the flavor was all wrong. Won't be ordering from here again and I'm convinced most of the good reviews on here have to be fake. ""Literal doodoo water"" -input from my boyfriend","Amazing service! Amazing food!

Only to find out at the cashier the total is actually $10.65... well that was far ways from $7.95 don't you think? Gets even better. Apparently Pad-see-uu is not part of lunch special but hey let the customer figure that out when they see the check than telling them on the phone it's not included. Not to mention did not include the wonton soup (see the picture, it clearly includes Wonton soup) that was supposed to be part of the lunch special. Guys, plan and simple - I don't care if I have to pay 15$ for lunch but don't do shady business. Let the customer know what they are getting and what they are paying for.

373,Surprisingly many people in there waiting on their order.  This is NOT the Tack's I used to know.  The food has been downgraded and obvious short cuts taken.  I haven't been here for a while and decided to try it again when I passed by.  The chicken dish I ordered was subpar.  What happened to this place?  I will not return.,Just bought chicken and broccoli with pork fried rice. This food was soo spicy it left my mouth burning. The pork fried rice was a dark brown color and tasted awful. Every other place that I get pork fried rice from the rice is always yellow.  I have never tasted chicken and broccoli that is spicy.,"A few months back, this place had the absolute best Chinese food. I would tell everyone that would listen that their chicken and broccoli was pure perfection: the thin sliced chicken, perfect amount of sauce and the SAUCE!! Perfectly flavored and the right consistency. I have eaten chicken and broccoli before that had gelatinous and salty sauce but Tack's sauce was a dream. I noticed about 2 months ago, the chicken and broccoli becoming flavorless and oily. I figured it was a fluke and wrote it off to a bad day until the next time I ate it and it tasted even worse. I swore that was it for Tack's. Tonight my husband went and picked it up while I was napping and when I took a bit of the chicken and broccoli it was flavorless and oily, the fried rice had no flavor except for a faint hint of horse stable and tell me how even white rice can taste awful? Two bites and I was gagging. In the trash, the food went! What a waste of $30! It's a shame because the people who work there are so nice and the food was excellent.","Easily the best chinese takeout on Staten Island. The service is quick and there's something comforting about always calling and hearing Tack's pleasant ""okayyy,"" when you call. If you like spicy food, Tack's is the best at catering to spice levels, just use the""X"" system when ordering. Now, I like my food spicy so I'll order my food and ask for 1x. (Pronounced ""one x""). I've tried two and it's just too hot to enjoy an entire dish. I imagine 3x is for devotees of man cs food challenges and iron stomach linings. My go to dishes are the chicken chow fun, beef & broccoli, pork fried rice, and barbecue spare ribs. My wife loves the sesame chicken too. The only star deduction is for the cash only policy which can be inconvenient.",One of the BEST Chinese Take-Out's on Staten Island.  Nice family owned business.  Very friendly.,Tack had the best food on SI two weeks after new owners took over it went down hill .miss tack and his family.

374,"Was looking forward to experiencing this restaurant. Unfortunately , I ordered pasta primavera and was served frozen vegetables. Carrots and broccoli cut uniformly, corn, peas and Lima beans. Chef should be ashamed of himself for letting that out of his kitchen...stouffers would have been better!","We've come here quite a few times and never had a problem until 3 weeks ago. I didn't want to write a negative review but I wanted to warn other diners about this place as they are dishonest. My husband ordered the Chilean Sea Bass fish special and he took a bite and said the fish didn't taste fresh and it was mushy. So he told the waiter and the waiter looked confused. My husband told him politely that he wanted to order a different dish instead. Now mind you we didn't make a scene or anything. So the waiter brings him the veal dish he opted for and as soon as he puts the dish on the table he tells my husband that the chef tasted some of the fish and that he said it tasted fine. The waiter started getting argumentative saying ""but the dish was fine"". So now I'm saying to myself wtf is he implying?? It's as if the chef got offended. And who tastes another strangers dish (gross)?? Why would my husband send it back if it tasted fine??? And whatever happened to the customer is always right? Anyway my husband again told him that the fish did not taste fresh and that it was mushy and not firm. Now at this point my husband took a few bites of his veal dish since he was hungry but we wanted to go home after being questioned about a dish that definitely was not fresh. So we asked for it to take home and asked for the bill. When we got the bill we were appalled!!! The bill was $164!! Now mind you we did not order any drinks, just 1 app, my veal entree, my husbands veal entree, 2 ginger ale's. Of course first thing that came to mind was that they did not deduct the fish dish. So we looked over the bill and it showed everything we had and it showed the fish dish crossed out BUT it was not deducted from the total. What kind of sh*t is that?????? That's some sneaky and dishonest thing to do to your customers! And it gets better. Seemed like our waiter was not in sight after waiting and waiting for him to come to our table so we can tell him of his mistake. So we flag down a different waiter and tell him to please get our waiter as there is a mistake on our bill and he looks at the bill and says that it is correct because the fish dish was crossed out. Well apparently no one here knows how to add. So I told him no, it's wrong - check it again. So he gets our waiter and he comes and looks at the bill and looks confused and walks away with the bill. He comes back a good 10 minutes later and says ""oh sorry"". Unreal. Bill was now corrected to $124. On the way out, the owner turned the other way and didn't even look at us lol. As an owner, he should have came to our table and apologize for the dish and that should have been the end of it. They made us feel like it was our fault for sending that fish dish back and to add insult to injury they tried to charge us for that dish and be sneaky about that too. We will never step foot in there ever again after this. Plenty of other restaurants nearby that are far more better and aren't crooks.","I don't know why but I always try to come back to this place and give it another try but I hate it every time. I went for lunch a few weeks ago and I hated it still. The place smelled funny when I walked in, for lunch they give you the lunch only menu which I hate - I want the full fucking menu but I understand not all places do that during Lunch hours. I ordered the rice balls for an appetizer - they sucked and then I ordered a burger medium well and it was bleeding all over the plate so I just left it and didn't touch it. The food just isn't what it was when I used to go on Hylan Blvd years ago. Also - the place needs a face lift. It's decorated as if it's a townhouse built on Staten Island around 2010 with the colors and tile on the floor etc. I really want this place to be better but it just keeps disappointing me every time. I will not be returning again until I hear it's changed in some way.",My favorite restaurant. Consistently good! Never disappointed.  I enjoy the specials and they are very accommodating when you want to modify a dish. Love the wait staff they are always so friendly. Favorite dish is the seafood fra Diavolo.,"Very pleasant experience. We were a group of 10 and ordered a range of food from the daily specials list like baked clams, crab cakes, pizza, veal chops.Everything was soooo YUMI We had a lot of fun and prices are reasonable","UPDATECame for Mother's Day dinner in the later evening hours since we've been here before and were satisfied with our meal. Well, times they are a changin'. Things that haven't changed are the patrons, as its south shore Staten Island at their finest. Also their French fries are still A+First off, we were handed a special Mother's Day pre-fixed menu, which we were not aware was the case since no mention was made over the phone when making the reservation. When we inquired if it was possible to order off the regular menu, the waiter, who defines the word abrasive, snapped at us with a NO. We asked if we could order pizza since we had children with us to which our waiter again snapped, ""If its not on the menu, don't ask!"".For appetizers, we had the fish salad, and two orders of the Luna combo platter, which consisted of fried calamari, grilled octopus and baked clams; all of which came out quickly. The fish salad was light and fresh, and the calamari were also good. Baked clams were a fail. The waiter calmed down his act, but there was a significant amount of time between the apps and main course. While waiting, since we had lots of time to do some observing, tables behind us were ordering from the regular menu. Good to know. Thanks waiter.For the main course, I had breaded pork chops which were good and had lots of flavor. Came with a side of broccoli and a few shreds of spinach and potatoes that were hard like a rock. The filet mignon came out mooing that it was so rare. My dad ordered the branzino and he said it lacked any seasoning. Main course gets a 5 out of 10. As the meal came to a close, a dessert order was placed. I asked for the vanilla bean gelato. While waiting for the bathroom, which gives an insightful look into the kitchen, my sister witnessed an act that is very unsanitary and totally ruined the experience. She saw a worker molding the gelato into the silver container it is served into, with his BARE HANDS. He then looked up and saw my sister looking in, and he quickly washed his hands, mumbled something to his sidekick, who then swiftly pulled the kitchen curtain closed. Typically thought gelato gets its scooped shape from an ice cream scoop. Guess at Cafe Luna they get their scoops from making snow men with their hands. I did not touch the gelato as my sister tipped me off that this is how it was prepared. There was no sense in mentioning something to the waiter because he was angry he had to work to earn his living. This trip was a total miss. I do not know if I'll be back after being witness to this odd/unsanitary act of serving ice cream.",Cafe Luna
375,"Blt is the hot diggity dog there and their eggplant.... Junior there isn't so friendly but you'll get over it once you get your food, your change and your extra ketchup on the side.","I wanted to order their famous roast beef and mutts  on a hero and their dipping sauce, but the place is filthy inside. Not to mention the B rating on the window .  I walked outside and never came back.","You can't go wrong with this place, traditional Italian specialities and Hot Roast Beef to die for, catering, take out or eat in, parking around back.","This is probably my favorite deliTheir sandwiches are amazing, and if you go, I recommend a BLT on a beef patty in cocoa bread (don't forget the hot sauce, you won't regret it)",I was introduce to the shrimp parmigiana sandwich through my son as he attended the high school years ago and I still go back. It's the best.,"Just when I thought I was going to miss Brooklyn here is another Brooklyn great on Staten Island!!! This place happened to come up as a suggestion on my Yelp, and when I seen johns deli I wanted to scream! I immediately asked my husband if this is the same from Bensonhurst! Then looked at the pictures on Yelp, and seen the roast beef and brown gravy!!!! You have no idea how happy I was, and then when I went that same day my navigation said three minutes away! Which made it so much more better!!! There is also parking on the side, but I was so excited I illegally parked right in front, it's a small place, tables in the middle, and a long time, same signs on the wall, like the one in Brooklyn, I ordered my roast beef on a roll, with mozzarella, onions, and a LARGE brown gravy on the side. Rushed home (3 mins) and to my surprise it was the same!!!! Same great taste!!!! I must have demolished that sandwich in three minutes! A guy on line recommend the shrimp parm, one day I will try it, but I'm such a sucker for that roast beef!!!",John's Famous Deli
376,"It's unfortunate that the food tastes good at this establishment. I had a terrible service experience the last time I ordered from here. It takes over an hour for them to prepare their food, which I have come to accept. However I stood at the counter waiting to pick up my order for 10 minutes. When one of the several workers finally acknowledged me, I told her I was here to pick up my order. She asked me if I speak Spanish and unfortunately I do not and when I said no, she proceeded to ignore me and continue what she was doing. It made me feel extremely uncomfortable and I continued to wait till one of the other workers would assist me. Then she proceeded to tell me I owe them money when I paid for this order online.Overall it was a terrible experience, enough for me to never order from here again.","Not licking my fingers or sighing from having just been satisfied with a fulfilling lunch. Not doing either of those things because I just finished, or shall I say ""partially finished"" lunch. OMG!!!! Such a disappointment for me, first and foremost, seems like this delivery took forever and a 1/2 day, but its lunch time, so I can resort to pettiness and overlook that. This was a group order which consisted of the following:* 1 Pernil with White Rice & Red Beans* 1 Maduros* 2 Chicken Empanada* 2 Meat Empanada* 2 Shrimp Empanada * 1 Randy Chicken Wing with BBQ sauce.So there you have it lunch for the day. First & foremost this review is not based solely on my picky opinion, but the opinion of a diverse group of people, ""My coworkers"". So here it goes.... We all thought the Empanadas were mediocre to say the least; they were described as small and dry. I only had the shrimp Empanada, but I agree with everyone else; in addition, 1 Empanada was missing from our order, yet there was no explanation as to why (so much for customer service). Did they run out? Did they forget? I have no clue, but a phone call or email would have sufficed, I'll have to keep an eye on my credit card bill just to make sure there's a price adjustment. According to my coworker who ordered the Pernil with White Rice & Beans, he said the dish was good; while it didn't exceed his expectation, it did meet his expectation. Now for the main event... My Wings.... They were saturated in barbeque sauce and were extremely soggy (see pic). There wasn't an ounce of crunch to the wings at all and I can truly say I am highly disappointed and have wasted my hard earned money. I was overwhelmed with the amount of sauce used and was only able to eat 1 Wing, my supervisor agreed that there was literally too much sauce. ""Will I attempt to try something else from here again?"" you ask ""Absolutely""... ""Not!!!!"" I Should have gone to Havana Central or el Lechon de Negron but they don't deliver to Avenel""damn!""",Called at 8:30pm to get a specific item which they said was freshly made & I was advised that I had to wait a bit to let it cool off before picking it up. I inquired about their hours & they stated they were open until 10:00pm. I get there at approximately 9:10pm at which time a lady advised me through the window pane that they were closed. I advised her that I called and she just stated we're closed! I can't believe they seriously just wasted my time. They have definitely lost future customers. I guess I will just go to the Dominican restaurant on Wood Ave next time. I will never spend a penny at this place.,"My friend raved about this place and I added it to my bookmarks. On Saturday while craving some of my native food I decided to give them a try. At first I was ready to walk out because no one asked if I needed to order, was waiting, nothing for over 5 minutes. Just as I was about to leave a young girl was ready to take my order. I ordered white rice, light beans peril (roasted pork) and a beef enpanada. Did not like the rice. I hate mushy rice. The beans were flavorful and the pork was good. Well seasoned and cooked well, but still juicy. The beef enpanadas were filled all the way, unlike most of the other Dominican restaurants that give you an air filled pastry. It was a bit oily, but tasted good. I am giving them four star because they are family owned and managed. The young girl assisting me was the one helping the others get it together and I know family owned business are hard to control and work in. It is also hard to also get other people who do not have a real interest in the business to corporate, but if they can get some better workers their business would boom even more. Grandmom was working too, placing orders! Too cute. Business has a lot of potential and can't wait to come back to try their mofongo.","I had their food at a street fair so can't review the physical location but YUM. Pernil with yellow rice with peas and sweet plantains (maduros). Delicious food, good price, and very friendly staff. I would eat their food again for sure!!","I've visited this restaurant for the first time ever. When we got there we seated ourselves. Within 10 minutes a young woman did come to the table to take our drink orders. About 10 minutes later , another woman came to the table and and apologized because she had forgotten us and took our orders. The red snapper was out of this world!!!! We also ordered empanadas, black beans with white rice and maduros. They gave us a free sample of San Cocho which was also delicious.  The food was so delicious that we decided to order chicken to go. Overall it was a good experience. Good service and good food. The prices were a little expensive for the portions. We definitely would go back again",Meson Tropical
377,Breakfast was delicious. Place is extremely loud. Can't have a good conversation. Mexican fiesta omelette and greek salad were both very good. Coffee is ok.Outdoor seating (not where we sat) is in a parking lot off Hylan Blvd & a neighboring mechanics shop. I wouldn't recommend for an outdoor meal.,This is was my first and last visit to this diner. The waitress lied to us from the minute we walked in. Told us there were no specials only to find out there were in fact specials the manager came over super rude and told us that we already ordered so no changes but he would take money off the bill but could care less that we were upset. Food came waitress nor manager checked on us and forget about finding someone to give us our check. Very disappointing to say the least,"Horrible customer service. Nobody listens, I ordered well done and my burger was alive still. 23$ dollars for two burgers and they made wrong. Stupid diner says well done on receipt but people must not know how to read. Literally Walked 15 minutes to get disappointed and over charged. Easiest thing to do is cook a burger if you can't do that right you should close AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!! TRASH PLACE I RATHER STRAVE! Never again !","Have had breakfast twice and dinner once. All were good experiences. And food was delicious. For breakfast the Mexican fiesta omelette with a greek salad was very good. Coffee is also good. My wife also enjoyed an omelette. For dinner I had the Greek combination platter: Gyro, Chicken, and Falafel with Rice, Pita, Greek salad and Tzatziki sauce. It was fantastic!  My wife enjoyed the open pita. My In-Laws loved the Roast Beef Au Jus and a Chicken & Mushroom Panini. My 2-year old daughter enjoyed the grilled cheese and french fries. The place can get very loud when it's very busy. My wife and I couldn't hold a casual conversation during breakfast. We had to raise our voices. Just something to keep in mind.","This is my absolute favorite diner on the Island.  I come here all the time. The food is amazing. I haven't had a bad meal here. I've tried typical breakfast food, entrees, deserts, wraps and pasta. If you like pasta, try the Penne vodka. I could not believe how grit was. You wouldn't think about ordering that at a diner but give the food a try, you won't be disappointed. Also, not only is the food great but the service is great as well. The manager always comes over to see how your meal is and if you need anything and the wait staff is phenomenal. Elizabeth is probably the best waitress you will ever encounter. I highly recommend this dinner.Updated to show pictures","This is my absolute favorite diner on the Island.  I come here all the time. The food is amazing. I haven't had a bad meal here.

378,"Extremely disappointed.  Visited today, and it was largely empty.  Ordered a sandwich that I am assuming was a special, as it was hand written on paper in a window.  It was supposed to be Cajun fried chicken, with bacon, baby spinach, pepperjack cheese and chipotle mayo.  Ordered fries with it.After about 5 minutes later, waiter came back to tell me they were out of baby spinach, but he could replace it with another green.  That was fine.Food comes out, I bite into the sandwich, and there was no cheese, no bacon, no replacement green, and the mayo was plain mayonnaise.  There was nothing ""Cajun"" about the fried chicken, though it was cooked well, and crispy.  The fries were lukewarm, at best, but really bordering on cold, and desperately needed salt.  They were super soggy.  I would have brought it to the servers attention, had the staff not been working very hard trying to look busy in a largely empty restaurant.  The lone decent point were the pierogies, although they were just that- decent.  Being a native islander and never eating there prior to today, and knowing its reputation over the years, I was looking forward to eating there.  However, this experience ensures I'll never go back.","I am  highly disappointed in this venue. As a woman who ventures out a lone, and has performed in bars, I have had my faire share of oncoming abuse from horny drunk ape men who have anger management issues. I have knowns this place to be a safe haven, and I even developed an open mic on Tuesday nights to help bring business in and perform my art here. However, it all stopped when a nasty misogynist, apparently friends with one of the bar owners, called me a ""cunt"" loudly and repeatedly after I asked him politely to finish his  pool game so I can set up for my scheduled gig, he then proceeded to push me, and my boyfriend at the time. The cook came out and witnessed his behavior. I went to take a picture of the abusive dude and called the police, and then he hit my phone out of my hand. People sat frozen, the music stopped and no one did anything. The next week the owner called me, he said the guy apologized to ""him"" about his behavior and he didn't need my services anymore at the bar. In other words, his buddy wants to be free of seeing a woman run shit at this shit-hole.  So, GUESS what misogynists?  This place is all yours... and any musicians who are okay within bringing business in for your dirty pockets contribute to everything that is wrong with the world. NO one wants to eat your roach infested food either.","Bryan: ""What's in the burrito?""Waiter: ""I don't know.""Bryan: ""I'll have the grilled chicken sandwich.""55 minutes later we left, having never gotten any food. No food = No stars. (Well, one star, but that's as low as I can go. Which, btw, I think Yelp needs to change.)We walked out and passed another group who had just left for the same reason, except they'd been waiting for over an hour. Riiiiight. All of this is very unfortunate, as the place was kinda quirky/cute with that random road sign, fake graffiti, paper tablecloth look and a decent menu of 1-step-up from pub grub fare. Such a disappointment! Boo.","The food is always great here , prices reasonable and restaurant clean.  I'm glad they updated it, its so much nicer without the pool table. There are not many good places to eat in the area so I'm glad its here.  The shrimp dishes are delicious, the nachos are awesome..the selection of beer is pretty good also!","Cheddar hamburgers with sweet potato fries were excellent. Best hamburgers that we have eaten all week in our visit to NYC. My daughter's fish sandwich was superb. The waitress was very friendly with excellent service. However, the cafe was dark, which did not inspire customers to visit. We had second thoughts when we entered the cafe and almost left without ordering.  Glad we stayed and eat.",Great spot! came in one eve from Brooklyn. A band played some rocking sounds as I grabbed a seat at the bar (tipsy) I might add.  Sat next to two friendly's & ordered a brew while we made salutations. Not a bad spot. I was comfortable among the natives. Friendly bartender too! Recipe for fun.,Cargo Cafe

Fancy Lil joint with tacky decor.  Weird Oder when you step in, but don't let that scare you away, this place is a gem","This was my first,  and last time coming here. Service was okay, very fast paced even though the restaurant was not busy on a Saturday night. We had the calamari for appetizer. The calamari was not that great, lacked alot of flavor and texture. Entree, i ordered a shrimp Caesar salad.  The shrimp had an awful taste that i could not continue eating. Shrimp had a ""soapy"" ""frozen"" taste. The ""head"" waiter noticed I was talking to one of the other waiters about my shrimp and he did not bother to try to resolve the issue. My boyfriend ordered the salmon with lemon sauce and he said it was average. He had better luck than I did. I did not finish my meal and the waiter asked me if I was okay and i said no, due to the fact that i didnt really eat. He then left and came back with the ""after dinner liquors"" and platter of desserts. We obviously were very disappointed and wanted the check. They charged us for the salad even though I hardly had it and did not care to ask me what was wrong. Overall, i am never coming back and do not recommend this place. This place is truly a disappoint that does not care about quality nor customer service.",Let me start off by saying that you should stay away if you're going there for lunch.  I had a restaurant.com coupon to use there which turned out to be a horrible idea. A lot of hidden fine print to use it and when I mean hidden I mean it's made up conditions on the waitress's part. We get there and get a very rude middle aged woman to serve us who acted almost as if we were wasting her time. Aside from the horrible demeanor and welcome the food was decent and came out quick. The sangria was sub par and the waitress had the nerve to include her tip on to the bill because of our coupon which states no such condition. But worse of all the food is wayyyyy too overpriced. Listen there are many other Portuguese restaurants to choose from in this area. Stay away from this one do yourself a favor and don't waste your time.,"We absolutely love this restaurant. It is our go to place, we never get tired of going here. They have an excellent paella marinera which is our favorite. Great choices for dessert & coffee options.

Again, this meal also had ONE broccoli crown lol I didnappreicae that the chef didn't ass salt to my dish and the rice/chips were delicious. But the presentation was not what we expected and the chicken in garlic sauce turned marsala was definitely not a pro. I might be back again but maybe only to order out. As far as the atmosphere and service, the server Uri was incredibly sweet and nice! The restaurant was very quiet which is nice for a simple date/friend/family meal.

380,"Food quality notwithstanding, this place is a gigantic ripoff. Go somewhere else and spend less than half. More than $19 for General Tso's chicken and a small soup. What a joke.","Big disappointment here.Have ordered for years and enjoyed their food.Then suddenly they wouldn't deliver anymore. I pumped our order over $50, but still no delivery.Since it's a new development, makes me think it's new management.Not sure the food is still as good.Always tipped at least 25%",Went here for a lot of years but was very disappointed tonight. Delivery took an hour and a half. The broccoli in the chicken with broccoli and garlic sauce was clearly steamed and was incorporated with the water it was steamed in. All that water diluted the sauce and made the chicken bare. The result was sauce-less chicken and broccoli floating in a container of water.

Prosciutto is not cheap and they don't make fresh Mozzarella at subway, so you get what you pay for. Also, do you have eyeballs? You ever see how much meat they put on these sandwiches, it's absurd. To be completely honest. This ain't a chain sandwich shop, it's not perfect, there prices change slightly when ordering sandwiches cause they eyeball it, you gotta put up with the local banter between patron and shop owner, and the prices are higher then a crappy deli or chain sandwich shop.However!

I think it's mostly about the bread you choose, and I never felt like they were ripping me off. The guys that work there are great, actual Italians, and they've always been friendly.

382,"BLATANT CREDIT CARD FRAUD AT DA NOI IN BAYONNE NEW JERSEY!I went to DA NOI in Bayonne New Jersey this past week and the restaurant committed credit card fraud against me! The manager who calls himself ""Romeo"" allegedly from South America put an unauthorized tip on my credit card without my knowledge or consent! I had to call the owner and let him know he has thieves working for him who are stealing and breaking the law! If you ever went to this restaurant you should definitely check your credit card statements to see if there are any unauthorized charges from DA NOI in Bayonne New Jersey! If you were at any of the other DA NOI restaurants in Staten Island check your bank statements too just to be sure! Maybe there is a pattern of credit card fraud going on in these other restaurants too? I'm sure I'm not the only one they did this crime to! I caught them right away and reported it to the owner! They figure people might not see it or not do anything about it! It's not acceptable and it's a crime! Also the food was horrible,the service was nonexistent and the portions were extremely small! In fact a waiter came to my table speaking only spanish to me and I told him I speak english I'm American! There were no other customers in the restaurant while I was there in the afternoon  and now I know why! I included proof of three photos to show the blatant credit card fraud from this restaurant! One photo is my credit card receipt and the other is my bank statement for the charge and the other is the stub from the original check! As you can see I put an X IN THE TIP SECTION WITH A CIRCLE AROUND IT! The total amount of the check was $81 and they put their own tip of $10 which was not authorized after I left the restaurant! I looked at my  online bank statement and found out the next day! They voided out the original bill of $81 and put $91 instead behind my back and without my knowledge or consent! This is blatant credit card fraud! They should be investigated to see if there is a racketeering conspiracy involving a pattern of credit card fraud at this restaurant and all the other DA NOI restaurants! I was shocked and violated by this corrupt restaurant! By the way I never got my ten dollars back that they stole from my credit card after I spoke to the owner Edward and Romeo the manager of the Bayonne restaurant where the credit card fraud took place! They put back $10 on my credit card and then took it back out again the next day! Double fraud not once but twice! A very unethical and corrupt business! I have to go to the police and report the fraud and dispute the fraudulent charge to my bank!DO NOT GO TO DA NOI BECAUSE THE SAME THING MIGHT HAPPEN TO YOU!!!",First off the decor needs an update. It's Easter and they still have Xmas decorations up outside. That should have tipped me off right away Service was slow and inattentive When the meals came out the server could not remember who ordered what dish so they were calling out the meals like some side show. Very unprofessional for the outrageous pricing they are charging I ordered the lamb chops medium rare. Came out over cooked and were three little New Zealand chops that you could have bought in any supermarket. Again very disappointed for the priceIn closing the only reason why I will ever go here again is if my mother in law drags us there.

We were lucky enough that they were serving their homemade meatballs as an appetizer the day we were in town.

The kicker is the restaurant wasn't even busy. Super slow service. And no he didn't give a discount for spilling a drink all over my jacket, blouse, pants. The picture is of my cardigan after two hours air drying. Still wet. I was very upset. Food was ok but never coming back with my group of friends.","Went there a few nights ago. The food was delicious, the service was even better. Great time, will be back soon!","Went there a few night ago. The food was delicious, the service was even better. Great time, will be back soon!","Nice new spot we tried today! I did not even preview this place on Yelp before coming here. We were actually intending to go to a nearby restaurant, but when we parked across the street from Dava, we smelled some good cooking... so we changed our plans and went here instead. We are glad that we did because this place was great! Everything we had was good and had a comfort food kind of vibe. They have a brunch menu on weekends from 11am-4pm, and you could get a free Mimosa. We opted to order from their regular menu though. They gave us a bowl of tasty corn chips with this really good dipping sauce. It had a nice flavor and spice to it. We got: a beef empanada, chorizo, papa rellena, yucca rellena, tostones, and chuletas with maduros and white rice. We enjoyed it all! The beef empanada had a good amount of ground beef in it. The chorizo was really tasty, and we enjoyed this with the white rice we got with our chuletas. Papa rellena is mashed potato stuffed with ground meat and sauce, fried with a thin coat of breading. This was large and was good. Yucca rellena is mashed yucca stuffed with ground meat and sauce, fried with a thin coat of breading. This was really yummy!  I love how soft and smooth the yucca came out. Tostones is green plaintains, mashed and fried, with a little salt. I like that they were not too thick, and came out good. Chuletas was 2 pieces of pork chops. This was the best! The meat was a nice, thick cut of pork, and very, very, juicy! It also had a great char on it, and the flavors were clean and just yummy! It was really cooked very well.  Maduros are sweet plaintains that have been sauteed. These were perfectly done. Dark brown on the outside, but not burned, and super soft, melt in your mouth on the inside. It was the right amount of sweetness as well. This whole meal was shared with my husband and 9 year old son, and it came out to about $40! Very nice! Our server was also very cordial and attentive.We will definitely come back here again and recommend this spot to friends. I love how this place was a nice contrast between a modern style, but good food that reminds you of home. Enjoy!",Dava
384,The problem with this place is they don't use any gloves when they are touching the customer's food! That's the problem here! The owner seems to be a gentleman and nice guy! The mozzarella is good and their sandwiches are good too! But it's not sanitary to touch and handle people's food without any gloves! That's what turns me off about this place! I saw another review that complained about the same thing but this store doesn't care and they continue to do the same thing and think it's alright! It's very sad!,How do you handle money with the same gloves you make sandwiches with. Cant imagine what happens when they have to use the restroom.,The food was bad and overpriced. The bread was stale and the sandwich was dry. Benanti's has better mozzarella.,"The owner and all the employees are quite possibly the sweetest people in the world. I went in there to grab a Snapple while I was getting a tattoo next door and the owner excitedly offered me a piece of fresh mozzarella and a piece of chicken cutlet he had just made. I was charmed and bought a whole sandwich. He knew I was getting a tattoo and so I brought the sandwich with me. He popped in to check on how I was holding up and if I was liking the sandwich. I've never ever met such nice people.Every time I go there the service is the most attentive and lovely I've ever gotten in Bayonne.The food is always wonderful. Definitely make this a spot you go to if you're new to Bayonne, visiting, or you've lived here for years. You won't be disappointed.","When this place first opened up, my fiancee and I met the owner who let us sample the fresh mozzarella cheese. It was amazing! Well, fast forward to now and I finally got a sandwich form here (typical mozz, prosciutto). It was shockingly mediocre. Nothing was fresh, especially the bread. I tried the mozz by itself and it tasted nothing like what I sampled when this place first opened. I'm guessing I just came on an off day or something. It was a Saturday. Maybe it's great during the weekdays?","What in the name of all that is holy did I just experience here??!! Listen to me- RUN- don't walk- RUN to this place! My husband has been telling me about their food for awhile, but I've never had a chance to pop in. We dropped by today to grab a late lunch....I still cannot believe how customer service driven Giovanni is and how fantastic the food is!  I must share....So I really wanted a cucumber/tomato/red onion salad... but there wasn't any left. No big deal, I'll try again another time. Then Giovanni, whom I've never met before, says to me, ""what were you looking for? What do you like?"" So I tell him and he says, ""I don't have that left right now.... I still have tomatoes and onions. Hang on, I'm running out to buy a cucumber and I'll make your salad!"" I could not believe it. Was he serious? He was going to leave his store to buy a cucumber to make a salad for me? Then he said, ""Hey you're not here for me, I'M here for YOU"" and promptly ran out for the cucumber! He was back in what seemed like a minute and wanted to know exactly how I wanted this salad, explained how he normally makes it and then got to work. I asked him to add in some cold cuts too. What this guy created was pure magic! No really, I'm pretty sure one of the ingredients was magic! It was AMAZING! My husbands sandwich was fantastic as well, grilled chicken, mozzarella and roasted peppers. I also grabbed their lasagna for dinner tonight! I would highly, highly recommend trying this place out. The food I fabulous and the customer service is off the charts! Thank you Giovanni, for a wonderful experience! We will absolutely be back!",Giovanni's Salumeria
385,"Have been coming here for the past 30 years. With the Bayonne Bridge construction and random closures, don't get here as much as we used to. At one time, this place was excellent, plentiful, great food, at reasonable prices. Last night may have been the last time we go back. Walked in at 845pm on Saturday night. One large table finishing up dinner and in various states of leaving. Another table of 8 celebrating a birthday, and us. Hmmm. Why?Service, as always fast. Sangria-very good. Bread, soup (although server asking if we wanted ""more"" as scooping was strange-especially since he put so little in bowl that you couldn't have scooped without tipping bowl). Soup, good, a vegetable lentil, a bit watery but flavorful. Hubby and I both ordered Mariscada en Salsa Verde (seafood in green sauce). Waiter asked did we want vegetables. Asked what it was-a mix of carrots, string beans and peas-of course. Food arrives. Mine is overflowing with Mussels. Not just any mussels, but barnacle covered, seaweed containing, sandy mussels. I had minimal green sauce, so little I couldn't scoop it from the pot to add over my rice. On the plus side my Lobster was well cooked and clams plentiful. Shrimp was a joke, looked like salad sized shrimp, many still containing their shells. I had a piece of 1 mushy scallop. The rice tasted like it was a boxed Zatarain preparation. Potato ""chips"" very thick, soggy, none had a crisp. ""Vegetables"" were a canned DelMonte mixed vegetables. Disappointed, disappointed, disappointed. Decided on Flan as a dessert. While tasty, feel it also was a Jetro restaurant pack pre-made item as well. Very disappointed. Seems like no care to the preparation. Not sure we will return.  Sad to see what was an excellent restaurant decline so badly.","I gave this a second try because I saw some good reviews pop up. However NOTHING changed ! Seriously, I can't believe how horrible the place is. While I sat at the bar a middle age couple was raving about the food- or should I say how plentiful it is. Well, plenty of yuck is still just bad. Stuffed mushroom apps- stuffed with breads (nothing else) and caned brown gravy !/!?Garlic shrimp-tiny very garlic""y""  OKDrinks- can the glasses get smaller?? Stick with sangria you can't mess up wine with triplesec and sugar...lots of sugarWine list-- Nope, none, naddaPaella- all rice, where's the chicken or shrimpSteak- tough as nailssoup- don't splurge for crab..it dishwater with ""something"" in it, but not crab.Tried shrimp in green sauce- same tiny shrimp as app and sauce is corn starch, stock and parsleyAND- REVIEWERS ARE RIGHT::: canned veg and fake potato chips grossly undercooked.Definite no go","OMG I don't know how it could get worse ! I seriously think they are paying for the good reviews. Food COLD, tasteless, canned veg??? Really, canned veg; dirty, old, rude servers. This is simply a NO",First time here. Restaurant area is small. Bar area is a good size to hang out and catch a few drinks. Service was good. Food was good. Will definitely come back.,"Another EXCELLENT dinner / birthday celebration at Rincon de Espana! I just don't get the negative reviews.  Looks at this food!! Consistently excellent for 20+ years (started going with my husband's family when we were just dating).  The chorizo appetizer and escargot were excellent as always.  I love the pork with almonds other of our party of 8 ordered the steak, lobster, paella.  Everyone was raving about the deliciousness and huge portions.  Oh - and the Sangria is the best you'll ever have. Not too sweet, lots of fruit.  We order the white as personal preference.  They make red too.  Servers have been there for years.  Wonderfully attentive gentlemen.  Go! You won't be disappointed.","Eight out of ten messages I receive through Yelp are unpleasant. How can you like that place? You must be out of your mind! How could you NOT like this place? A message I received the other day did nothing to change this reality. I was chatting with my son about where to go on our next birding adventure and more importantly, where to eat. We decided to go to the Ocean Terminal in Bayonne and then Rincon de Espana for dinner. In a truly weird coincidence, my phone alerted me to an incoming email. Great, another Yelp message. What now?How can you like Rincon de Espana, the Yelper inquired. You like frozen vegetables and reconstituted potatoes? Go to Newark and learn what real food tastes like. So we went to Rincon anyway. A friendly welcome, a half pitcher of white sangria and some chorizo got things off to a nice start. My son had the special two pound sirloin steak-medium rare. I had the veal in almond sauce. Yellow rice. Spanish potatoes. Everything was delicious. The steak was grilled to order, the veal was tender and potatoes were crisp. We asked for no veggies but they were brought anyway. Yes, they are the frozen variety. They shouldn't be. We skipped them as we always do.Rincon serves up some good food. We like it here. If you don't, I'm sorry.",Rincon De Espana
386,"What a delightful place to stop by to taste a coco chocolate donut. They also make a mean iced latte, and they're open late.","Came here for breakfast today. To start, the staff was friendly. Then we waited a half hour for our food. We finally went over to the register to ask if our food was almost ready. Employee said ""I called your names five times and no one answered.""  We were sitting about ten feet away at a table. Not once did she come looking for us. Then hands us our food in a to-go bag. We said ""it was to-stay so we weren't listening for our names.""  We proceed to open our food and find that I was charged for a side of bacon but not given one. So I had to make another trip to the counter.  On top of that my omelette was freezing cold from sitting on the counter for so long. Then we open up the four egg and cheeses on plain bagels we ordered. We find that all four of them have bacon on them. Most of the kids just took the bacon off. One kid hates bacon and wouldn't eat it. Another trip to the counter. We asked them to please make an egg and cheese on a plain bagel with no bacon. They said ""ok.""  Then brought the child a roll with a scrambled egg on it. No cheese and no plain bagel.  This whole experience showed a complete disregard for customer satisfaction. I'm really disappointed.",This place has excellent pumpkin spice lattes. Barista said with a lol cinnamon it would be sweeter. Couldn't agree more. Good price for good service. Big variety of food but I am in a pizza mood today,"Great staff and a great atmosphere. The girls are very respectful, call me by name, and always know my coffee order when I walk in. I thought they were giving me special treatment, but they literally know EVERYONE's name and order - I'm amazed at that level of service and commitment. I recently had a work event catered by them for a mid morning brunch type deal. Eddie the owner did a great job taking my order and having it ready exactly when he said it would be. I would recommend their catering to anyone who's hosting a similar event - Professional and spot on. Thanks for everything, and keep up the great work!Chris",When i'm not in the mood to sit at the diner I come here. Perfect for a quick bite. I prefer country donuts over Dunkin donuts anytime. The food and coffee is good. The line can be long but it goes quick. Love country donuts.,"While the line may be lengthy, the food is quite delicious for their low prices. A quick yet enjoyable bite, they have a wide variety of donuts from the classics, vanilla and chocolate with or without sprinkles, to out of the ordinary donuts such as the chocolate coconut and s'mores donut, which I recently tried (4/5, needs more graham cracker and has the perfect amount of marshmallow). Besides donuts, they also have coffee, different kinds of sandwiches, and other kinds of food available - chicken tenders, fries, burgers, quesadillas, and breakfast foods such as an egg sandwich. You can also customize a breakfast sandwich tailored to what you desire. A great place.",Country Donuts Amboy
387,"Food is GREAT! However, the girl who answers the phone either has a hearing problem or is very inept at her job. My order constantly comes wrong, I call back & get an attitude & The has the nerve to hang up on me. This has happened several times, I'll no longer order from here. She needs to be fired!","Have to tell you... we order from Pronto regularly and it's always been excellent but lately it's not been that good. We've given it multiple tries and it's still been sub par. I don't know if they changed ingredients, process or chefs but I have to say I'm really disappointed. This used to be my go to and now I have to find a new spot.  Consistency is key and unless they get it together it'll be time to move on.",The men that work in their are slime balls. The guy with the long nose is constant picking his nose. So effin gross. And how unprofessional their always yelling at the young register girls. Pigs,"We've been eating from Pronto for the last 5 years and have never been disappointed .Our friends and family have all loved the pizza from Pronto as well . People always say it's the best Buffalo Chicken Pizza they've ever had . Damn that Buffalo chicken pizza is GOOD !!!! Too good !! The philly cheesesteak pizza is a very close 2nd best . They're very generous with the toppings which is hard to find at most other pizzerias. Very friendly staff , fair prices and great food . What else could you ask for ?!?! Great job Pronto , thank you for being the best pizza around !! Oh and they deliver very far too bring you their yummy goodness","* This review is on their regular and Sicilian pies, as well as their service.To this day, this is the best pizza on Staten Island. When I say ""pizza,"" I mean REAL pizza, and not that terrible yuppy fancy garbage that places like Denino's, Brother's, Spumoni Gardens, Lee's Tavern, Nona's, Pier 76, Joe & Pat's, and the rest make. This is actual NY pizza. The crust is not cardboard, the mozzarella fills the entire slice, and the sauce isn't a puddle. Pronto's sauce is slightly sweet, and their crust is perfectly fluffy and not too hard. It's not flat pizza and has some mass to it. The size of the pie and slices are typical and enough to feed a family. Their pepperoni and sausage slices are also fantastic. When the oil drips from the crust after folding your slice, you know you're in the right place. Their Sicilian pies are also gigantic and super thick, and could possibly feed more than just a family alone. The cheese and sauce is perfectly distributed, and a pepperoni Sicilian slice from Pronto is just magical. I have yet to get a slice of pizza in NY that competes with Pronto, and I've been living here all of my life. The Pronto on New Dorp Lane is also just as wonderful, and I'd assume all the others would be just as good., but that's just being presumptuous. This is specifically for the Richmond Avenue location. The people behind the counter are always so nice and friendly. Very polite people. If you want a real slice of New York pizza and you're sick of these Staten Island yuppies telling you how great these aforementioned yuppy places are(even though they are not), do yourself a favor and visit Pronto. You're welcome.Also, order online and use code Web10 for 10% off your order.In addition to this, my mother and father also swear by Pronto for their Chicken Francese and Eggplant Rollatini, saying it's the best they had in their 63 years of life as New Yorkers born and raised in Brooklyn. All of us order from Pronto at least 2-3 times a month, and we know real good pizza and pasta.",Always order online and they have the promo code which is awesome and also they have a rewards system. Which is awesome!!Stuffed pizza is really good and filling...Also I like their chicken entrees my favor is the one in the garlic cream sauce.They give you a good amount for the price.Also always quick delivery and the drivers are polite and super nice.,Pronto Pizza Pasta
388,"I've been ordering from Domenico's for years. However, the quality (and the staff) has changed drastically in the last 2 years or so.I ordered two wraps today and the girl on the phone put me on hold three times, leading to a phone call that took 13 minutes... to order TWO WRAPS. Then the order finally came 30 min later and guess what... They got it wrong. They charged me for a wrap that was lacking two ingredients (both ingredients factoring into the price). I thought that everything would be packed deeper into the wrap so I took a bite. I immediately called them and let them know what they had forgotten. The girl immediately put me on hold for 5 minutes and then returned saying she could ""swap it out"". I told her I took a bite out of it already (not knowing what was missing). She again put me on hold and then a manager got on the phone and lectured me about how they made a mistake and it's not a big deal. You're right, it's not a big deal. But taking my already eaten wrap and using the ingredients over for the next customer is. This is in fact, a health code violation. I will not be ordering from them again. The food is very subpar at this point as well.",Was so sad that the soup was terrible!! I love a good homemade chicken noodle but this was legit water with potato's and a few noodles. Would honestly give them another try but this soup is truly so bad,Price went up and using a cheaper bread crumb. Becoming like everything else on this stump of an island.,Great pizza spot that meets all your needs. I order from them like twice a week. Compared to all the other local pizza joints they are clearly the better choice. Their chicken parm is delicious and just about everything else. Enjoy...,Best pizza on the island and fresh calamari very good and tasty food Can't get enough of this place,Not my first time ordering from here but first time reviewing. Very good pizza & salads best Sicilian in the area since villa monte closed but sadly when I opened my box all the cheese was stuck to the top which ruined this order but definitely won't stop me from ordering again. *in response to the owner who commented back I was not the customer who called back and asked for replacement slices! I still enjoyed my slices very much just missed a little cheese. One of those pieces that go into the slices to stop the top of the box from hitting the cheese would be very appreciated in the future though!*,Domenico's Pizza
389,It's been awhile since I ordered from the Staten Island location. Very disappointed in my order. I order  two 10 piece original wings and we got mostly cornish hen legs and a maybe 2 cornish hen wing pieces per order. The last time I ordered we got regular size chicken wings not these things that were also hard. How do you justify charging customers $1 a piece for a cornish hen leg??? I dont like chicken legs anyway. What a rip off...never again....,Worse wings out there. No meat on them and the drown them is sauce. Also it takes forever for an order to get delivered a few blocks. Try other wing places,"Horrible food place is dirty with very nasty staff. Ordered 2 times. First they got it wrong and where nasty about it and I ended up stopping the argument and ate my food which was terrible. Second time I ordered for the super bowl, wings where the size of my pinkie finger and I mean size and width and again where terrible. Never going back and don't recommend it","This is my go-to wing place for the past 5 years and  the negative reviews are surprising. My first time here, one of the employees recommended the leapin lizard sauce and I'll never go back. Their original wings are the perfect amount of crunch and the curly fries are amazing. I usually do pick-up and food is ready when they say it is.","I usually do take out but I pick up. Last night I ordered a delivery. I ordered online and received text messages that the order was received. About 10 minutes later I received another text saying my order was out for delivery. 50 minutes a 2 phone calls later I got our food. And yes, it was cold. I will not do delivery from here again. And the snotty comment from the employee about my bing to wait was uncalled for.","I went in for a quick food.. and i learned after its not that quick as i thought. Had to wait about 10 minutes to get their chicken wrap. The counter guys didn't seem much like they cared or was processing my order. I just paid, ate & kept in the back of my head not to come back! If you seen my images you'll notice the portions are way off, which will help telling you their skills were lacking. The most entertaining part of my visit was also reading up on all the other horrible reviews on yelp.",Planet Wings
390,This is my go too pizza spot in the area. Pizza/food is always delicious.Have ordered delivery numerous times and it's always quick and on time.,"This place is gross. Undercooked mozzarella sticks, Philly cheesteak with grey meat and cheese that looked and tasted like plastic. The best thing I had from there was the paper bag that my cat immediately played with. Horrible.",This place is huge and the pizza is good... Not great but good :-)The bathroom is really nice too.,Went here yesterday for an early dinner and boy !!! If you love pizza; this is the place to get it from. My family always caters from here for events and when I tell you the food never disappoints!! We always order their shrimp and I love it more every time. Back to yesterday's pizza I tried their vodka slice with ravioli and I was mind blown !!! That combination may seem odd but it's truly the best I have ever had. The hospitality and environment is great. If your ever around the island and want to grab a bite I recommend this place !!,"Only reason why I stopped by was because I needed to stop by the organic market across the street and I also had a $5 coupon on Slice. I ordered a Grandma pie and my sister got a grilled shrimp Caesar wrap. I am not sure what happened but I waited a really long time for wrap, the people working there were all really apologetic which was nice, even offered me a free soda. I honestly didn't care but as I got home I realized my pizza was cold and the amount of basil on my pizza was such a disappointment. The pizza was ok, nothing to write home about. I would probably recommend going to brothers if you really want a grandma pie.",This is my second time here and I have to say it was just as good as the first. This time I trod the chicken Alfredo with spinach! It was AMAZING! I went there with my sister and children. The gentleman behind the counter not only served the pizza temperature to my children liking but he also cut it for them which made it so much easier to feed them! Amazing service. The sauce for the pizza is sooo good. Not overly seasoned thank god ... Beautiful staff with respect and very clean.  This has become a staple in my family household! Love this place,Prime Pizza Kitchen
391,"Wow.(In a bad way.) When food is overly expensive and the quality is poor, it makes me pretty upset. With that said, I will usually grumble to myself and then man up and just deal with it. The ramen here is not just terrible, but aggressively bad. Whoever made my ramen must really just hate their life and it shows in the food quality.  The person who made it is clearly working there because it's an airport job, and not because they give a care about food (or people, for that matter). I got the spicy mushroom ramen and husband got the chicken ramen.  There are so many things wrong with both dishes, but ultimately, I was STARVING when I sat down, and couldn't choke down more than 2-3 bites. I left hungry, and sick to my stomach.The waiter was very gracious. In fact, he was actually super nice. So I feel bad to have had this terrible food experience in front of him because clearly he had nothing to do with the food prep (when referring to what the restaurant had on the menu, he referred to it as ""they"", which indicates to me that the food is actually not made at that particular restaurant, but some airport kitchen that probably does the food for most of the airport.) But upon seeing me not eat my food, he offered a refund saying ""don't worry, this happens often"".I don't know how to end this review other than I'm offended by the food here.","OMG worst Ramen everDon't listen to any review that gave them more then 1 star. Tonkotsu ramen was tasteless with a cold hard boiled egg, cold dehydrated fish cake, tasteless broth, huge glob of noodles (also tasteless) and cold bamboo shoot. Do not eat here (well at least the ramen)On a positive note, my Sapporo beer was fine","OMG worst Ramen everDon't listen to any review that gave them more then 1 star.

I should have checked Yelp review but did not. Big Mistake. We sat at the counter and ordered by iPad. The bartender was okay. Semi-helpful with information but not friendly. But since we ordered by iPad, she just had to supply glasses of water and clear the places when done. I went with the tonkotsu ramen, my fav. Hubby had the miso ramen. My noodles were clumped together. :o( The soft-boiled egg was okay, though not cold like another reviewer's. Pork was shredded and decent. Broth was on the salty side. Just couldn't get past the clumpy noodles....","For the airport I must say it was not horrible ramen, but it certainly was not the best. They had really good drinks and ok sushi, but the ramen needed some work. Also the food took almost 40 minutes to come out.

392,"I generally like panera food but this location is really going downhill. My last visit at panera i found short black hair in my breakfast sandwich, bit into a rotten apple, and overheard an employee training their new colleague by cursing every two seconds.","The food was average Panera Bread quality food considering it's all frozen anyways but what I didn't appreciate from my experience here was the fact that I was also frozen due to the AC blasting on a 50 degrees day. I also did not appreciate the fact that my chicken noodle soup was served in a bowl that was not filled to the top. I was barely given any soup and the soup I was given was 95% broth. Upon mentioning to my server that it was barely any soup, she said ""Oh I'm sorry let me give you some more"" and she went to give me more until who I assume was the manager gave her a dirty look and said no. I chose Panera over my other options because I wanted an inexpensive meal. But for the price, with the limited amount of food they give you, I believe I made the wrong choice. I will be sticking to my other options when I visit Staten Island from now on.","I never write reviews for anything but the experience I had yesterday was this terrible. I don't know what happened to this Panera. I worked there 12 years ago and it definitely wasn't this bad when I was there. I ordered a you pick 2 yesterday, a strawberry poppy seed salad and a frontega chicken sandwich. The dressing amount was so small it barely covered the salad, I basically had a dry salad. I know I had a half a salad and it would be a smaller container but there was basically no dressing In the container. The chicken sandwich had barely any chicken on it and the bread was hard as a rock, I literally almost broke my tooth biting into it. It was a to go order so I couldn't bring it back. I paid $16.50 for my order and it just was not worth it. That is extremely expensive for the quality food you get. I will most likely never be going back. Lower your prices and add more food in the orders.",Food and bread are great here except all the soups are too salty.. let the customers put in salt themselves; that would be much better.,"This place is trash. I asked for cheddar and provolone cheese on my grilled cheese and extra cheese at that because I know the bread they use is thick so I wanted to even out the bread cheese ratio. They end up giving me American cheese and not cheddar, provolone they got right but no extra cheese. The best part? They burnt my cheese. With that bad grilled cheese I got bad service. I can't tell you how many times the check out lady told me that the extra cheese would cost more as if I expected it to come free with the sandwich. Soups are always great but the service and the grilled cheese is TRASH!","I really enjoyed my lunch here. I had the light lunch for potato soup and half a chicken avocado sandwich with bag of small chips. Yummy to my tummy. The place is cozy and comfortable, the price is decent. Love it!",Panera Bread
393,Peter our rude waiter overcharged us and then has the nerve to say we didn't leave a tip when we left a 15% tip based on the overcharged amount. He questioned why we needed to see the receipt and had to redo the bill 3 times before he corrected the bill from $100 to the proper amount of $65. When I asked to speak to the manager they said she wasn't there. When I called back later they still insisted she wasn't there and I persisted and finally did speak to Tina and she said she would speak to Peter. He didn't even come to see if we needed water or other advice. We won't be returning.,So Brunch was average.  Nothing great.  The fruit was good but the pastries they give you are the ones no one ever wants.  The entrees were not great.  The real insult was they add a credit card service fee to the bill.  I won't go back.  A restaurant shouldn't add their credit fees on the customers bill.  Especially when the food isn't as good as they think it is.,"Food isn't fresh here anymore. Wraps and sandwiches are cold and the chicken sits there waiting for orders to be placed. They're not cooked on a base to base order. That's also pretty obvious since the food takes 3 minutes to come out .... Soda isn't acidic it's more watered down / stale. staff loves to argue also. The customer is always right. If I ask for something don't argue with me and pull out a receipt saying "" is that what you told your waitress"". Even If i didn't tell my waitress, it shouldn't matter. I'm asking for it now. Was a regular customer but not anymore. Improve your customer service and food quality.","I order my daughter Sweet 16 cake with Fina. The cake was beautiful and was create and design as best to what we requested. The taste of the cake was great. FINA is very knowledgeable of her works, Understanding and Caring of her customer's.

394,Just tried to call and place an order but the number was no longer in service. I think they closed down.,"I ordered the seafood ravioli through grub hub. The 1st ravioli that I bit into didn't have any filling in it. Once I found one with filling, the crabmeat mixture didn't taste fresh. I had a 63 dollar order and it was extremely disappointing. I was looking forward to this place based off of reviews that I've seen.",The food was exceptional. I went here with my girlfriend because my friend spoke very highly of this place and we were not dissapointed. Friendly staff and highly recommended if you're looking for quality food and service,"OMG.  IN our backyard for months and we didn't know how great it was..Appetizers were coconut shrimp,  calamari with marinara sauce.  Cooked to perfection... Colette can sure cook.....I had chicken quesadillas , fresh fresh fresh. The guys had burgers, phenomenal.Next time getting bolder and promise to try all their original flavors .Gotta try the lemonade, basil and mint.who would have thought!!We will most definitely be back..","* Que Beef Burger* Thai Twist Tofu Wrap* Fried Sweet PlantainsWent to Two Que's Cafe for lunch.  Its a small but comfortable spot.  The server was friendly and polite.  We ordered the Thai twist tofu wrap with a spicy Thai peanut sauce, lettuce and sweet peppers.  A side of plantains and a Que beef burger that had bacon, sauteed onions, tomatoes, cheese and a fried egg on top of a toasted seeded bun with mayo and ketchup.  I asked for the burger to be cooked medium.  The server brought the meal out and everything looked awesome and all the food was well seasoned.  My one and only complaint was the actual burger.  It was cooked WELL DONE instead of MEDIUM.  I did not send the burger back and ask for a new one because I was starving.  If it was cooked to my liking I would have given this review four stars.  I will definitely go back and give it another shot.",Had an amazing dinner here last week as I participated in one of this cafe's events.  The food tasted fresh and home cooked!  Even the simple foods were phenomenal such as the Beans and rice - OMG so good.  Would love to go back soon.  My favorite was definitely the coconut shrimp :-),Two Que's Cafe

Thanking Jesus I didn't have to starve, but I threw half of it away.","Not a good experience.Sent me a wrong order, I order eggplant rollatine and they sent eggplant parmegiana.","Eh. Went in for a slice. People weren't nice or helpful at all, but that's somewhat expected for Jersey I guess lolPizza wasn't the best. Probably been sitting out too long. I'd go back again but only out of necessity.","Food is outstanding, best pizza in Elizabeth. Great variety of fresh specialty sandwiches, pizza is delicious made the right way.","Staying at a nearby hotel on business decided to try a local pizza joint. Was going to uber it but it was snowing and didn't feel like venturing out into the cold and leaving my life in the hands of someone I didn't know.  So we ordered delivery.  I finding myself trying to be healthy ordered a salad with grilled chicken on it and my co-worker and I decided to split a pizza. We decided on a half margarita/ pepperoni and sausage. The half meat was mine, my co-worker is on some meatless Diet...but he didn't mind the pizza with meat sharing the same box as his vegan pizza which was cool...The order arrived about an hour after we placed it. The pizza was still warm but not hot. It was pretty tasty and it looked like it was made fresh, but being it got cold the crust became soft and lost its crispness.....the sauce, cheese, pepperoni and sausage were good....definitely New York style...The salad had  fresh greens and the chicken on it was good. Overall not too bad for a delivery in a snowstorm.I'd give a perfect score but the pizza could've been hotter...they had it in one of those warmer bags, but it looked old like they could update it to something newer that would keep it hot...this caused the crust to become soft and lose the crisp it looked like it had...next time I'll take the uber and try it in house",Pizza is rich and absolutely divine! I love ordering the Tomato Pie. The detail in every ingredient is spot on! Thank you for having delivery available. The driver is always fast and delivers great service!

396,"We came here for a ealry dinner. We are 6 people and only another table with 2 people.  We order our food every ones food came out but not mine. I order a paella, which  i know it  takes a little longer to cook, but there is no excusefoe my food to come out when my table was done  eating. The waiter which i know its not his fault didn't even keep me posted on when it would come out. I have never been to a restaurant that management didn't care either",I always walk past the restaurant ding the restaurant empty and the bar full. Should have been my clue to avoid this place. My wife and her friends insisted. I order the skirt steak on the tile. The waiter tried talking me in to something else. (Warning Sign) I stick with skirt steak. He didn't cut the steak instead placing the near raw steak on my plate. Ughhh! Now as for the flavor bland ! I gave this a lot of thought this absolutely without a doubt the worst stake I have had. Take a ride to Ferry St. Newark or Solar in Belleville!,"Planned a family gathering here this Mother's Day (went the day before)...we had a large group of 13, and had to enter through the bar door because the main door was locked. It was uncomfortable carrying small children through the bar to the other side connected...I'm not sure if it was an ethnicity thing or what, but me and my in laws (I'm white and my in laws Puerto Rican) were seated at fold up tables covered with a table cloth, while the Brazilian/Portuguese customers got star treatment. Could have been a coincidence...our service was bad. The waitress was sweet, but the man who brought out the steak on a tile was spilling grease all over the floor and on my baby nieces plush jacket and didn't even apologize. Our food all came out at different times and we had to constantly ask for bread because there were hungry children while waiting nearly an hour for chicken fingers, and we got attitude for continuously having to ask. When our glasses were refilled, they did so quickly as not caring that the beverages were being spilled all over. I don't speak Spanish or Portuguese so I asked what certain items were and the waiter spoke quickly while walking away as if not caring...I ordered the chicken in rice thinking that's what I'd get...I got a rice soup with bits of chicken. Had I known it was a soup, I wouldn't have ordered. It was very bland. Someone in our group ordered the chocolate mousse for dessert-the menu should called it chocolate soup because it was so watery-NOT a mousse. And, the fact that you are given the option to buy a single apple or a peeled orange at a cost of $3.50 as a dessert shows how ""classy"" this place was. My husbands créme brûlée was also burnt. When it came time to pay, we did the math amongst the family since some had cash and some had cards. We told the waitress how much to put on each card after the cash was put through...30 min later, I had to ask what took so long...I was told the waitress didn't know what amounts to put where and couldn't do the math...she had acknowledged the amounts when we gave her the 2 cards (told her $68 goes on the cards and the rest was covered by the cash) apparently this was too hard to understand. One thing I still have yet to figure out is why there were so many ugly fake trees scattered throughout the restaurant...","Hidden gem. Great service, good food, excellent sangria ( with the headache ! ).  Great atmosphere- I recommend that if you are only dining as a couple or A small group, sit in the front room, where the bar is. They have a jukebox and everybody talks to each other.I always order the salmon, fried calamari, and the grilled octopus. Never had a bad meal, except for when we went with a large group for a Christmas party, the fish (filet of sole) was very salty and overcooked.  It happened only once, out of the many times that I've been there.  The staff some of them don't speak English fluently, but they are so nice and accommodating and trying to explain the dishes, that it's really not an issue at all - it only adds to the experience. The area is a little crappy, but they do have parking lot in the back, so if you're worried about your car it's not a problem at all.",This was first time coming here and I must say it was a good experience. It wasn't really crowded at the bar area which is where we decided to sit. They have another room which is a bit more fancier. When we sat down we were immediately greeted by the waitresses. For drinks we started with sangria which was really good. We got a whole pitcher which felt like never ending sangria. For our entree i got the grilled shell steak which I was excited to try. My boyfriend got the picadinho. They both came with a side of rice and fries. I was not pleased with the shell steak. It was never fatty. But I got to try my boyfriends picadinho and it was great. Very flavorful. I wish I ordered that instead. They do give a lot of food. We had enough to take left overs of both meals. I would definitely come back but try something else besides the shell steak.,"This is the worst restaurant meal I've had in the past three years, and it was expensive!The chicken was rubbery, the texture of undercooked chicken. The other meat dish we got wasn't as bad, but it was bland (other than being oversalted). The fries were room temperature and soggy, as if they'd been sitting out for hours.On the plus side, the bread was pretty good.",Minhoto Restaurant

The square had the consistency of chewing on cardboard.,This is my standard pizza place I order from around here..nothing special but gets the job done.. I've only had the pizza here and have no complaints,Food was plentiful done very nicely much more than a pizzeria would certainly come back and not afraid to recommend it,Best Italian pizzeria/restaurant on Staten Island.Fan favorite of their calamari slice!

So frustrating,  I ordered  a wrap  veggie 4 inch  long over 10$ and cold never ordering  again!","Ordered for pick up, waited over 20 min, got there just for them to tell me they just put it in.. asked the girl to put sauce with the knots..NO SAUCE?! Place is getting worse and worse..never coming here again..","I ordered a large pie and they sent me a pie that looked more like an individual pizza. All the Staten Island pizzerias short on the size of their so called ""large pie"".  I should have taken a picture.   The slices were literally half slices.  Totally ridiculous. If there is a next time I will have to order 2 pies to equal an actual large pie.  Decent pizza though.",Deeee-lish. Heaven is a couple slices and a soda.,"I am very picky when it comes to pizza. I love dough, just enough cheese, not too much sauce, but just enough...and a lot of pepperoni to cover the entire pizza, but not too overwhelming. Let me tell you, with how complicated that sounds, this Pizza is by far the best I've ever had! From their sweet staff to the variety of options in the menu, it's very fresh, flavorful and well prepared. I wish this pizzeria was nearby where I live because I would be there all the time. I 1,000% recommend!","Love the cold seafood salad from here! Always fresh, plentiful and delightful! They give you a nice portion size- so much that I can eat it it twice, and it's only like $15 something. Must try!",Amici Pizza
399,"Burrito Shoppe is a local staple. The interior does seem a bit dingy which may make you stand offish but don't let it. The food is good and reasonably priced. The torta combo is a good deal at $10 you get the torta, fries, and can of soda. Not a bad deal any time of day. The torta is delish! No complaints here on the. Strangely enough the first and second time I ordered this I got different types of fries. The fries the first time although more than enough, were extremely soggy shoestring fries. That being said I have ordered it more than once because the deal and the torta alone are the same price. So why not?! The second time they were thicker but still not crispy. The burritos/burrito bowls are BIG. More than enough food to fill you and then some.",Idk in what universe these are considered enchiladas but I will not be ordering from this place ever again. Chicken was added to the dish as a side rather than incorporated into the enchilada. Food was room temperature. Enchilada sauce was more like a chunky yet dry salsa than an actual sauce. Just awful.,Worth the 2 block walk up from the Empire Outlets. Had the quesadillas and Sara empanadas. Very tasty. Seemed quite authentic.,"the store is close and accessible from the ferry terminal and the outlet. i ordered the burrito and it was stuffed! i was only able to eat a half and saved the rest for dinner. the cost is reasonable at about $8 and change. they heat up the wrap and you get to choose what kind of rice, beans, and 1 protein you want. most toppings (guac cost extra) are free like lettuce, salsa, sour cream etc. i was inbetween the spicy chicken and spicy ground beef. the spicy chicken was good and it has a nice kick! next time i will try the spicy ground beef. only thing is, i wish the rice had a bit more flavor. my friend got their spicy chicken quesdilla and it was good, i think the burrito has more flavor and is more worth it. this shop is casual/self service seating and you dont need to pay tip. it was homey. the colorful walls, the artwork, and calaveras on display is beautiful.","This burrito tasted really great, showed up quickly and the delivery guy was nice and friendly.unfortunately i don't think they could have possibly fit more onions in my ""shrimp burrito with no onions""still hit the spot though.",So good!

400,Poor customer service. Not quite sure why the woman on the drive-through mic had an attitude while taking my order .. Food took a little on the longer side to actually receive. Only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because the food was actually really good!,"Just horrible!!!!Drive thru closed. Line out the door because only 2 people work there. Unorganized and sad. No customer service and and zero professional. Renovated to look better but ran terribly!! Try cleaning the tables too. What a friggin mess. I am modifying this review, after eating the food. Not only did they forget the gravy for the mashed potatoes. And of course we were too far away to turn around. But the grilled chicken seem very fried and the mashed potatoes were terrible. I guess they might've tasted better covered up and gravy. How do you screw up franchise food? It's all regulated and repetitive. Perhaps you should have more than one person at the counter and more than one person preparing food.","This place is an absolute disgrace, and so are the pathetic unprofessional manager & workers. Ordered from UberEats, 90% of the order didn't come, called KFC several times, and no answer, it goes to a fax machine. Decided to go get the rest of the food I paid for. Explained to a girl who calls herself a manager that 90% of my food was missing, even brought the food they did deliver, her response.. so you got food delivered, but still decided to drive her.... well yeah! Considering no one answers the phone...called the store in front of her, put it on speaker phone, heard the phone ringing in the back, and still no one picked up, went to a fax machine, she just stood there with a pathetic look. She finally decided to give me the rest of the food I paid for. BUT... told one of the employees to ONLY give me the food that was missing....huh? So I'm suppose to eat half cold food, and half hot? No you are going to give me the entire order all over again, and you can take what was already delivered! So unprofessional! So pathetic! So sad! If you don't like your job get a new one, and if you can't handle being a manager at a KFC I'm sure you won't be able to handle a career!",Super long wait... didn't have what I ordered... all the food went up 2 dollars...tables and floor not clean....drive through closed.,"KFC is KFC ; I get it ,fast food.  But for god sakes, clean the tables!  There were chicken bones on almost every table, for fucks sake the bathroom was cleaner.  This place needs a manager, or has to fire the current one.  It doesn't take much to get one of the workers to clean the dining area.","I've lived on Staten Island for 8 years now and tried giving this place chances but can do so no longer. Many times, I've received food that was NOT FRESH. Chicken, sides, all have varying quality, but more often you get food that is old, like it was sitting out, not sold that day, then refrozen and reheated for use again. If you go in in the later evening, they usually make you wait, which sounds like they're limiting the quantities of prepared items in advance and would happen if they don't sell, a likely outcome if you lose customers to bad food. Not just chicken, but everything. Even the biscuits made me nauseous and tasted like someone put something in the batter. I also noticed that you have better chance of getting this off-tasting, stale food if you use the drive-thru later in the evening. Perhaps they think you won't realize the problem until you've gotten home and either won't drive back to complain or do so and they'll be closed. If I want KFC, I go to Brooklyn. I'll never go here again.",KFC
401,"I always order sushi from a different place, but decided to give this place a try and boy was I disappointed. The Sashimi was not fresh and sushi didn't taste good. They charge extra for every additional sauce. I was very disappointed and will not be ordering food from this place ever again.","After reading the reviews, I wanted to try this place out. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to the hype. It was my first time ordering from here and the sushi just didn't taste fresh.","Only been open for 3 months. Was in the neighborhood shopping and had a craving for sushi. Their menu is very small. No uni or quail eggs. No premium sashimi, however their sushi looks very fresh.","Great food, small 6 table sushi spot that pledged for quality food and great service. You cannot go wrong here with any sushi or sashimi order. Yummy!!!","My husband and I have been planning on hitting this spot up for a while, we just never got around to it. Finally walked in one night about 45 minutes before they closed. It had one larger party and two other couples seated which suggested good things to us. It is small though, and we took the last table available. The service was good and always attentive. We got the edamame, seaweed salad, sweet potato tempura roll, veg dumplings, and the avocado cucumber roll. My husband also got a few special rolls and the spicy garlic wings. All of it was super delicious and fresh, and my husband went to town on the wings. We also got mochi which was lovely. The bill was way more than reasonable, honestly we can't wait to go back. I was really unsure what we would think but now we are looking fwd to having this option.","I was on a business trip and had a great meal at this small, clean restaurant. The quality of food was excellent with generous portion size.",Rahway Sushi
402,"I came on a Sunday at 745pm. I wanted to come after reading the reviews and seeing pics of the food. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  Upon walking in...the establishment smelled like a cat's litter box.  It was dark, dirty and looked dingy. Despite these facts and me wanting to leave I decided to give it a try.  Trying to stay open minded.Another mistake - should have trusted my gut.  Me and my guest ordered a vodka and seltzer and the special blueberry martini.  You can't mess up a vodka and seltzer so the 1 * is for that only.The martini was koolaid with a dash of vodka. The customer service is AWEFUL. Upon walking in both the male and female bartender seemed more interested in maintaining their personal conversations than serving guests. The male bartender was dismissive and the female bartender Gina was inexperienced and it was revealed in the martini she made.The prices of the drinks were ridiculous for Elizabeth,  NJ. $13 martini and $11.50 vodka and seltzer is more than NYC and the drinks SUCKED.I don't see why anyone gave a 4 or 5 star rating here. Not impressed at all.  Maybe other nights are good but the Sunday staff needs work.I do not recommend and will not return.",The bartender Tony made great recommendations and was very accommodating given my grumpy attitude after getting flights cancelled at EWR. This place is just what the doctor ordered.,Tony makes the world go round!  Also they make a damn fine burger! Be sure to get a beer!,"I had a long day flying. Damn my arms are tired... I digress. There does not exist a more tight knit set of amazing bar tenders (Tony, Phil LA) and a chef that can whip up quite frankly the best quesa-dilla this side of 2019.  Special shout out to the gentle giant at the door (#John). Pure heart and pure happiness. You can't miss popping in for a brew dog or the killer food. God bless.","Good food and good selection of drinks/beers - Anheuser-Busch beers on tap, which is great! Price is also very affordable. We were served by Tony who provided excellent service",Came around 7PM on a Thursday with my 3 friends and they had $20 sangria pitchers which were really strong (that's a good thing bc you get your money's worth) but I just wasn't a fan of the taste. The mozzarella sticks were so good and the cheese quesadillas!!! The chicken fingers weren't so good and neither were the fries. The quesadillas were actually probably just as good if not better than the Applebee's one! Our waiter was Tony and he was amazing! Super kind and very efficient,Nugent's Tavern Irish Pub & Grill
403,I've been ordering from here for months.  I order my food the same way. My fish fried hard. I called to let the manager know my God was prepared incorrect. His response was rude and unprofessional.  He says this is how all fish is prepared and he is not going to argue with me.  Then asked if I wanted my money back.  I responded yes. He says ok and he is sending the driver back to get the food and return my money. Driver gets here asked for the food without my money. I asked where is it. He said it on my card.... but didnt come with proof. I asked why doesn't he have it... he then all of a sudden can provide it. It was in the car. It just says voided. Not happy about the service today at all,"Big portion and juicy chicken! -1star becuz some pieces are not as well seasoned, overall worth it","Was so excited to try this because my attempt to find really good fried chicken has been a fail. But this was in no way a four star establishment and the chicken, though flavorful was old and dries out and poorly butchered. So poorly butchered that I couldn't tell which part of the chicken I was eating. We ordered the mash potato, mac and cheese and onion rings for sides and they were very disappointing. The potatoes come with gravy even though not described as such and it was a weird tasting gelatinous concoction. The mac and cheese was so orange and shiny that it looked and tasted like plastic. The onion rings were greasy, formerly frozen, and gross. We also ordered cheesecake and banana pudding for dessert. The banana pudding was 2 tbsp of imitation banana flavored pudding and 30 vanilla wafers. The cheesecake was pretty tasty. In short, if you think you're getting delicious, southern-style fried chicken and sides, then think again!","The food is Always Hot & Fresh! I'm visiting from GA where Fried Chicken is a Southern Gem! But Rahway Fried Chicken really made me feel like I was back home...G. Laidler (Atlanta, GA)","I recently found this place when I was searching for fried chicken near my home. I needed to place a large order of wings for a surprise bbq for my fiancé. After comparing prices for the quantity I needed and Yelp reviews as well, I decided to give this place a try.I always love online ordering options. However, you can't place an order for a later pick up. The only option is ASAP which they estimate to be about 20 mins. When I placed my 100 wing order, they did call my cellphone within the next 2 mins to let me know since it's a really large order, it would take about 30 mins (instead of the estimated 20) which was fine since I assumed it'd take longer and placed my order about 45 mins before I intended to pick up. The woman that called me was very friendly even though our conversation was short. My cousin picked up the tray of chicken for me (which included a bag of dinner rolls). They were a hit with my friends and family! I'm glad these were the bigger full chicken wing (not wingettes) and they were fried nicely. Very crispy but flavorful white meat on the inside. I'm unsure how the location actually looks since I didn't pick up or how other food tastes but I definitely intend to try this place again. A few friends even asked me for the name of this place because they loved the chicken so much. I'll be sure to update my review when I try other things!","Wow! This Fried Chicken is so delicious!I was craving some fried chicken and started looking up menus on Yelp and stumbled upon this place. I had seen it before but had opted to try places closer to me first. their online menu was really good, easy to read and to access online. The prices were great as well! I placed an order for delivery and my order came earlier then anticipated. We had ordered an 8-piece a fried chicken which came with three roles and two side dishes. We chose the mac and cheese and French fries. The signs are nothing to write about. You come here for the chicken! We were also eyeing up some of their chicken sandwiches as well, which I would assume are also really good. The chicken breading is almost unbelievable. It is so well seasoned and delicious, it leaves you craving more. The quality of the chicken itself is also great! Some places skimp on the quality of chicken and just brought it but this place has great chicken with a delicious and perfectly crisp outside. I'm such a fan of this chicken, I'm hooked on it now! And they do delivery!",Rahway Fried Chicken

The service was great, and the food was fresh. I'll definitely go back soon.","This place has some of the worst service I've ever seen. If there are more than two tables with people seated at them, forget about prompt service, and forget about the waitress getting your order right. If I received half of what I ordered for dinner it would have been great. At one point I was sitting there for an hour waiting for some miso soup. I asked the waitress, who barely understood a word I said, where the soup was. She disappeared into the back and I guess my soup disappeared with her because I never received it. None of my food orders were correct, and when whichever messed up order finally did come out of the kitchen, the food was cold, like it had just come out of a refrigerator. Obviously that only applies to the hot food like the soups and not the sushi buffet. The food itself, what little of it that was good, was pretty stock. Nothing special. Just your run-of-the-mill Chinese restaurant. I've had better. The main problem is the lack of grace and the lack of a viable system to properly serve the customers. Between, that, the tardiness, the sloppiness, and the inability of our waitress to communicate with her customers, this place doesn't even deserve one star. I wish I could give it zero, but Yelp is too nice. Won't be going back here any time soon.",Red Apple Restaurant
405,Local Cuban/Puerto Rican restaurant with authentic food that is very reasonably priced.,Took forever to get arrive food has NO FLAVOR!!! The green plantains tastes and looked like they were sitting on oil the rice no flavor and the meat tasted like a unseason meat just raw meat a waste of $33... the delivery driver never came out his car expects you to go to him and you expect me to give you tip?? Rude I give tips generous tips but not when your an ass and also didn't even bother to show effort to come out the car as well.... FOOD TOOK 1.5 hr & IT WAS COLD!! Never again,"I had ordered from this place before and the food is decent, but I had forgotten how long they take to deliver. Needless to say As I am writing this review at 8:59 and the food just arrived and had ordered the food around 7:15 I will never order from this restaurant again!!!","Today ,my wife asked to try out this spot she claims she saw them on news 12 and like their story . The place is in a so so area of Elizabeth Nj . The parking is street and meters which .25 cents gets you only ten minutes at a clip . The place is a whole in the wall type of joint . We ordered the steak sandwich with fries and a Cuban sandwich . The steak was under average and a little chew for my taste . The wife Cuban was good but average at the best . The place was clean and the staff was very pleasant to deal with . Just food was ok !","Ordered online:  Shrimp Mofongo, side black beans, lemonade & avocado salad. I will say the woman who delivered the food was extremely nice and apologetic for how long it took to come...however it took over 2 hours from Elizabeth to Roselle (what?) to receive such a small order.  My small lemonade was $4, it was though actually delicious & not overly sweet as some spots do, but $4 for such a small drink?  On top of all the waiting and my hunger for 2+ hours, anticipating mofongo with red sauce and black beans... I was charged for black beans but they were not in the bag, charged for nothing and I was not about to even make a deal about it at this point. Hangry. My 'salad' was a few strings of lettuce and slice tomato with avocado but mostly canned string beans, beets and other canned veggies. Thumbs down. A salad is a salad: fresh lettuce, enough for a human portion, maybe some onions and tomato, cucumbers? anything FRESH...doesnt have to be fancy. I don't want canned veggies that cost 99cents a can or less that were 90% of the 'salad'.  Thats not what Im paying for. Mofongo was a good size portion and Ive had better (Bonao in Perth Amboy for one) but it was good enough or I was just super hungry.  It did have chicharrone super fried hard pieces in it when I just ordered shrimp mofongo, it seemed like pork, I just picked it out, wasn't edible, not a huge deal for me esp after waiting that long, but for anyone who cant eat pork or chicken it would be so they should note that.  Shrimp was on the ok range, not a ton of them. I asked for red sauce on the side as some can be dry which also wasn't there. For $35 or so plus waiting that long, missing items, etc...seems the base may be there but Im sure they can do much better if they revise things and make adjustments.","I've been going to El Palmar for a while and it's still my favorite place to go to for Puerto Rican food in the area. This is a small family owned place on the super popular Elizabeth Avenue. Parking can be difficult to obtain - so be prepared to search. The owner, Eddie, is very nice and always greets his customers if he happens to be in the dining area (and he usually is, from my experience). This is a no-frills kinda place. Place mats are paper, napkins are grabbed from a dispenser, and utensils come in a paper package. If you're like me and care less about the particulars and more about the food, you won't be disappointed here.I am a mofongo lover. Mofongo all day, please. I really enjoy the mofongo here and I prefer it to other places in the area. This place is also one of the few Caribbean places in the area that serve jibaritos. A jibarito is a sandwich that can come with either chicken or steak, but instead of bread, it's nestled in between two thick pieces of platano (not the sweet ones). Yum, yum, yum! I was so happy to find that menu item because it's a favorite of mine. You can find the typical Puerto Rican/Cuban fare here. Rice and beans, bistec, pollo guisado - you can even find puerto rican pasteles and other cuchifrito type food like pastelillos and alcapurias. Waitresses speak both English and Spanish (so does the owner), so English only folks will have no problem getting what they want here. El Palmar is an Old Elizabeth favorite that many people have been visiting over the years. In the past few years, some changes have been made, but it still remains a staple here in Elizabeth. They even offer delivery service now, which is a huge bonus!",El Palmar Restaurant
406,"Not conducive to an airport. Maybe this isn't fair because i didn't actually GET any food here although I tried.  They were OUT of crab. And most of the other things I tried to order. Except chicken wings and burgers?? How is that possible in a sushi restaurant? Extremely slow service. I ordered Miso Soup to go and waited over 15 minutes and had to leave.  Should have just poured it and sent me on my way. They have all kinds of food besides Asian which might be the issue?Loaded nachos, fish tacos, crab cake sliders and...Japanese food??Watched multiple people walk out exasperated.  Get your food on the other side of security unless you have a 4 hour layover.","Ordered veggie tempura and dragon roll, waited more than 40 minutes for my food. Tempura was terrible with paper tissue inside. Dragon roll, probably the only lady server forgot about me and the dragon roll is 0 crisp inside and really not fresh. The chef really don't know how to make the food the right way, the server really forgot everything. Many of the customers got wrong check and had to wait for checking. Waste of time, if you in little hurry, forget about them. Plus, the server asked for more tip.","Wow! Never have I written a review so quickly, while I walk out of a restaurant. So I specifically asked the person at the entrance if I would be able to finish my dinner before 7.10 PM(flight boarding time and I had 40 minutes left before that) and she said she wasn't sure but still allowed me to go on. I found a seat at the extreme end of the restaurant, set down my two huge bags, browsed through the menu pages, made decisions on what I was going to have (while watching some deliciously looking foods pass by me).Then comes a waiter and informs that they were short on staff that any item from the menu was going to take 45 minutes to one hour to arrive at the table. Feeling totally distraught and hungrier, I got up from the table, packed everything and headed to the entrance. As I courteously explained to the same waitress at the entrance on what was told to me hoping she would apologize or at least take that message for the next incoming customers, but she responded with a SMILE!!!!My problem was not with the shortage of staff but with the horrible customer service by the lady who couldn't properly give a time, know that there was staff shortage or know to apologize to a pissed off customer.Now I got to pass this place every time I land at this airport and will have some nice memories to carry!!!","Do not come here if you are already at the point of hangry. We were waiting on a flight back to Florida and decided that this spot looked ok. Sat down at a table...10 minutes in and no one has waited on us. We get up and go look for other options, but theres not many. So we come back and this time sit at the bar. We were greeted pretty quickly and ordered a plate of rice, and some beer (because we are the epitome of health). We were really just trying to find something to hold us over without spending a small fortune. Fast forward, beer is cold (YES!), and they bring me my plate of fries. Wait, what? Fries? I thought I said rice?! *scratching head* Yall...I was at the point of crying because the experience was already pretty upsetting. But the fries pushed me over the edge. Speechless.","Waited 20 min for someone to come over and say, ""would you like to order?"" We said ""yes please!"" And then the guy walked away and no one came over. About 10 min later a girl came by and asked ""do you want sushi or food?"" We said ""both."" And she said, ""our kitchen isn't open yet."" So after being seated and sitting at the restaurant for 30 min, they told us we couldn't even order. Instead of addressing us as soon as we got there and giving us time to get food elsewhere.Get food before you get to the airport because the staff at EWR does not give a hoot about customer service.","TL; DR: Eat before you get through security while traveling via Newark.There are few airports in North America with less charm than EWR. So, it's probably appropriate that Sora is definitely one of the least charming fast casual Japanese restaurants you'll find a modern day traveler.Sora gets one start for a respectable menu and one star for a relatively engaged staff. It loses one star for prices steep even by airport standard and two for the uninspired execution and quality of it's offerings given said price points.",Sora Japanese Cuisine & Sushi Bar
407,"This is a great authentic Mexican spot that i just discover. However, I can't give it a 5 star because I was very disappointed that not only do they not come to ask you if your food is ok but they also do not take credit cards or debit cards. cash only! It's very rare for me to have any cash on me so this was very disappointing. I did mention it to the ladies that they should have a sign or something that says cash only. Other than that the tacos alPastor are delicious,the horchata is also good, the Guacamole is good..","Sadly I found flies in my food yesterday.  Not one or two, we had to throw the food away. We got the nachos and a chicken dinner. My sister got a salad. Nothing tasted right.  I drove passed the place today and the door was open and there were soooo many flies. I just kept driving. Never again.",Long story short I walked into this restaurant tonight got the dirtiest look from the waitress as if they were about to close and I just ruined it because now she has to serve us. I asked if they were open and she said yes then I asked if they take credit she said no so no problem my daughter and I proceed to sit down look at their menu to decide what we want... we sat there for about five minutes meanwhile the whole time she's on the phone talking to someone not once did she acknowledge us or ask us if we needed anything...so we decided since she had an attitude when we walked in we were going  To leave and when I turned around...there was a nice gentleman sitting down eating and he turned and looked at me and said I'm sorry...and I said it's OK and  thank you n i said I guess she doesn't want our service and I left.,The food is amazing and the women are very nice.  The place is always busy so I'd call ahead to pickup your order or you might be waiting 30minsI ordered a mushroom quesadilla to go and when I got home it looked nothing like a quesadilla but I wasn't disappointed because it was amazing! This place has authentic Mexican food and I'd order the same thing again.,"Best authentic taco place on the south shore. Keep in mind that since it's authentic, some things are not the Americanized version you might be used to, for example, the quesadillas are done traditionally, and not that flat version that you'd get at American eateries. Speaking of which, their tacos, platters, and quesadillas are sooooo good. You won't regret ordering!","I'm originally from LA and constantly on the lookout for legit tacos. I drove by this place a few times taking my kids to the play area next door, so I finally decided to try it. I'm so glad I did! The tacos were fantastic - nice, simple tacos you'd expect from any great taco truck in LA. You get three per order and it's $1 extra to do different types of tacos. I got the steak, al pastor and beef tongue tacos. All were great! I also got a side of the rice and beans, which did not disappoint. I'll definitely be coming back here!",Taqueria Oaxaca
408,Disgusting. Pick up : What I was given couldn't be classified as food. I don't have words to express my disappointment. Never again.,"So sorry, went to Jersey Gardens Mall and stopped here for a bite to eat. Dirty, small and there was a rat dropping on my plate. When I showed the waitress , she examined the napkin, made a face and took it to her boss, this punk walks over and tells me. That wasn't a dropping it was from the French toast and tried to convince me I was wrong... NEVER AGAIN STAY AWAY!!!! Dirty","pretty much what you want/expect from a non-chain diner. Standard fare done competently for a reasonable price. Standard diner ambience. This isn't some hipster take on a classic diner, it's just a classic diner.","Solid diner. Friendly service and good food. Got the Reuben, a Cuban sandwich, and onion rings. Would recommend the Reuben above the Cuban, but not by much. Everything was tasty.","Atmosphere: 5/10. definitely a smaller place, which isn't a bad thing, but something to keep in mind. They did however have crappy music over the radio, as well as a somewhat undesirable crowd. Not the type of place I'd want to come to at night for coffee, which is an important aspect of any diner. Also, a lot of Spanish speaking amongst employees. Menu/pricing: 7/10. Decent sized menu, and the prices are very reasonable which definitely helps this place. Food: 7/10 portions were adequate, nothing bad, but also nothing to write home about.Overall: 6/10.","Classic lil diner...seems to be a locals favorite.  We were just passing through on a Tuesday morning and it was pretty full.   Food comes out piping hot!   Western omelette plus well done home fries w/peppers and onions, short stack and pork link sausage.  All classics, but great flavor.  Pancakes are perfect!   Quick and friendly service too.  Happy accident finding this place, didn't use Yelp was just trying to get on the road and turned a corner and there it was.",Seaport Diner
409,"Had the shrimp scampi to go for lunch via Uber eats and I was VERY disappointed with the shrimp.The scampi sauce was AMAZING and they sent a HUGE piece of bread that was also good. The shrimp however were so so.I did not like that the shrimps were not tossed in the scampi sauce they were just kinda thrown on top of the bed of pasta. The shrimp were deveined, but there was still some deveined residue cooked on the actual shrimp, therefore I couldn't enjoy them.Not sure if I would give any shrimp dishes a second chance, but the other components were well.","We went last night for dinner with two friends. While the food was good, I think the food at Cioffi's is just as good. The dining room was packed, perhaps for pre Mother's Day celebration. The place is always crowded on Saturday night and the noise makes it hard to hear people at your table. It took us OVER TWO HOURS to get our food. I understand, they're crowded but no one should wait 2 hours. This is where management needs to offer something to make up for the delay... they didn't. I will pursue other choices. High prices and long waits are not compatible.",First time hereExcellent foodLots of choices on the menuAmple parkingQuietRomanticHighly recommend,Great place great service I'll definitely come back Jason is top notch Great happy hour and everything was delicious,"Mario's may not have a specific dress code, but as you walk in it feels like a higher end Italian restaurant. Beautifully decorated and dim, the restaurant looks and feels nice.The menu is pretty diverse, but has most of the staples of a general Italian restaurant. Meatballs, different chicken or beef and pasta dishes, and calamari. I chose penne alla vodka with breaded chicken. The food is good, and the portions are gigantic, but the prices are so high that it's difficult to justify dinner here.The bar is a different story, however. The drinks are reasonably priced, and the bartenders are incredibly kind and attentive. The different drinks and cocktails are pretty diverse (my personal favorite is the blue sangria)The bar can get pretty rowdy on Friday or Saturday nights, but it's generally a fun place to be.","This is a solid local Italian restaurant Parking lot is small as well as tight - otherwise you have to find street parking Inside is cozy ... to the right is the bar and a small dining area and to the left is another more quiet dining room. Staff is friendly and very attentive I've been here a long time ago but can't remember what u had Today - I tried the red sangria wine which was pretty good.  You can order by glass or my pitcher. Appetizer - I tried 6 oysters which were good.  They were $3.25 each . Entree I tried the Malfalde Bolognese - it has home made pasta with a delicious bolognese sauce with a touch of mascarpone . It was yummy. Especially with fresh mozzarella on top. It was a lot so I Doggy bagged it. BTW it also came with a starter salad with 3 types to choose from ( balsamic vinaigrette, creamy Italian or Caesar)No dessert menu - instead the bring a platter out of different cakes, pies and also can get cannolis and tiramisu. I didn't try since I was too full I would definitely come back again",Mario's Tutto Bene
410,"No regrets having this airport pizza to tide us over before our flight. It's located in the sizeable food court. We ordered a Pepperoni pizza, small personal size. This was an adequate pizza. One small pizza filled the two of us up before our flight out. The dough was powdery and floury on bottom. More do than crispy on the bottom. The cheese and the pepperoni all worked together. It's pizza, nothing more and nothing less.If in the mood for pizza before a flight, it might be worth picking up a slice in a city and bringing it to the airport. Not sure this pizza is worth having again.","Don't know why this place is rated so high. Mediocre pizza at its finest. The spinach was so watery, had no flavor whatsoever , And it was super soggy. How pizza should NOT taste when it comes out of the oven . If you're having a pizza craving.... keep walking orYou'll find yourself disappointed. Guess that's airport food for you !","Terrible experience. Unhappy employees make it obvious they don't care at all about the customer. Stupid procedure to begin with. You order your pizza on a computer. Then you take that receipt to another kiosk with another unhappy person to pay. I'm disabled so I ask for help carrying my order to the table. Employee acts like he's being really inconvenienced because I asked for help, then spills my drink on all my napkins and drops my straw as we go to the table. Did I mention what an unhappy person he was? He drops it on the table and just leaves me there. I can't leave my luggage so I'm just stuck with no napkins. And I find out that the other employee whose only job is to successfully cut my pizza didn't cut the pizza at all, so I really need napkins. And silverware. Just awful. I feel bad for people who are so unhappy about their job that they treat other people badly.",So good it's worth Walking several blocks through the terminal and passing other pizza places to come here! (Not to mention flying out of terminal C instead of terminal A). A highlight of EWR and NJ in general.

Once it is your turn to order, the nice gentleman working here will ask you what you would like on your hotdog and from there it is made quickly and efficiently.

Waiter came quickly and gave us a plentiful amount of fresh warm bread with butter and cripsy bread pieces of bread with tomato/onion, etc. We were fairly new to this place and heard it was good for the impossible burger which they ran out of, and as one of our party members were vegan, was chosen to pick the veggie burger which the waiter told us IT WASN'T FRESHLY MADE THERE. As it was the only choice there we had it and wasn't a bad bite, Gordon Ramsay wouldn't approve though.As food came quickly, their burger, though asked for well done, came slightly burnt but still well and enjoyful. Fries was a decent amount but all the choices had me full before getting to it. Let me tell you that the fried calamari, an appetizer, was good enough to be a meal and was possibly one of the best I've tried up to date.This place would've easily gotten a 4 star review but truth came out that the veggie burger wasn't made freshly there, deserving a 3 star review.",Z Two Restaurant Diner and Lounge

414,"Where do I start? Headed over to the barge after being told there was a wait at the armory. What a disaster. Waited 15 mins for waiter to come by. Ordered, got our apps, both disgusting. Was told cook was in the hospital, that is why the salad was terrible. They said being people were coming over from the armory, they were not prepared. Then, waited another 45 mins for dinner which never came. Asked to speak to owner, he never came out. We then decided to get up and leave. What a joke. Went to hostess, told her we were leaving and told us owner said no charge. No stars.","The crabcakes should be called fishcakes as I could find no crab in them! The decor is dated, old, and smelly. It could be a beautiful place but it's not. They claim to serve seafood, but there's not much good seafood on the menu. Bad food, bad atmosphere, bad service. Stay away. It's too bad because the view from here is beautiful.","The Barge may be great during the week -but don't go Easter Sunday at 5pmMy half lobster was as dry as a hockey puck . My daughter is not a seafood fan and ordered the turkey dinner. The meal was plated in layers, white meat, dark meat, stuffing and slopped w gravy. We should have sent it back but didn't want to stay any longer than we had too. We were seated in the front with a table of 8 and a table of 5. The entire back of the Barge was completely empty and the noise volume was unbearable. The check was $150 for a party of 4 ----thumbs down. DISAPPOINTED a diner would have been an improvement.","First time trying out this restaurant.I notice the decor. Love the mural on the wall as you entered the restaurant. I came here because my friend suggested this place. So glad we came! My friend and I were the first customers to arrive that day. There was construction outside due to a sink hole outside but once you walked inside, it was nice and peaceful. My waitress was pleasant and had helpful suggestions. I brought my 3 month old baby in and they were just so accommodating. I wish I knew my waitress' name because she was excellent. She mentioned she has been working there for 10 yrs. Our waitress took our orders right away and got us a bread basket. The drinks came out so quickly. My friend ordered a cappuccino served with rock candy as the stirrer.. thought that was a nice elegant touch and clever.i ordered the grilled salmon with home fries and cole slaw. The salmon comes sizzling hot on a hot plate but the waitress put my salmon on a regular place because she didn't want any of the salmon oil to splatter on my baby which she was on point and so considerate. She apologized for it not being on the hot plate but I was impressed that she was thinking of my baby's well being. My friend got the same dish as me plus lobster tail. My salmon was cooked perfectly. it was moist with mild flavor but thats how i like my salmon. The home fries were charred and flavorful. Best home fries ever. Cole slaw was as expected- delicious. My friend was satisfied with her meal as well. Then came rice pudding. All the dishes that came out had a nice presentation and this rice pudding had whipped cream on top. I couldn't be happier with the serve, the food, the atmosphere. Also when you're eating, theres a great view of the water.The Barge is a place a highly recommend and I will be back for more!!","Eh.My friend had her birthday dinner at the Barge. The first thing we asked sitting down was if we could have separate checks, and the waitress told us that it was clearly stated that they do not do separate checks. They did not tell my friend this when she made her reservation several weeks ago, nor was it on the menu or the website. Anyway, our waitress said that we could pay by amount at the end, so we ended up doing that since we were already there.When it came to the food, it was OK. I got the chicken parm with linguine which was pretty good, but it was not worth $17. Many of my friends ordered seafood and were very unhappy. The mussels were not cleaned well and two of my friends said they tasted gritty. My other friend had the salmon and said it was greasy. When it came down to the check, it took my former server friend 15 minutes to figure out how much everyone owed, which would have been so much easier if their system was updated, or if servers write out separate orders. This would take longer but it would be so much easier on both ends. Our waitress was nice and attentive the whole time, but we could tell she was getting noticeably impatient, even though it was something that could be resolved if they did separate checks in the first place. I felt bad for my friend who deserved so much more.There are so many other places you could go for a group occasion. While the Barge has its positives - the location (which is pretty touristy) and some of the food, the system is just updated and communication is not the best. Trust the reviews on this one...","Sorry but this place needs a lot of work. It has great potential to be amazing, but they need to put some effort into it.The food is mediocre at best. The décor is very, very dated. I think the only thing that keeps that place afloat is the older folks with their discount coupons and when the armory is too crowded.",Barge Restaurant & Cocktail
415,"This is the absolute WORST Friday's I have ever set foot into. I sat at the bar and the bartender was so unwelcoming. Not a smile has yet to be cracked. I ordered a drink and I've finished my meal without so much as an offer for another drink. Isn't that your job Ms. Bartender? Let's not talk about how the drink was awful. I ordered food and it came on a chipped plate. There were 6 other people in the bar area and a few in the the dining area. Do you mean to tell me that you have NO OTHER WHOLE plates in the entire restaurant? Why do you even still have this chipped plate? I appreciate that when I asked about it the plating was changed. But really...why should I have to ask?I used to live in Jersey City and this location was close to me. It wasn't great then but I thought let me try since it's 2 years later. There has been no improvement in service. As a matter of fact, it's worse in my estimation.It is not ok to be in the service industry and unpleasant.I will absolutely NOT be returning to this Friday's.","Not Sure if I came on an off day for the cook or someone was in training. The service was terrible as well as the food. I was served what was supposed to be ""loaded Mashed Potatoes"" and my son ordered a burger that was burnt. Will not be returning to this establishment at all.",This is the most disgusting TGIF ever horrible service food is terrible they don't clean off the tables just disgusting,"What did you really expect?  Fine dining?Just get your unlimited apps, happy hour light beer and save yourself the time of reviewing this negatively.  The only reason you ended up here is because you are too lazy to cook and too broke to go anywhere else.","Decided to take a chance on a 2 star chain restaurant, should have listened to the reviews. Was this a bad movie or was our hostess annoyed that we walked in?  Yup! Totally annoyed. As soon as we sat down a family of 4 walked out, I heard them say we waited long enough. Thankfully we had a great waitress Daiahna. I believe she was the only highlight to this place.  She cared about her customers and what the place looked like.  There were at least 15 employees that passed up a napkin on ther floor, but she stopped to pick it up.  The first staff member that dropped food to the table we said thank you, he said yeah.  Then we asked for utensils, he came back around again dropped them, we said thank you, he said yeah again, apparently the only words he knows. We did tell Daiahna how appreciative we were for her attentiveness and made sure with our tip. Oh ""yeah"" , the food. It was pretty good. The whiskey sauce on my burger was the tastiest I've ever had, the fries were crispy and my extra pickles came just as ordered. So if you want a decent meal but don't care about being treated like 2nd class citizens, try Friday's in Bayonne. Just hope you get Daiahna, she was the only reason we gave an extra star.","Once in a blue moon, I like to go to chain restaurants. I recently tried the Fridays in Bayonne. I have had Fridays before and even this location.  What I like about Friday's is the Jack Daniels whiskey glazed sauce. This is the best from here.  The whiskey glazed boneless wings are great. The perfect appetizer to begin with.  Jack Daniels chicken stripes, ribs, their signature burger, or anything with their Jack sauce, are the best items to order. You won't be disappointed.   It's also great to come to Friday during happy hour, as appetizers are half off, as well as lots of beer specials.  I like to order their signature burger, with the whiskey sauce on it. I never had a bad experience with it.  As for this location,  the inside is setup nice. Bar seating on one side and table seating on the other.  For a chain restaurant, you cant expect much, but Fridays is fun with a group of friends, for drinks and appetizers.",TGI Fridays

I got my overpriced cutlets, but continued to walk around the meat counters. Saw a package of pinwheels thst was price $.98. ""Awesome deal"" I think to myself. It's just 2 ( normally there is 3) but still cool! I get to the register and either the cashier is completely stupid or trying to rip off the market she works fir. She starts ringing up my stuff but I notice to never totaled out the guy in front order of $53. So she tells me my chicken cutlets and pinwheel are $62. I say to her a little sarcastic, ""does thst seem right?"" So she re-rings up my order and starts yelling at me. ""OH NO YOU DONT! YOU CANT GET THE PINWHEELS FOR $.98."" So I grab another package from the meet counter that is marked $.86. And ""They are 99 cents a pound! I actually want both packs""She starts screaming for the manager. He comes over and yells at me that it's a mistake and I can't have them for thst price. I explain that it's markerd that price snd he has to give it to me for thst price. He rips them out of my hand like an animal and tells me ""I'm not a big supermarket, I don't have to give you anything!"" Instead of making a Big commotion, I paid and I left with only my chicken cutlets. Never going back there again. EVER! What a$$holes!","Loved this place.  I asked for an Italian sandwich, and the only question was ""what do you want on it.""  I went for broke- capicola, soppressata, prosciutto, pepperoni and sharp provolone. Great bread, fresh sliced onion, lettuce, tomato, and perfect oil vin.  What a monster... $12. Unbeatable.Also got 1 lb. of the fresh mutz.  Super tasty, and at $8.83 much more affordable than Fiorito's.  Honestly, I was really happy I decided to check this place out.","Yesterday was my first time visiting Novelli's Pork Store and it was great! I placed an order to have it picked up ( because they are right down the block but have the option to deliver) for a few sandwiches some rice balls and cookies so my husbands friends can enjoy the Sunday football games. I walked in and was greeted by two of the chefs who make all of the food in the morning daily ( I forgot their names but they were so pleasant) they also started to brag about the mozzarella that they make AND they had every right too! I'm a Sicilian  girl who knows the good stuff from the bad stuff and let me tell you. It's out of this world! They have fresh bread, deli meats, ready to go entrees that just need to be heated up, fresh meat, milk, eggs, yogurt, a bakery inside, appetizers that can be heated up ( which btw the procuitto balls were insaineeeeee a must have!! ) and some regular day to day shopping needs. One stop shop for an Italian! Haha Thanks so much for being so pleasant and I will 100% be returning. Foods delicious customer service is even better!",Great Italian selection. Convenient store and everything is so delicious and fresh! The only downer is the store is super small and the deli line is always long. Other than that everything is great,Novelli's Pork Store
417,Damn this was super disappointing.Sushi: This was super poorly made and I don't even know the sushi rolls and meat inside were not good. Damn this was bad. See pics for better detail. But it was soggy and messy and the wrapping looked just old and used. I could be wrong but it just wasn't good at all!Overall: I would not recommend this place at all this is not good sushi and there are too many others to choose from in Staten Island.,"Unfortunately I will no longer be ordering from Kiku. Something must've happened in the past few months bc there has been a major decline across the board. My last 3 orders didn't seem like the fish was fresh, and my most recent order was completely incorrect and their was no ginger or wasabi. Very sad bc this was the best and most affordable sushi place in town.",This used to be my go to spot for sushi i was here on a Regular basis but the last 2 times was horible i will not be back need a new go to sushi place,"Visiting town and was invited here by my inlaws.Let me get it out of the way... the Unlimited Sake is unlike anything i have seen before and is definitely a PLUS!The food was Awesome, and so is the service.Im glad we made Kiku one of our stops while visiting Staten Island-- truly a local gem!","Visited Kiku Sushi for lunch on Tuesday afternoon. Reasonable sushi and solid lunch specials make it a good option for a sushi fix.Quality: Kiku Sushi has several different lunch special options. I went with the Two Rolls Lunch Special, ordering a Salmon Roll and a Spicy Tuna Roll. They were both fine. The Salmon Roll was very fresh, while I could have used more heat from the Spicy Tuna Roll. I also ordered the Kiku Volcano, which was an interesting piece. Spicy crunchy tuna wrapped with seared salmon, with mayo and three flavor sauce on top. Very rich and creamy, but not something I would order again.Quantity: The Kiku Volcano is relatively small, but since it is so rich it is the appropriate size. The Two Rolls Lunch Special makes for a solid meal.Value: $6.50 for the Two Rolls Lunch Special. $10 for the Kiku Volcano.Ambiance: Kiku Sushi is located in Staten Island. The small shop sits along a busy road and near a train station. The space itself is relatively simple. A few pieces of art on the wall. They have the sushi bar set up along the right wall, so you can check out the chefs at work. The music choices were an eclectic mix of hits from the early 2000s.Crowd: Just one couple dining in the restaurant, but two or three other folks grabbed food to go. Service: Friendly and fast service. Easy for take-out, but also great for lunch on a work day.Parking: They have a small private parking lot.","My favorite restaurant. I've been going here for years.  I ordered two rolls.. my favorites, almond dragon roll and sex in kiku roll. Some sparkling sake. Service is great! Always recommend this place.",Kiku Sushi
418,"I went 2x on lunch time and this place was closed even when it says on yelp that they're open: I tried calling, no one answers. Thankfully golden crust opened in union so I will be going there instead","Got the oxtail, jerk chicken & jerk chicken patty. Everything was flavorful and of high quality. Highly recommend trying this place out.","Was so dissatisfied and so disappointed when I went to take a bite of this Pattie..you can't serve this and think is alright.  The 1st time I ate the Pattie, it was edible so I decided to buy again, was good again but 3rd not so happy (thumbs down) .. there parties are a hit or miss.","Everything is good. Oxtail, which is my favorite, curry goat and curry chicken are all delicious. Service is a little slow but you can call and make an order and then pick it up.","If you like jerk chicken order the wing appetizer, you CANNOT go wrong!!The curry goat, roti and the patties are a delicious win also!!!",Only giving them 4 stars because it depends on who's working what your plate and service will be like. Some of the employees need training. Never the less the food is amazing and great portion.,Mama Shers Caribbean Cuisine
419,"Picked up take out and received food that wasn't edible. Found a piece of napkin in my spicy tuna crunch roll and the avocado in the Philadelphia cream cheese roll had gone bad, you could tell by the color. Called to explain and the manager asked me to call my bank and fight my charges. It's the restaurants responsibility to issue any credits back to the customer. Also, this wasn't the first time my order was wrong, however it was one of the worst. Won't be ordering from here again.","Extremely disappointed with the service and food. Usually it's one or the other. We called for delivery because they placed a flyer on our door and decided to give it a shot (without checking yelp unfortunately) and the menu had ""10% off with takeout or delivery"" when we called and placed our order, we mentioned the coupon and they wouldn't grant it because it's ""for takeout only"" even though we read them the coupon word for word. They just wouldn't accept it. How is that even possible? We didn't argue because we didn't want our food to have any spit and just placed the order anyways. Then, my steak teriyaki came raw. See the photos below. We literally had to finish cooking it because it was ridiculously raw. The only reason why I'm giving it two stars is because my girlfriends hibachi was actually really good. The fried rice and steak. So there ya have it.","If you're here for the all you can eat lunch, its worth it. But don't expect high quality food. Kinda compares to chinese buffet food. I don't like the quality of the sushi, its sub par to me. There are better places in bayonne where you can get sushi.","If you're hungry and looking for a great meal, Volcano is the place to go. Food:The all you can eat lunch is my favorite when coming here, just make sure you come before 3pm to make it for the lunch price and not the dinner price. I started off with the miso soup, super delicious! I then ordered the shrimp shumai (shrimp dumplings) and the gyoza (pan fried pork dumplings), they were both cooked well, classic taste and flavor. The chicken teriyaki captures my heart! It was so good and delicious, I ordered two plates of this because it was that good. The chicken was super crispy and the teriyaki sauce was nice and sweet. The shrimp tempura roll was a class and delicious, I loved the dragon roll, it tasted super fresh! The California roll was also great. Price:All You Can Eat Lunch: N/AVibe: The energy at Volcano is very calm and relaxed. The few times I've gone with friends, there is this very calm aura about the restaurant. The light and booths add to this relaxed vibe. The servers are very friendly and nice, they make the experience great and are there if you have any questions.","I ordered the steak teriyaki bento box and was disappointed to find my steak pretty darn close to raw.Now, I understand rare and black and blue are temps for steak, but usually not in this type of bento box.On top of that, the steak itself is cool to the touch and has the texture of legitimately being raw. These steaks are so thin that it's actually pretty hard to get them to look like this unless you only let it kiss the grill for a moment.The tempura veggies are gooey. It's upsetting because I was looking forward to eating it. I have no problem cooking it a bit longer on my stove top but it's definitely a turn off.",Great all you can eat selection. Very reasonable price for the quality of food you get. I love their aged tofu and dragon roll. I will definitely come back.,Volcano Japanese Cuisine
420,HORRIBLE! Bad service . My food is never cooked the right way and the workers don't remember anything .,"I came for a few half price appetizers and dessert with a friend. Place was empty and service was still horrible. We didn't get one water refill. Kitchen was closing soon and our waitress said to us ""if your dessert comes out with your food I'm sorry."" I thought that was a little pushy and rude. I understand it's late and you're getting ready to close but don't show that in your service and affect. Food was good we got the chicken wonton tacos and steak quesadillas. Those were both flavorful. Our dessert did come out with our apps which made me feel rushed. All I'll say is don't come near closing time the waitresses really show that they want to get out of there.",No flavor ribs where old mac and cheese pasta with cheese tossed on top asked for fries with cheese on top got got cold old fries no cheese hubs burger cold people where nice but were never going back I paid 50 bucks for dog food,"Normally I avoid reviewing big chain stores, since they already have name recognition and smaller businesses need the word of mouth more but I make exceptions if a business is really terrible or I really enjoyed the experience. This time, it's the latter.Here are the highlights from my outing at Applebee's:-Super friendly waitress who was patient and helpful-The food was really good and they had good deals when I went-Offering a promotion on Regal theatre movie tickets: $9 voucher per person, if they ordered an adult entrée.",My children love the atmosphere so I go because of them yet this was the last time I put up with the BS of the staff.. they were short staffed so they have to bring a bartender out to take care of us which was a total joke. This guy actually thought he was as a professional wrestler and didn't know anything about the menu It was quite obvious that he didn't want to take care of us so the atmosphere became very toxic. The manager should've put someone who was kid friendly at the table.. we waited over an hour for the simplest food on the menu which was an excusable being that the place was not busy at all. The food was but it is yet the service I'm taking 25 minutes to pay for the check was totally inappropriate in this type of establishment.,"Heard they are now serving breakfast so a friend and I decided to give it a try. I have been to Applebee's on many occasions for lunch and dinner and was always satisfied with the food and prices . The breakfast however is very overpriced. Pancakes $10.00 , waffle $13.00 without any sides.  I ordered blueberry pancakes which were very good and it was a big portion but I can get just as good at the dinner for half the price.",Applebee's Grill + Bar
421,DO NOT ORER FROM THERE   This place is so dirty there was bugs in my food!!!!! I mentioned it to manager lady in front and she went bezerk real terrible place i will be reporting them to health department !! And will be calling everyday to complain until they are closed !!! Cannot have bugs in food !!!!!,"We have been ordering here for 5 + years, because the food is consistently good. Higher priced but good.Today I made$40 order and received a call that they could not deliver. We were now too far for delivery. Neither they or we have moved, so I'm disappointed with change. Maybe their under new management and their quality has changed.Too bad...end of a good thing.","Best Chinese food on Staten Island hands down. 3 star rating is an absolute joke. It isn't a dine-in place, there are some tables but not ideal for a sit down meal, this place is all about the food.","I would challenge anyone who says they have located better Chinese food on Staten Island.I've been ordering from Empire Szechuan for years with my family, and I cannot even begin to express how strongly I  recommend trying it out. The staff is very friendly, the food is always made quickly, and the quality is unbeatable. Although I understand some reviewers claiming it is a little pricey, I argue that the lunch specials are unbeatable. Soup, fried rice, & and entree (a very large portion of food) for an extremely reasonable price varying based on the entree of choice. Empire Szechuan has become a constant in my families take out food rotation, so much so that we have relatives who crave the food whenever they come for a visit.","The best Chinese food on the island.  Love the scallion pancakes they just added to their menu.  The speciality noodle soups, sesame chicken, and ribs are so good!!!!  They also always offer coupons","I live around the corner and I want to say I love the fried shrimp wonton, and the boneless spare ribs !!! The other food options are also really good I never seem to be disappointed !",Empire Szechuan
422,Unfortunately after hearing a lot my experience wasn't pleasant. The place was empty with only one table occupied. We had to sit down and wait about 10 minutes before someone came up to us and asked what would you like to drink. After ordering tea and gingerale it took another 10 minutes to get it. We were ready to leave already when the only young woman that took our order decided to come back and ask for our order. All this time she was looking in her phone.,"Very rude, horrible costumer service. No accommodations given. Trying to make a $12 minimum for delivery, when I call back 2 minutes after lunch special ended would not honor it. I will no longer give my business to this place.",Great food! I am a big fan of the pineapple fried rice! My husband and I eat here several times per month. My only complaint is that I always order the pineapple rice without the seafood but I'm still charged $5 more than plain or chicken fried rice. Other than that I have no complaints!,"I absolutely love there rolls and  if you sit down and eat there , the oreo donuts are a MUST. I get the Sexy girl roll and  alvacado chef speciality roll. There spicy edamame are bomb ! If ur a sushi fan deff try them out.","My boyfriend and I were out to grab a quick lunch and stumbled upon Avocado Sushi. From my understanding they are relatively new. Since we had a little bit of time we decided to dine in. The inside is very bright, modern and sleek. They even have a private room, that is opened for dinner. We ordered a variety of things :Spicy Edamame - this had a kick to it. It almost tasted like the pepper that would make sriracha. But it's always fun to put a spin on a classic. Chicken lettuce wrap - didn't love this. It is very proper forward. But that's just a personal preference. The lettuce was very fresh and crisp. Smoked Salmon Sushi - I wish the salmon had a smokier flavor. It was very mild. Shrimp Sushi & Crab Stick Sushi - very good Volcano Roll - this was a hefty roll that had a lot going on with it. Tempura shrimp on the inside , lobster salad on the outside. It is very filling. We will definitely be back!","This is the first place I've been to that refuses to honor their check in offer. First they stated ""it's not this restaurant"" and then said ""yelp will give you the price you order online"" When I went to online orders the grub hub app asks for a coupon code which is not provided on check in offer. I showed the employees this and they said ""we don't do this price"" I would appreciate the restaurant to remove the offer if they won't honor it. Really disappointed in the customer service here.",Avocado Sushi
423,"This place has let me down a few times.  I had one decent experience there and ever since it has been downhill.  I caught an old school R&B night and the vibe was on point that particular night.  During subsequent visits, the wings have been undercooked, they are so use to their locals and regulars it feels like they ignore newbies and take quite a bit of time before they even come take an order, the music is hit or miss, it is often either empty or full of rambunctious meat heads and frequent fights involving the police to come by and disperse the idiots.   The football game was not playing on their TV's the other day.  My boyfriend received extremely poor service.  He basically had to get someone's attention, with only 4 people at the bar, just to get a beer.   He didn't even bother ordering food (was not even given a menu) since they totally missed the mark on being set up for football season!This place has so much potential yet time and time again they totally miss the mark on all accounts.Please get attentive wait staff, daily specials, drink specials, BETTER music PLEASE, better drink pricing during the weekends would make this place more appealing, cook your wings and all other foods thoroughly! Get it together, point, blank and period!","I come have been here a bunch of times and liked the vibe, but last night I ate the wings and I have some serious stomach pains. I was really hungry and I scarfed down the food and there was a slight foal taste to one of them but I ignored it. Next day, my stomach is in knots and I can't get off the toilet. To boot, my friend who was with me and ate the same thing is experiencing the exact same symptoms as me. In conclusion, this bar has good drinks and a decent vibe, but I will never eat here again because they definitely gave me some kind of food poisoning.","We live 6 blocks from the place, but had never been. Read how they took in people from a fire overnight recently, so decided to go. Glad we did!Fabulous burgers and truffle fries! The only thing I would change is the Fox News channel on the tv.",Man... this place never lets me down... I have only been in the place once (great vibe by the way)... But I order from here every once in a while... it was a recommendation on Uber so I tried it and wow... The food is always awesome... A real man's place (in a good way) like u want a burger... Some sliders... Some mozzarella sticks... Fries... Boom they are here and they taste like good real man cooked fresh grill food.. like it tasts like the tavern vibe should taist if that makes sense... Must try...,"It is not a very diverse crowd ethnically speaking and mostly young loud obnoxious yuppies or middle aged working class crowd.  The music was diverse but very much status quo - top 40.   However, we met the manager who was very pleasant and welcoming.   The food was good bar type food and I'd rate the drink 4.5 because it was strong just how we like it! We will be visiting again mostly based on convenience of location, good food and drinks, not so much for the crowd.","Really good weekly deals. I.e. taco Tuesday ($2 tacos, $4 Coronas, $4 tequila) and wings Wednesday (.50 per wing). Happy hour m-f 2p-7p $5 apps and good drink prices. We went on wing Wednesday, Thai chili wings were pretty good, 4/5, lots of sauce if that's your thing.

424,called and wouldn't pick up. wanna make bread or not?? disappointed. was excited to try to cheesesteak!,After ordering multiple times from here they decide to tell me I cannot use a credit card for my purchase because I only ordered with them one time???? What???? Never heard of that ordering there before! Our order was 35.25 I had my friend call and order 12.99 worth of food never called them before ever SHE WAS ABLE TO USE HER CC this establishment is horrible! Their customer service is even worse,"Food is just okay. It's a quick snack when you're in the mood for wings but don't want to do the whole restaurant experience or bar scene i.e. BWW. Usually I order from here as delivery, I never eat here. Place is kind of drab looking and always a ghost town. There are some straw wrappers on the floor and the floor itself is sticky. Kind of gross. Food was okay. Just generic but I didn't expect anything more anyway so it was all in all just a whatever experience all around.",Been to all 4 locations on Staten Island. All A+. My favorite thing to get is teriyaki bone in wings. And making it a combo with fries and a drink for $1.99 is a great deal. The food is always consistent and delicious. The staff is always very friendly and food is up quickly. This is an absolute must when visiting Staten Island.,"Ordered a gyro with extra meat. It came with a total of 4 broken half slices of meat. When I called to ask where the extra meat was, the guy on the phone says yes ""4 slices of meat is considered extra meat."" I just hung up the phone. This is a Lettuce And Tomato on Pita with a splash of meat. Not a freaking gyro. Meanwhile they charge you extra and you can get twice as much from your local halal cart for half the price these hacks charge. The caveat though.....this ""sandwich"" tastes like it was made yesterday.  Save your money and time and eat garbage straight out of the trash can. You'll get your money's worth.",I wish I could give 1/2 star. If wings are your specialty make that the best part of your menu NOT here its the salad and that probably because they didn't cook it smh the wings are horrible very dried out. The turkey burger like package Costco burgers Won't go back,Planet Wings
425,"Pizza was delivered hard as a rock. Garlic knots were flavorless. When the restaurant was contacted by the Slice app customer support team, I was only offered a $18 discount on the next order. What next order do you think I'll be placing if you're not even willing to replace the pizza that you delivered to me in exchange for my cash?!I'm out food and $20. Will not consider this restaurant in the future due to the gross lack of customer service.",Very rude girls over the phone Will never order again And btw the food sucked Put me on hold after every time i asked for something She had to call me back for a total on the order,What you guys growing lettuce in the back and picking it yourself.. obviously you ran out of chickens on your chicken farm bc I got no chicken on my chicken Cesar salad.

NO dressing.. do not order from this place save your money order from any place but this one who messes up two salads literally easiest thing. Then an hour and half and no chicken and no dressing.,"This place is the bomb best chicken wings on staten island by far, The biggest and The Juiciest. I have ordered from them about 30 times. They have their occasional mess ups. The delivery is always on time sometimes the bags smell like cigarettes or weed which is really disgusting. But all in all great prices, great food and great delivery time with no fee","Maybe, just maybe, they should think about cutting the number of menu items in half to focus on QUALITY over quantity. Ordered one of their ""incredible"" heroes recently, and it was horrendous. Basically, it was badly cooked chicken (kind of stale or cold??), thrown in bread with minimal sauce. DRY. Very dry. As for the fries? If you look at some of the photos that have been uploaded, you'll understand. Generally, I don't like leaving bad reviews because I know they do deter some customers. Not only is this somebody's business and livelihood, but it also employs people that need their job to pay bills. HOWEVER, enough is enough. I do feel bad, but this place either needs to get their act together, or lose even more clientele. Do they even care? The area is very busy and this is one of the only pizzerias around, which explains why they're still around, unfortunately. The whole neighborhood lacks good food options.","Ordered the grilled chicken bruschetta pie, medium came with 6 slices. Asked for extra cheese and for it to be cooked well done, they made it exactly as I asked. The prices were also good. I will come back again.",Brooklyns Finest Pizzeria

They brought out our meals one at a time instead of together, the waitress forgot our requests (like our side of limes, our side of tostones, or the empanadas we asked for), she did not check up on us once while we were eating, and i had to dlag down 3 different waitresses just to get a cup of water (which they did not bring, they instead charged me for bottled water, even though free water is the law).Additionally, the food has gotten worse over the years. The chicharron tasted more like bad bacon than chicharron. The side of tostones came with less tostones than there were people (4 of us, 3 tostones)",The worst placeeeee everrr bought 10 empanadas found a roach and went to complain no manager to talk to so spoke to some waitress which was rude ass heck showed her the roach on the emapnada trying to tell us it wasnt a roach like really she eas so rude do not eat here they are nastyt in every way,Had lunch here with a new member to yelp...

I also like the mango in milk a lot. The steak is not really a steak I'd say. It tastes more like a sliced beef dishes with onions.The fish is really over fired and not good. The chicken is ok.

The nori (seaweed) was so dried out and had an extremely unpleasant chewy texture. The rolls tasted extra fishy to the point where we couldn't even swallow our food from the taste!

I likeHow they cook their chicken I stopped eating here because one of  the female staff members was so rude to me that I've refused to go back every since .

I have tried a burger once here and they are good, but average compared to their chicken. I would highly recommend this place for anyone seeking out the nation's best fried chicken. For those who like details, I would describe their chicken as meaty, tender, juicy and breaded to perfection. If you're looking for crispy, I wouldn't expect it. But overall, they have a tasty piece of breast meat on a savory bun (full of poppyseed). Their lettuce usage isn't overwhelming like some - it fits well on the sandwich. Their mayo is drizzled to perfection as well.Don't even get me started on their cheese fries. If you hate cheese wiz, don't worry because even though it looks like cheese wiz, it's more of a hybrid. I go crazy for their cheese fries. Ughhhhhh. I want some right now.Enjoy folks. You'll thank me.","Honestly not worth the hype. I do love the cheese fries, they're almost unbeatable and worth trying. Their burgers and chicken sandwiches are not that great. The chicken sandwich breading always comes off in the middle of you eating it and the burgers are rubbery. Also, the food is EXPENSIVE for no reason. You could honestly get better food at McDonald's and pay less for it. I do appreciate it being open 24 hours, however.","The burgers are pretty average, and the rest of the menu is pretty standard. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. The inside was well kept, and the restaurant is nice inside. The food is cooked and put together well, there's just no flavor and quality is pretty low.",Burger Express
429,"Ok I think they're just dumb AF at taqueria. OMG. THEY HAVE SCREWED UP MY ORDERS MULTIPLE TIMES. Then when u call them about it, they give u a bullshit excuse how they will take care of u on the next order. No dummy I just want my order done correct the first time. I've paid for extra side stuff & never receive it. I wish ubereats & door dash wouldn't do any business with them until they get there shit together. OMG. I'm done with them. There not the only Mexican restaurant in Elizabeth. I hope they lose everything customer they have. They deserve to be out of business. I'm a blogger with a lot of followers on Facebook,Instagram & Twitter I will definitely be sharing my horrible experience with taqueria for sure.",Food was good the first time I ordered. But I decided to order again and didn't taste the same. Not sure what happen. They screwed up my order & over charged me and was missing stuff I paid for. When  I call to complain gave me some BS excuse that when I order again they won't charge me for the missing stuff. Like really. . Not sure if I will be ordering with them again.,Best tacos in town. Some items are over priced but they have specials every day. Plus they have 30 tacos for 30 dollars. Can't top that!,We decided to take a pit stop here on our way back to CT & we loved it! The service was very good. The woman at the register was very kind & didn't mind explaining any of the food items to us. The food was pretty tasty! I got the Mexican (I think) taco combo with al pastor & chicken. I wish I had gotten both of them al pastor because it was so yummy. The chicken was a little less flavorful to me but it was fine since they provide sauces & other garnishes. I also had added pineapples on my tacos which made them even better! The rice and beans were regular I wish they were a flavorful but all the food together was very good regardless. If I ever get a chance to come back here I will!,"This is pretty much the holy grail of tacos for me, their al pastor meat is delicious, I cried tears of happiness the first time i ordered them. I usually order the tacos americanos because they're very cheesy, then combined with the al pastor meat they are super juicy, and if you like pineapple like I do, slap some on there for juicy deliciousness.Ive you're a nacho lover I would also recommend getting the nachos al pastor because you get the same delicious orgasmic sensation that you would get with the tacos, except crunchier!The place is overall pretty clean and the staff is friendly, you can also order through Uber eats if you're lazy like me hahaI'm also a hot sauce lover so if you dine In, there is a selection of hot sauces that you can choose from, my favorite is the green one.","Absolutely wonderful deep rich flavors of chicken pork and beef the crispy crunchy texture of both the bacon and fatty pork pieces were heaven, totally new way of cooking old world recipes. I initially thought it would not be enough food but there were more than enough to go around.",Taqueria Los Gueros
430,The food was alright. Cute place but I never went to a place where I had too prepay for my food which was worth $57 two ladies came in after us and ordered and just sat down. On top of that we asked if on the sandwich we can add tomato and they said they didn't have any which is weird considering they had it as a topping on their menu for the waffle omelet. Overall I don't really recommend this place.,I love the concept of this place but their coffee is weak. Too sugary and not enough coffee taste. The tea selection is much better.,"Good coffee and even better service. The only downside was the place, needed to be updated. The color of the wall was fading and tables an chairs are old and many scratches. Not attractive.",Cute PlaceThis place is really good for small outings with good friends. It's a very instagrammable spot with a cute atmosphere and really good waffles!,"So many options, hard to choose, especially if you love waffles. We had the red velvet waffle, apple pie waffle and the strawberry cream cheese stuffed croissant french toast. The french toast was delicious. A bit on the pricey side but ok for an occasional treat!","Staten Island best and busiest coffee shop or breakfast nook. Very tiny location right of forest Avenue and yes finding seating is nearly impossible because of its cost welcoming vibe, once seated you will not want to leave. The food was amazingly good as well. I had waffles with fruits, I know boring. But my mom on the other hand who said  her doctor ""said my blood was bitter"" ordered the apple pie waffle with icecream on top. I had a bite and it worth my blood being a bite sweet. The coffee, my usual vanilla latte was good to. They also had a variety of teas in which my mom indulged in one. She loved it. Loves everything about the vibe and had no complaints which is rare. The wait staff are amazing. NYC hospitality at best. Great find via yelp!!",Beans and Leaves
431,"I would give it 0 stars if I could. I went with a group of people, mind you I was the only black in the group. We weren't sitting on the table but we had our drinks on it with 2 jackets on one chair. One of the the waitresses kept coming up to me saying I cant have our drinks here. I said ""ok"" but confused as to why she kept coming up to me. Then after a while she just proceeded to remove our drinks on her own. Incredibly rude and racist. Never again.","The service here was terrible. They refused to let my friend in and claimed her ID was fake. She's 26! Why in the world would she use a fake ID? The did not take any responsibility when they damaged my friend's car. (She used Barcode's valet service) DO NOT use their valet service! This is not the first time I heard horror stories of damaged vehicles.They were also RACIST and did not let 2 of my black friends in and claimed they were ""not part of our group""I would not recommend this place. All my friends and I agreed we will not be coming back.","Second bad experience going here. Music and crowd was fun but they try to rip you off. Menu clearly states a margarita is $10 but they charge $13. When I asked why, he said the machine rings up $13, and he can print out a ticket. And was arguing to not correct the price. Rude and wrong. And the worst part, the margarita was straight up lime juice...","Decided to go to Barcode on a Friday night, 10/4/19 to have some drinks and a bite to eat. Now, I haven't been to Barcode in about a year or two and the experience definitely was not the same. The drinks and food were still pretty good, we ordered 2 bulldogs, a mango margarita, coconut shrimp, crab cakes and mini cheeseburger sliders- all were tasty and just right. The service however was HORRIBLEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! After being seated at the bar it took us about 15 mins to even be acknowledged and receive a menu. We then had to literally wave our hand and shout to get the bartenders attention so that we could place our order. There were two female bartenders at opposite sides of the bar and unfortunately the one where we were seated was ridiculously inattentive, she was on her phone and just seemed so unenthusiastic. The only reason I'd return back to barcode is for the food, drinks and atmosphere/music. If I based it on the customer service, I would never go back there!!!!!","This was my first time at this bar/club and it will most likely be my last. Unfortunately, we chose to go the night of their grand opening for their pool. First off, waiting in the line to get in was absolutely dreadful because there was no fans or AC. One of the security guards assured us that it would be much cooler inside. Once inside, it was so stuffy I couldn't breathe. The issue wasn't the people around, the issue was that they had no wall or door of any type separating the pool area... so the club was open to the outdoor the entire time. The humidity was really bad in the first room. They had another room downstairs where it was a little cooler but still unbearable after about half an hour.Another issue we had was with the bar downstairs. There was only 2 bartenders tending to everyone around the bar on a busy Saturday night. There was no rotation either; it was like they were focusing their attention on one area of the bar. So someone could be waiting in an unlucky spot for 30 mins, while someone who just walked up on the other side could quickly be serviced. Anyways.. spent the first 30 minutes waiting for a drink and the next 30 sweating profusely. They played mostly Latin music. Wish there was a mix of genres. To sum it all up, left in the first hour I would say.","This is definitely a well known club in Elizabeth and in NJ at that, I always come here with my friends. Great spot for celebrations or just a fun night out. Employees are kind and the service is decent. It's a club so obviously you can run into trouble when drunk people are stumbling everywhere but the music is always AMAZING. I definitely prefer this spot over lobby because of the spacing as well as the atmosphere I feel like I just like it better here versus lobby. Card minimum used to be $50 but thank goodness they dropped it to $25 because that was making too large of a dent in our pockets. We actually stopped going because of the card minimum, and hookah was cash only so that doesn't even contribute to the $50 hookah is $26 btw. The hookah at lobby is way better though. I encourage you to visit but also to pregame before doing so. They are working on building a pool at barcode which is probably going to be one of the most unsanitary things ever but there will always be some type of crowd who will love it. They close at 3 and don't always have a cover charge so I recommend you getting there at like 10 so you can drink heavy without it being crowded and then by the time more people are flooding in you're already intoxicated so it won't bother you. You don't have to drink to have fun here though which is anothOn 5/22 a Wednesday I ordered 2 cranberry vodka drinks which we're $5 each and gave a $50 bill. I only got $9 back in change but I didn't count it because I saw him check to see if the bill was real so I figured he was being cautious with the money and that was my mistake. He only gave me $9 instead of $39 because he told me the two drinks came out to $11. I placed the money in a separate pocked in my purse because I was trying to limit how much I was going to spend but then I bought another round, I realized I didn't have enough money because I only had the $9. He originally told me he didn't service me so my friend backed me up saying I was serviced immediately after her so he clearly lied , and then he told me he always double checks the cash he gives back but obviously not because I didn't even get my $30 that was missing. It was my fault I'm a way because I didn't double check the money but that's because I always pay with card this was the first time I tried paying with cash and I was so disappointing. I left him my me and number but I already know he's not gonna give me the money back which is ridiculous. Honestly they do sc you so I'd rather go to lobby afte tonight.",Barcode
432,Stopped in last night to grab something to go. I ordered 2 of the lobster rolls. The first batch the rolls were burnt and I had to turn around and take them back. The second attempt the rolls were served with brown lettuce. (See pictures). I am quite disappointed.  The staff were friendly and accommodating but the food was substandard.,"Such a disappointment! We were seated and offered drinks. We asked for Bloody Mary's at 1pm on Sunday but bartender didn't know how to make them.I started with French Onion Soup, it had no flavor whatsoever and soggy bread. It was served with a teaspoon. Yes, I guess they don't have Soup Spoons!The Steak Frites was lackluster, no flavor. The steak was sitting in a bed of string French Fries. I asked for steak sauce and they brought me ice cold sauce and charged me $3. for it. Who serves cold steak sauce? They do here!The Octopus didn't taste fresh. The French Dip was served on a brioche so it became way too soggy. The string fries were so not steak house!I wanted to come back and enjoy but it was very lackluster.",Food wasn't good at all... there was no one there but food took a while to come out... and bartender was server and just was slow... nice place but I won't be back.,"We had a private party of 16 adults and 6 kids for my son's baptism and it was excellent.  Every course of food was delicious and my family can be very picky.  It was nice and quiet, great attentive service the GM was very helpful setting up and planning the event.  The space is beautiful and there was even a real nice outside area that the kids were able to play and run around between courses.  I definitely recommend going.-Anthony and Lara","Stopped in last night to grab something to go.

The staff were wonderful however the food still needs work. We ordered seasonal cocktails, Good Life and Purple Rain- both were strong and delicious! We had the crab cake for an appetizer- this was tasty and made with lots of crab and not too much breading. I thought- well they have improved! However, I ordered the Sea Bass Special and my daughter had the Tuna Poke bowl. Both main entrees were dismal. The small piece of sea bass (not worth $32 for the size) had several bones in what was supposed to be a filet, the carrot puree was bland - the overall flavors of the dish don't pair well together. The tuna in the poke bowl was not fresh- slightly browned- and the rice was mushy. We took a bite of each dish and sent them both back. We got a slice of chocolate cake to go- the cake was very dry and the flavor was bland. The ambiance is lovely and the staff are great- this place has the makings to be good but they need a better chef. As it stands, this is a great place for drinks and appetizers- but stay clear of the entrees or you may be disappointed.","Ok so this was my 1st time coming here . Located off Morris Avenue across from Kean University campus. Actually Ursino shares the building with Kean University. I found it because I know the area plus I used my navigation. Driving upon it - it is not clear where the entrance is and where to park. Not only myself- but I saw several people having trouble figuring out where to go. There is a huge parking lot that you can park in- some spaces are even designated for Ursino( see my photos) . I read there is valet but not when I went which was a Sunday .There are two parts- the "" tavern"" and the "" steakhouse"".  So if you park In the parking lot and walk across the street to the building . The obvious door walks into the upper floor which is the "" tavern part"" . That is where the bar is and surrounding tables.  You can access the staircase or the elevator to go downstairs - and that part is the steakhouse I came on a Sunday and was able to order from the steakhouse menu upstairs. I sat near the window since I wanted to be near natural light .  I had a lovely view of the outside patio and the manMade lake The bar looks nice. Has a few TVs to watch games. Funky vintage rock like Hendrix's Foxy Lady was playing . That was kinda cool to me. Staff was over all nice and helpful. Their cocktail list is mainly whiskey and bourbon cocktails which I was surprised. But the bartender made me a pomegranate martini which was good.  They also have wine list. I didn't bother with the appetizers since I knew I was ordering a steak with some sides and a dessert. I don't eat steak often and if I do - I could only down like 6-8oz.. here all the steaks are 10oz plus. I was bummed that they did not have ribeye on the menu since that is my favorite cut.  Waiter/bartender also told me a list of steaks they ran out of. Good thing my choice was a 10oz NY strip steak - medium. I also ordered side of garlic mashed Potatoes and side of garlic sautéed spinach. Took about 20 mins . I was given a warm biscuit roll which was very good until my meal came. Steak was good/average. Definitely not the best steak I've ever had. But the sides were fantastic. So yummy. So then it was time for dessert- and I was SUPER excited because I saw someone on Yelp  post that they had German Chocolate Cake within the last month and I even called before coming to Ursino and the girl told me they had German Chocolate Cake. She placed me on hold to check so I was certain that I was gonna try their version of my FAVORITE type of cake. So it was to my surprise that when I asked for the cake- that they also ran out of that as well. VERY disappointing. I mean there was only one or two other tables when I walked in. Unless they all hAd German Chocolate Cake Lol. * shrugs shoulders*Only reason why I'm making a big stink is that I called  right before I came to make sure they had it .... and they also told me they ran out of some cuts of steak. On top of that I read other reviews on how they ran out of items during their experience also . Not a good sign. Why am I giving it 4 stars? Because the service was pretty good and I loved the sides I ordered .Otherwise Steak was 3/4. I easily spent 90 bucks for my meal. A lil pricey for a place that still seems to need to establish themselves a lil more. For one they need to have better signs to direct patrons since they are not in a great location for their advertisement .... and they need to have the items they offer on their menu.I will be back just to see if they tell me they have a list of things they don't have including my German Chocolate Cake. Lol . Stay tuned",Ursino Steakhouse & Tavern

There was not one customer in the restaurant. I asked how long it would take and the girl who took my order said 10-15 minutes. I also asked what was in the tacos and she said mushrooms and other seasonal vegetables. My order took over 30 minutes to come out and my tacos were mostly shredded lettuce and tomato. No cheese, no mushrooms and the tiny bit of shredded peppers and spinach that were in the bottom had no seasoning leaving the tacos completely tasteless. I paid $2.50 extra for avocado and got 3 measly slices.

Between Jersey City and Bayonne, this might be my second (after Orale) Mexican spot to gub at. Casa Lupita offers real, authentic Mexican food for a fairly cheap price. Every time I come, I end up ordering something different and I'm never disappointed. One thing you have to make sure you order is the tres leche -- AMAZING! The staff here is always super friendly and although at times, the wait can be a while for takeout, (I have yet to dine in) it is worth it.

434,"I decided to try it since they claim to have new items every day. We arrived @8 and it was almost empty.Ordered a chicken dish and Waited almost 30Minutes.Nobody came over to the table to ask if we needed anything, and had to ask for water.Ordered dessert and after waiting 15 minutes I asked the waitress and she said she would check the bill. She said it was never ordered.I would not go back there and eat for Free.Mediocre food, and NO service.They have the nerve to add a gratuity onto the bill for NO service.Stay Away.",Order via an I Pad would maybe work if the staff actually spoke to you or checked on you. I let a staff person know I did not want the cheese on the pulled pork sandwich I ordered.  Arrived with cheese melted and impossible to remove from the pork. No time to a wait another. The bun it was served on was hard as a rock. There was a manager walking around who checked on select patrons. I spent $50 for lunch (included glass of wine). Way over priced but it's an airport.,"My pancakes, like many a Jersey girl, offered surface prettiness that conceals underlying toughness. This combo works better as a character trait than as a pancake. Nonetheless, after reading Terminal C culinary disaster tales, I'm willing to cosign on Daily as the best thing going, since the food was edible and there was even a little service.The coffee, though, was the worst I've ever had -- gag-reflex bad, tasting old and burnt right after opening.",EWR Terminal C is stepping up their food game.  This little diddy was surprisingly delectable.Grilled artichoke appetizer and the baked clams were not only tasty but a great healthy option at the airport.This was an exciting find.  Great service too!  Try this place out if you are anywhere in Terminal C / United.  It's worth the walk if your gate is not right here.  Across from Gate 78/79.  Two thumbs up!,"Nice airport restaurant at EWR in terminal 3 just down the concourse from the United Club.  A bit pricey but the Quality of the food is very good for an airport.Started with a Stella Artois, then had the Salmon entree, finishing up with a cappuccino.Overall a 4 star experience.","I had a very good experience at this restaurant. The staff was very friendly and the food was top notch. I had the halibut which had been flown in the day before. The restaurant changes its menu, depending on what they can get fresh.

435,"Writing this review as I'm waiting for our server to give us the bill. We have been waiting for about 25 minutes just to pay for our food.I have been here multiple times and the service was bad each time. But today, was the icing on the cake. This has been my worst experience at this establishment. After being seated, we waited about 10 minutes just to get greeted by our server. She bought bread and butter to the table then left. She came back then asked us what we wanted to eat. She totally skipped over what we wanted to drink. There was a total of 8 people and we each ordered a meal. Two meals came out completely wrong. She sent them back to correct the issue. I am giving two stars because the food is not that bad. Other then that, the service is really bad. Even at the bar. Save your time !!",I have visited this restaurant on July 27. Food was ok nothing special. Mojito was excellent but glasses so small. Enjoyed cuban music and dances. However I did not like that they include 20% gratuity. It defeats the purpose of tipping. Because of that I wouldn't be back here,"This calls for a review writing after having this terrible experience, we arrived early and we had the whole restaurant to ourselves coming from Miami I was looking for a place where they can serve us some close to home made food... we obviously ordered the croquetas and fried calamari to start oh wow... they croquetas looked like they were from a week ago and the relleno was disgusting, the Calamari I had to send back after it was so hard to chew to be dangerous. We ordered the Fried Fish where you could taste the poly-saturation of being reheated food  for days down your throat... the Pernil was ok if you like your food floating in greasy oil thank goodness for the most expensive rice and beans otherwise....anyways at the end I finally said well maybe the cortadito can save this fiasco guess what? It did not since they serve an expresso with some miniature milk on the side...overall expensive, gross and a terrible restaurant! Owners please pay attention! Very very disappointed and I regret paying for it for sure!!!!",Came here on a Thursday night and sat at the bar they had ladies night going on where certain drinks was 1/2 price ...the food and drinks was really good and the staff was friendly. I will definitely come here again.,"This may be my favorite spot for Latin food. First off the ambience of the restaurant is nice. You walk in you are greeted by a host l. The Bar is nice and had a few flat a screen TV's. There was Latin music playing good volume. We sat in a indoor patio right along the main dinning area. One thing I recommend is for speakers to be installed in that area. Though you can hear the music but it was afar so it would of made the experience more better.  Casual clothing I do recommend. Wearing exercising clothes or Shorts and a T, you will feel under dress lol. The tables and booths were nice. We order some drinks. Sangria and a Coconut Mojito and both was really good. Ok so let's dive in on the menu. From the Apps to the main course has a WIDE variety of dishes. I had for appetizers chicharrón de Cerdo, calamares A la ajillo, empanadas de rey and tostones relleno con ropa vieja each dish was delish For main course it was Pernil con arroz blanco y habichuelas rojas, Mosongo de camarones and Rabo con arroz blanco y habichuela negra and every dish was DELICIOUS for deserts it was Flan and Tres Leche. The Flan was a bit dry needed some of the syrup is comes with. The Tres Leche was ok. It's served on a small bowl and all of the liquid is in the bottom which I think is a bit much.   The service overall was excellent and very attentive. The restaurant wasn't busy at all so take it for what it is but our server was great. The food temperature was excellent and had the right spices. The timing of the food coming out was also excellent but again the restaurant wasn't busy at all but it was impressive. There is parking when you turn into the place that is free. I didn't give a full 5 star rating because they need to put speakers in the patio area but Overall the food, Sri is and experience was great. Would def return and highly recommend the place.","It's rare that I dine-in since the best room is at the bar. The mood is relaxing and perfect for business and/or an intimate setting. The bartenders are amicable and attentive. They also have a wide selection of Mojitos but if youre looking for something off the menu ask Pepe, the mixologist. Between lunch hours, if you want something more cost efficient try their lunch area. You can get an order of rice, chicken and tostones for less than 12 bucks. It just depends on what's being served.",La Terrazza Latina
436,"Made a last minute reservation here for Mothers Day. Thought it was ""fishy"" they had available spots for a party of 7 ""all day"". The last time my hubby and I were here was about 13 years ago. I ordered mushrooms stuffed with king crab meat and they were delish. My youngest daughter ordered chicken fingers and French fries.  They were disgusting. My other daughter ordered French onion soup and it was a cream based soup - absolutely NO onions A just bread and cheese. My mom ordered ""seafood soup"" which the waiter kindly told her it was lobster bisque - it was loaded with sherry - zero cream and NO lobster. My eldest daughter ordered rack of lamb. It was served cold, raw and zero seasoning. I ordered green mariscada and not only did it have no shrimp, it wasn't green - totally overloaded with milk and broth. There were ""scallops"" in there which were NOT scallops it had clumps of runny-snot looking things. Then I went to take the lobster meat out of its shell and saw something on my fork. It was the top of a beetle bug with its antennas!!!! I LOST it!!! NOW I know why the restaurant was empty. You've got to get your shit together Portuguese Manor!!! Your rugs are filthy, the walls are dirty - and food - I will NEVER come back. No wonder you're charging for salads on Mother's Day. You need an overhaul and I came home STARVING!!! I wouldn't even touch your coffee or desserts. We complained and no one came out to speak with us or follow up. Shame on YOU!!!

I found a fly on my seafood stew, I almost eat it too! It was deep inside the broth it wasn't sitting on top!

The paella valenciana  contained very dry chicken, and a lobster that tasty..well..funky. Three dished containing filet mignon were cooked well beyond recognition. Very well done, very dry.

437,Typical BYOB Peruvian food. Our selections were good and the service was fast. They had a lot of waitress waiting the tables. Parking is a bit tricky since they are right on a main street. We would return to this restaurant.,I'm a native Peruvian and I ordered the green spaghetti. Ive never had or made Tallarin Verde with green peas. The absolutely the worst. Then I tried ordering some rocoto and they were charging a dollar for some hot sauce. Seriously. My sister ordered aji de gallina and the chicken wasnt even fresh pulled chicken. They used the rotisserie chicken and mixed it in. You can see the big dry chicken that was pushed to the side of the plate. Not to mention it was super salty too. This was ordered from the menu of the day. They didnt even have chicha morada prepared. What was supposed to be offered in their menu wasnt even available. Their food is over priced and not great by any means.,"Not good flavor at all. Staff seems friendly but other than that, the food was not good. The pollo a la braza has not flavor. The only flavor you will find is in the skin, after that, everything else is DRY. The green sauce they place on the table looks and tastes really bad.. sorry, I really tried to like it but it was some kind of green watery 'sauce' that did not taste good at all. I also asked for a tamal and it was ok, just not what i was expecting. I wasn't asked how the food was and the place was empty. it was just not a good experience. I travel for work quiet a bit and I like to try Peruvian restaurants and this place is one of the worst places I've been too. If you are not from the area, safe yourself a drive and just go somewhere else.","The food is delicious but the price is not. Will come here again ofcourse but wish the prices were dropped a bit. The chofan special was my favorite. This place is really clean in and out food is fresh, and the employees do an amazing job.",Excellent! Pollo a la brasa and the ceviches are just excellent. I would give it 5 stars... but they never give enough salad dressing which is delicious.NOTA PARA LOS DUEÑOS: PONGAN MAS SALAD DRESSING!,"Overall, great Peruvian spot with a homely feel and delicious food.  I had the ceviche mixto, which was spicy but absolutely amazing once I added their homemade ""yellow/green sauce"" aji amarillo.  We also ordered a half chicken, in the traditional rotisserie style, and were not disappointed.  The location isn't the greatest at night but nothing too dangerous.  Also, BYOB and there is a liquor store next door.",El Iman Restaurant
438,"This review is just for the pizza, haven't eaten anything else.Stopped in for a quick slice, very over priced for just a plain slice, and it was just not that good.For the price they charged for a plain slice that wasn't even big I will not be going back.","Expensive pies with such little cheese. 75% of your margherita pie will be bland sauce, I guarantee it. My photos also show the difference between normal and ""extra"" cheese, which is basically no difference. The only photo with extra cheese is the full margherita pie. This ""extra cheese"" option should be the standard at least, as otherwise it's almost entirely just sauce on bread.    The pizza just isn't worth $20+ for such bland and minimal ingredients.",Solid 4.We ordered delivery from this pizzeria and I had the Veal Parm which was damn new perfect. The veal itself was tender and was loaded with sauce and cheese. What more could you ask for?The hero was delivered in a box which was new for me. Never saw anything like this but what it did do was keep it ultra hot. This needs to be a thing!I'd try them again!,"Pizza like it's meant to be! The slice was nice and large, like back in the day slices. I did have to add sausage and extra cheese, that's the only way to eat pizza in my opinions! I'm not for all this vodka sauce and chicken on a pizza!!! They had a wide selection, but just give me plain!Now the price, still not happy. $5.50! One slice with pepperoni, sausage and extra cheese. Tell me that's the going rate and I will chill!I'm saying, the people behind me ordered 5 slices of that foofoo stuff, chicken, vodka, etc and the total was $17!!! Do the math that's $3.40 for one slice with extra stuff!!! So I wonder how much is a plain pepperoni slice?Well, despite the price, the pizza was the best I had since my visit to ny! So I guess the $5.50 was worth it!","If this place moved across the street to the Fratelli location, business would be out of control. The only negative is that you really can't eat comfortably in the place. They had a few tables at one time, but not anymore. I wish they had more fish options on the menu like flounder or talapia. Overall great food and some different options for salads. Pizza is very good too.",This is my favorite pizzeria!! My 1st stop when i come home to visit. It feels like home and the food is delicious. I always have Penne vodka with grilled chicken. The pizza is amazing too!!,Domenico's Pizzeria
439,Order wrong - againAs alwaysFood either burnt or swimming in dark salty brown sauce Do yourself a favor stay away and do not order from here,I was very disappointed with there food. Funny taste to it. Seemed way too salty and no other flavors.,"Chinese food in my opinion is considered fast food; the average time to make a meal and get it to you is 15-20 minutes (the place is literally 5 mins from my apartment)Wife was sick so I couldn't leave home; ordered dinner for myself they said the norm 10-15 minutes......they arrived AN HOUR LATER!! ......An Hour?! For Chinese food..... And subpar Chinese food! Soup was delivered cold, cold sesame noodle delivered hot..... Sorry too many other places to warrant this place a return service","At first, I was pissed. I placed my order via Yelp, which went through delivery.com, who shot me an email right away saying the food was being cooked.  2 hours later I call the restaurant and they apologize for not getting it.  No sooner had I opened the delivery.com complaint window does the restaurant call me and say they can make my food and apologize again.Now I was worried about under cooked food. Much to my delight, everything was really well prepared. I didn't want soup so I skipped the lunch combo and went right for the general tsaos dinner.  It's weird because you can't order it under the ""chicken"" section served with white rice, only under the ""combo"" section... and they dont tell you what the combo is. So I ordered an egg roll and ended up with 2, because apparently the ""combo"" is fried rice and egg roll.  Luckily I really enjoyed the egg roll, good crunch, not too greasy... and got to enjoy a second one later for dinner.The general taso's was good, not great, but about what you expect. I was a little bummed that half the container was friend rice- but my wife was happy when I brought that home for dinner.  Scallion pancakes were thin, with a crispy edge and a floppy, greasy center. I don't like mine like that, but wife does. The dipping sauce was GREAT. Overall, pretty solid.","Short and sweet ordered $160.00 in takeout for a party, waited twice as long as they stated and they couldn't even bother to throw in a free egg roll lousy custom appreciation imho.","Excellent take out, arrives in good time and still very hot. Dumplings are fantastic and the standard dishes ( pork fried rice, egg drop soup, sesame chicken, etc) all great. Looking forward to trying some of the other many choices on the menu.",East New Sing Bo
440,"Idiocracy meets Kafka at the Newark United terminal! It's astounding that someone in management approved this hairbrained nightmare. Could anyone have ever dreamed up an even worse system for ordering a burger? Order from one location from a very limited set of yes-no choices (even McDonald's can handle special requests), take a printout to another location, give up if you are using a voucher (and why does it offer to have me scan my boarding pass, I just want a burger), walk over to a third location to have voucher processed (that's where we go from disgust to comedy as it's right out of the hospital check-in scene in Idiocracy) and finally go to a fourth location and wait, and wait, and wait and wait, for your $17.50 burger.  All of this in dystopian nightmare Terminal C where travel-weary humanity is struggling all around you but a human touch in ""services"" has been eliminated.The whole air travel experience today isn't exasperating enough for you? United's Terminal C in Newark takes despair about the future to a whole new level.","They did warm me there would be a 20 min wait for my burger , but it was 45 minutes. And it was cold And no fork to eat the salad.  That took an additional 10 minutes. For 17.50",I think they actually go to the back themselves to slaughter the animals before cooking the entree. They move at a Glacier Pace.,"Nice Burger but spot but overpriced. We at here while waiting on our delayed flight to Vegas and decided to have this burger, fries and 2 cocktails and the bill was $80. We didnt even leave town yet and was paying out of town pricing for an artisan style burger. It was good but not worth almost $20 but they have to trapped because of your flight get delayed like ours was for almost 2 hrs. You get hungry and want a drink and then they got you. Long Island Iced Tea and a Cosmo with Grey Goose approx. $40.They say that Newark Airport has the best terminal food in the country and I see why they can afford to pay top notch chefs to cook there.Overall a nice spot if you get hungry and dont mind spending. Hopefully your flight dont get delayed and you can spend that $$$ on cocktails at your final destination.","Located at the EWR, not a bad place to grab a bite to eat. Coming back to the United States after traveling abroad, my first meal is almost always a hamburger. While I don't eat hamburger often, I have to eat hamburger when I come home. Their portion size was huge. I couldn't finish my huge hamburger. It's not the tastiest burger but it still hit the spot and I was very full. I thought price is high for what it is but I guess the portion size explains it. I wish they have smaller portion size options.Ordering is via an iPad. Really easy to follow the step.  Service could get slow and I wanted refill for my drink but no one came... food did come fast after I placed an order.  I","All the restaurant/bars at EWR are pretty much the same. Customers order using an iPad at the counter/table. Someone eventually brings the food/drinks. Service is haphazard. I started with a Cobb salad and glass of wine, which came pretty quickly and the server was friendly and asked if I needed anything else.  Next, I ordered loaded fries. They took a long time (about 15 minutes) and a different server basically just dropped them off and left. The Cobb salad was okay. The fries were rather soggy and didn't come with enough ketchup, especially for $9.50. Everything was very expensive, even for airport food. Quality was mediocre for airport food.",Wanderlust Burger Bar
441,Closed temporarily. Ignore the star rating because I wasn't able to purchase anything. They are closed until sept 6th.,"The food is ok, but this place can be a little pricey depending on what you get. The Haitian lady with the thick eyebrows is a different type of rude and is the reason I will no longer frequent this restaurant. If you decide to eat here just brace yourself first. I recommend the Salmon, rice and peas, with veggies.","I want to start this off by saying their food is great, BUT don't go to this place following their business hours always call. I tried to eat here twice in one day. Once for lunch, however they pushed their opening time back forcing me to select something else other than their food I was actually craving. No big deal I'll go for dinner, right? Wrong. They were closed a hour and a half before scheduled closing time. If the hours on google were wrong that would be one thing but the same hours are literally posted on their front door. Highly disappointing, if you're going to run a business be reliable at least.",Have been ordering from her for almost a year and they have not disappointed me at all the steak with onions N pepper sis phenomenal. Also had their special palace chicken great! And their veggies cooked to perfection. If your looking for well seasoned and taste food come here they even make platters which is usually what I order.,"The place looks a bit worn down but the service was nice. They don't accept cards but they do have a cash app option. Cool. The lady offered me free samples but seemed to be rushing me since it was close to closing time. I ordered the salmon and noodles, it was good, just needed some Old Bay. They also have really good potatoes stuffed with meat or seafood.","Awesome little takeout joint in the heart of hillside ! I traveled 20 mins to try their chicken and it was so worth it . The staff was very nice and let me sample some of their signature items . I ordered the teriyaki chicken wrap and the sweet / spicy salmon pasta . The wrap was super flavorful and the chicken had an authentic teriyaki sauce . A little messy to eat in the car, but I managed lol. The salmon pasta mini meal was delicious as well . The salmon was cooked perfectly and the sauce was true to its description ., kind of like a sweet and sour style . I will definitely be back !",Grilled Chicken Palace
442,The owner is very rude.  We have been going here for 4 years but wont be frequenting this diner again. I have always gotten the special and then cake which is included. The menu says comes with a layer cake but tonight the owner insisted it's only 1 specific cake. This has never been the case in all my other visits. There was no effort made to speak to us by the owner and horrible customer service. Now they have lost loyal customers.,"Very mediocre food, slow service and dirty utensils. Best guess- out of business within (6) months.",I don't like leaving bad reviews but my goodness. This place has terrible food and rude service.  Left half my food and feeling so nasueous. Never going back again.,We come here once a week. Always have the best time at the lighthouse.  Our service and waitress Christine is the best!,Classic Greek/New Jersey Diner right in the middle of town in Bayonne.  This place has been a local standard in this city for a long time. Rarely will they blow you away with what they have on the menu but I will praise the consistent level of service and quality that the Lighthouse brings to the table.  Daily specials include rotating soups as well as different Italian and Greek/Mediterranean options.My go to at this establishment is either the roast beef or the French Dip(which are alarming similar I get it).  The roast Beef has always been fresh and rarely if ever too dry.  The same type of beef will be going in the French dip(pictured with this review)  however the bread is lightly toasted and buttered with garlic to give it another level of flavor.  The fries come plentiful but are average at best and the au jus comes in a big enough serving to gravy up every bite.Loses a star based on the weird delivery hours.  They do not deliver for breakfast or lunch and are only available from 3pm to 8pm Monday through Saturday.,"I have not had any issues, I have had breakfast three times and lunch this weekend.   It is always packed and loud but we are always seated quickly, food served hot and in a timely manner.  The flavors are decent, typical diner food and the service is courteous.  This weekend my daughter had grilled chicken and french fries and I had a Philly cheese steak which could have used a bit more cheese but tasty nonetheless.",Lighthouse Restaurant
443,"Out of their minds. OUT OF THEIR MINDS THESE PEOPLE ARE!!!!The food is great. I haven't had anything I'd describe as terrible or okay. My only issue I've had is a dry meatball parm once, some sauce did the trick.BUT!!!!!!!They are out of their freaking minds!!!!I've NEVER heard of an establishment where I can't order my food HOW I LIKE IT. Like NAPOLEON COMPLEX GONE WILD!!! This ain't a buffet, I don't have a choice at a buffet do I? But a PIZZERIA GET OVER YOURSELVESEvery other time I call it's ridiculous. Can't put a meatball parm on garlic bread, like who are they to tell me I can't have my meatball parm on garlic bread. ""It's not on the menu"" are these people looney or what? You have garlic bread on your menu, you have meatball parm on your menu SO ITS ON THE F$@&+# MENU. And guess what if I don't want roasted peppers on my sandwich today then I don't want any FN PEPPERS!!! You don't decide what I can or cannot order.

So I'll take it as such and assume it's all old Bc if it doesn't sell for the day Bc you won't tweak sh*+ here and there then I'll just warn everyone for possible food poisoning. Place can't be trusted. SORRY NOT SORRY.Sick of the BS. There aren't many places to eat, so maybe that's why they've been able to get away with it BUT NOT WITH ME!!! I'd much rather pay extra or go out of my way to eat from PLUM TOMATO WHO DOESNT TELL ME HOW I CAN OR CANNOT EAT MY FOOD. Oh and get this, they even had the nerve to complain about what I sent my husband to get once. I'm Italian I love bruschetta, I had a craving, and the guy goes ""seriously? That's what you want? You can't order something here (points to the already made food) you seriously want me to make that right now?""WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Never again. Never a f$@&*# gain. F$@& this place. And they refused to charge his debit card Bc of their minimum, we all know you get the same fee regardless. And my husband was told to order more food. He refused Bc of the guys attitude AND he took cash out of their atm charging the same $3 missing for their minimum. Guy was so confused tells him you're paying the $3 anyway, AND WE DONT WANNA GIVE IT TO YOU BC WE CANT ORDER WHAT WE WANT WHEN WE WANT. Foh Why don't you try being a little nicer? Maybe accommodate your clients, try to act like you care about your customers maybe and see them walk out happy. I have walked out pissed every time for the last 2 years I've lived here. And don't even get me started on wait times for pickup and delivery. I've never waited less than 40 for pickup and delivery has always been over an hour. Idk how Bc I never see anyone inside. If you're looking for good food HOW YOU LIKE IT then this isn't the place for you. I suggest plum tomato. Tastes as close to Brooklyn pizza you can get around here and I have never been told I can't have my food how I want it.","If I could give negative 10 stars I would. Let me just start off with the staff. I pray you never get the rude lady who answers the phone. Every single time we have ordered has been a nightmare. They are nasty nasty people, the food is not good and they mess up your order every single time. They have a program where you can win a free lunch. But if you plan on making several orders and have the free meal thrown on for delivery do not count on it. They REFUSE to send the free meal you win even if other orders are being placed. They said you must come in person with Id and the paper as proof and their computer can not set it for delivery. Biggest bull I have ever heard. Especially since we order a lot you would think they would do it or care to have a good reputation but they do not. Please stay away from this place. I am not one of the people who write a had review for just one bad experience.  This has been a continuous thing for months. We will never support this buisness again and I suggest you dont either",If there's -5 I would give it. The pizza has no taste. It's like eating cardboard. The staff is so rude. Its way overpriced. Don't go there!!!! It's waste of money!!,"Today we stopped in for authentic Italian pizza, and we are amazed how awesome this restaurant is. There are so many different choices of pizza that's ready and hot! Tiffany is our beautiful waitress, she and everyone is friendly and happy to see you arrive. How conveniently located off I-95 and the New Jersey turnpike.They have a wonderful private party room for your next event. Clean restaurant, nice restrooms, and great people everywhere! There is a gorgeous model eating her dinner here too!I recommend Riuniti Restaurant and Pizzeria to anyone who wants the best!","Came in after the hotel recommended this location to us. Upon walking in, the food is pre-made. They just warm it up in the oven. I ordered the pepperoni pizza slice. It was thin crust, very good taste, robust flavor. Loved it. My friend had the spaghetti and she didn't care for it. The waitress was very friendly and we really enjoyed the visit.Would visit again.","Shyster is the perfect word to describe these guys. They charged my family $60 bucks for a full tray of wings (for Superbowl) that came with only 30 wings , you do the math on that. Then they tried to justify it lol. This place is a joke.

I recently went in to grab some lunch a couple weeks ago around noon and they only had a couple bagels left. I said how come you only have a few bagels left they said it's because their bagel machine broke. My husband grabbed half a dozen bagels this morning and they're just not fresh how they used to be. Hard on top, and just old tasting. I'm guessing they still have not fixed their broken bagel machine.

So happy they were open at 7 am, as we drove back from LaGuardia Airport.  Their onion bagel was a plump, airy, creation, with a load a crunchy onion flakes top and bottom. A nice smear of light veggie spread and I was in business.  Just so happens that I visit number 1 shop last year.  It was also very solid.  They had some good looking donuts, too. Service was friendly and fast.  Prices very reasonable.  Strong java pour finished well.",I catered my daughters bridal party breakfast and they did an amazing job at both houses.  Bagels were fresh and delicious and crime cheese platters perfect.  Also had platters of the best donuts:muffins and croissants ever!  Very generous portions and dealing with the owner Mike was great... he is a sweetheart and got it all right!,Heartland Bagels 2
445,"I've never written a review like this before but I just have to. I paid $44 dollars for this order and I'm just disappointed.

446,Went Saturday Night and it was one of the worst clubs I've been too. Bouncers are very rude and think they run the place ! Hookahs are trash here as well !!! Just go to barcode which is down the block ! Way better,"The food is terrible. If you going for drinks cool, but nothing on that menu is worth trying to digest. Service is poor. Go for drinks thats it","Went here about a month ago with two friends for some unlimited mimosas event. Food was overpriced and just not good. I ordered some avocado toast and the avocado was not fresh. Complete garbage. Then I had the chicken and waffles and the only thing good about it was the syrup (probably was Aunt Jemima). The waiter came out after he was notified about our complaints and tried to offer us other food, which was nice, but I was honestly afraid to try anything else due to the overabundance of garbage I had already consumed. The mimosas tasted good but didn't really get me lit. And then after the fact that we complained they still tried to make us pay gratuity? Yeah no. Wouldn't recommend at all.","We dined here for my best friends birthday.  The business welcomed us in after we arrived a little late to our reservation.  They just opened so everything wasn't ready (music, server, etc).  We waited minutes before our server began to engage with us and we also waited a while to order.  Two menu items were not prepared correctly, according to the menu descriptions.  The Fettuccini Lobster with Hennessy cream sauce came out with just lobster on top of plan fettuccini pasta.  Such a disappointment.  Also, the salmon Caribe Jerk was not jerk at all.  A red/burgundy sauce was drizzle on the salmon but it didn't taste spicy or sweet.  Overall we had a good time celebrating outside of the errors.  Hopefully this review helps prevent future errors like the ones we experienced today.  The food came out in a timely manner, except the desert.  The desert didn't have ice cream which the menu says it comes with as well.  We would have liked to change our desert for a complete desert item, however we were not alerted prior to desert coming out.  I wouldn't return because they are not prepared for business.  If I'm spending hard earned money I'd like proper service.  Not to mention no one told us that they didn't have sufficient supplies/ingredients to execute what's on their menu.  Again, the food was the worst part of the night. The music and ambience were great.",Loved the 90s R&B music on at Saturday night. Food came out pretty quickly and the drinks were made strong! Gets crowded after 10pm it seems.,"The ambience was decent. That's actually what the stars are for. The customers were all there having a great time drinking, singing and dancing. I believe the DJ's music played a great roll on that. The bartenders were nice and got our drinks quickly. Though they should of came back more frequently to ask if we needed anything.We ordered a hookah and that as well came rather quickly. Yet towards the end of the night they took it. I explained to the guy taking it that we weren't done and he stated it was almost closing time and he was taking it. Ten minutes later on the other side of the bar two customers still had there's and they were not taken away. Talk about treating customers fair. The cleaning of the place needed a bit more maintenance. The bar section that were sitting by was disgusting. Someone must of spilled a drink before our arrival as it was super sticky every time I leaned my arm down. The bathroom was just excessively disgusting!! There was about a total of twenty people when we went. Five were of my party. There's no reason to why the above mentioned scenarios weren't corrected.",Dolce

But today i felt the need to just express how dissapointing this restaurant is. We ordered salmon and shrimps and they had no taste! Besides that, the tostones looked like they had been cooked from like 2-3 days ago. I get that crunchy is delicious but these tostones were so hard and they looked so old And we couldn't even finish them. I had a bad experience at this restaurant before with the steak but decided to give them a chance again and oh no never again. I don't recommend this place to anyone!","The food was decent.  The waitress was not.  The drinks are expensive.  There were 2 of us and the bill was over 100$. If you decide to go here, CHECK YOUR CHECK.  There was 2 of us and they automatically added a 15% gratuity.  Most people wouldn't even notice it but I know someone that went there and never noticed and tipped on the full bill and realized later that the tip was included and he got screwed.  Seems like a way to RIP YOU OFF.  REAL SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICE IF YOU ASK ME.",One of my favorite Colombian spots for breakfast. For dinner they usually always have live music which is beautiful but I prefer coming for the bakery goods or the breakfasts they serve. I ordered a calentado with meat and it was absolutely delicious. It was a lot of food on one plate so I couldn't finish it. Can't wait to go back!,Ok so this place is a good location - away from the congested Colombian section down the street. Some parking in the lot on the right Inside is a nice size. Open space and two floors Looks like they have music since there is a small stage for a DJ etc Staff was nice but service was lacking big time.  As far as checking up on us and finding the waitress when we wanted our check.  They seemed understaffed and needing more training to wait on tables. Menu could use some help. No prices for Colombian empanadas etc. Meals are servings for dinner as well as prices . So if you come for lunch - you will be paying dinner prices. There is no lunch menu I ordered the shrimp/camerones in garlic sauce . Came with platanos and white rice. Sauce was too watery in my opinion.  Mixing the rice and the Tostones made it better. The only thing that was ok was the beef Colombian empanada - I like the hot sauce they give you We wanted to try a new place instead of going to Brisas but kinda wish we did go there instead - food quality and service much better  even tho you have hassle to park,"I've eaten at the original Parador Rojo location countless times, but am glad a second branch is open to accommodate more customers. This branch has dedicated parking, a second floor, a bakery, and a small bar.FOOD:Bandeja Paisa ($16): Delicious! Parador Rojo is still my go-to place for this platter of deliciousness. It consists of a long strip of pork belly (chicharron), skirt steak (bistec), a fried egg, chorizo, an arepa, fried sweet plantains (maduros), a bowl of beans, avocado, and rice. Although this was ordered at the second branch, the flavor and portions are still the same.Lengua a la Criolla ($14): Tasty! The beef tongue was tender and soaked up the savory (and slightly sweet), tomato and onion-based Colombian Creole sauce. I received 4 large slices and a few small-to-medium slices. My order came with rice, a side salad with avocado, and fried plantains (tostones)Pargo Frita ($20): Delicious! The presentation was great, but the taste was even better. This came with rice, tostones, and a side salad with avocado. The fish was fresh, flaky, and perfectly fried; it wasn't a minute overcooked. As for flavor, it was great. It matches well with the green and red sauce served to every table.SERVICE:The waitress for my table was very friendly to my table. She got my drink order wrong (raspberry tea instead of unsweetened), but it's not a big deal. Seating should not be a problem as this branch is huge and has a second floor. Parking may still be a problem, though.There are many great places in the area, but from my experience, Parador Rojo has always been a consistent and reliable option for delicious Colombian food in Union County.",Parador Rojo 2

When we came here for lunch for a group of 5, the restaurant was completely empty and my sister was running late and asked for us to order for her. They refused to seat us until she came and we watched party after party pass us and fill up the establishment. This policy makes no sense, especially because the restaurant was completely empty when we got there. We didn't even feel like eating here after my sister arrived because we've never been treated this way before. Unless things change, we are not coming back.",Not very nice people...they have all sorts of rules and regulation I need to apply for a table. Half the place was empty... they will not give you a table unless you're a party of three or more.,"A nice place overall but for the sake of the truly dislikable, insipid, 4-ulcer-guy-on-a-3-ulcer-job cashier, we won't be coming back. Guy's attitude destroyed what was otherwise a decent breakfast visit and by the looks of some of these other reviews, I'm not the only one who was disgusted to be treated like garbage.","This is more than just a coffee shop. It's a diner that serves awesome food, and breakfast all day! Once you walk in you are greeted by the hostess and the owner, George. Very pleasant and friendly staff to go along with this establishment.Greek Gyro (or cheeseburger) is my usual go-to meal when I hit up any diner. It's sort of a tradition for me, and this place did not mess up the Gyro I had. It was a nice sized meal, but what made it even more tantalizing was the side of homemade tzaziki sauce. I could not get enough, and they were not cheap with the amount they gave either. All the ingredients looked fresh and colorful.I was very surprised and pleased with my experience here. It looks smaller than it is from the outside, but there is enough seating. One thing is that there is no parking lot, street parking only.It is worth the visit, and I'm sure I'll be back for more than just the tzaziki sauce!","Local favorite dinner with great service and excellent food. Menu has classic Greek dishes as well as breakfast all day. Sharing is caring when you order the large Greek Salad with seasoned  grilled chicken, don't forget the fries!","My favorite ""diner"" on the island. The waitresses are so personable, the service is perfect and the food is fantastic.  When there is a wait, my kids and I know it's worth it. Best breakfast and lunch around. Think your egg and cheese is a bit pricey? Try it and you will see it's like no other.",Island Coffee Shop
449,"This was a lackluster experience. I've driven by this place several times and have heard a few positive things about the small locale, but my experience was far from that.Let's start with waiting staff. We couldn't tell who our waiter was because we had four different people ask us for drink orders several different times. This was especially frustrating because we wanted to order food but they seemed to only come around when our drinks were empty. On top of that, out of the four different people who tried to refill our drinks, 3 of the 4 were dry and kind of rude.Let's move onto food! Our food was ordered and we waited (the wait wasn't long, which was awesome...ish). When our food came to the table, we were missing some of our order and had to ask two separate times for some help to remedy this. Aside from that, our food was room temp to the touch!! I was so frustrated at this point that I just dealt with the temperature and ate. My tacos were dry and I asked for no onions but there were plenty of onions, and let me say this!! I don't mind when things like this happen because I can survive, it's really not a big deal to take them off or whatever I have to do, but when there's a plethora of issues, all the little things pile up and I just wasn't having it. Last but DEFINITELY NOT LEAST. We were a group of 4. That's it. An automatic gratuity was applied (I wanna say 18%), but with such shi**y service, I'm so upset by the automatic tip. I will never be back.",Waiter stole my debit card info and made personal charges. After I handed him my card to pay for food and drinks I checked my account a while later and realized someone made over $120 purchases for different services. This is currently being investigated and I hope the waiter gets jail time.,The waitress was extremely rude and the manager did nothing to stop her from being problematic with customers. Her tone and actions was completely unacceptable will not be supporting this franchise again,"I like this place. The staff is pretty good, especially Arianna. The food is hit or miss. Don't get anything that's not made to order, that's the secret. It has a nice bar vibe.","Food and drinks are great here as well as prices. However there is 1 server/bartender there that probably shouldn't be there. Not sure of her nationality but appears to be Portuguese/Brazilian?? Doesnt serve with a smile or consistency. Just appeared to be miserable. Never came back around after we finished our 1st drinks. When leaving, we did ask another server/bartender her name which I believe was Mikayla.  Now she came around a few times to our table to be sure everything was good and we had drinks.  She truly was an allstar and did provide service with a smile.  All around, Terminal 1 is a good spot!","Great place to eat and watch sports. Very good to sit relax and enjoy a burger and fries. Try the Frenchie, it's so good",Terminal One
450,"I called on Thursday about a gender reveal. I was given pricing information, but had a hard time understanding the name of who I spoke to. It sounded like Jasmine, she was very nice. We went to put a deposit on Saturday, 2 days later. We asked for Jasmine, we were told ""She's not here, I can help you"". Unfortunately I didn't get this person's name, she said she was a supervisor. I recounted my conversation about the party. She went and spoke to someone and said they're rethinking parties and not taking reservations. I said, but I spoke to Jasmine two days ago. Her response was, ""WE DON'T HAVE A JASMINE HERE"". I said maybe it was Jacqueline. The point was we wasted a trip after being given incorrect information TWO DAYS earlier. Nasty is never necessary.","We came here as a group of 12 people. The service is horrible. !!!! One person ordered a bubble tea and didn't like it and she told by the waiter that her taste buds were incorrect and she couldn't get a refund or a change of flavor. Another person stood at the register for 5 minutes with 3 of the workers just looking at her until she had to ask them to help her. The lady that was helping her then walked away in the middle of her talking and came back to tell another lady to take her order. After, she asked for an avocado shake (which was on the menu), the woman looked back at her with a confused face. She had to go back to get a menu and prove that they serve it before she agreed to take the order.Another person asked for a sundae and they gave her just 3 scoops of ice cream .. dry as hell how can ice cream be dry. Lastly, one person ordered a Greek salad and another person ordered a strawberry smoothie and it took them over 40 minutes to bring them out. This place needs to upgrade their service.","If I could give this place a 0 I would. The manger is very disrespectful, I was never given store credit when I was supposed to because my graduation cake was horrible. The writing was written like some 5 year old did it, the cake was all dry,once you cut the cake it fell apart. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ITS NOT WORTH IT.   IF YOU EVER HAVE A PROBLEM DO NOT SPEAK TO LAURN, she won't help you but apologizeAs you can tell no one really likes this place if you keep looking at the reviews",Had the chai latte. Was very delicious and full of flavor. Ambience was cute and clean. Very hipster place.,"We arrived for a birthday breakfast for my nephew at 8:10am, the ONLY party in the place. We sat for 45 minutes and finally asked our server when the food may be coming out. She said ""oh I'll go check now"". (Hmmm maybe she should've thought to do that prior to us having to ask). At 9:10am parts of our order started coming out, cold omelettes. We got all but 1 of our orders. She assured us the remaining meal would be out shortly. She then scrambled to the computer, it was clear the order never made its way in. She then came over and said my omelette would be over soon. Whoops I didn't order an omelette! What a great birthday celebration! Also. The amount of single use plastic is nauseating. Hire a dishwasher, cheapskates!!","Tasty cookies and other bakery treats (including, yes, cake), and friendly staff. Piece-a-cake also has a food and drink menu, and sandwiches and soups are also good (not gourmet, but hey, it's a bakery after all). Relaxed atmosphere and fun decor. My only wish is that the kitchen was open later - I recently went in at 6:30pm on a Sunday (they close at 9 most nights) and it was dessert only at that point.",Piece A Cake
451,"Just ate there, the food was delicious! Also the staff was extremely friendly. Not sure what all the negative reviews are about. Also, the prices are very reasonable. Will be back !","Horrible! Went here with my brother. The place was empty when we walked in and there was no one standing behind the counter. The staff was not really friendly or welcoming. The place where they place the food can be cleaner. I ordered a homewrecker burrito l vegetarian which was alright. I didnt end up finishing it. I ordered with a meal and she didnt give me a cup i had to take it myself.They also ran out of plastic knives.It was empty and had to look for a clean place to sit because all the tables were dirty. Whenever they didnt have any customers the whole staff would sit and eat together and whenever a customer came in one of them would attend them with food still in their mouth chewing.The mens bathrooms was dirty with a wet floor.Same day, my brother and I got sick and later saw they have a C grading in one of the reviews.Would not recommend. Please avoid this place unless you want to get sick.",Will NEVER eat or order from here again. We were going through the line and my girlfriend asked for guac not realizing that unlike chipotle there is tomatoes in the guac which she can't have. She kindly told the lady I'm sorry but I didn't realize you have tomatoes in your guac can you please take it off. So the lady proceeds to scrape it off the steak and put it back into the container of guac. How unsanitary. Especially if a vegan is to order the guac after it was slabbed over my steak quesadilla. Smh I'm so grossed out about all the other things that can be thrown back into the containers of food.,"I order from this location quite often, and recently I've begun to notice the last few times I've ordered from here things have been lacking. To start with, I live within a 5 minute or less drive from this location, the fact that I do not go pick it up myself is generally out of pure laziness and I pay the price for that (both literally and figuratively). If you've ever been to Moe's or ordered off of their app before immediately what stands out is the $20 minimum fee. If you're ordering for just yourself that's a little ridiculous to pay, and on top of that the prices for the food are much more expensive than ordering in person (even on their own app). I understand they raises the prices for Grubhubs fees, but I've spent $8 on a burrito bowl in store that costs me $13 on the app (that's with no add-ons that would raise the price). Now, to the actual food. With every meal you order (except for the nachos) they should include chips and a small cup of salsa in the bag. Sometimes I get chips for the meals I order, but more times than not I'm being shorted multiple bags of chips for the meals I order. If I make a request for a specific cup of salsa (that is already included with the chips, which are a part of the meals) I'm never given a single cup of salsa. Now, as I previously mentioned I live fairly close to this place, I've picked food up from this location and taken it home on a number of occasions. Even stuck in some amount of traffic, the food is always still hot and in good condition by the time I get it to my house. Lately, every time I've had food delivered it is always ice cold and the food is always coating the sides of the containers making it impossible not to make a mess when attempting to open it. I've been ordering from this place for years and the delivery standards have greatly declined over time, which is a shame because I really enjoy the food from here and don't always have the ability to pick it up myself.","They offer bowls finally, a little on the small side but still tasty! You can also get tofu and now they have sirracha! Love their vanilla peach soda too! Really enjoy eating here","For about 15 minutes on a hot summer afternoon, i actually wished i lived on Staten Island! Crazy, right? It's true, and it's all because of Moe's! Working in Manhattan, i'm used to eating at ""The Big C"" because they have one every other block, so having an alternative like Moe's is a great thing!The bright yellow caught my eye as i was driving up Hylan Blvd, and i had to pull over and check it out. As soon as i opened the door, a big guy i later learned to be 'Lou G' yelled out ""Welcome to Moe's!""It took me a few minutes to look over the menu, it's kind of hokey with funny names, and i eventually ordered the 'Art Vandalay,' which is a vegetarian burrito. They have a few more options than ""the big C"" including black olives, standalone onions and different types of lettuce. I got the works with all the usuals and decided to make it a meal. This is where i was impressed! You get complimentary chips with any order! And with the meal you get a drink and one side, in which i picked guacamole to dip my chips.It gets better, too - once you walk away with your meal you immediately see a self-serve, all you can dip salsa station! I was in heaven, they had 6 different types (also with funny names), and i went with the mango salsa which was fantastic!My beverage of choice was sweet tea and i was all set. I went to a booth in the corner facing the street so i can see all the action on Hylan and i had a very enjoyable meal. Classic hits from the 60's, 70's and 80's blasted out of the speaker and paintings of celebs lined the walls. They also have specials like kids eat free Wednesdays 5-9pm and something called ""Joey Tuesdays"" which gives a deeply discounted meal. I have to say that ""the big C"" has some major competition in my eyes, i paid $9.56 for my entire meal which costs $11 at the other place with no chips, side or unlimited salsa. I loved Moe's and i hope they expand to Brooklyn so i can avoid making the occasional trip over the expensive bridge. 4 stars for everything they have to offer, and a 5th for being the only game in town.",Moe's Southwest Grill
452,"As we walked to the entrance a lady hassled us to give us a dollar.  Not the best neighborhood to hang out. When I asked for another spoon, I got the nastiest facial expression from the cashier. Service was fast. Baked goods are fresh. 1 mango yogurt, 1 orange juice, 1 tiramisu and 1 cheese pastry -$12Plenty of seating and tables inside.Food was overall yummy and that's why they get a 2 star.",The meat in the empanadas is either raw or spoiled maybe even both. I ordered chicken and beef. Took one bite and had to spit it out and throw the entire order away. It was that bad. The chorizo was also under cooked.,"I have been a patron of Brisas for 17+ years, and always used to say that they had the most delicious Colombian food and service.  However, I went there this morning for a takeout breakfast, and it was the worst experience ever.  The empanadas (which they were known for) were raw on the inside.  The calentao had raw onions and the beans were hard as a rock.  In addition to the quality of the food being sub-quality, I also had to wait almost 45 minutes for my order, when I was promised that it would be 15 minutes maximum.  Unfortunately, I have come to realize that the Colombian food that I make in my house is better quality and not as expensive.  I am going to be reaching out to the owner (whom I know personally) to express how unpleasant today was for me, and that regrettably, I will not be returning.  GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER, ALBEIRO.  YOU ARE LOSING A LOT OF CLIENTELE!!!!","Random pick on my way to work and I'm so happy I found this location! I picked up a corn arepa with a passion fruit juice and it was delicious! The service was quick, and my overall experience was positive!","This restaurant is worth the visit for a nice Colombian cuisine, but I left ""unsatisfied"" today.It is a busy establishment with a bakery & restaurant.  It's cool how they have the waiting area located in between the buildings, and made it look like an authentic Colombian home.  They make some freshly squeezed authentic juices, fresh authentic ice creams (fruit flavored), and authentic meals.Be advised that the wait here is long.  You wait to be seated, you wait for each menu item to come out to you.  Our waiter was hard to locate at times as we waited.  It took around 30min after we were seated to get the complimentary cheese bread.  It also took some time for me to get my juice drink.  It was about an hour to get our meals.  They do appear short staffed, or maybe their kitchen isn't big enough to cook up a large order for their customers. Not sure why this is.So I ordered the Colombian Mini Paisa (yes, that's the mini).  It basically has it all, plenty of different kinds of meat, rice, beans, plantains, and avocado for a really decent price.  Once it came out I was dying to dig in.  The longer I wait for something the minute I get it I wanna tear it up, BUT I did not do that with this dish.  It was cold, like ""sitting on a table after it was made"" cold.I never turn away food, especially when I'm beastin', but I had to say something.  The waiter offered to make me another one, but after being there for over an hour now, and starving I had asked him for something quick like a skirt steak.  His reply to me was the icing on the cake, ""The skirt steak costs more"".Needless to say I did not dine here.  Towards the end he brings over a flan dessert to the table.  So you won't feed me another meal, but bring me a dessert when you didn't even want to feed me....WTF!!!!!     I did not eat the dessert.This place has a lot to offer, but having a ""satisfied"" customer is what makes them keep coming back.","Whoever manages the phone should speak english, or be taught to hand the phone to someone who speaks english. This was terribly rude - I called to see if they could accommodate a party of 10 and the woman who answered the phone responded with, ""No english."" and hung up on me. I called back 15 minutes later hoping a different person would answer, but it was the same woman, and the first thing i said was, ""Please find someone who speaks english."" she responded (with attitude this time), ""No! no english, no no."" and i repeated myself, and she hung up on me again. It felt like I was being discriminated against in my own country for speaking my country's own language. What the hell?i was STILL going to go eat b/c the food pictures look great and the reviews are so positive, but after the way she handled my 2nd call, now they've lost my business and i'm going to share this feedback on all internet platforms and directly to the restaurant's website.

453,"Ordered $63.00 worth of wings for football Sunday.  I ordered all boneless. They were all boned. Some were dry and small. Celery was mushy. I called to complain and I got no satisfaction and at first I was accused of not ordering boneless, then he said I would get 15% off next order. There won't be a next order. Disappointed",Originally called for delivery but it was over an hour wait guy said if I can pick it up it would be ready in 15 mins. Well he wasn't kidding.

Haven't had planet wings in so long thinking it wasn't that great anymore WRONG was damn good,"The food great but they recently changed the containers. Now all the food is soggy, cold and crushed by the time you get it. Don't get delivery anymore you might as well just go there","There is a couple of things I enjoy about planet wings. My all time favorite is Chicken Quesadillas, they are delish! I occasionally order the philly cheesesteak but have to ask for extra cheese otherwise they are cheap for what the point of cheesesteak suppose to be. The burritos are good, The tacos I've ordered a couple of times but the ground beef was ice cold and cold chopmeat is not a delightful taste!    For a place that suppose to be all about the wings, I do not enjoy them! I guess their bone-in wings are probably better but I always ordered boneless and I found the wings menu to be pricey such as, 10 wings for $10.99, yes they do have a large variety of different flavors, but I find them to be swimming in sauce and overcooked and dry.   I do enjoy their grilled chicken salad and montero ranch grilled chicken wrap. The best thing about planet wings is that you can order online through their website and I never had a problem with the delivery man never showing, he has come every single time and you receive confirmation emails when it is being prepared and out for delivery.   Overall, planet wings will continue to be a dinner option on my list! If I could make any suggestions to the planet wings it would be in their value meals, have the option to choose fries or a salad because most of the time I have to order ala carte to avoid high caloric dinner options and that ends up being pricey!",Would've been nice if I got the crack water this time they messed up my drink and my friends were not cooked and my quesadillas were ice cold and it's only 10 blocks difference from that place to my location and last time I ordered like $60 worth of food and I repeated the order and they were all supposed to be combos and the guy said yeah sure whatever no problem and we were missing drinks and fries and then he claims that we Never asked for that maybe it's easier to order online but I did that today and I still had stuff messed up and missing and not cooked properly this place used to be pretty good but it seems like the staff just this kind of an interested and could care less,"From the looks of it, majority of these reviews are from several years ago. Well, I can say that today I ordered a fairly large order for takeout and everything was as expected. Wings were really delicious, fries were crispy, Philly cheese steak and quesadillas were very tasty. Prices are inexpensive and wait time is not long. I remember a few years ago I'd used to order from here and still I don't recall ever having a problem.

454,Didn't even get my food. Called and placed an order over the phone and was told it would take an hour and half. What????  That is unreasonable. You want to tell me that if I came in for lunch and sat down it would take an hour and a half to get my food? Either the person who answered the phone didn't know what they were talking about. Or they just didn't want to do the order. (I did place an order for 8 people. But still. If 8 random people came in and stood in line it would take them an hour and a half to make their food? That's insane!),Doesn't even compare to other local BBQ places. Wanted to give them another chance so I showed up at 11:35 waited 5 minutes to have someone tell me the lunch specials that are advertised starting at 11 AM won't be ready for another 20 minutes. It's not the 1st time it's happened! Don't advertise that if you're not going to serve it then. Won't be going back!,"Have tried this place several times and decided to give it one last try. The service is slow and the food is mediocre. It's Portuguese cuisine and was owned by a Portuguese lady, not sure if it changed owners but quality went down.  For a place called the patio and has potential to have nice outdoor seating, the patio is in desperate need of repairs and greenery. The string lighting need replacing and indoor needs updating. Unfortunately will not be coming back.",I love every the food here. Perfect little byob spot. Staff was very nice and explained the items on the menu well. The ribs were awesome. It's quiet so its a nice little down to earth date spot.,"Thank you Yelpers for guiding me to another excellent meal! Had the chicken picadinho lunch special to go for $7.49 including tax! Be prepared to wait a few minutes as your food is cooked to order, not scooped out of a ready-made tray (it would probably still be good)! My meal was served with an awesome Portuguese roll! Sadly, there wasn't enough for leftovers, but it was a filling lunch! Nice restaurant area off to the side. Looking forward to going back!","Love this place. Great friendly service. Lots of space.

455,I was there on a Friday night. They were so busy. They didn't even acknowledge that we were waiting. After a few minutes I had to say something to be seated. After we were sitting the waitress ignored us for 20 minutes. Once again I had to ask to be served menus. The food took an hour to get to us and we were served different times at our table. We didn't get forks or knives I had to grab them from a table. Seems like they are only considered about take out orders. The food wasn't as good as it usually tastes. I gave them one more chance. I ordered take out. I hade avocado rolls. I ended up getting very nauseous from the food. I'll never go back there again.,The one on hyland Blvd. sent wrong food to my house and told me that they were sorry wouldn't change order and called me a liar they wouldn't change food,"I'm sad and disappointed. The girl who was working there today seemed to not give two craps about anything. She wasnt rude or anything, but seemed that getting back to looking at her cellphone was the only thing in her mind. Very unfriendly. The sushi was just okay, sort of carelessly put together, the salad that came with the lunch special was a 1/4 bowl of lettuce with ginger dressing. No tomatoes or cucumbers. The soup that came with the special was tasteless. The edamame wasnt salted and came with a stray noodle. Overall an experience that was a little less than ""meh"".",Great sushi spot. One of my favorite places for take out. Tuna sandwich is just delicious! Always fresh and quick.,Good spot for sushi in Staten Island. Fresh and light and good pricing.Food: Spicy Salmon: Standard. Always good no matter where I go.Salmon Avocado: Light and freshHarajuku: So good and crunchy and a def must here to get.Overall: Typical place for sushi if you want a quick meal around Great Kills,"This is my go-to sushi spot for date nights when I'm in the area, so I get the same servers, and the ladies are wonderful and very nice. It's bright and clean and the food is delicious. Nothing but good experiences whenever I go here. It's usually empty when I go for dinner even on friday nights. When it comes to pricing, it's the usual. Not too cheap nor too expensive and the quality to me seems fresh and worth the money being charged for. It's a relatively small restaurant, so there is one unisex bathroom which is clean and spacious. Overall, I really like this place, and I recommend trying it out! Best part of all, they have parking, albeit a limited space, it's better than nothing. If you circle around though, you can usually find a spot in the neighboring streets.",Cucumber Sushi & Salad Bar
456,They are very racist. And iam Hispanic and I do speak english and spanish.iwhen I got food poisoning I never went back. But I noticed the price changes when u speak spanish and the service is a little better.,I had a few bad experiences here.i few years back I got very bad food poisoning.that can happen anywhere.Today Oct 2017 I went there I stood waiting no line but every time someone who spoke Spanish came.they took care of before me.So I spoke Spanish they came over The rice was dry and hard no flavor the pork was hard over cooked and the pastel was dry as card board This was my experience ism not saying it's going to be the same for you I feel this way.the food and service should all ways be at it's best.And that's not the case here.Plus Ian not a friendbnor a relative writing to boost this place up This place is at its worst,"Food is good, staff is shitty depending who you get. You get charged differently depending on who's serving you. I got the Chicken Teriyaki with Brown rice and was told beans weren't included, when I literally ordered last week and it was included for no extra. I literally paid $3 extra for the same shit, and the lady was rude as hell, if you don't speak spanish don't expect decent service or fairly portioned plates. I've even tried it with a hispanic friend where we ordered the same shit and I was charged $2 extra. So I guess a non-spanish speaking tax is charged. Food is good but the staff are rude as hell with the exception of some of them. But if you've been there you know who i'm talking about already. You know it's fucked when most of your 1 star reviews are about how bad the staff treat non-hispanic people. Racist fucks.","Delicious authentic latin food! You can order a plate made to order, or pick from the buffet steam table. I usually go on my lunch break for a quick bite. They have the most amazing assortment of proteins and sides!

457,My favourite place to eat. Friendly neighborhood pizza and more. Penne vodka my favourite.,"Clearly, I've never had good Sicilian pizza before (new to area). Got half mushrooms and half cheese. Added some Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper (I put that on all my pizzas). So tasty. While the crust is thicker than a traditional pie, it was fluffy and not dense and weighed down.","The pizzas are incredible here. My go-tos used to be Americana and white gold, but the vodka pizza is also to die for.",I looove their pizza. This place is a friendly reminder that community can still exist in this superficial world of shameless self promotion. Their sauce reminds me of my dearly departed nana.,"Yuck. This pizza was cold and the oven wasn't even hot at 12:30pm (on a Saturday!!) to warm it up. It looked like it had been sitting for hours. The crust is SO thin, to the point where it seems like they're trying to cut cost on dough. I would not be complaining if this was dollar pizza. But it's double the price! It looks like dollar pizza and tastes like dollar pizza - it is NOT worth $2 a slice.","Massive scrumptious thick crusted sicilian pizza and awesome friendly delivery drivers made both times I've ordered really pleasant experiences.The only things I have to question though are1) Why are the workers who answer the phone always so confused? They seem to not know anything about the restaurant at all.2) What's up with the weird kitchen closing hours? They seem to change by the day with no schedule listings online, so both times I've ordered and attempted to, I couldn't get any non-pizza food.Those complaints are pretty minimal though.

The tortas are my go to, especially with chips and guacamole.",Review Summary: Great food and friendly service I was on a business trip and wanted to stop in at a Mexican place before getting to the airport. It is a little out of the way but highly worth it. The food reminds me of several places I have eaten in Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta. It is well seasoned and cooked to perfection. We had the flautas and gorditas. They were both excellent and the portion size was huge. Their black beans are far from bland and the house made verde salsa had the perfect blend of heat and seasoning. I highly recommend you eat here and I wished I lived in the area so I could return.,"Review Summary: Great food and friendly service I was on a business trip and wanted to stop in at a Mexican place before getting to the airport.

I've passed by this place many times, but never noticed it until now. It's also great that they close late.Now for the food. We tried the breaded beef burrito, spicy pork tacos, and guacamole with chips. Everything was so delicious! We're a big fan over everything, but our favorite part was the breaded beef burrito. Everything was fresh and tasty. We will definitely be going back!",Antojitos Mexicanos
459,"Very bad experience. I would not recommend this place at all. First of all, it's HOT in there. What's wrong with this business that they can't put the AC to a comfortable level. I asked the server and she said it's because it's hot outside. What??Second of all, the food was horrible. I ordered chicken and waffles. My chicken was dry and re-fried in old oil. It was like leather. The waffle was dry and tasted gross. The hamburger had no taste. The chicken finger waffle sandwich was disgusting. The avocado toast was blah. Prices do not match quality of food. If it weren't for the pleasant waitress and hostess, this place would have Zero Stars.Never again.","Horrible horrible service and customer service horrible! Waited and waited and waited for food that never came and then they charged me for the coffee I drank while waiting for them to get off their asses and make my food! Waited over and hour and not once did any manager come out to apologize, not one! Never again, overpriced, discourteous and run horribly","I give it one star because you can't leave zero. You wait to sit longer then really needed because the place is not managed properly. The two bus service folks don't know left from right. They leave tables unfinished when cleaning to jump on other tables before allowing folks to sit at the first table. The wait staff gets orders wrong more often than not. To be honest, go to iHop. Better food, better service and cheaper.","So let's talk about Project Brunch located 4553 Arthur Kill Road,New York, opened 7:00AM- 3:00PM I finally made it there completely unexpected I usually never do that.I walked in with My 2 1/2 year old date was greeted by 2 people with smiles on there faces which means a lot to me, was seated within 3 minutes excellent.The table and Restaurant were very clean as were the staff, the Cook was smiling which means everything is coming out of that kitchen with love poured all over it as it was. He wasn't bad to look at either. I asked my waiter for recommendation he leaned me towards the BLT, I said that's my favorite for Brunch but this wasn't a boring regular BLT, this was the best BLT on the Island. Made with premier ingredients the tomatoes were sliced to perfection then made in a batter, did I say blew my mind then the Bacon was premier quality just the right thickness, then made with a Chipotle sauce and instead of lettuce Baby Arugula drop the mic. My Date ordered Chicken fingers & fries, when it arrived it was the best looking Children's Meal of course I tasted the quality of the Chicken was very good, the taste & the color were excellent well done  yes I recommend Project Brunch can't wait to go back and taste something else off the menu.","I thought I reviewed Project Brunch here already, but I don't see that one. I know I reviewed it in the past, giving it top marks. The food & service was amazing.But, after not having gone to PB in a while AND after they opened multiple locations, with take-out at their Arthur Kill Road place, service has definitely changed.First, PB is ALWAYS busy. You always have to wait for a table and sometimes for a seat a the counter. When my husband & I went last week, on a Thursday, the wait for a table was about 25 minutes. There were seats at the counter & we were immediately seated. My first issue was the state of the bathroom. In the past, and hubby & I have gone to this location dozens of times since they opened. The bathroom was ALWAYS CLEAN. Last week, there were a few horrors awaiting that I'll leave to your imagination. But, I wasn't too keen, especially after there wasn't any soap left. Ok-- as I said it was busy. As I said, we've been there many times so I wasn't going to be daunted. I wanted my chive waffle extravaganza.Inside of 15 minutes, we ordered and the order wasn't overly complicated. A coffee, latte, breakfast burrito bowl, and a Project BEC breakfast. We got our drinks maybe 10 minutes later-- which was a bit of a wait, but we were at the counter, so we saw how busy everyone was. And I also saw how slammed the kitchen was. For every in-house order, they were processing a take-out order or two. I could be wrong, but when PB opened their take-out side of this location, I thought they had a kitchen on that side. I never saw take-out passing from the kitchen, and we often sat at the counter. This time-- as time passed, for every in-house order, two were going out. Ultimately, after waiting another 45 minutes-- a total of an hour at PB-- we left. We had an appointment to keep. The staff was friendly and asked us to wait before leaving. Why, I don't know, but we had a doctor's appointment that we ultimately were late for. They didn't charge us for the drinks BUT we should have been told as the waitress took our order that the kitchen was delayed and our food would take 45+ minutes to prepare. When we told the waitress we were leaving, she checked our order. IT HADN'T EVEN BEEN STARTED YET! Not cool Project Brunch.Really disappointed yet another fine establishment has suffered because of greed & a desire to expand. Perfect what you have before you open more restaurants. The kitchen staff should NOT have been dealing with take-out orders too. They were drowning under orders & clearly they need more kitchen staff. Ditto for the wait-staff. When we first sat down, we were thrilled to see a PB location opening in NJ. Now, I wouldn't waste my time.","Really wanted to like this place, especially with all the positive reviews. And it does have all the ingredients to be successful, including good service. But the food was very hit or miss. We ordered:- Farmers Breakfast w/ pancakes- Egg White omelette- 2x Latte's w/ Almond MilkEggs, bacon and coffee... good. Sausage links (chicken apple sausage) and pancakes were... terrible. The sausage tasted like the cheap frozen stuff you buy at the super market, which was left for too long in the freezer, and then overcooked. The pancakes were also too dry and felt similar to the frozen pancakes you put in the toaster oven. After a 45+ min wait, this was quite a let down.",Project Brunch
460,"I've been eating here since I worked down the street. Our company would order food from here all the time. Parking can be a bit of a challenge because it's street parking on a busy Forest Ave. The staff are decent people. Have nothing much to say about that. The pizza is pretty good. I'm not sold on the sauce though.  You need to add more salt or some garlic to get more flavor. I know it's disheartening to hear but I feel the sauce could have more life. The cheese and dough is great, no complaints there. $2.50 per slice. You get a decent slice though.","disrespectful People, Half at a time mess up my sandwich.

461,Whew a waste of $22 during my Christmas shopping. Stopped by for a quick visit I wanted to pick up some food and go. First of all the workers were talking about how lazy the cooks are and how they have to cook orders for themselves most of the time. Ummm WHET? So the cooks aren't.... cooking???? So it immediately made me open up my yelp app and look up the reviews and low and behold they were terrible. I had already paid so I was stuck. I sat at the bar and waited for the food to come out.First of all the text mex rolls were obviously frozen and ONLY 3 pieces for $10 are you kidding me???The wings were terrible. They looked and tasted unloved.I will not return to this establishment EVAAAAA,"Not that we've been to many Chili's but this one was the worst.  We were here on a weekday around 5 p.m.  At that time of day, business was slow.  We were seated immediately and were given a booth.  No sooner did I sit down when I noticed an awful smell.  I quickly traced it to a very large spot of dried food that was on the seat cushion.  It was so dried on that my attempts to wipe it up didn't work.  My husband switched seats with me and was careful to not sit in that mess.Our server was on the slow side getting to us.  To drink, I ordered a watermelon margarita.  This drink was a disappointment as the only watermelon flavor in it came in the form of large pieces of it that were in the glass.  In other words, it was very poorly made.  My husband had a beer---I forget which kind.For dinner, I ordered from the ""guiltless grill"" and got ""margarita grilled chicken"" which (supposedly) consisted of:  ""pico,  tortilla chips, Mexican rice and black beans"".  It came out swimming in black beans.  While it was edible but forgettable, it wasn't attractively presented.My husband had better luck with his dinner.  He ordered an ""old timer burger"" which has:  ""pickles, lettuce, tomato, red onion and mustard"".  He did enjoy it, thus the reason for the 2 stars instead of 1.The kitchen was on the slow side.  When it was time to get the check, the server took her time getting to us.Needless to say, if we ever go to Jersey Gardens again and it's time for dinner, we will stay far away from this Chili's.","Went to jersey gardens to do a little shopping and of course after shopping you want to eat. I was absolutely shocked that chili's of all places, didn't serve us at all. No one greeted us, we were seated by the hostess and that was the only interaction we had with any chili's employee at the jersey gardens mall location. We sat and waited for 15 minutes I had even set a timer, because we were completely floored by the lack of service. So if you want to just rest without anyone talking to you it's a great place.","Wow, all the bad reviews. I'm usually very picky, but I found the food here to be quite good. We did not have the friendliest server, who didn't smile when serving us, but she did move fast.  I got a lemonade to drink, and it was nice and sweet, like how a fresh lemonade should. I got the 1975 Soft Tacos, which was made with chili, lettuce, tomatoes, and served with sour cream and salsa. The shell was really nice and soft, and the chili tasted nice and spicy. I didn't taste much lettuce, but that was fine, because I'm not a huge lettuce fan. Could have seen a bit more cheese, but again did not bother me. Some of the taco did topple over as I was picking it up, but I've experienced that before. The chips were good, but the salsa had the crunchiness of tomatoes, instead of it just being a sauce.  Overall, though this was a great Chili's.","Shopping mood buzz kill. Long wait to be seated with half the dining room occupied. As per our smileless hostess and my own eyes, all available dining tables were not cleared nor cleaned. I should have taken that as a clear sign to go somewhere else. We were finally seated with no utensils or napkins.Ta'-sha (yes that is spelled and hyphenated as per receipt), our waitress was very pleasant and seemed to be the only one running around to please her tables. Her strong efforts were noticeable. Waited very long to get our drinks from the bar. Bartender sent over our drinks without a bottle opener to pop our single serve bottles. Walked over to bar and did it myself. An extremely long wait for food. Salmon dinner $18:Salmon mediocre as expected.Broccoli came straight out of a bag onto my plate no seasoning whatsoever. Side salad substitute for rice pilaf was an extra $1.50 and barely basic. Fajitas:Came out looking really good and sizzling. Presentation nice!Bottom layer was BURNT. After a minute of sizzling was able to smell the burnt. Burnt rice was sizzled onto the hotplate. Only able to eat top layer of everything on hot plate. Side of french fries: yummy. Over priced for service and quality.",Stopped in for lunch while Chrismas shopping. Sat at bar and ordered triple appetizers. Took a long time to come out  but they were good or I was really hungry.,Chili's
462,"This is the worst place I've ever ordered from. Ordered a chicken Marsala hero and a dish of penne with Marsala sauce. I specifically asked for NO ONIONS- considering I'm allergic. The puppy on the phone said she couldn't do the order like that and I had to order the chicken Marsala dinner and they'd give me the hero bread on the side (even though I had ordered it like that 2 weeks ago with no problem). I said fine but please no onions. When the food came, it had onions all over it. I called back and they said they would send it back with no onions. Guess they substituted the onions for a hair ‍ NEVER ORDERING FROM HERE AGAIN. Maybe hire girls to pick up the phone who know/care about what they're doing.",Shame on me for thinking the jerk that works there was the owner. The skinny guy w the ugly facial hair who harassed me for parking in the lot was a worker. I met the owners who were very apologetic and turned out to be lovely people.,These guys are rude and unprofessional. They put a sticker on my car and swore it wasn't them because I stopped in the pharmacy before ordering a pie which I did not after his arrogant comments. I. Will never patronize that store again and hope anybody else wouldn't either. Real jerks,"The pizza is just that good. I was skeptical originally, and then came in to test a slice. Saw them on the counter, and was like probably an overpriced place. Then the smell hit me, and was so good that I unconsciously started to salivate. And from the first bite, I was in heaven. I finished it so fast that I didn't even wait for it to cool off first, and was delighted by every second of it","Most amazing pizza on Staten Island. The cheese is under the sauce and melts in your mouth. I have had pizza, pastas& apps from here and was never disappointed. Would definitely recommend:)","Only ordered twice and it's pretty good. So far we tried the heart shaped fresh mozz (for Valentine's day) sicilian rice ball, eggplant roll, and the leonardo sicilian. Only thing I didn't like was how sweet the sauce was on the leonardo. Other than that everything was very tasty. We'll definitely be coming back!",Mona Lisa Pizzeria
463,"If you think this place has anything to offer...you need to get out of Bayonne more often ! Food- crap pure and simple. Poor quality steak, overcooked twice. Friend' sauerbraten was just terrible. Cocktails- if you can get the crabby guys attention away from his ""musician"" buddies he make a good drink. Atmosphere- it's one thing to be quaint and historic, another thing to be dirty, smelly (sewer) and sticky. Wait staff- think the girls come in for a hen party, not to work.  Tried this twice NEVER AGAIN",I feel bad having to write this review. I came in with two other family members. One of them ordered crab cakes which I would never try here but she did and some weird sauce was not in the side but poured over it. The wait staff offered to come back with another fresh order minus sauce but we were on a time limit. The other person who had the sauerbraten which she had before but this time it was swimming with the red cabbage. Looked horrible!! I stuck with the sliced steak sandwich which was average. We decided this was our last time.,"So disappointed with whomever bought this place or manages it now. It used to serve better food & pretty much catered to ones likes. Unfortunately my sister & I left this afternoon because things have changed for the worse in there. It was my go to place all the time. A staff member, who will remain anonymous, said it's just not the same & apologized. At the same time another couple walked in an asked if they could have something & the staff member had to decline them due to the owners new rules & they left very upset. Bye Hendrickson's. My family and myself won't be back.","How could you even give this place negative reviews? We ordered three appetizers and two entrees and everything was excellent. The steaks were cooked perfect, the French onion soup was homemade, and the beef tips were absolutely amazing! If you have high class NYC taste then you may want to steer clear but if you're average like most of us, then this is the place to be. Few other things to note:1) drinks were cheap 2) food was priced below the average 3) the German food was absolutely on pointWe will come again and will bring our friends.PS - We just moved here a year ago and this place reminds us of the coal regions in PA. Where we were born.","The place has an interesting vibe which is why we walked in. Our food was cold, and cheese tasted moldy. Definitely not going back here. Wish we had checked out a different place on the block, lots of cool restaurants around there.Also much like others have said here, the staff is not personable and rude.","Great Bayonne, NJ Bar & Restaurant. Good selection of beers on tap. Good solid food menu. Friendly locals.",Hendrickson's Corner
464,"I went last year and had a basic iced coffee that was flavorless. The service was awful, which is a major turn off. I can accept bad coffee, but bad service is unforgivable especially after I contacted the owner who did not seem to care at all.",This place is cute and one of the few healthy choices in Forest Ave but its employees are some of the rudest people in Staten Island. The other day one of the girls was screaming and slamming the drawers and equipment. They don't even greet you when you go to the register and if they have sth in their hands you have to wait 10 minutes until they feel like attending to you. Horrible people,Reasonably priced acai bowls and juices considering it's on Staten Island. I can imagine it being a good place to get studying/work done. Of course I had to be extra and get their Tutti Fruity bowl (which has about every fruit under the sun in it). It's basically ice cream for the health conscious.,"My mom and I stopped in here today and placed an order to go. We ordered two iced coffees with skim milk. I loved the coffee, it was so strong!We also ordered two California Crepes with turkey.Everything tasted fresh and was a light but filling afternoon meal.If you check in on Yelp you receive 10% off your order. But I only did that after paying already, while waiting for my order.Will need to save it for the next time I'm in the area!",Went in for a cup of coffee and it happened. I did have to trek my way through some wanna-be Brooklynites that would have probably thrown paint on me and told me TRUMP WAS NOT THEIR PRESIDENT.... if they saw my MAGA hat ;-)BUT NONETHELESS it was a pretty good cup of coffee. Large cost me $3 and I tipped $1 and it made me feel good.,Such a cute little coffee shop. Coffee is amazing. Great location too. Staff are super nice.

465,Good pie fast delivery. Guy on phone was patient and very polite. First nj pie I have had. Would order again,Their Sicilian pie used to be huge and delicious. I just ordered it and it's smaller and very bland with minimum cheese.

From the young lady who answered the phone and took my order to the delish chicken francese I was delighted. From phone call to delivery it was about 45 minutes, the portion was plentiful and hot unpon arrival. Highly recommend.",Wow! This place has delicious pizza! I have to say it's a bit small inside but the wait for a table is worth it! I ate here a few days ago and the Sicilian pizza was fantastic! What I really appreciate is the owner suggested  he add sauce to it since he felt it needed a little more. What I like is he cares so much about his product he wants to make sure you enjoy it.  That says a lot to me! I have been here many times and I will come here again & agin! The pizza is so good I have yet to order an entree.  Will try the eggplant parm next!!,Small restaurant with very limited and tight seating. They have some interesting names for some of their food. However I stuck with the Hawaiian and the other guy that I was with had the kitchen sink. Both pizzas looked good and tasted great. I would definitely say this was a solid place to eat and I would definitely go back if I was interested in pizza. Total for a large pizza was roughly 20 bucks. They also honored the free can with a purchase too.,Eli's Pizza Pasta
466,"Great spot for lunch and dinner! They have a nice bar side, lovely restaurant side, and there's like a private area in the back of you are interested in hosting a list dinner (my sister actually hosted her engagement dinner here). The pizzeria is on the corner of the street connected but I don't think as a customer you can walk through the kitchen to get there. I found THE sandwich to die for (I switched out the pita bread) but their penne alla vodka is absolutely exquisite.","I cant freaking believe ""side order of meatball"" almost $3 for this meatball! 1 small cold meatball  ""wth"" are they thinking. Other restaurant give you 2 or a large meatball. Smh so disappointed!!!","Who doesn't love pizza ? Pepperoni slice, delicious,Cheese slices too plain.

467,"Food was like warm and oily. Nothing that should have been crispy was. Sushi was weak. Had one guy behind sushi and hibachi. The girls that work there are very nice; but it seems to run very low budget. No need for another visit here. Food was not the best, needed more care in preparation and presentation. I'm sure I got them at the end of the night 6:30pm. Typical Chinese Buffet food, just wasn't all that.","We just left there for a Father's Day dinner. The food was really good but the reason for the 3 stars is because as of June 1st they started charging a 15% SERVICE CHARGE to help maintain the quality of service. Really??? I have never heard of this and they do it so sneaky. They have a small sign when you go to pay at the desk. Not when you first get it, not by your server or a small sign on the table (yet the push the alcoholic drink they want you to buy on the table) or even a description on your receipt. They charge you tax, service charge of 15%  and then they want you to tip on top of it. Why not just raise the prices $2.25 per person, instead of doing it so sneaky.  All I can say is beware and check your receipt!","I hope you all know, that once a month, for a $5 fee, this place allows you to twerk all over their serving tables. Apparently,  while you shake your rump in the place of which they usually put out their chicken wing trays you'll be sober AF. TWO hours for ONE long island iced tea. Literally could've drove to .L.I. in that time. Weird setup to have a club in a buffet with 2 young and frazzled bartenders overwhelmed by 70 angry, sober, mean people. Even angrier as they watch the owner step behind the bar and start to feel a sense of relief, then watch her make herself 2 drinks and run off. Never. Ever. Again. Ever.","The staff here is so friendly and nice. I also appreciate the diversity. Unlike most buffets, Wei's gives customer a bar option whether at the actual bar or drinks to order from the table. This buffet has-been here for a few years now and has really grown to be a great spot. I will say, it's best to go days that are more popular because the food will be constantly refreshed. Nothing worse than a buffet with stale food! The hibachi is also a great feature!!!","This is my favorite Chinese buffet.  The food is very good, the sushi bar has excellent choices, and the waiters are very pleasant.  The collard greens are very good but they would be éven better if they were cut up a Little bit more.

Never again.",I found a staple in my daughter's white rice and she almost choked on it.... for that reason I give this place one star.... chicken was also very hard to chew. Very disappointed !,For the last 6 years I would have given 4 stars but as of this past month I only give one star.   Did they change owners ?So disappointed.  This was the only place aside from Empire Sezuahan  I'd ever have ordered from but my last order was terrible.  Worse than that was how the owner treated me I had a delivery of 2 large wonton soups.  Their soup was the best.  But my last order was bad.  The wontons were sour tasting.  Like they may have been improperly refrigerated or sitting out in the heat.  They were inedible.    The  bags of fried noodles were stale. I was just getting over a bad flu and was dying for their soup.  I called the restaurant to tell them the soup was bad and they said I could come there to return it.  I said I ordered take out and paid a $5 gratuity to the driver for the convenience of not having to leave my house.   They asked what I wanted and I said I would br happy with only  a credit for the soup for my next order   I didn't expect them to redeliver new soup.  Just for a credit on next order.  The person on the phone said I could not get a credit.  He said the owner said I could only come into the store to return it that night.   I asked him to ask the owner if he really wanted to lose a long time customer over $9.50.  He came back on the phone and said the owner said it's ok if he loses a customer.  Lmao.  I guess he must do very well there to act so pompous but I feel that alone will stop me from ever ordering again from them.   How can they justify not offering a credit for rancid food ?   Especially to a long time customer.   Bad business.  Bad attitude.   Ione less customer  .,"The General Tso Shrimp is some of the best I've ever had. As someone who only eats fish, I tend to look for this dish everywhere I go and very few Chinese restaurants on Staten Island make it, or make it as good as Chen's Garden. I just wished they would've put scallions on it because the recipe usually calls for it. However, it was fresh and the portions are huge for the price. I then ordered their fried jumbo shrimp appetizer. I was so satisfied with the quality of the shrimp, the breading and the volume of portion, for just under $7. Last but not least, their Spicy Chili Shrimp is to die for. For $13 you get a ton of medium sized shrimp, in a carmelized pepper, onion, and carrot medley smothered in one of the most delicious spicy and sweet chili pepper sauces I've ever had.","Not much to add about this place but this little unassuming Chinese food spot is pretty good. My family has been ordering from this place for years and they've never been disappointed. Ive been inside recently and they aren't too dirty or sketch.You'll get solid dishes here. General Tso's, Egg Rolls, Fried Rice, you cant go wrong. If you're nearby and need Chinese food give em a try for a quick and cheap meal.","Chen's is a fast serving above average quality neighborhood Chinese-American take out restaurant. The food can be quite  good at times particularly for lunch, but can taper off in quality closer to closing time although this is to be expected with any restaurant.  The lunch specials and combos are reasonably priced,  with lunch coming with choice of soup or soda of which I opt for the hot and sour soup coming with generous portions of tofu, chicken and veg. Service is very quick with orders usually finished within ten minutes. If you are in the neighborhood looking for a quick bite of some good Chinese I would recommend giving Chen's a chance.",Chen's Garden II

But didn't get to try it. Well worth the money we spent. Will return and the take out is quick and fresh. Will continue to order here.","The most unprofessional delivery that I ever meet! Called them to order lunch special, the man hold me on the phone  for almost  3 min, to take the order from the people who called after me (OK I'm very patient) . Finally I started to make my order and I wanted to ad extra fries for $1 (that was an option in menu)and the man started to almost scream at me and say O MY GOD -- I asked you sop or soda, and I sad I want just FRIES!!!!! And than mean attitude continued and I HANG! How the reception phone person can afford like this attitude????????Newer will order again and will tell all friends not to do it! Now I understand why the restaurant is always empty...","I can't comment on the Japanese food, but I have been trying their chinese food for many weekends now and I have to say this chinese restaurant is probably the best in Staten Island. I typically order out here on the weekend because I am too lazy to cook, and their food are always on point. I love their Peking Pork chop, which was made with the correct peking sauce. I have tried pretty much the entire lunch menu and the quality is always good. I totally recommend this place for some delicious chinese food.",Fortune Hawaii Chinese and Sushi Restaurant

They have one of the best chicken ceaser wraps and eggplant rollitinis I ever had.,"Every time I stay in Bayonne my go to spot is Mona Lisa! The first time I had their pizza; I kept going back for that. Then I had the shrimp parm sandwich - GREAT! I also had the penne vodka (with cheese) and it comes with a piece of bread; it's a lot of food and so so good! Their Cesar salads are good as well but the dressing is kinda runny. The picture I have below is of the vegan (impossible) burger with French fries. As you can see I had to stop myself from eating more just to get a picture cause it's that good! 99% of the time I order for delivery. If you order online you get a 10% coupon and a email confirmation of when they receive your order, prepare your order and when they are out for delivery. You can also add tip to your order or too in cash. The service is pretty quick too! The one thing I wish they did is provide utensils. There has been many of times I ordered penne vodka and I didn't get a fork in the bag. Next time I'm back in Bayonne I will be ordering","I order here all the time but this time , I picked up my order and check my food. I ordered pesto salmon that's COMES with potatoes and veggies and ANY SEAFOOD DINNERS comes with pasta or salad, I chose the salad. I did not see potatoes and veggies. I got JUST the salmon and salad. I asked her where's my potatoes and veggies and she said' "" you didn't chose the potatoes and veggies "" well. I I didn't because it comes with my salmon. I'm not paying $17 just for a salmon and a simple salad. She then told me that all HOT SEAFOOD DINNERS have the option of potatoes & veggies OR pasta or salad. On the menu says "" Pesto salmon and underneath it says ( Potatoes & Veggies "" meaning it comes with it. It just doesn't make sense that only my salmon is the only one that has ( potatoes and veggies ) and it doesn't come with potatoes and veggies. And she pulled it the menu and showed me what exactly I was talking about but tried to tell me otherwise. Anyways , food overall was good but she took away my salad because I chose the potatoes and veggies lol. 2 stars for good food but she tried to make me look stupid.",Mona Lisa Pizzeria Ristorante
471,"Algarve BBQ, not to be confused with Algarve Restaurant, or Algarve Fish Market is a corner Portuguese churrasqueria on North Ave.They are a small take-out only, no-frills BBQ specializing in grilled meats served over a heaping pile of fries and rice.Unfortunately, I found it rather unsatisfactory. The prices were good and service friendly, and they seemed busy as well with orders. I went for the 1/2 combo of chicken and ribs with vegetables on the side. There was an unclean taste to the food, as you were tasting the grill, but in a bad way. I was unable to finish the food, even when drenching in hot sauce, which was a disappointment.","This place has great food, but they NEVER deliver on time. I've ordered several times and it's always a problem with the driver getting lost, being late, or having the wrong address. I've waited over an hour countless times. You would think after delivering to the same address they would not have any more issues with finding the location. Terrible customer service, and delivery. I would only recommend eating inside. I am done purchasing food from here. Update: My family has purchased food and they did not bring the correct ordered and the same women on the phone was extremely rude and accused my family of lieng. Stay clear","Worse customer service waited over an hour countless times. You would think after delivering to the same address they would not have any more issues with finding the location. Terrible customer service, and delivery. I would only recommend eating inside. I am done purchasing food from here.","They have the best French fries! Portuguese BBQ place. Chicken is juicy and yummy. The rice is amazing, its white rice with carrots and peas. Yum! The prices are very affordable. The customer service is great!","It really should be closer to 3.5 stars. Good spot for lunch in an area of limited options. I'd compare the chicken quality and taste to El Pollo Loco (for the SoCal Yelpers our there). It's an excellent value since there isn't that many quality food options in the area. Hey, at least it beats Burger King & Popeyes.","I love, love the grilled salmon from this place, must of the time I order with vegetables ( broccoli and carrots) only.The price is pretty good!

472,"Horrible food tasted like noddles that came from the microwave. Service was not all that great I had to step up more then once to the counter to ask for a simple menu. My first time here and I didn't know if the place was self seated or not and since the young lady working there was not even paying attention to us we just sat down. The Thai tea was good and I ask if I can please have another Thai tea since I already finish my first one. The lady told me "" sorry no more Thai tea you got the last one"" I was very disappointed that I couldn't even get a refill on my drink I had to drink water. I will never come here again no wonder the place is empty.","Ridiculous! Restaurant have $15 for $30 worth of casual dining deals on Groupon. Purchased it and was told they do not accept it. But, it is not the customer's fault! It's the restaurant who did not take care of the whole situation. How is this the customer's fault?! Would never go again and absolutely do not recommend!!","I don't normally rate restaurants as I try to appreciate all experiences.  I would have been completely okay with missing this one.  I bought a local flavor voucher to try this place ($15 for $30).  Long story short, I wasted $15 and 90 minutes of my time.  Here's the long story by what I ordered:Chicken satay - 4 over cooked thin slivers of chicken on skewers with peanut butter on the side.  Yes! The worst peanut sauce I have ever had House Salad - I ordered the papaya salad but settled for the house because they had none of the ingredients for the papaya salad.  The house salad was Iceberg lettuce, 4 cherry tomatoes, 2 slices of cucumber cut it have and that terrible peanut butter  claimed this time to be a dressing instead of a sauce.  BBQ pork buns - settled for this because they didn't have dumplings or lettuce wraps or spring rolls.  Flavorless bun with what tasted and looked like bbq pork you would get in a pouch. Taro custard - for some reason it took 30 minutes to cut 2 tiny squares of pre-made custard and warm it up.   It was tasty but nothing worth experiencing.  The staff is very inattentive and clearly doesn't have much experience in the food service industry.  I wouldn't come back even if someone else was paying.   Not just because of the food but because how much time was wasted","Their food is delicious. This place is a hidden gem on Stuyvesant Ave. If you're in town, I'd recommend you to try this place. You won't regret it.Fave items:1. Drunken Noodles2. Pad See Ew3. Thai steak saladand of course4. Pad Thai The food is juicy and full of flavor unlike many thai restaurants that overcook their noodles so it ends up being dry.It's a yes for me ;)","I live in town and pass by here often. I must say whenever I drive by Noodlefan, my mouth waters. Their food is delicious. I've been coming here since they opened and the taste of the food has been quite consistent. I've sampled a variety of items on their menu when they first opened however, for the past 2 years I've ordered the same thing - Drunken Noodles (less spicy) with vegetarian duck and an order of spring rolls. I used to always get the Thai coffee (DELICIOUS) but now I've been getting the Thai tea. The food is flavorful, fresh and they don't have you waiting forever while they prepare it. There's a good variety of vegan options on their menu also. Parking can be a slight challenge depending on the time of day you go, but for the most part Union has several parking lots within the vicinity- it's just a matter of parking and walking a couple of blocks to get there. The employees have always been very kind and professional and every time I go there, it has always been clean and the restroom has been very clean as well. The reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because many times when I call in to order my favorite lunch special (the meal indicated above), they are all out of spring rolls. This is very disappointing to me as it has not happened on just one occasion but SEVERAL occasions. I certainly hope they get it together in the future. I would love to update my review for them, when they do. I would definitely recommend Noodlefan to everyone.",I gave this place a five star for several reasons. When we walked in at 9:20 on a Wednesday night they smiled and happily served us. We started off with some delicious chicken wings. There were only four chicken wings in the order but it was delicious. We then moved along to some chicken Tom Yum soup's that were excellent. We paired to Tom Yum soup with a delicious beer call down shore from Icarus brewing in Lakewood. The beer has a hint of lime which perfectly brings out the lemon grass in that Tom Yum soup. After the soup I received my chicken pad Thai which was perfectly cooked. My partner in crime for the evening let's just call him Professor Micah Enjoyed his chicken green curry very much. I see myself returning with the whole family for a delicious meal and telling friends about this excellent spot. Thank you for an enjoyable meal.,Noodlefan
473,Went for lunch today Ordered a calzone to share and I ordered sausage & pepper hero Well a 1/2 hour later the calzone came it was good but not anything to write home about. My sandwich was so over toasted I couldn't even enjoy the bread The sausages were dried up and over cooked...Sorry I think this place is overrated,"They deserve zero stars. They're always late when delivery food, my orders have been messed up several times from them. They catered Thanksgiving dinner for me last year and the food was awful. Boston market makes better food and that's sad. I decided to give them another chance this summer and ordered tuna over a house salad and there was a dead fly in it. Then it took them over an hour to DELIVER ME A REPLACEMENT but the delivery guy couldn't find me So I never actually got anything from them. Stupidly Ordered again. Their Greek salad is gross, it arrived warm, the tomatoes were mushy and they didn't have GREEK DRESSING so they sent this super sweet balsamic disaster of a dressing that ruined the already mediocre salad.","They deserve zero stars.

They have nightly specials and tonight's special was bbq ribs.  They looked great and my brother in law confirmed they tasted as good as they looked.  I had the veal parm and my wife had a cobb salad.  Everything was better than average and the wait for the food was worth it after we all dug in.  They brought us out some excellent garlic rolls and some with tomato sauce on it to munch on before dinner and that was awesome as well.  Prices are about right for the area but ended up being inexpensive for the quality of the food.  I highly recommend this restaurant.","My go to place on the island for delicious large paninis that is well worth your every dime! Ordered a sausage broccoli rabe panini and although it wasn't listed on their menu, they were very accommodating in making whatever I liked. I was surprised at how large and filling the panini was. Once I saw it I giggled a little in joy where my inner hunger jumped out as a devour myself in this sandwich. Whenever we needed to cater, this would be one of the place on our list. I have had their buffalo chicken and cheese steak panini that were very memorably delicious.Like many Yelpers recommended, get the Mess! The Mess resembled sal kris deli in Astoria where the famous bomb is everyone's favorite. The mess was close to it and would satisfy my craving whenever I need to find something similar on the island!","I've been ordering from town deli for years now but never actually sat in and dined until last night. It was crowded but we were seated right away. We were brought out a basket of focaccia pizza bread which was a yummy treat we then ordered the appetizer sampler 5 wings, 5 chicken tenders, and 3 mozzarella sticks it came with honey mustard, blue cheese, and marinara dipping sauces. We enjoyed them as they were served to us hot. My husband ordered his usual chicken vodka panini with fresh mozz and extra vodka sauce on the side his all time fav. My daughter ordered the hamburger kids meal with fries it was 2 sliders which was perfect for her. Finally we did the meat lovers pie which consisted of pepperoni, ham, bacon, meatball, and sausage. Holy meat nothing was missing and for the price of $21 it could not be beat. The service was great and our waiter was sweet. Still crowed when we left after 8. We are big town deli fans and will be back to dine again soon.",Towne Deli & Pizza
474,"Did I pay $5 for a slice that looked like public school lunch? Yes.Was it worth it? No.At least the crust was crispy, but no real discernible taste otherwise.","When I ordered my plain square pizza here, it was ready quickly and the staff was friendly. The sauce on the pizza was sweet and enjoyable. However, it could use some more basil or garlic. The crust was bland. Finally, I do not understand the lack of cheese and seasoning. As many have complained, a cheese pizza comes with a tablespoon of mozzarella  sprinkled around a personal pizza. For those who don't like much cheese or flavor, this could hit the spot, but it misses the mark for me.","What the hell? Probably the worst slice of pizza I've ever had.- Looks and tastes like a 3rd grader made it- Watered down tomato sauce- Barely any cheese on the slice.. are they trying to be cute? This is not how they make it in ""the old country""...  I don't buy it.- Crust has no identity- Overpriced - $4-5 for a small paper-thin rectangular sliceThey should rename this truck ""the cardboard pizza truck"". Avoid at all costs.","You know a pizza is really good when one is not that hungry and end up eating 2 slices of pizza. Yes, I ended up eating 2 slices, the Sicilian slice was excellent, it was puffy and thick, super delicious. My taste buds were amazed and the unique flavor in the pizza crust, I don't know what they put in it, but it is actually the first time I tasted that kind of unique specific flavor in the pizza crust. It's my Yelp friends who got me into this pizza addiction thing, I now find myself tasting and paying attention the the pizza flavors, something I never paid attention to, for me, all pizzas were the same, until I started to read reviews of pizza. Who knew that pizzas were so diverse in taste. On a serious note, if you are lucky enough, to taste their Sicilian slice, I hope you can taste what I tasted, heavenly taste.","We hired Valducci's to have pizza for our guests after our wedding and they were amazing!  Mike and Margaret were incredibly easy to work with and even put our own custom labels that we sent them on the pizza boxes.  Most importantly, the pizza was delicious and all of our guests were thrilled.",Really enjoyed their Sicilian slice at the $1 slice festival. It's puffed up and the dough is soft with the cheese melted into it so that the border between the two is hard to distinguish.,Valducci's
475,"Food took forever & the to-go bag was a mess, first and last time at Cali burger, overrated.","Not only was the food overpriced but it was not good at all. My burger had 2 layers of ""gunk"" that I had to scrap off. When I told them that it was not what I ordered that did not want to change it. The burgers were dry and not very well made, the only thing that was worth it were the fries.","Waste of money!!!I went there for a quick meal, and ended up ordering a chicken burger. After waiting for 30 minutes without people ahead of me, I was given the wrong order. But, guess what? This is the second time they mess up my order. :)","If it wasn't for the food tasting amazing, I'd give this 2 or 3 stars... Whether you're going to eat inside or take out, prepare to wait about 30 minutes to get your food and maybe up to 45 minutes if it's a busy weekend (especially late night past 9pm through closing which I believe is about 4am) If you're going to order take out, definitely I recommend ordering way in advance! Alas, The food is still amazing","Heard alot of good things about Cali Burger and let me tell ya, it doesn't disappoint!  I ordered a super Cali Burger and it was enough. Had to save the rest for later. The order doesn't come with any sides, that you would need to order sperate. However, trust me when I tell you, you don't need a side. The burgers itself is huge and multiple layers of flavor ! Be ready to get into a food coma after this meal!","Is not a bad place to eat, but is not what I expected it to be. I wish they could have done a better job with the ingredients to make it as close as possible to a real Colombian burger and hot dog.",Cali Burger
476,I wouldn't recommend this place for good food. I got wings and mozzarella sticks. The wings weren't fried hard enough and had no seasoning & the mozzarella sticks were frozen before and tasted like powder. The cheese didn't even flow when you but it :(,"Nasty, over priced, non authentic Italian pizzeria! The place is out dated and the food on display looks old! Nothing tasted fresh... save your money or go else where!","Never ever ever again!Ordered for delivery and the guy taking my order was so rude. They sounded busy so I took that in stride.Then we received our delivery and two items were missing. I called to let them know figuring they could just deliver the missing items.Nope. A girl answered the phone and after asking me if I ""opened the box"" to check she tried to charge me for the items I already paid for.I explained that I did not want to place another order I only wanted my missing items.  She called back 4-5 more times questioning me, each time I thought the issue was resolved and they would bring me my food. Instead I got repeatedly questioned to the point that I gave up and told them to just forget about the food. The food we did receive wasn't even good. Wish I could give less than 1 star.",My favorite place for pizza and calzones! The food is always good and fresh and the owner is a gentleman!

477,I have no clue why there is good reviews of this place .I gave them a trial on their pernil for an upcoming event . I am so glad that I decided to do the trial a week prior to the event.  Horrible is an understatement.  I placed an order which I had to pay in full upon them taking the order.  I asked for the pernil to be left whole.  When my daughter brought it was only shredded meat.  NO flavor at all and dry.  I bought 2 pasteles to try them .. we both spit it out.  I called them because I was hopeful that this was a special order for someone else as I specify that I needed the pernil Very well season but sadly this is how they cook their pernil.. Sadly discarded the tray,"First off watch your bill and ask to see it before you pay. I was charged for an extra drink we didn't have. Be sure to ask for an opener for the glass bottles as some won't open easily and there are no openers on the tables. The food takes a bit of time to come out which is ok if they make some parts as you order. There isn't a lot of seating and when it is crowded it is a little tight. As for the food, the rice was the best part. I didn't eat my pollo guisado for one because i hate it made with chicken breast (my fault for not reading the sign) but besides that it was barely flavorful. We also has the fried cheese which literally was pulled from fryer and dumped straight on the banana leaf so all the grease was just puddled on it. The empanadas were not the worse I had but there was no flavor or anything in them. Ground beef and potatoes and just shredded chicken. A bit boring for me.  Tostones had no salt or anything on them and were barely warm. I didn't eat the disco fries but my husband says they were extremely salty and he couldn't even eat them. Literally left the bowl there barely touched and a waste of $10. Overall I might be back to try some of the other stuff but I highly doubt I would buy anything I already had ever again if I do go back.","Mofongo with pork, food was excellent a little pricey compared to other Puertorrican restaurants but the taste was good. The mofongo was fresh. Our only complaint is the music they played it was totally offensive and dirty. The lyrics were about explicit sex and body parts....horrible my 12 year old daughter asked me at one point "" what chichando means in the culo?"" It was disgusting. The table next to us were embarrassed and commenting about the rap the restaurant was playing. The other bad complaint was the ladies serving were dressed provocative with low tight shirts and Licea pants...suggestive specially with the kind of music playing. We're not going back. Is a shame, because the food was good. This is how places go down! They should change the music from reggaetón and trapp to good Spanish music. This place is good for take out! Not eating in.","Recommended by a friend who lives nearby, decided to try it on a random Tuesday night. Though most people seem to do take-out we decided to eat there.

Hopefully they get it fixed the next time i crave chicken and waffles so i can re-review this place,The fried chicken and teriyaki mixed veggies is ALWAYS on point. Haven't disappointed yet!,Most ignorant people working there.  All have a very bad attitude.  Every person who worked there were all rude.  I would definitely go to a different location than here.  Maybe hire some people that are nice and welcoming.,The fried chicken is outstanding.  One of if not the best in the area.  I get the teriyaki without the sauce and I really enjoy it.  The prices are good here and the food is consistently top notch.,"I ordered via Seamless for pick-up on a Sunday afternoon. My order was ready right on time. They fry your chicken to order.Their Fried Chicken's nice and moist while the outside's crispy. It's good but batter could use more seasoning besides salt and pepper or they can offer another flavor option like that.Then their Waffles might have gotten steamed in transit since they were a little on the soggy side. Otherwise, they tasted okay.For sides, their Vegetables were good with a faint soy flavor while their Coleslaw's pretty good but on the wetter side. Then their Biscuits have a nice texture, but I'd actually like more butter/moisture.I'd visit again if they address some of these issues, especially the flavoring of their fried chicken batter.TIPS:**Parking's easy in a small shared lot on the corner of Stuyvesant Ave. and Kay Ave.**Wheelchair-accessible**Genderless restroom","Okay food. Chicken and shrimp with brown rice and corn was okay. Teriyaki sauce was topical generic Japanese sauce. I would say this is good for take out if you are hungry, nothing special I found. I think I can even cook better than this, which is not saying much since I don't cook often. One guy cooking and lady taking orders and answering phone. Fried chicken was okay.

479,Ordered a chicken francese hero from here and I could not even eat it. The francese sauce had no hints of lemon and tasted more like a chicken Marsala sauce. It was so gross I took 2 bites and threw the hero out because of how awful the sauce tasted. The chicken was very chewy. The chicken fingers that I ordered were very well done and dry. I order from here because it is convenient and close to home.

I arrived at 8:25 and was told it was in the oven and needed another 5 minutes because I asked for It well done. But then 10 minutes later, my pie was still in the oven and 10 minutes later it was still in the oven. I know they gave my first pie , possibly the second one to another customer and the delivery guy was in and out twice while I waited too, So they may have given it to him.I was so disappointed at being strung along and forced to wait 45 minutes for a pie I had been told was in the oven for over twenty minutes and I know I was actually lied to by both the counter help and the chef that although the food is usually better than , the pizza place down the block, I will give J & R another try , as giving my pie away possibly twice was really really really not cool!!!","Eek you're correct. I happen to live in the neighborhood, and its a nice pizzeria (I stop by at least once a week). Yesterday, I bought 3 regular slices, went home, and after I ate the 1st one, I noticed a DEAD COCKROACH IN THE BOX!!!.. I immediately ran tthrew the 2 slices in the garbage. I thought about calling, I decided I will call today. So I called and told the girl that answered the phone, she said thank you, I told her that is NOT good enough, I want to speak to a manager that's is just grossed. I speak to MAXIMO that says ""I dont what to say"", so I told him, the 1st thing you say, Its I'm very sorry!, he said oh yes, its that I dont know what to say, this is the 1st time, I told him I am 47 yrs. old and this is a 1st for me, and where there's 1 roach there is hundreds! He annoyed me by his response, so I told him, not a problem, since he doesnt know what to say, I will just report them for an inspection.NEVER AGAIN! AND NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE OF THE COCK ROACH, BUT BECAUSE HE DID NOT WHAT TO SAY AND DIDNT SAY MUCH!","Love this place.  Moved from Brooklyn a few years ago, and this is the only pizzeria that reminded me of the old neighborhood.  Everything I've tried here was great, my personal favorites being their grandma slice, Penne slice, Margherita slice and the all the rolls!

480,"Drinks were good, beautiful decor, service is great but the food is below average.   We did not enjoy our dinner at all !   People at the bar cursing while families with children were trying to enjoy dinner.    Won't be going back - sorry!","2 rounds Sangria, 3 Appetizers, 4 Entrees, 4 Coffees, 1 desert  1 cordial .... $300 ...including  tip ... Crazy ...    Mediocre service ... Small portions ... Luke warm food I can find better food and service  in the area for less money","From the Portuguese sausage appetizer to the T-bone steak and pork cubes and clams. I would say this place had very good food but the service goes a long way. They have an additional parking lot across the street. The service threw me off which made me give them a 3 star rating. Server came off very rude, no smiles or an excuse me when placing the plates. This place wasn't as friendly as I would've hoped especially since the server looked like upper management. How do you give a customer to go boxes without any bags? On another note, go for the food if your willing to deal with poor service.",The food .  is great. Yuma the bartender is the best In the area. Her drinks are amazing. If I could give this restaurant a 10 I would.,"Best Bartender on the East Coast!  Great food . I always feel welcome. The owners come around to make sure everyone is okay,  whether you're sitting at a table or at the bar. I recommend trying the strawberry Capahena.","I've been wanting to try this place for quite some time now. It's a  restaurant with excellent service. I had the lobster bisque, which although it was slightly thin in texture, the flavor was absolutely delicious, so good I forgot to take a pic until I was done. I also had the garlic chicken which was an appetizer as my main meal. No carbs other than the bread. The service was excellent, our server was very knowledgeable of the menu as well as friendly and had a great personality. The restaurant itself is beautiful, it's great for groups as well as a great date spot. I have to go back again when I'm able to drink and my diet isn't limited. But for now I was extremely satisfied with both the food and the service, the only downfall was the limited parking, but as always we made it work!",Vinhus Restaurant & Lounge

I had issues with quality of food at Applebee's before, like stakes of grey color.Eating there is like a playing a Russian roulette, hit or miss, would not go there if I had a choice.What are they doing with food to keep costs down?Is it food???? OR plastic salad?This is no way to conduct a restaurant.",The service won me over here!Our waitress Shalalala truly our did herself. From the minute we sat down she was highly attentive and friendly. We had questioned her about a paste that was recently changed in the menu and she was knowledgeable as to what it was changed for. This waitress was honest with choice preferences and we truly liked that. Furthermore we express how we were in a rush due to movie tickets we purchased next door and she assured our food would be our on the along with the bill. She also came by sufficient times to assure my family and I were good. I got the chicken tender and fries since we were in a rush. Can't really go wrong with that choice. It was cooked just right. Bartenders were on a roll. My frozen margarita and husband's drink came out quicker then expected. Totally recommend people to come here before heading to the movies.,"Honestly, did not expect much from this shopping mall restaurant. We were seated promptly and server came and took our orders, everything was fine.The appetizers came and we had no silverware. Had to ask server for them. Waited about another 20 minutes and the entrees arrived.I got the steak and that's when I realized she never asked how I wanted my steak cooked.......it was cooked almost well done- there was like a tinyyyy pink part. But again didnt expect much  they probably would've overcooked it even if i asked for medium.I also asked for the two sides to be mashed potatoes and fries cause I hate the soggy broccoli. But....it came with the broccoli. She was super nice about it though and brought out a small plate of fries for us quickly.We payed on the little touchscreens on every table which were super convenient!","It had been  years since we were ""eating good in the neighborhood"" so when we came across this Applebee's, we decided to give them a try.There are lots of 1 and 2 star reviews here but our experience was ""A-OK"".  We were here on a weeknight around 5 p.m.  Our server was prompt in getting to us plus he was polite and efficient.  For dinner, I ordered ""cedar salmon"" which consists of: ""maple glaze"" and  comes with 2 sides of your choice.  I chose baked potato and roasted summer veggies.  Surprisingly, the salmon was properly cooked, tender and moist.  The maple glaze didn't really register, though.  The summer veggies were nicely grilled.My husband ordered ""fish and chips"" which comes with fries and cole slaw.  He liked it all and had no complaints.Our son-in-law ordered the 6 oz. top sirloin and got broccoli and mashed potatoes for his sides.  He enjoyed his dinner and said his steak was cooked to the requested temperature.Our food came to our table in a timely fashion so no complaints about the kitchen.  While our food didn't have that wow factor, it was just fine.We would consider going once more if we stay in the Jersey Gardens area again.",Applebee's Grill + Bar
482,"Terrible. 3 of us wanted to kill time before a flight. 2 people ordered the $30 filet medallions, one asked for rare the other med-well, both came out burnt char crisps. The server was so terrible anytime we needed something she acted like we were bothering her, even to get a refill on water. The burger I ordered sat under the window so long all the cheese melted off the top of the burger on to the sides of the bun. Terrible flavors. Terrible spot, save your money and save your time in Newark Airport for any other place, even the grab and go kiosk had better service.",Terrible service. Even worse food. Waitress sounded like we had somehow disrupted her day. We asked for 2 items on the menu but she repeated the order 3 times and then went on to say we had confused her:) will get a dunkin donut instead next time.,"Service was fine, but the food was really really bad.  Dinner salad was brown and wilted.  Ordered well done burger and it had burnt taste on outside but near raw inside.  Save your money and keep walking!","If you would have told me that I could have found a healthy and delicious meal at the airport I wouldn't have believed you. All of my doubts were dispelled at Tony Roma's! I went with the mojo chicken which came with a large piece of grilled chicken breast and a delicious and fresh tropical salsa with lots of mango, pineapple, tomato and jalapeno. Everything was served alongside a bed of wild rice and steamed broccoli. The entree was $17 which isn't far off from grabbing something less healthy from the food court. Wine made the meal pricey...a 9oz glass of cabernet was also $17. But usually prices like this are expected at an airport. If you are flying in Terminal A there is only one sit down food and drink option past security. It can get very crowded. If you have some time to kill and want to sit and relax with food and a drink then a solid option is to hit Tony Romas before going through security.",The dining choices in and around terminal A are pretty limited.  I figured that I could get a descent meal here.  I arrived for an early lunch and the place was somewhat empty.  Sat at the bar and the experience was a ok.   I had a burger and it was good.  Nothing really to write home about but it satisfied the craving.  The service was ok.  Usually sitting at the bar meals a lot of banter. This experience was different.   Not a ton of banter but a little here and there.  All in all there was nothing spectacular about my experience.  Not a ton of options in terminal A.,"Tony Roma's inside the Newark Airport around Terminal A, right before security check in. So if you want to grab a quick bite with family/ friends before you head inside you could totally one here. The wait might be a little long because there are only a few waitresses to take your order. If your in a rush than probably wouldn't suggest this spot. We ordered a hamburger and a steak and mushroom flatbread from here. It took about 20 minutes to get our food and it was pretty much what the menu has said about it. The flatbread had a lot of flavor and the blue cheese was very overwhelming. Also some of the pieces were a little bit on the burnt side. The hamburger was pretty tasty and if you want to customize it you can! We didn't want to eat bread so we said no buns and they made it that way. Tip- Know how much time you have before you need to go to your gate so you can gauge yourself if you could eat here! But overall it's an easy menu to read and pretty large selection of food!",Tony Roma's
483,"Workers are horribly rude. They can't talk on the phone and do pick-up. My daughters say ""can we go to another diner. This one is too depressing and it's always empty"". Haha they're right. Poor business etiquette. Garbage food. Depressing atmosphere.","Food is good, that's my reason for going back.  Took friends for lunch and the waitress was agitated and annoyed.  I was afraid to ask for a refill of soda, she literally stood by table with an angry look as we ordered.  It happened two more times with different waitresses.  They were annoyed with the job and complained.  Again, I was afraid to ask for extra napkins or cole slaw.  I always leave there liking the food but upset with the service.",Guy on the phone hung up on me when I asked about my delivery that never arrived. Called back and he put me on hold. Called again to cancel and he just said ok. Mike's place is an embarrassment,The sweet potato fries and the mozzarella cheese  burgers are the best in town :)!! The vodka paninis are must try,We stopped in here for a quick dinner before a wake we were going to on Staten Island. We were greeted by a friendly staff and were taken to a large booth in the corner. The waitress was friendly and took our drink orders very quick. I had a bacon cheeseburger deluxe. It was excellent. A nice sized burger grilled to perfection. My son had a chicken wrap. He loved it because he ate the whole thing and said it was very good. The waitress was very kind to my daughter who has autism and even gave the kids cookies when we left. I would definitely recommend this establishment. We will be back any time we are on the Island again. Thanks.,"I'm not a fan of Mikes Diners in general but they serve a purpose. My love for an ordinary Grilled Cheese Sandwich and Pickle. This is for when I don't want to have to think about food. This was my first time to this Mikes. It was clean, waitress was friendly and attentive. It always so pricy for a 2* dinner who's food is just premade stuff in the freezer and reheated. My basic grilled cheese was burned. It left an awful bitter burner flavor. When you pay $6 for a craft singles piece of yellow melty cheese between 2 pieces of griddled bread with no sides and you burn it? Come on they should have never let this leave the kitchen. I ordered a side of Sweet Potato Fries. Delicious, shoestring crispy sweetness. They even reheated at home that night when I had the leftover fries. The Egg Bacon Sandwich was tasty and hit the spot. Nothing else to report. I have no need to come back here. It served a purpose the day I went. Make sure you get the sweet potato fries",Mike's Place
484,"10 minutes for the Swedish meatballs? The one iconic dish IKEA is known for and they run out?.... the lunch crowd is getting restless. Dining room not cleaned since the breakfast crowd passed through, tables not wiped down. Ice machine not operational so diners are forced to get ice from a less than sanitary plastic trough using a slotted pot spoon...really? Everything from the meatballs to the salmon salad appears smaller, mash instead of young potatoes, over cooked broccoli and beans with the meatballs which just taste different. Fountain drinks watered down to the point of utter tastelessness.Big push on plant based items like vegan ""meatballs"" and vegetarian burritos With talk of IKEA food labs and stand alone cafes opening in select markets they will have to up their game substantially to make a go at it...... Too bad actually, yet another era has passed.","Rated only on all you can eat Swedish Easter Buffet for $12.99The event took place on Friday April 5th from 6pm to 8pm.The Smorgasbord included the following:Cold selection had different herrying varieties, deviled eggs w/shrimp, smoked salmon w/mustard sauce, cheese, cucumber salad, red potato salad, Lingonberry jam and a variety of breads. Hot selection had poached salmon, meatballs, mashed & boiled potatoes, gravy, Jansson's temptation and ham.Also there was assorted Swedish desserts & cookies with fountain & hot beverages included.The standing in line, then taking the cold items onto your tray that were already portioned out and then from there to the cooks on the cooking line to serve you like cafeteria style what you wanted was not my cup of tea. All of the food that was offered was either their frozen food that they heated up or refrigerated prepared foods that they removed from their packaging that they sale normally there or to customers to take home. I was just a bit disappointed with the quality, taste, selection and the set up of the food. I am undecided if I would do the buffet again or not.","This IKEA has fallen from grace. You used to be able to get latte, americano, & cappuccino here for free. Now they cost $1.25 each, and you have to go through the hassle of buying tokens for them. On top of that, their regular coffee was out when I visited, and the only other option was a decaf coffee that taste staled and watered down, no flavor what so ever. I don't like wasting drinks, but I couldn't bring myself to finish it.","Always a fan of IKEA restaurant - cheap food but actually really good!! The seating area is plentiful and clean (most of the time). There's rarely a wait for the food line and the drinks are on the outside so you can go back and forth for drinks if you need. I know if you're part of the IKEA club you get a free cup of coffee here. The staff here aren't very interactive or nice but hey, all you do is really grab what you want and pay for it at the cashier- that's it. Definitely grab food if you're in IKEA, but I wouldn't say just come to IKEA for the food unless you're craving their meatballs!!!","How could you go to Ikea, and NOT get Swedish meatballs with the brown gravy on top! Oh and let's forget the mash potatoes...yum yum yum, yes I know it's probably all frozen, and it's cafeteria style, and you need to carry your own tray to the table like you're in High School, but it's all part of the experience! It's like going to Coney Island & not eating a hot dog from Nathan's. Some things you just have to do when you're there, especially since I'm not much of a IKEA fan, so the few times every five years that I go, I must have the meatballs.","Grimey. Hairy wheels on dining carts - literally hairballs on every single cart wheel. The meatballs were great as usual, however the Seasonal vegetables (cauliflower and carrots) were still frozen in the middle.Oh - and the soda machines are more carbonated than usual - 3/4 of the glass is foam!",IKEA Restaurant
485,"Walked into ""The Square"" after hearing they now sell individual slices. My first impression was a very dead atmosphere.. The place just felt ghostly in a way.I ordered the slice regardless and within minutes had a reheated square slice.I took a bite and rather than impose upon the innocent young girl doing her job, I chose to throw it away and chalk it off as a bad experience.Place needs to either close their doors, or take their business seriously.","Now this place apparently (street tale) has a war with L&Bs. This pizza should never be compared to Spumoni Gardens infamous pizza as you can see from the picture. I removed the overly sweet sauce to expose what looks like sliced cheese, which I know was not mozzarella. $22 for a pie, I should be paid to eat it. Very disappointing and I can't even offer a good review for their service as she didn't ask if we needed anything else, nor ask if we wanted a box for the 12 slices left on the table. Don't even get me started on the blandest mini rice balls I've ever had. If you were thinking of trying this pizza, DON'T, unless you've lost a bet. Rating 0/5.","This place is disgusting and the owner is a nasty S.O.B. Literally disgusting. There were flies all over and a hair in my wife's food. When I told the owner he looked at me like I had 10 heads and didn't take it off the bill. Go to pizza parlor instead. Much better, bigger menu, and the staff is awesome. Can't see The Square staying in business that much longer .","I've heard about the square many times and how it resembles spumoni Gardens so I figured, why not. Pizza got delivered in about 35 minutes and much to my surprise the pizza was better than I thought..Definitely taste like money garden with a nice soft crust. Would definitely order again and get my seal of approval.","The square is the best. Food is so delicious, there has not been one thing that I ordered that I did not like. The counter girl Gabriella was very nice and the service was fast.  I highly recommend the square.","Love, Love the pizza! Better then L & B. It's lighter & more crispier. And now we're hooked on the chicken fingers. Can't wait for their new menu to come out.",The Square
486,Simple menu with quick service. Place was clean with a number of little tables. I had a bowl which was tasty. Not enough for leftovers but enough for the price. I would come here again.,"The food is good, but a bit overpriced for the portion sizes. I paid almost $12 just for a whole wheat shrimp + veggie wrap.","Very hospitable. Owner was sitting when we first arrived.  It was our first time there, last time I was there was, it was a muscle maker grill. The owner mentioned that was still run by the same management as MMG, but that she revamped the menu with better options. I have to honestly say I wasn't that impressed with my meal ( shrimp fajita). Food did not taste fresh (canned) , aside from the shrimp. I ordered a burrito but instead got a bowl. They did offer to change it but I really hate returning food back into the kitchen. I thought the dishes were more on the pricey side. I don't mind paying for quality but this place was definitely not worth their inflated prices !","If you haven't eaten here do yourself a favor and go!!! The house sauce is probably one of the best sauce's I have ever had! So good, I became obsessed! They need to bottle the house sauce up and sell it, ASAP !",I have been ordering from Mamichi's for well over 5 years. They never disappoint. Burger burrito is by far my favorite dish! Staff is very friendly and courteous.,"Great option for a healthy lunch. Their homemade balsamic glaze is delicious. I ordered the vegetarian balsamic rice bowl with brown rice. The rice was fluffy and the vegetable cooked perfectly. Owner was really nice and added chickpeas, cucumber, lettuce and broccoli to the bowl. It was delicious! I wished they had portobello mushroom, it would have been perfect and I hope the owner considers adding tofu or another meat substitute. All in all, I would come here again.",Mamichi's Grill
487,What's up with this place?It's like they take an ad out in the paper looking for the most arrogant rude nasty people to work there.You go there to spend your money and the employees are the rudest.God forbid if you interrupt them with an order .You will get sighs and faces / eyes rolling if you ask a question or order something . Giving them two stars because the food is good but employees couldnt care less,"La Bella is awesome until you realize how much expired goods they peddle.  Been coming for a while and really like the selection but it's just not worth risking food poisoning .. third time this has happened.. first time was somewhat my fault. Bought an onion focaccia that was expired and I didn't check the date (shouldn't have been on the shelf though to be honest). Second time a sour sausage with parsley and cheese ring that was bad a day before the sell by. Today is the last straw.. Today is August 8th and I purchased manicotti that has a sell by date of August 9th.. inedibly sour. At first I tried to make excuses and said to myself maybe they used a different cheese even though the manicotti itself was sweating and slimy. Went through the hassle of cooking it in the oven to warily take a bite into it to find it had tasted like it was made with ten year aged blue cheese. Expired dates is one thing. Selling products with a sell by date past the actual expiration date is downright dangerous. Does someone need to get seriously ill before La Bella management does something about this? Scour through the yelp reviews. I'm far from the only one. This is a repeat issue and they clearly don't take it seriously. Go by the ""fresh""pasta section and I guarantee you'll find something either growing mold or past its date. Wake up.",Shop here all the time the only problem is Deli workers ..They are so rude they get annoyed and roll their eyes the most unfriendly staff ever ...One day I heard a worker speak so nasty to an elderly person they need to either be nice or be fired ....If it wasn't for deli staff I would have definitely gave 5 stars,"Great Italian market with weekly sales and some fun imports. Freshly made doughs and cheeses are available daily and some of the best fresh pasta and meats you can get. Some of the prices area bit wild at times, but quality is always top notch. Try the fresh Mozz, house made sauces and soups. You won't regret it.","La Bella gets a rating that's right down the middle, for now. The place is huge and has literally every Italian product you could imagine and even stuff you won't find in any other Italian market around. As big as this place is you have to pay close attention to the expiration dates on everything. While looking around I saw more than a few things that had been expired.Besides that the variety in this store is unreal. Nothing around has this big of a variety. All kinds of cheeses, meats, prepared foods, and everything else you'd find in an Italian American market. The prices aren't too bad either.","Shopping at LaBella for about 6 months and because of the wonderful customer service that Cesar, one of the store managers , Vinny  mgr from the deli and the fish manger , (forgot his name) I will continue to shop at Labella. Thanks guys!!!!!Everyone needs to take a page from your book.",La Bella Marketplace
488,"This is a top notch pizza place in the area. You can tell from the reviews that people who LOVE pizza rate this consistently 4-5 stars. It's a 5. Why? Well first of all, because I said so. But also because the balance of cheese, gravy and crust are BANG-ON. The low rated reviews are a scream. It always amazes me when people rate a NJ Pizza place low because they were spoken to in a rude way! Did you read ""Yesenia's"" review??? LOL!!!!! It's NJ. IT'S. A FREAKIN PIZZA PLACE!!  If you want to be coddled, go see a guidance counselor at your local board of education.

This place is your standard New York/North Jersey hole-in-the-wall pizza joint. It's not a sit down restaurant. It's a place to get a decent pie. Keep in mind: ""standard pizza"" in this area is no joke. Anywhere else in the United States and it would be ""Phenomenal"" or ""Incredible"". People from this area don't mess around when it comes to pizza. I ordered a sausage pie. The toppings were generous. The sauce was very good and the crust was just right. ( not too thick or thin.) It wasn't over cooked or under cooked. ""Goldilocks Pizza"". Just right. I've eaten at a bunch of these shops in this area and this is as good as it gets.","I'm a born and bred New Yorker, I've lived in NJ for almost ten years now.

I can't remember the last time I had pork fried rice as part of a lunch special that had more than an occasional speck of fatty pork in it, but at Red Apple there were actually pieces of tasty lean pork in the rice! You can even see them in the picture! I'm looking forward to going back for another good meal. Check it out!","Decided to try them out today because they always pop up on Yelp. The place is one building but on one side it's a traditional Chinese takeout spot and on the other side is a hibachi grill. I ordered the chicken teriyaki with vegetables and white rice, the jalapeño steak quesadilla and a pork egg roll. First let's address the jalapeño steak quesadilla. Why would someone order a quesadilla at a Chinese spot you ask? Sheer curiosity lol. And I'm so glad I did... it was delicious! The steak was very tasty and the tortilla was buttery and please just do yourself a favor and order it. The chicken teriyaki was really good too especially with the yum yum sauce. Only thing I didn't care for was the egg roll, the flavor was off. I'll definitely be a repeat customer.",The chicken teriyaki was delicious.

I have a weak stomach.  So much so that after this experience with these young 20 something year old kids making my food I can no longer have foot unless it is prepared in front of me.   THERES NO TELLING HOW LONG THAT SOUR CREAM OR THE CHEESE SITS OUT FOR.   ESPECIALLY ON A DAY WHEN THE REALFEEL TEMPERATURE WAS 110 degrees.  BOYCOT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!",The customer service is horrible.  The food is cold and every time I go they never have enough food to complete an order.  Either they have no brown rice and want you to take whatever they have left.  The portion size is a joke compared to all other Chipotle Restaurants in the City.  Salads are expensive and they barely want to give you anything for your money.  It's really a shame since this is the first Chipotle on the Island.  The service is so bad that I pay a toll and go to the Chipotle on 86th street instead.  The workers are poorly trained and are really making the Chipotle franchise look bad.  Take my advise and don't waste your time and money.  I am giving them 1 star cause I don't have a choice,First chipotle on Staten Island. Whoo hoo!! They just opened so def clean and fresh. I hope they keep it that way! We shall see! I got a bowl and it tasted fresh! They are a little stingy though with everything. Usually whenever I get a bowl in the city locations they pack the bowl to the very top and more! But this time there was a lot of space left over lol. All the ingredients tasted fresh though which is a plus always!! I will be returning frequently lol I will update this next time!,"When I am really hungry and know I don't need to do too much after, I come to chipotle. Their food makes me feel very heavy, so I rather not get a burrito if I know I still have a lot of work to do. Anyway, this place makes the burritos the way they should be like. I'm actually little surprised in only got 2 stats. My visits here always were ones that satisfy me, and tasted good. The thing with burritos is that only when you are half way you really get to know if the mix came up well. For me it is not each one individually. But the mix of all that makes that final taste that when it is good makes a good burrito.","Great food, slightly limited selection. If your looking for one of the best burritos, come here. If your looking for a quesadilla, you're out of luck.",Chipotle Mexican Grill
493,"Unfortunately this delivery from cafe con pan was not the best. The guacamole and chips had no flavor, absolutely bland. You'll probably get better guacamole from chipotle. I ordered the huevos rancheros and it was the worst thing I have ordered. I wish I would've taken a pic of the plate. 3 soggy corn tortillas with some black beans 3 slices of grilled ham and eggs with chunks of cojita cheese. Sooo dry and just plain, since when does this plate have ham or any type of meat?  I was unable to eat this because I don't eat meat. There was no onions no salsa...NOTHING. They forgot to send the green sauce so I couldn't even throw it on top. After ordering from them every Friday. I think this is the time to take a break from them. Not to mention it's not like my family orders under $20. Our orders are always over $50 with a good tip. We order regularly, even twice a week. they should pay more attention to all deliveries going out and not just throw food on the plate and send it out.","I ordered delivery on Seamless and it was delivered quickly! But I'm not in love with the food. I ordered chicken enchiladas verdes and a carnitas quesadilla. My food was pretty cold and I wanted to reheat but they put iceberg lettuce under the cheese on my enchiladas. No one likes hot iceberg lettuce :( The chicken inside the enchiladas was sadly dry and the tortillas were dry too. Carnitas were better but still not great. On the plus side, my food was packed neatly and it included salsa (verde and roja), silverware and napkins. Neither salsa was very flavorful however. Disappointing because this is the only traditional Mexican place that delivers nearby.",Me and my family have came here many and I mean many times and back then they have really good food everything was good and it will not take long to get food here but when I came in yesterday it was a nightmare we have ordered tacos me and my girlfriend I remember asking for 3 each and I end up getting two was no problem for me I didn't care but what I care how small they were they were a small and I mean small for a child like a 5 year old child and I never remember them being this small they had no taste didn't have enough meat it look like it was cook 3 days ago and just no taste at all and also had yellow rice and no flavor I it was just bad but I also had cooks they were selling I open them and started to eat them and my girlfriend told me something look wrong with those cooks and I spit them out and they had like black mold and I feel so sick and I look at the rest of them and they had black mold and I wanted to throw up I was spitting them up it was just black mold keep coming out and I told them about it and did nothing about it they just give me my dollar back didn't even get a sorry I am sorry to say I will not come back here,"My go to taco place that never let's me down! Friendly service to good Mexican food, what more can a person ask for.",Tacos were delicious!  Ordered from them 2 days in a row! I hope they keep up the good work and don't change. Delivery was quick. Horchata is great too. Authentic Mexican hands down.,"Authentic and delicious for a very good price !A hidden gem that looked like a deli and convenience store from the outside but an actual authentic cafe from the inside. Ordered two tacos large size for the value - chorizo and spicy pork. Couldn't help myself but to get a churro since it was calling for me on top of the counter. Tacos were freshly made and stuffed with delicious meat. Churro was very good for $1! I will be back to try burritos, Tortas and whatever they have to offer !",Cafe Con Pan
494,"I've come here a few times. The bagels are good, the prices are reasonable. However, today I ordered two bagels. One with cream cheese, one without- my bagel with cream cheese had two hairs in it. This bagel place should probably wear hair nets and hats while prepping food, that was absolutely disgusting. Also I feel like the girls who prep the food are a little rude, so I'll be taking my business elsewhere.","Was coming here for years. And recently they started digging prices out of their nose. $5.50 for a plain bagel with egg and cheese. A bit overpriced. And when I hear the guy next to me being charged $3.99 for a bagel, bacon, egg and cheese I stopped coming here.","Down right horrible, I am never taking my money here again, despite being a loyal customer for years on end. My grandmother was having a party today and saw this advertisement for their Express Bagel Breakfast catering service. It included 2 dozen assorted bagels, 3 lbs. of cream cheese (2 regular, 1 flavored), butter, and jelly for a price of $49.99 + tax. Yesterday, she ordered this and was supposed to pick it up today, but while she was ordering she was confused because the employee told her she couldn't cut them in quarters like it was advertised in the pamphlet they created and printed. They can only cut them in half. Alright, no big deal. Today she goes to pick them up and the same woman forgets the entire order. Then she asks if it's okay she puts the bagels in a bag. A bag? You advertise a platter of 2 dozen bagels, why are they going in the bag? They said it would be $20 extra, but instead they only put one dozen on the platter and the other dozen in a bag and charged her $10 extra for putting it on a platter. They also only included 1/2 lbs. of cream cheese and no butter, jelly, or the other 2.5 lbs. of cream cheese that we paid for. This is false advertisement and a disgrace to loyal customers who have been coming for years. Don't advertise something that's not the truth !! $60 for 2 dozen bagels and half a pound of cream cheese. Disgusting and disappointing, and should have cancelled the order when she asked for $10 extra.","Obsessed with this place!  Great prices, excellent bagels!  I only get out this way a couple times a year and always stop here sandwiches","Great place. Dont understand all the horrible reviews. They have an awesome selection of bagels, definitely worth stopping by.",I feel this place would be good if they would just get my order correct.  Been here three times in a month and ordered the same breakfast egg sandwich and something went wrong or missing of what I asked while I was sitting in car about to chow down.  Yeah I accepted and went back.  Thought this place is so busy but they can make it right next time I go.   Nope.  Instead of watching them make it next time I just try another place.  I like this place too.  But for the life of me I don't understand how difficult can it be to make the easiest egg sandwich in the world.,Manor Bagels & Superette
495,"Service was fair. Ordered typical Staten Island diner breakfast. Coffee was burnt and un drinkable. Waiter did brew another pot and was acceptable.Breakfast meats ( bacon, sausage, ham) were low quality and had no flavor. Potatoes also had no flavor. Toast was burnt. Still waiting for refill on my water....","The food is ok but they screw up the orders the place isn't that clean, the bathrooms are underprepared and dirty, my father ordered orange juice and gave him pineapple juice and the place is understaffed, terrible in my opinion, the staff seem to be a bit clueless about there menu, on their menu it says gluten-free pasta and they didn't have it, if you're eating here and have an allergy to certain foods be careful they might make it a different way, and lastly the place was a bit overpriced for a diner",Extremely inattentive service.  Staff is more interested in their iPhones than their customers.,"The decor is really dated..like 1980's Staten Island/Bensonhurst type furniture that's pretty worn out. Think ""The Golden Girls"" style. Aside from the decor, the service was excellent. The waiter was friendly and attentive. The food was brought out in a timely fashion. I had a Greek Salad with grilled shrimp. It was very good. My only issue is that the tomatoes weren't ripe. They were that bland, washed out color of tomatoes that have no taste. Everything else was well seasoned and fresh. As another reviewer mentioned, the pickles are fantastic!! Better than any diner I've dined at in years. My companion had a bacon, egg and cheese wrap which looked delicious and she thorough enjoyed. I would definitely return here.","This was one of the saddest excuses I have ever experienced. I'm pretty sure the only reason why it's in business is because it's located in Staten Island and options are limited. With that being said, this is a famous place an my basing my experience on the lunch I received. I'm sure the breakfast is delightful. Maybe I picked the wrong place to sit and chose the worst thing on the menu.I ordered the Staten Island Cheesesteak. It's a cheesesteak, but would be the kind that a true Philadelphian would expect from Staten Island. Cold hero bread, steak ems grilled, not even chopped up, with square cheese melted on top. Needless to say it was not very good.The fries were pretty delightful. But the pickles, the pickles were out of this world fantastic! Whoever makes these pickles needs an award. I would come back, I would get something that diners cannot mess up with. This way I wouldn't be disappointed.","**Not Halal**This is the first time I've been to this Diner. I've been to quite a few Diners in Staten Island and this is probably one of the better ones. The atmosphere was welcoming and very family friendly. I really liked the retro look with the neon purple lighting. Like most Diners in the island, they weren't halal. However, they did have an extensive variety of breakfast options for halal eaters from different styles of eggs to wraps. I had the Mediterranean wrap which was fresh and juicy. They could've done better with presentation but, the excellent service made up for it. I'll probably go back for breakfast!!",Golden Dove
496,The worst service I ever had in my life.  Waitress was super lazy!  Restaurant was not quite full.  It took more then 15 minutes for her to come over and check out is if need to place order with the empty table.  The food was decent as usual.   Not a chance to go back again!  Thanks so much.  Lol,"The service is terrible. I've came here twice and experienced the same problem both times. Me and my boyfriend were seated pretty fast, however we were ignored right after. As we waited, we noticed everyone around us getting their orders taken but yet no one was approaching us. It took them almost 15 minutes to take our order and the only reason why they did was because we had to say something. Shortly after, it took them another 20 minutes to get our drinks and another 30 minutes to get our food. I've experienced the same service both times and now refuse to go back.",Slow service plus been sitting down for 30mins and still no utensils napkins given. Sadly we had to ask for it or else even when food get here we wouldn't have utensils and napkins!,"As someone who can eat pancakes for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, IHOP is easily one of my favorite spots for a simple and relatively inexpensive meal out.  I've been going to this location for years and I've had great experiences and ones that were less than perfect. It's one of those places that can be a little noisy because of other guest, but the staff is usually friendly and will fix any mistakes they make.  This past weekend I went and tried the new Addams Family hot chocolate and while visually it was a little gross looking, I kinda loved it and it tasted really good. My waitress brought me the wrong drink, but apologized and brought the right one out.  I also got my normal strawberry banana pancakes and as always they were delicious.  If you're looking for a gourmet meal obviously this is not where you want to go, but delicious and fun breakfast? IHOP will hit the spot.",We've always enjoyed stopping in here for a quick bite and since we've moved we haven't been here in a quite  a while.. tonight we saw that it's been decorated which was very nice but as soon as we sat down I noticed the dust all over the light fixtures over the booths.. this should've been a signal to get out We order decaf coffee which was like watered down liquid of something used to be coffee. Then I ordered off the +55 dinner menu the chicken fried steak my wife ordered chicken fried steak as well but with eggs. After one or two bites we each knew there was something very strange about the taste ! Needless to say we sent them both backI ended up getting a short stack and the check The server tried to charge me $15.69 for what was 2 eggs and 2 pancakes. Never ever again !!!! Stay away unless you need to clear your intestines for a colonoscopy I wouldn't recommend this place except the water it was good and very cold !,We've always enjoyed stopping in here for a quick bite and since we've moved we haven't been here in a quite  a while.. tonight we saw that it's been decorated which was very nice but as soon as we sat down I noticed the dust all over the light fixtures over the booths.. this should've been a signal to get out We order decaf coffee which was like watered down liquid of something used to be coffee.

497,"This luncheonette is within walking distance from the ferry.  I liked the ham and cheese sandwich, and a piece of apple pie.",Not impressed. I wanted a chili dog and they didn't have any chili. The French toast was dry.,"Food wasn't great. Rubbery turkey burger, tater tots had a strange aftertaste , as if they absorbed freezer smells. Pretty unspectacular food :/",Can't ask for a better turkey club and I'm even more blown away by the crispness of their lightly dressed (jus the way I prefer) coleslaw. Only gripe? The amount of slaw was in a sauce container so it was essentially like 3 bites. Considered buying a side but didn't want to lug it around all day. Definitely a home-grown staple who hosts regulars like they're family. And they have a lot of those. Would love to revisit on an off-peak hour (good luck) for the no frills ambiance.,After a long day in Staten Island court the gavel offers up some quick tasty comfort food to help get over that crappie verdict just handed down. Whether tuna on rye a burger salad or Belgian waffles they do it right.,"This is what we used to call a ""coffee shop,"" eventhough they're nothing like today's Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts, and their coffee, while okay and comes with free refills, is not the main attraction for me. There's counter seating on the left and tables and chairs on the right, all together about the same dimensions as a railroad car. The music today was mostly the greatest hits of the 1950's, and so were the signs behind the counter (someone has already taken good photos of those). My order today was the very reasonably priced, basic breakfast special: 2 eggs over easy with tomato instead of potato, a sesame bagel with butter, and regular coffee with half & half (served in a mini-pitcher, not plastic with a pull-off top). It looked great (see photo) and hit the spot. I've been here maybe ten times in the past 5 years, but only for breakfast, and was never disappointed. Service is prompt and accomodating. As you might guess from the name of this place, it's conveniently located near courthouses.",The Gavel Grill
498,Don't know what happened but this was on of my kids favorite quick place to eat at but I believe the owner are no longer there and the last time we order the food was tasteless. I decided to give them another chance and when to have dinner there and it was even worse.,"Quick, you get a great portion for the price, just didn't care for the taste. I got shrimp with broccoli and shrimp fried rice and was unimpressed, it was bland and the rice had egg in it that just made it taste and smell fresh. My spring roll was brunt and my boyfriend didn't care for his shrimp pad see ew noodles",We ordered food from Bay House Bistro and while my daughter was eating her chicken teriyaki bento box she found a bug stuck to the chicken.  It killed everyone's appetite. We all stopped eating and threw everything away.,Decent Chinese food and sushi. Sushi options seem to be drenched in sauce. Good option for casual takeout.,"So because my friend loves the beef and broccoli from this restaurant I decided to come with her. I ordered the lunch special chicken and broccoli with pork fried rice, the chicken was like rubber which could not be chewed. The waiter was attentive and said he would make me a fresh portion of the chicken. The pork fried rice was very good as well as the egg roll the lunch special came with. Sadly the new portion of chicken was also like rubber. 2 days later I decided to give it another try and ordered sweet and sour chicken I was surprised to see the chicken covered in sauce considering most places put it on the side. No big deal since it was much better than the chicken with broccoli option. Very nice staff seems empty to dine it but many take out orders for delivery.",So rare so good and pretty busy for a small corner restaurant on a weekday. In 2015 they won a best restaurant award. They have sushi as well. We shared a bay house fried rice and it tasted like it was made with grandmother's love. Best Chinese food on the island so far. The fried rice looks plain but packed with hidden flavors. Bring a date...bring the whole fam and eat!,Bay House Bistro
499,"Have ordered from here several times and it has always been decent. Today we ordered our usual lunch specials. Wong tong soup was blander than water, Fried dumplings were soaking in oil, boneless spare ribs were drowning in a gelatin colored fat making it completely inedible! When my husband and I called to complain the rude girl on the phone handed the phone to another employee who told us that it was normal and hung up! NEVER AGAIN!",Foods mediocre at best. One tiny thing of white rice after I ordered two pints of food is ridiculous. When my girlfriend called to ask why it was such little rice the women was very rude on the phone.

I ordered chicken and broccoli combo with pork fried rice and a wonton soup (which they charge 75 cents more for by the way) and a pint of lo mein. Based on the other recent reviews I can't understand why they think so poorly of this place. The chicken and broccoli was delicious and delivered hot I mean mouth burning from the broccoli. The rice was also good. The wonton soup broth was tasty like a real beef broth not those water based wonton soups and they give you 4 wontons. The lo mein I ordered plain and even for plain it was excellent I love Chinese food In fact 75% of my yelp reviews are based on Chinese. So give this place a try!,"First time ordered take-out from them.  Had company so we ordered a number of different dishes to get a sense of the food and to feed  everyone. Overall, expected better.  All dishes, from appetizer to main course, were average at best.  I expected more from their version of Peking Duck, Sesame Cold Noodles, etc, which were relatively tasteless.  Prices were reasonable and delivery was prompt, but I don't plan on ordering from them again.",Peking Taste
500,This pizza was so sad it made me miss Brooklyn the cheese was so salty and it was falling apart cheese falling off the slice. Bayonne is known for good pizza not sure what's going on just threw out the whole pie,"I abhor ever writing a negative review but I would never want another group of individuals to starve the way we did after ordering from Luciano's. It took over 2 HOURS to receive food & they're only 5 minutes away. Note: We're a 5 minute drive down. We ordered 2 boxes of pizza. One plain, one pepperoni. Nothing special. No complicated order.We placed our order exactly at 11:00 AM when the shop opened up, with the estimated delivery time of 45 minutes. At 12:10PM, I called again concerned our pizza would be cold by the time it was delivered. The host assured me it was on its way. 12:45 PM hit and a different lady told me, ""the driver is on his way and should be there any minute.""1 PM hit. You guessed it. No pizza, so I called for the 3rd time. As I was calling the pizza shop again, the delivery man called to let us know he was provided the wrong directions & wrong address. So yup, had to wait longer for this pizza.Gave this place an extra 2 stars because at least the pizza was good served luke warm. Would love to try it when it's delivered hot (maybe) next time.","Ordered a simple soup and salad, almost 2 hours later still no delivery.  When i called the restaurant the very very rude girl on the phone gave me an extremely nasty attitude and basically scoffed me away.  When i asked her why it's taking almost two hours to deliver an order less than a mile away she scoffed ""because we're backed up"" and refused to apologize. When i asked her to transfer me to her manager she hung up on. Fantastic gem here!","One of my absolute favorite pizza places here in Bayonne.I haven't tried much of the menu since I stick to pizza but I can safely say that it is wonderfully consistent.I always order a pie with extra cheese and it's fabulous. Wish I could live off of this extra cheese pizza but alas, one cannot.","Luciano's San Vito's is one of my favorite family restaurants. The food is fantastic and the service is topnotch. Last night we had Mozzarella Carrozza, minestrone soup and spinach and tortellini soup as appetizers, all were excellent.  I had the soft shell crab dinner special... awesomeness!!! My husband and friend had chicken rollatini in Marsella sauce, delicious.  My daughter had the linguine with aioli. Now... I only eat Italian cheesecake.. do not really like New York style.  Anthony made the most delicious Italian cheesecake I have ever eaten.  It was light and moist and extremely flavorful.  Highly recommend trying it! There was also live music which was a nice touch.  When you're there... you're treated like family.","I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place sooner! The food is delicious! We order from them pretty frequently and have not been disappointed. My husband loves their grilled chicken with broccoli, garlic and oil. But to me, their ultimate- Best in the area dish- is their vodka penne!(which I change to vodka over bow ties lol) Their vodka sauce is so delicious...like seriously DELICIOUS! You need to try it. It tastes ever better the second day. The garlic knots are good too, although a little too heavy on the garlic. But hey, October's coming and I need to ward off the vampires, am I right? The pizza is pretty solid as well! I have only ordered by the slice so far and have not been disappointed. I will say that service on the phone is significantly better and FRIENDLIER then some other place whose name rhymes with Mizza Pasters. Be sure to give them a try! You won't be sorry :)",Luciano's San Vito Restaurant and Pizzeria

I ordered the nachos with a side of guac. I was impressed with how reasonable the prices were, given the airport location! Tacquila is a bar kiosk; each seat has an iPad installed in front of it, which you order on. Another thing that impressed me was that despite this, the waiter was still very present and attentive; it wasn't like the iPad replaced him. My food came out quickly and it was delicious! I will be back to Tacquila next time I'm at EWR.",Nice place to catch a small meal and a drink.  Order your meal and drinks on a tablet and it'll come out in minutes.  Very helpful staff.  Not much to say about a place that's in an airport but when your flight gets delayed then a couple of drinks helps.,Tacquila
502,"Food is subpar to most places in the area. It's good but not the greatest. The seating seems crammed and the decor is mediocre at best.

I don't care if you pay your staff more than 2.13 and hour!!! If I go to tip them, they keep the tip, not you! Bunch of greediness!!!","It is a shame I have to give a minimum of 1 star, because Vintage doesn't even deserve that much.The service was horrible.  The waiters and I assume the owner couldn't get the orders entered correctly.  The waiters were terribly inexperienced and did not have a clue on proper service.  The dishes for the salad course did not arrive until after the salads were served and were not all cleaned off the table before the main course was served.  The table was dirty between courses and the wait staff made no effort to clean it up.The ambiance was outdated and very tired.  And what's up with the Christmas decorative lights?  Too lazy to take them down?The main course was a chicken dish in a watery sauce with over-sautéed artichoke hearts and sun dried tomatoes.  I never got the side of vegetables that was supposed to come with the dish.All in all , never again.All my wife wanted was a simple salad for her main course and it didn't make it to the table with my dish.  We had to ask them a second time for it.",I work in Cranford and only order lunch here for delivery.

The owner (female) was very nice. Got there right in time for the live music (Joe Caroselli) to start - he and Danny on keyboards were outstanding, as was the guest sax player and other folks who got up to sing as well. A real friendly atmosphere. The service from everyone working there was excellent as well. Please see my pictures for the delicious dishes we had. You could tell that many of the folks here were regulars, and people don't keep going back to a place where the food isn't good! Ok, so why only 4 stars? The dessert was lacking. Coffee wasn't very hot. We got the tiramisu and it was slightly warm. Realized that it had clearly been frozen and probably nuked in the microwave before serving. Tasted like it had been in the freezer for quite some time. So, has to take a star away for that reason. The decor could use some freshening as well - but the appetizers/main dishes and friendly atmosphere is why people come here!",Vintage Italian Restaurant
503,"Customer service is okay, My last visit I was hoping for my experience to be a little different than the last time I was there, and for sure it was, but not in a good way. Usually the food is greasy, and that's something I was tolerant of, because it happens. But my last visit was the most unpleasant, and afterwards I felt disgusted. I had ordered an 8 piece combo with fries and a soda. What I got was seriously concerning. I thought I had paid over $10 for this meal, and what I got in return was a plate filled with oil and grease. The chicken wings were completely soaked in grease to the point I had more a ""grease soup"" on my plate than actual chicken. It was sickening having to open up my plate and seeing this. I WILL NEVER ! Go back to this place","I don't understand what this restaurants does with the other 2/3s' of the wing, especially the really meaty portion that attaches to the body.  Ordering bone-in is pricier than boneless and you're served the second bone.  Guess I should be grateful they don't serve the tips.  They boast 10 gradients of spiciness but you couldn't prove it by me.  I was disappointed with the chicken BUT I loved the french fries.  Went back for an order and was told they were out.  How can you be out of a proponent of your meals?  Weird place.  Won't go back.","This particular girl is just terrible!

While driving in the parking lot of the Farmers Market - I saw it, the green and white sign, I was in disbelief! I have, have HAVE to have some Wingstop wings!!! The last time I had them was in Texas waaaay back in 2010. I was greeted by a very friendly cashier, Emanuel, he took my name and order and told me it would be about a 12-15 minute wait. See the thing with Wingstop is that they make everything fresh to order. I got 10 wings half mild and half hickory BBQ and a roll. They are a non breaded wing deep fried then tossed in sauce - simple and perfect! The mild was buttery and smooth, the BBQ sweet and tangy. I also got a yeast roll it was warm and dripping in honey butter. I know it's a franchise, but I didn't see a tip jar, nor was there a place on the credit card receipt to add a tip, they should at the very least get a tip jar. The place is clean and well kept l, they even clean the tables off for you! I'm so happy Wingstop has made it to NJ!","I may have set the bar of expectations to high for Wingstop. I was not impressed or blown away. They were basic wings, same I would get at a papa johns or dominos, very basic. They were good, small but good. The fries were great, whatever seasoning they tossed it in. All in all 3.5 stars. I do believe they are a little pricey(I had it delivered), I may maybe pass by here again but I would not go out of my way to do so.",This is probably one of my favorites fry places nearby. I ordered my french fries ahead and we're ready within five minutes. I've walked in got greeted and serve within a short period of time! I don't eat meat anymore but I splurge on my,Wingstop
504,Disgusting food. General tso chicken was like rubber. And how can u f up rice? Just unsatisfied and it took forever to come.,"If I could give this place NO STARS I would!!! I ordered Wonton soup along with a few other things and when I went to bite into my first Wonton I nearly almost choked due to a piece of plastic the size of a Half dollar stuffed inside of it with the meat!!! I call the restaurant and tell the girl on the phone what happened and she says. ""Ok, sorry"" and then silence. Wtf?!? Are you kidding me!?! No I'll tell the cooks, no, maybe we should check the rest of the wontons. Just absolutely NOTHING. Then she says ""well what do you want? A refund for the wontons or a new order?"" ARE YOU KIDDING????? NO I DONT WANT A NEW ORDER, WHY THE HELL WOULD I WANT THAT???? AND HOW ABOUT A REFUND FOR MY ENTIRE ORDER!!!!!! Disgusting. MY CHILD WAS EATING WITH ME! EITHER ONE OF US COULD HAVE CHOKED ON THIS PLASTIC!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I ORDER FROM HERE! And be sure I will report this to the Dept of Health as well!!",The Least Friendly Customer Service over the phone I have ever had. And PS. I am 2 miles away and they did not close for almost 3 hours when I called...... Still told I was to far away.,"really good food, and their lo mein is amazing (especially the shrimp). Delievery is always fast and the delivery man is quite nice.",This place was ONCE great; the food tasted the way it was supposed too! What Happened? Ever since the original owner left the food now is horrible! Don't waist your money going here.,"Ordered online via grubhub for lunch, which is always a plus. The lunch special was more expensive then just getting an egg roll and small general tsaos and throwing away the fried rice because I'm not a fan, so be mindful when ordering. The chicken had a bit too much sauce and not enough crunch, but flavor was good.  Egg roll was pretty standard. I got some dumplings to take home- thick wrapper with not enough meat inside. Dipping sauce was alright. Overall, not bad, not great.",Yum Yum Chinese Food
505,"Poor service, found a hair in my taco. Soggy bread and packed horribly! Disgusting to dine in and rude management. Never coming back here. Beware!!",It's quick okay food. Tacos are okay. Not great not terrible. Same for wings. It used to be better.,"Wings are good...the staff is terrible!In the past I have asked for 10 hot and 10 medium. Instead of charging me for 20 (which was cheaper at the time), I was charged for 2 ten pieces. This happened to me more than once. I was told I have to specify a 20 piece by the rude, punk assed kid staff. Lol...really!?!?!I once ordered the nachos. The menu (both online and on the big board in the restaurant) stated it came with sour cream and salsa. When I arrive to pick up my order, I discovered I was charged extra for each. When I explained it was supposed to be included, some other rude, punk assed kid staff member refused to swallow his pride and admit he was wrong. He said online is different! How can a franchise not honor its online menu? Lol. Regardless, this location also said it was included on the menu. It escalated to the point where he actually grabbed the food and asked if I no longer wanted it. Wow!There are more examples but I'll just share these two. Is these type of experiences that you remember when you are dealing with any type of establishment. Too many unpleasant experiences and you will never return.",Great location and not only do they have great wings the other food that they have at this restaurant is amazing too like the cheese steaks. It is a bit pricey and they don't release coupons too often which I wish they did.,"In reading some of the other reviews, I'm honestly shocked at such a low rating. I order from Planet Wing rather frequently and I haven't been let down. This is not a ""fine dining"" experience, it's a wing joint. A damn good wing joint.  Buffalo wing sauce is on point, I have several go to's... California Wrap and the Gyros are the best.  This place is hands down better than wing world.","Stopped by for a quick bite recently after not having been there in a while. Not to say it was all bad, but I can see why that is. The wings for the most part were of a normal size, but the sauce on them was uneven. Some were completely smothered in it, so that the taste of the chicken was almost impossible to discern, while others had barely any. Fortunately the curly fries were pretty crisp and generally enjoyable with cheese on the side. So I suppose if you want to just snack on those, the place is perfectly fine, but when it comes to chicken wings, there are definitely better places on the island.",Planet Wings
506,"Herb Diner was OK, food was reasonably price and the portions were good... I was somewhat disappointed because they didn't have cheddar cheese to add to the grits. the shrimp were good( Large fried jumbo shrimp) eggs was scrambled nicely. The only downside was no cheddar cheese for my grits just American cheese as we all know, if you're a foodie American cheese just doesn't cut it you need cheddar in your grits. I would visit the diner again in the future, if I'm ever in the area.","Just  disgusting! I've tried this diner on three different occasions just to be sure of the food and service. Each time was worse than the last. I've had the pancakes, waffles, eggs, home fries, beef bacon, turkey bacon, and grits. It was all nasty. The only thing that was good was the toast.","Having my car serviced a couple of blocks away and I'm hungry. Authentic diner with that slightly decrepit look and feel. Service is efficient and they give you a lot of food, one order enough for 2 people.I had the shrimp (battered and fried), scrambled eggs and potatoes and walked away with a complete meal in the styrofoam container.Come hungry","This is about my favorite breakfast spot in Jersey. Fried or baked fish with shrimp and grits! Delicious! And the price point is great. Not fancy, just good food and down to earth folk. And, Herb is pretty cool too.",Someboday call Guy Fieri...They need to be on DD & DsAlmost left without going inDown home open kitchen family run establishmentThey know the value of the large plateThe grill man is on point with paper ticketsThe food....PHENOMENAL Country cooking at its bestI had breakfast and got the menu because I saw some dishes come out that kitchen that I need.The classic working man's place to grab a great meal......Don't expect speed service - greatness takes time!!!!,"I've been to Herb's Diner 3 times over the course of the last two weeks. We had the shrimp/ fried fish with grits. It was very delicious and our plates were nice portions. The waitress was very sweet and caring. If you are ever in Hillside, NJ, please stop in to Herb's. You will most certainly not be disappointed.We love Herbs!!!",Herb's Diner
507,Very poor and slow service. Manager did not care that my salad arrived with a hair on it. Menu doesn't represent what you order. Don't be deceived!,"I'm a big fan of the OTG restaurants, but this one seems to be operating in a vacuum. Rude staff, excessively long wait for drinks, oysters did not come as described and hair on another meal.","The service is horrific, the man next to me flipped out and walked off, and I could not even blame him.","Mostly automated through iPad in front of you. 1. Press food2. Scan barcode of your boarding pass3. Add to check then payRemember to CLOSE your tab!You can also surf the internet on it :)Service was friendly and attentive although when I sat down two servers were arguing loudly. The kids grilled cheese is super sad, one star. Definitely kraft cheese singles and cheap bread. Came kinda cold too.  Fries was decent.Stars are more for the drinks and cool concept. The pineapple jalapeño margarita was perfect. Great heat level, and not too sweet or sour.The bourbon lemon drink was good too, horse feather?","So ok I'm really confused with the low star rating here. It really is a descent place to stop and grab some tasty sushi. I ordered salmon sashimi that came with three pieces instead of two, a yellowtail roll and a glass of Malbec. The sushi was FRESH. Service was QUICK. Wine was DEVINE. It was a modern dining experience with iPads used for ordering. The waitstaff was professionally dressed and moderately pleasantly. I would definitely stop in again despite the poor reviews. Lets face it: It's not Tokyo. Its Newark airport.",Long wait for a $10 beer they would have forgotten if I didn't remind them. The beer finally arrives in a glass that's sticky. Gotta love Newark Airport.,SURF Bar
508,Ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and they forgot the buffalo sauce. ‍ The guy making the wrap was to busy trying to show off how good his wrapping skills were to the other workers.,"I go to this jersey mikes all the time since the owners purchase this place , today will be my last day. No lines , ordered a turkey wrap one guy that was there didn't want to make it , then they ask another then they ask another , once the services drops this quick, I won't spend my money any more it's not worth it ! Get new worked minus the young lady! Good bye jersey mikes in Hylan Blvd!","Stopped in to get two sandwiches on Friday night, it was 8 pm and the floors were all wet already and the store closes at 9.the place was empty basically with one lady in front of me, but they were working on all phone orders. I had to wait basically 25 minutes to get my sandwiches . And then the guy behind the counter asks who is next and a transit worker cuts me in line when the worker knew I was next and took his order. All young guys working, didn't ask me how I wanted my sandwich . Tomatoes were moldy. Took them off my sandwich . Took way to long for an empty store.with three guys working. Sandwich tasted overly salty. Won't be goin back. Workers seemed liked they didn't care and wanted to get out early","Love reading the classic Staten Island reviews on here: workers touching something barely without a glove on, not being served after closing time, etc. Im waiting for someone to complain that the restaurant name doesnt have 'Bella' or 'Villa' in it somewhere or it doesnt serve buffalo chicken slices. The guy barely touching lettuce with his bare hand is sacrilege, but the albanian or mexican 'italian' guy cooking your chicken marsala in 'Cafe Bella Villa Vita Roma' with no gloves ever, is perfectly fine. But as for the FOOD here in this SANDWICH place, its pretty good and i wouldnt want to see it closed down because of one star reviews because the bread was a 'little hard' or someone's arm touched the food. My only complaint was that my soda was completely Flat, but doesnt warrant one star. The sandwiches were a good size and had more meat than Subway would have, besides the fact of it also tasting better. Is it the best sandwich shop ever? No. Is it quality compared to Subway and other chains? Definitely Yes. Will they ever serve Gawlic Knot sandwiches with chicken pawwm in them like Cafe Pizza Bella Villa Roma Brothers? Probably if they want to survive on Staten island","Actually been here a few times and so far it's been fairly decent. I find it to be better than Subway and Jimmy Johns by far. Unfortunately I had a bad experience when I was paying for my food today. The bill was $41 and change but when I pulled out my money to pay I realized I only had two 20 bills. So I pulled out my credit card not realizing I placed the two twenties on the counter. As I'm going through the motions to pay via credit card, the cashier reaches over and tries to pull the money away. As she was doing so she began folding it into her hand. I luckily noticed it before she could pull it off. When I said hey I'm paying with credit not cash why you touching my money, she just said my bad. I was going to blow her spot up but I think she felt horrible as it was. She clearly knew I was paying with credit as she told me what button to press yet she reached for my cash. Take it how you want but I call that bad business. Revisited the said location on several occasions and was very satisfied overall. However on the last visit I noticed what appeared to be a hair on the tomatoes. I Told the manager behind the counter what I observed. He just removed the tomatoes that it was touching and continued to serve me with the same gloves and took from the same batch of tomatoes. After leaving with my order I decided to throw the meal out as I was repulsed. I just couldn't eat after that, period.","Actually been here a few times and so far it's been fairly decent.

509,"Been a customer for 8+ years and always order the same thing. Tonight after long day of work and classes I ordered a margarita pie via Grubhub. If you're familiar with how this is prepared it's mostly sauce and fresh mozzarella and basil placed all over the pie. It's usually a good amount of cheese for someone like me that doesn't consume too much dairy which is why I opt for this pie over any other. The pizza came as a cheese pie with more sauce and cheese added to it. Immediately knew something was wrong cause the box was heavy! I called the restaurant and the girl answering the phone literally says ""No we didn't!"" She tells me this is how the margarita is made even though I eat this shit at least 6x a month. You should be apologetic to customers if there's a complaint. I'll never eat here again and will dispute with Grubhub.","I have no clue what happen today i been ordering here for more than 6 years... I always tell everyone this is the best spot better than many competitors on this island! But today I must say super disappointed. I ordered 3 dinners and every pasta was not cooked the pasta were stuck together and hard the sauce was very light i actually had to open a jar of sauce to pour over. I wanted to order out but ended fixing my order instead. Pizza was good for the kids but the stuff shells no good, chicken parm with fettuccine horrible, chicken Alfredo fettuccine with broccoli which i felt they just cut the entire broccoli and just put in in my dish no flavor.. I know restaurants have some bad days but damn i just threw out $40 plus bucks in the trash!!! Again super surprise i always give this spot 5 stars!!!!! Gotta see if they correct this next time if not I be looking for a new spot!!!",I use to order from them all the time but not anymore. There food has become overpriced. And the food is not great.,"Best pizzeria on the north shore! Have been order from here consistently for the past 2 years. This is one of only pizzeria I know of where almost everything on the menu is delicious. I order through the slice app and the food always comes earlier than expected and the delivery guys are always really nice & professional. Some of my favs are the wings, their crispy fries & their salads. They also have the best garlic knots I've ever had.","Crispy is a decent pizzeria and is practically the only one on the Terrace. Ive stopped into this location a few times over the past year for a quick pizza fix and left pleased each and every time.Their counter has about 20 different types of pizzas, mostly the pan type, regular round, pepperoni, squares, and all sorts of rolls. On my last visit I had a regular slice and it was just right. Definitely fresh and flavorful and to boot it was only $2! Anything that's yummy and under $10 has my vote anytime. Their eggplant rolls are also amazing.I'd suggest this joint.","Second time eating here. The regular slice, just like last time, was fantastic. thin crust, tangy sauce, and good amount of cheese. This is standard, good, NYC pizza. I also had a square. Great as well.",Crispy Pizza
510,The delivery service here is terrible .. they always say 30-45 min for delivery and my food always takes an hour plus more to get here and half of the time the food is cold ...,You don't get what you pay for . The pizza portions are so tiny . My steak roll was so small and cold on the inside . I left hungry,"I like their pizza don't get me wrong, but it aggravates me when they say the grill goes off at 11.45 and at 11.42 they don't even pick up the phone.  You could at least pick up and say ""sorry grill when off early tonight"" if you don't wanna take my order, just be polite, but they didn't they just let it ring.. I called twice and nothing, I'm in there all the time.  I live a block away, good way to treat your repeat customers. Also the one girl who works the front always touches the pizza with her hands if she can't get the slices apart right away.. RIGHT AFTER working the register (touching cash, the touchscreen, etc...) which is a violation of the health code.  Watched her do it twice in the span of 10 minutes.",We called in an order for pick up. Service was quick we got there 10 mins later and it was already ready. Props to them since we were starving after waiting at the mechanics for over 3 hours without having breakfast or lunch. We got the Danny's Alfredo pan pizza which was delicious! It was topped with Alfredo and spinach and chicken. I def recommend this if you're in the mood for a pan pizza. We also got the penne vodka with grilled chicken. The penne was a bit too soft And the sauce was all oily and dried up on top when we opened it. The grilled chicken tasted burnt to me. The garlic knots were really good! We finished them in the car while driving home. Lol,"I just place an order to the Forrest pronto and the order was sent to the Bay Street restaurant, and this place stole my money. They messed up my order, did not deliver everything that I paid for and to top it off, they dare to call me a liar. I had ordered a 3 topping pizza, only got one topping did not get my drink, and the manager says that his chef is sure he made the it correctly. Like is the chicken invisible, are the onions pulverized!!!?  The asked me to send them a picture of the pie which I did and he said that yes he could see the onions!!!! Well i sure can not taste it!!! I WILL NEVER AND YOU SHOULD NEVER ORDER FROM THIS OR ANY OTHER PRONTO EVER AGAIN!!!!!! Tell me do you see the damn chicken or onions?!?!?",Is it the best pizza ever. Nope. But food is typically consistent. Excellent specialty slices. Better than most other places.,Pronto Pizza Pasta
511,This is the worst place I ever had pizza. It was horrible and so dirty inside. We went there on a very hot day and it was just as hot inside as outside. Empty and the phones don't ring.,"Very disappointed with this place. I ordered my food at 9:00 P.M. and it's now 10:46 P.M. and my food is just now being delivered. It's ice cold, when the man who answered the phone promised me it'd be warm. The delivery woman had no remorse that the food took so long to get here, she stated ""yeah I was busy I don't know."" I tried to call the restaurant and they refuse to answer the phones, I assume pretending to be closed is the best way to deal with customer service. Will never order from here again, $50 wasted on frozen pizza. Could have went to shop rite for Ellio's and saved $40.","I typically order from Casa Nino's once a week, if not twice a week.  I put in a substantial order on Grub-hub  and after an hour of waiting called to see if the food was on its way.  I was told they weren't taking orders because they were only doing catering so I had zero options at this point. I am very disappointed in their professionalism and lack of concern for their customers. There was no ""sorry for the inconvenience, but more of a ""I don't know what to tell you"" attitude. So here we are (6:35) with no food after placing the order at 4:50. In the future they should post on these sites that they aren't delivering. Other restaurants have done this and it avoids the confusion. I understand that things happen but I am more annoyed that a local place that I give a lot of business to had such a poor attitude.","Chicken rolls are amazing!!!   Not too much sauce which is why there so great ,     Workers are all friendly and helpful too.    Must try","Casa Nino's Pizza House is one of the best places. The buffalo slice is one I recommend to all. They have more unique pizzas that are just as delicious.

512,This place is good but there's a hair in my potatoes the minute i opened the box. kinda disgusting.,I ordered a large order for lunch for my office. The food was delicious and plentiful! Delivery did take a long time (about 1 hour and 15 mins after I called) so that's the reason for taking off 1 star. But I ordered the limo Saltado and the beef was very juice and fries were not soggy. I'd order from here again.,I have mixed reviews about this place. There rotisserie chicken is very flavorful and there Peruvian green sauce is like nothing I ever experienced! It's amazing...but it annoys me that when I want to order lunch I can't order chicken bc they say chickens are not ready until 1230pm. I think think should cook them up in the morn so they are ready ...there salad is always wilted and looks like it's been sitting around and there delivery takes so long and I'm only .9 miles away. So basically yes their food is good but they need to speed things up.,I love good food and the Peruvian rice here is good food. It's always perfect. They give you enough rice for a week in one serving. I've only ever done take out but I wish more business came here.I ordered lunch from here for my co workers and they loved it.  Parking is a problem if you are trying to stay in or pick up and the menu seems like there are too many different options that don't seem pervuavian.,I've ordered food from here numerous times and every time has been excellent! The portions are pretty large and the food quality is excellent. Their roasted chicken is hands down my favorite and delicious!

I would recommend this pizza place! And I'll definitely be back!,Big mac pie all the way. They always have a bunch of custom pizzas ready to go for slices. 2 thumbs up.,"Disappointed. Menu looked incredible and reviews were great so really expected better. The food was incredibly bland. Ordered the linguine with white clam sauce and it was literally boiled pasta with mini clams poured over. NO flavor whatsoever. My husbands meal of chicken a la Rocco also very bland. There was zero flavor, nevermind salt! The garlic knots were in a pool of oil. We could not eat them as the oil was literally pooling out of them.

However, most recently the quality has decreased somewhat. The fries are not the best. The bread is just American rolls instead of the crusty European bread we all know and love. Half the ribs were underdone. The other half was great, nicely charred. The flavor is still fantastic though.Another time, the pork in a stew was underdone. We know that the meat should always be tender. And more gardiniera would be appreciated. But overall great flavor, once again. And the rice should contain more peas and carrots, please.

This place is horrible.","Beware:  Automatic Gratuity.  Don't get burned.  This is shady.Food:  if your going to call yourself an Irish Pub, you need fish & chips!   Also, the Caesar Chicken salad was pitiful.  It was nothing like the picture.   Two beers and a crappy salad -  $50.  My the odds be forever in your favor!","$14.99 for 2 sausage dogs and potato chips. Both sausages were on a pretzel roll, and came with a small individual serving of sauerkraut. I got a bratwurst (okay) and an Italian sausage (cooked hard, not very good). If you get a soft drink, they give you free refills. Service very slow.","Service was truly THE WORST! The food was ok for airport quality but it can VERY clearly be improved. As to availability, they need to have much better hours. It was 11am and they were still completely disorganized in trying to get their doors open. Then once sat, there was no availability from the bar (the LARGEST feature in the restaurant physically AND by name) for another hour or more. The service literally took absolutely forever.....meaning about 20-25 min to put in an order and almost 35 min to receive sandwiches like a BLT and grilled cheese with barely anyone in the restaurant. There was no attention given to the table for refills etc. If you are going to offer a service & charge airport prices for it, well at least have the decency to carry it to some sort of potential. I look forward to the opening of Piattino across the path as some competition.....let's hope they are not as much of a train wreck!!!","Well they earn their rating...avoid this place.  We just finished a $63 lunch which included a chicken Caesar salad sealed in plastic just like could be bought at an airport Kiosk (lovely misleading picture in the menu), a gilled chicken BLT that was stale, dry and in a box (also like could be bought at an airport kiosk) plus two $12 beers.  I should protest the charge on my credit card.Clearly they exploit international travelers who they likely won't have to face again.Ridiculous!  And based on the other reviews...I added a 10% tip on what must have already had a 15% tip.  That was the best tip ever left for very poor service...well s&$t","So I'm sure that people dont come here because they want to. They come here because they have to. If you want warm decent food, please do yourself a favor and eat before coming through security to area B. 22 dollars for a box with half a bag of chips, sandwich, and a bowl of soup. The sandwich I got was a chicken BLT and it was noticeably dry. It might as well be called rubber TLT for tasteless lettuce and tomato (with one tiny sliver of bacon). The chicken noodle soup had plastic-tasting bits of chicken that made me fear for my own health. I did like their ketchup and mustard though (store-bought on the table), which was probably the highlight of the meal.Salt was added on to the wound when they included a mandatory 15% gratuity to our bill. It's like this place knows the service and food is so subpar that they have to force the tip in. But after all that is said and done, there are some good things that came from this experience. I realized that I'm fortunate to be eating and not starving. I realized that I'm thankful to be alive to even make a bratty review on yelp. I am fortunate because I can typically choose what I want to eat. This place has made me realize all of these things and so thank you for that.",McGinley's Irish Pub
518,When I first arrived at Wabi Sabi I was very confused because I thought a cashier would take out order. After 5 minutes of standing there my group and I realized you order on a ipad. Once I started ordering I realized  you can't request to leave out certain things from your meal because the ipad doesn't give you the option. This made it difficult for me due to dietary restrictions. However for some dishes you are given the option to add certain  proteins on. The meal itself was pretty good but the service was a real let down.,"$11 for the worst stir fry noodles I've ever had, even at an airport. $2 extra for 3 pieces of broccoli that had started to go bad. Minor adjustments to the process could actually turn this into a good meal if someone taught the employees how to cook noodles and vegetables, but as it stands it's awful.",Just say no. Took forever for no vegetables and a bunch of nasty sauce for a ridiculous airport price.,"I ordered Singapore noodles using the kiosk, making for an easy experience. At $10, it was cheaper than expected and I checked myself out with ease.When my food arrives, I could tell it was made to order and not sitting under a heat lamp or on steamers. That's a plus. Now, to the cons. The noodles were overcooked and more soggy than anything. Aside from a lime and pieces of tomato, it was merely noodles with curry powder. I've had more expensive and worst tasting airport food. This was fine, but there are better places to check out.","Now I understand the bad reviews. Everything is bad with this place. The taste, the service, the value, everything. I only didn't give them 1 star because that is reserved for instances of food poisoning.Ok. So let's start with the taste. The chicken katsu meat was deep fried in some kind of sweet cinnamon breading and it was way too sweet. The rice it came with had no flavor and the cabbage was also weird tasting. Nothing in the meal was good but it was the only thing we could eat on the plane so we were stuck.The food also took a very long time to prepare. So if you do end up eating here be sure to leave a lot of time to wait for the food. The employees working there were pushy and rude. It was very clear they did not want to be there and could care less if you had a plane to catch.After spending $14 I would have expected a little more food. It was barely enough to feed one person, unless you eat all the bland rice. I think next time we will go with the other signature chicken dish (it did look a lot better in the picture) or we will just eat somewhere else. The choices in the food court are a bit limited, especially if you are looking for something that can be eaten an hour or two later on the plane.Happy travelling!","Shrimp bowl was delicious and filling with a nice tinch of garlic sauce. Service was quick and easy. A little pricy, but worth a shot!",Wabi Sabi - Gates C120-139
519,"Provender: they have a wide assortment of food and booze. It's airport food, so I don't really expect Michelin Star quality food. Prices: a Turkey club is about $15 and a glass of beer is about $8-9.Parking: N/APeople: weary travelers. This is more adult oriented, although kids are definitely welcome.Perks: the ambiance is dope. And they have a better selection of booze than other eateries. The joint is located in terminal C, near the food court. You order via ipads, which is standard throughout terminal C. They also have charging stations for your phone. They DO NOT accept cash.","Rude! Bartender was too busy, and lazy since he only had one customer, to help me with my order. Food didn't look good and after he gave me attitude about their merchandise I decided to take my business to one of the many other places to eat in Newark. You will notice they are empty in comparison to every other restaurant in the airport.","From CBGB's online ""rate your experience"" questionnaire:Congratulations, your table ordering service was a convoluted mess & extremely slow. The tablets at our table of four didn't work and when they did, it would crash. Our server was very helpful, but even she was confused by the crash. The food was m'eh at best. The Turkey Club (photo) tasted off, while the the Deviled Eggs (photo) were minuscule and the bacon was over cooked. And all this for $38.63? Come on now!Return factor, nil.","It's in the NYC area and it's at an airport.  So quit complaining about the prices.  You want low prices, have a staycation and eat frozen dinners.The iPad ordering system works fine, and you get a 20 percent discount with a United credit card (which also gives you priority boarding and free bags).  Nice selection of craft beers.  They were out of the one that I ordered, but had a nice substitute.I had the Chicken Schwarma Sandwich, which was nicely seasoned and filling.  My companion had the Apple Cranberry Walnut Salad, which was large and delicious.  As far as airport restaurants go, this is a good choice.  Now if they could just eliminate all the crowds of clueless travelers.  The server was very friendly and efficient.  Food delivery was quick.","If nothing else, CBGB is an excellent glimpse into what a corporate dystopian future could look like. So I don't know the whole story, but it seems that there's this company called OTG that secured the contract to run pretty much all of the restaurants in Terminal C. OTG has decided to ditch restaurants in favor of ""experiences"" - which basically means each restaurant is essentially a well-decorated seating area.A central kitchen cranks out food for each of the restaurants, and the only real difference between each place is the façade. This helps explain the absolute desolation of the Yelp reviews - it is bleak. At each seat at each table is an iPad with a visually busy display. It is constantly moving and playing ads. You touch the screen, and try to pick out the ""order"" button from at least 20 different icons. No waitersNo human interactionBland, depressing foodImpressively negligent service - no refills, no extra ketchup, absolute minimum of human interaction. As far as the food itself, I got the chicken BLTA (avocado). It was thoroughly bland. Which is sort of appropriate for a place named after something with character. Every bit as satisfying as going from actual fresh-squeezed orange juice to off-brand Sunny D. But ""bespoke"" Sunny D, so it costs more. It's a beverage experience, after all.So what to expect next - it's easy to see that people hate the restaurant situation in terminal c. The food is just not good. The prices are too high. The service is so disinterested. So they will avoid it. So OTG will either cut services and quality, or they will raise prices further.","Newark international had only one decent place to eat and this was it. It was a sit down restaurant where food was self ordered and paid with the kiosk system. The burger and fry that I ordered was a double patty with slices of American cheese layering each one. It was one pretty display. The patties were bland gave nothing to the palate . The presentation was everything however: for $19, I wish that I were given something to brag about flavor wise but I can't be picky in an airport.",CBGB L.A.B.
520,Most disgusting diner with the poorest management. This place cant seem to get it right. Do youself a favor and choose a colonoscopy over going to this diner. Trust me that is worth your time more than this diner. They are so unprofessional its not even funny. They took over two hours to send a delivery. The service was so horrible that I didn't want it at the end and just canceled. The manager is a joke and i can't even imagine how stupid the owner is. Come on people this place rebranded over 6 times since I grew up in Linden. Terrible terrible service and I would not be surprised if the same owner has had the business over several years.,"The burgers are HUGE!!!! Simply to die for! I've had the chili dog too which is another favorite of mine. The chili has just the right amount of spice without being too hot to handle.  It is very small inside so if you want to eat in instead of take out, you may be limited.  Still, it's my twice a week go-to place for lunch!",I think they change cooks too much. Food is inconsistant. I have 2 go to places. Here and sunnymart in avenel. They should get the cook who just left Sunny mart...just my 2 cents,"I've been meaning to go here for maybe a year plus and it's legit up the road from me. So today I finally pulled the trigger and man I should've gone earlier.I got the Belly Buster breakfast sandwich as I was fiending for some hearty in the morning and it did the did the trick. It comes on a 6"" sandwich roll, which I'm typically not a fan of, I prefer bagels or croissants for the bread, but I am now a firm believer and will never turn back.The bread was soft, the meats were succulent, the cheese was oozing, and heavens were opening. The sandwich was massive and came out to $7 and change.I took it to go so didn't get to hang out in the diner for long. It's a pretty tiny spot and it closes at 4PM on weekdays and 3 on weekends. So you need to get there early. Typical greasy spoon diner environment. They sell snacks on a rack in addition to what's on the menu. They also had a sign inside the diner with Dominican breakfast dishes like tostones (fried plantains), mangú, fried cheese, amongst others. There is a boast on the menu of them having the ""absolute best coffee in town."" As their competition looks to be bodegas and gas stations....maybe a Dunkin....there's a good chance this boast is on point.A lot of trucker type hard living dudes hanging out there, but if you don't care this place seems pretty special in a sea of chain franchise restaurants that NJ is riddled with. The staff was kind and though it's not my usual crowd I didn't feel out of place.The food was excellent with very reasonable prices. New yet cool environment. I will be coming back!i","Johnny, it was a pleasure talking to you and enjoying your hotdogs with that unbelievable homemade chili, a real taste treat, you get the slight sweetness at first and then the ever slow slight afterburner sensation, fantastic. similar to the umami sensation you get from Szechwan Chinese. As an aside I noticed in a few early comments a few people complained about ""good food lousy service"" yesterday your crew took care of over 70 people so efficiently it was incredible. I will make it a point to come and see you the on my list for quite a while, it was the  very first establishment on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives.","I always get the single burger medium rare with cheese and pickles and ketchup, nothing else, and it's perfect every time!

I called a bunch of times left a message.  I will never order from this place again.","The food was so bad i had to throw it out! I have never in my life had chinese food so disgusting that i didn't even make it halfway. i had other people with me try it to see if i was just being picky, but they all agreed that it was terrible. This place needs work. It's a shame, because it's in a very convenient location and i was hoping to grab a quick meal that wasn't popeyes (not that there's anything wrong with the chicken joint), but clearly that could not happen.",I don't know what happened to this Chinese restaurant. It was one of my favorite restaurants on Staten Island. Now it's barely average. Very dissatisfied with the quality of the food. The ribs were actually grey.,"Easily the best Chinese food on the Island. I'm a Brooklynite and never found an equal place in SI. So I'm very picky with Chinese food. I've tried others but this one is the truth. They are a bit pricey compared to other places but they do give you a bunch of food. Also, the best fried rice I've ever had. Legit place, glad I found a regular spot in SI.",Love their ribs and wonton soup. Better than most places. Their delivery is quick and when you eat in someone brings your food to your table. Nice for a small takeout place.,"What do people always get with their Chinese food? And please don't say fortune cookies because some places do not. What we always get is rice. Either white rice or fried rice or whatever. I can't say that the food here is good or bad. Or if the place is clean or anything like that. But I can judge them by the type of rice they use. It's the bad kind. It's hard, dry, and I think It's call the bagged rice. Heck it even sounds like bad rice lol. The employee at the cash register never look at me. Ask what I wanted. Took my money. And gave me my rice all while playing a game on his iPhone. Surprised that he gave me the right change and food. Hence the 2 stars.",Fortune Cookie
522,I been ordering from here a long time and never in my life had a problem with this place but after today there is a bit problems almost took a hour to get my food for 2 things and after I ask how much they still me it's 15 something after telling me it was 12 something I wouldn't have no problems with that I didn't care but the way the delivery driver was talking to me was the most disrespectful thing I have heard talking to a 17 year old and after today I will be no longer ordering from here again till I get an apology I will not recommend to come here,"I was deeply disappointed last time when I ordered my food and I was called a stupid Nigger over the phone. Even though I proceeded to order the food when it came I noticed that I only received three wings instead of four. My brother had ordered pork fried rice with general Tso's chicken. Unfortunately when the food got here the chicken had like a very squishy texture like a rat. In addition, there was a black dot like an eyeball. If you are reading this, DO NOT EAT HERE!!! I got food poisoning and the workers are very rude. Please take this serious.",Used to be our favorite when my 11year old went to pay and get the food from the driver the driver asked for a tip and when my son didn't the driver started yelling at him next came the beef sticks that used to be huge chunks of marinated beef were dehydrated dried and the width of my pinky the fried fish must've been old they were very fishy tasting the beef and the shrimp lo mein noodles were over cooked and had barely a handful of bok choy no other veg and the large sizes ordered had a small amount of meat and shrimp fried dumplings were good so were the shrimp rolls. Smh when I called they wouldn't replace or do anything but they will tell the owner about scaring my kid... $40 wasted and will never go back they must be under new management because they're nothing like they used to be,Pretty good Chinese food take out. General tso or eggplant chicken is great. Guys this is not gourmet food. But I never had any bathroom related issues and it's good. Been ordering here for over 3+ years. I typically call and pick up the food.,"Rob Thomas said it best ""It was a hot one, like seven inches from the mid day son,"" and my manager worked hard. I decided to treat and get us some Chinese food. Mid you we didn't go there so this review is only covering service and food. When I called to order the people were super friendly. Some other people wanted food so we added on the order. With a order that large I figured it would take time. It didn't! They came fairly quick. The delivery guy was also nice so we tipped him well. The food was hot so I know it wasn't sitting and it looked fresh. But know the taste test would begin, was the food good. I couldn't believe how good the chicken was, I truly enjoyed it. The Lo Mien was good but I felt it needed more shrimp. I'm not complaining, they give you a lot of food and it taste amazing, I just want at least 10 pieces of shrimp and not 4 of them. I can say it's a place a can get use to going to. Next time I will go myself and get more pictures and also see if I could possibly get more shrimp.","This is the best Chinese food I've had, and I am comparing to places even when I lived in Queens and Brooklyn. The boneless spare ribs are my go to and they are always tender. The fried chicken is crispy and not over cooked. The fried rice taste fresh and not like it has been sitting for hours. The awesome thing is it never taste oily and I feel pretty decent after .",Golden Star Chinese Restaurant
523,Overrated. The workers here are so nasty and for an overpriced sandwich you'd think there would be a little more class.,ok first of all the sandwiches are first rate can't say anything too bad about that. However if you call ahead with a sandwich order you are told very nastily that the sandwiches won't be made until 11.  Do you not wanna do business? Also depending on their mood sometimes they can give you a single slice of meat in their sandwiches. I ordered 7 sandwiches and asked politely to pack in the meat and was charged about 4 extra $$$ per sandwich for extra meat 7 sandwiches cost me over $100 and like I said they are very nasty in that little shop it's almost like they know they are good but don't really care if you frequent the shop or not. If they are a sister to crown royal or filoncino those guys need to step in at this place.,3 out of 4 visits the sandwich was made wrong and today i asked for a side of balsamic and they gave me an attitude and put a drop in the little container. Im from Brooklyn and never had an issue with penatico or royal crown on the north shore but im definitely done with this place.,"Getting here is a bit tricky. You get to a light and the GPS says ""turn right"" (or left if you come from the opposite direction I did) and you think... here? It doesn't even look like a street. Then you drive down and think ""this is where people hide bodies.""  But eventually there are a few shops and finally this place is on the left. Parking is limited, and the area looks very industrial, but I found a spot. Interestingly, there were a ton of luxury cars parked over here too. Ok, onto the food...The #14 was hands down the best sandwich I've ever had. Bread was crunchy and soft at the same time, really amazing. And the reason this is a 5 star review.  I also got a large loaf of bread that was excellent, but the website leads you to think there are like 40 bread options and I only saw about 3 to take home. I got some rainbow cookies and cannoli as well. I wasn't a fan of the cannoli cream, but the shell was excellent. The rainbow cookies were a bit dense for me. I'd stick to sandwiches and bread here, other bakeries on the Island are doing a better job.","Only giving this place a 4 star because i'm not sure what a 5 star deli sandwich tastes like. I ordered a #56 and the bread was unbelievably toasty, great quality meat, and they also make their own mozzarella!","This is a full on Bread Factory that supplies a lot of the Islands stores and restaurants. The do have a small store front where you can buy a few fresh pastries, breads and a Sandwich. Sandwiches are all a combo of Sopersata, mortadella, Prosciutto, salami, mozz, hot pepper spread, eggplant, artichokes etc you get the gist. They are all numbered and you can't pick say the Prosciutto sopersata Pepper Spread but not balsamic since it's not the menu. This was freaking annoying. The girl had to stand there staring at me staring at the menu while trying to read a 100 different combination instead of just telling her. This does not expedite things this is just dumb. I get when it busy this is a good idea but not when I'm the single solitary customer. I did settle for the #14 PROSCIUTTO SOPRESSATA/MOZZ HOT PEPPER SPREAD $11.50It was good, crunchy fresh baked bread and nice salty cured meats and very spicy spread but it would have been better if I could've added balsamic or roasted peppers which they have but not in this combination of meat... ridiculous. As for the Cannoli it was delicious. Perfect crunch from the shell, cream was not sweet. Enjoyed it a lotAs for the sandwich combo issue maybe I'm to picky",Artisan Bakers Group

It's tailored for an experience: high retro chairs, wall couches, high tables and even a stage for I believe karaoke. After getting shaved ice and heading towards exit I stopped for a moment to look at this sophisticated glass machine. It turns out to be a NITRO freshly brewed coffee!

529,"Dominician restaurant in the heart of Perth Amboy NJ with ample seating at the counter and tables.I was so in a mood for good Spanish food so I decided to oder a typical meal of ox tails with white rice and red bean and their signature drink la Viagra which is basically carrot and orange juice mixed with sweet condensed milk.The drink drink Viagra was very good. It was what you would expect of a carrot orange juice and sweet condensed milk drink. Delicious and sweet. The white rice and red beans were typical Spanish flavor. But the big disappointment was the star of the show, The oxtails. But then I would think that they would be tender but unfortunately they were tough and hard. If you know anything about oxtails you have to cook them for at least three hours to make them tender. They are a very rough and tough meat that needs to be tenderized in the pressure cooker. Unfortunately my oxtails were hard and rough. Big disappointment. The total for my meal was $17 in which I think it's a little bit extreme for what I had ordered as a typical Spanish food plate. I will not be coming back.",Wish I can give this Restaurant a ZERO star. Came here with Group Of friends & sat downAnd we were giving menus and waitress didn't come back at all after sitting there for 30mins with the ladies at the counter looking and while stuffing her face with food. So upsetting ! Service here gotten worst.,"I wish i could give this restaurant 0 stars.  Sat there with my two friends, we were given menus and then no one ever came to take our order. There was one other table and the waitresses were just hanging out. We sat for about 30 minutes and then decided to leave. Terrible service. I will never give this establishment my money.",Great Spanish food in Perth Amboy.  One of my go-to spots for lunch.  I always get the grilled chicken with arroz condules.  This specific time I went they gave me white rice (good thing I checked before leaving).  After making them aware of the error they swapped the white rice for the correct rice (arroz condules).  Great vibe here.  Family style restaurant.  Check them out!,"Always Great Food,  However I recently visited on Friday 5/31 to buy food as I periodically do...& to no surprise I was ignored, happens often when I visit but this time it was extensive especially because the restaurant was not overcrowded, so it was noticeable not just from me but also the patrons (2 women) who were sitting at the counter. I stood in eye view of a group of waitresses who were behind the counter & all 4-5 of them totally ignored me as if I'm not almost 6feet without heels on...coupled with the uniqueness of my statuesque & beauty I might add, there is no way I am  invisible to the naked eye. At any rate, when one of the waitresses used her voice to  reach over my 6ft stature & ask the short Spanish woman behind me what she wanted to order, was when I decided my services, better yet my money was not wanted here in this establishment so I walked out. But not before one of the women that was sitting at the counter kindly intercepted & said wait a minute, weren't you standing there the whole time & did not get served or asked?  I said YES...& proceeded to walk out....That will be the last time Bonoa treats me like a 2nd class citizen which is what they do each time I walk in....pretend they don't see all of my Blackness & wait for prompting by their male manager then indiscreetly huff & puff their way over to me to take my order...Yes their food is good but there are soooooo many other great & tasty Spanish Food restaurants in Perth Amboy that is happy to serve me in exchange for money...I actually pay y'all like everybody else...this food that I buy from them is not given to me at the end of the night...Lol...All jokes aside because this treatment & blatant disrespect is not a joke....Going forward, I hope this establishment trains their employees to start serving women especially English speaking Black women the same way they hustle to & expeditiously run to serve men take their orders with a smile . ThkU for ReadingNamaste KLW","10-7-19 Hmmm think i'm revising my review.The staff there, didn't seem to care about the customers, too busy chatting with each other, as was the owner( he was too busy on his cell, but at least went outside) Ordered Sancocho soup & a side of white rice, husband ordered the Short ribs & arroz con gandules. Soup liukewarm at best, rice ( both of them warm) asked to have it heated up, they asked if we wanted it heated in the microwave ( said yes so i can see it) During all this , saw 1 young woman cut a piece of cake with plasticware, use her fingers to get off the excess & then lick her fingers, then put it in the microwave, to check the temperature touched it with the same fingers she licked,( never saw her wash her hands) couldn't look anymore.... Used to be a good place to eat, seems to be going downhill & i don't see any of the ladies that we know anymore.Think i'm done with Bonao's",Bonao Restaurant
530,"Drove up here from Philadelphia just to eat here with my girlfriend and there's a sign that says ""on vacation until September 4th""",I used to love ordering pizza from there (I was actually really sad when they went on vacation lol). Just got 2 regular slices and they look like they were out for 2 days! Tasted really bland and old I'm really disappointed,I live around the corner and decided to give this place a try for delivery. Called several times - both numbers and no answer.,Delicious food! Second time visiting- pizza by the slice delicious great Sicilian and Drunken (pizza vodka sauce) slices! Tried the chicken parmigiana with side of penne vodka today everything very fresh and tasty pasta served al dente -had plenty of left over to take home- big portions -real deal Italian food can't go wrong. Staff were very attendant to us- thanks!,Think it's under new management. Stopped in for bite to eat and found they have quick table service. Server was also very friendly. Salad and pizza were alright.,"So, I have been eating at Bruno's for a very long time and within the last few months it was sold to new owners.  Whenever that happens sadly, many restaurants either go downhill or is just not as good as they can be.  I am happy to say that's not the case at Bruno's.  The new owners are doing a great job of providing fantastic food! We've eaten there a few times recently and everything has been great.  The pizza is delicious and they always have a variety of types of pies to choose from.  The other day I had the chicken noodle soup (home made by the way) and it is as good as my families home made!! They also had chicken & rice available! This is a great neighborhood pizza place and the owners are friendly and are truly happy to have you eat there!! Enjoy!!",Bruno's Pizzeria
531,"My spouse and I regular patrons of other locations, and decided to try this specific location because we were visiting his parents in the area. HUGE MISTAKE! We called to place an order for pickup consisting of a whole chicken with three sides. After we picked up our order, we arrived home only to discover that we received the wrong entree. Instead of the whole chicken, we received a container with a quarter chicken, fries, and a salad. We called the restaurant and informed them of the mistake. The young lady who answered (and who also took my initial order and packaged our food) told me that we needed to come back to get the correct entree on an already cold and rainy night. Once we arrived, the young lady presented us with a whole chicken. However, we kindly explained that we would like our entire order prepared over because the sides were cold and soggy. She told us that they will not prepare our order again. Instead of making a fuss, we simply stated we would like our money back. She stated that they will not refund our money and that there was nothing they could do. I asked to speak to a manager or owner and she stated that they do not have one. The young lady then completely ignored us for ~ 10 mins to tend to other customers. To make a long and frustrating story short, I had to practically beg the young lady to refund our entire order. I refuse to patron this restaurant ever again. I have never in my life experienced customer service this poor. Not once did anyone apologize for the inconvenience. I wish there was an option to leave a review with ZERO STARS!",No one speaks English ... & if you don't know how to speak Spanish they don't treat you the same .I order chicken rice & fries the chicken didn't look cooked it was mostly pink all around the rice was hard & the fries we're stale so I told her that they weren't good & stale they come back with the same plate w the same fries !! They put the stale old fries in the oil to cook again .. at that point I put the food to the side & they didn't ask me they let me sit there for a while hour .. & then when I go up to pay for my drink she tried to make me pay for something I didn't even touch . Never again !! They new cooks & new staff that know how to speak both languages!!!,"My husband was craving ceviche so he looked up the nearest Peruvian restaurant. This was such a disappointment. We ordered ceviche mixto over rice which was sadly tasteless, the seafood was stiff, dry & smelled bad. I ordered chicken tomatoes/onions in soy sauce over spaghetti, it was also very mediocre. No taste. The appetizers, cauza de pastado (mash potatoes with avocado) wasn't worth talking about either. For this type of food; the prices are too high. This place needs a serious makeover!",Absolutely delicious Peruvian food!! Our waiter Sebastian was awesome. He gave us the perfect recommendation of dishes to order. Will definitely be back!!!  Thanks again Sebastian,Came here for lunch and I won't be coming back. Got rotisserie chicken with rice and salad. The chicken was dry and the rice was old. It tasted like it was from the night before rice that was just heated up in the microwave. Didn't even finish my food. Not coming back here next time I'll just go to El Iman way better Peruvian food and service.,"Fairly decent Peruvian chain restaurant. Fast, friendly service and food was pretty ok though a little over priced for what was actually served. I don't remember it being particularly flavorful but serviceable nonetheless (the ceviche on my last visit was sadly bland). Smells undeniably fantastic from outside. If you happen to stroll by and you're even a little hungry, chances are you're going in.",Don Alex Restaurant
532,This place is absolute garbage. The guy taking my order took 15 minutes to figure out if they even sold rolls and when I bought a Snapple from here it was somehow sour. I've never had a Snapple that's gone bad before until I went to this place. I also asked for a whole wheat everything with bacon and cream cheese and when I ordered it the guy said they didn't have whole wheat everything bagels when a whole batch was sitting right in front of my face on the counter. I had to hand it to him and explain what a whole wheat everything was. Never coming to this place again.,Completely burnt bagel... This isn't the first time this has happened. The quality of their food and establishment has been steadily declining.,"I placed order online. When i got notification about pickup, they were still working on my order. Two times girl went back to kitchen and two times she was tell me ""5 more minutes"". Food quality was not so great, bacon was over fried and too salty. Not a place to go for second time",Uhh bagels the size of your head with actual good amount of cream cheese in it. Bacon Egg and Cheese double the size of anywhere else. I don't know what people are ordering here but if you stick to breakfast staples can't go wrong. Some of the best bagels in the NJ / NYC area.,Definitely DO NOT recommend this place. Went here on a Sunday afternoon. A few things that stood out to me: - place is a deli with some tables (awkward)- place was FILTHY but hey we were there already and still decided to give it a try - waiter was nice but he took our order then disappeared - counter girl was on her phone the entire time and did not see us trying to catch her attention - there is a bird nest next to one of the cameras?!?!? Food was decent. Nothing to rave about. Place needs a complete renovation/new staff to actually succeed. Sad but true.,"A great place for breakfast. They have a wide assortment of delicious bagels They also serve good wraps for lunch.overall, it's a relaxed and fine restaurant to visit. I highly recommend it for your dining by pleasure.",Bagel Bistro Diner & Grill
533,Trapped in concourse c with a long layover.  Overpriced choices.  We ate here.  Salads werent bad for 11 and 12 dollars. Pizza 18+ ok.  Artichoke dip was a bunch of artichokes.  Service was horrible.  Never saw waitress after food brought.Couldn't add mushrooms to a pepperoni pizza.,"I ordered a salad  that was missing part of the ingredients on the display when I ordered it. In addition, I ordered a hot tea and their baked artichoke. The waitress brought my salad after a few minutes but no drink. As I started to eat the salad I noticed it was missing the basil and garbanzos (see pic). I asked her and she went back to the kitchen. Came back and said it doesn't come with it. I showed her the picture from the menu, she once again went back and came back saying that it doesn't say it comes with it. The basil was listed on the description but not the garbanzos. I advised her that's false advertisement bc you're marketing a pic with ingredients you don't have. I told her I did not want the salad. At this time she still hadn't brought my tea nor artichoke. The manager came over and apologized but i feared they would spit or do something to rest of my order and asked for my full refund. Thank him and left. But I noticed he didn't refund the tip... She could've handled it better by checking before telling me they don't have the ingredients and placing the salad back after I told her I didn't want it. The manager agreed that it should be the way on the pic. By taking out ingredients yet charging full price is not the way to go. Just saying.","It's an airport restaurant, I went in with low standards. The waitress insisted she seat us, but the dining room floor was empty. So that's an awkward start to service. You have to order from ipads on the table - but the ipad was placed in such a terrible location basically making it hard to share food like pizza. And to make matters worse, my ipad was filthy and covered in a red sauce from someone before me. We ordered a margarita pizza and a salad - the pizza was underwhelming and the salad had dressing that was too acidic to even finish. The people that sat down next to us happened to order the exact same thing - and their food looked WAY better than ours. Their version of the same pizza had fresh basil and herbs on top, more cheese than ours. If given options, I would skip this place - if you walk further down the concourse there is a food court.","For airport food, Forno Magico is not bad.  My 7 year old loves the pizza.  The Caesar salad was good.  The kids burger is also good.  Service was fast and friendly.  Our biggest complaint is that you have to order on an iPad at your table and the iPad flashes ads at you the entire time you're eating.  It was beyond annoying.","Really couldn't believe the reviews when I saw them! The food here was extraordinary, staff was really attentive and friendly. I genuinely loved the food, wine, tv access and overall appeal of the place. I didn't post the calamari, but I recommend as an app! Cozy place for a long layover. Will be stopping by when we're back around!",Located in Newark airport.Didn't expect a good pizza at the airport especially after super good pizza we had in Connecticut.Ordered clam and meatball pizza and we were sold!The dough was so tasty of course clams and meatball also.IPad thing on the table was fun also.IPA was tasty.,Forno Magico
534,"We've just tried it today, the food wasn't good, the shrimp dumplings were almost raw and we're a bit empty with very little filling and didn't taste like shrimp at all, they tasted a bit raw on the inside, the food was very underwhelming, and get very little for what you order,its not really worth spending money at this place","I have been coming to this place for probably 25 years plus. They have been for the most part on the money every time. Good quality food at a reasonable price. Not the cheapest and not the most expensive. But you get what you pay for. They are usually 20 minutes or less sometimes for delivery (only live around the block).   Can't remember the last time we had something we didn't like or they messed the order up.Only thing I don't like is that on the menu they don't have half orders, and when you do ask for one they charge almost the full amount.","The employees here are just miserable. They are so rude. And you can't even give them a get out of jail free pass & say well maybe they're having a bad day bc every freaking day is a bad day for them. They have no good customer service etiquette what so ever. Even if you're a regular customer no smile no hru doing gd 2cu!. And the food is not even that great. Average take out. Bland and greasy. Also, don't get me started if you want to customize your food. I ordered a fried rice & told them no onions & wanted extra eggs instead. Can you believed them had the nerve to charge me an extra $1.00 for the egg. For that they should've scramble the whole dam dozen eggs. When you empty the box it wasn't even extra. It looked like they only used one SMALL egg. What a rip-off. Also, ordered the mini eggs. Looked like they fried it in the whole tub of crisco.  Very greasy & they didn't put any duck sauce or mustard in the bag. Who the hell eats an egg roll w/o any sauce. Stay away from this place. It sucks. Order a pizza instead. Horrible food horrible workers. Rather go to mcd's",Decent takeout. The food doesn't send us immediately to the bathroom.  Their lo mein noodles are thicker than most places.  General tso is good usually. Their boneless spare ribs are good but the sauce is not the best.  Their mini egg rolls are awesome.  Definitely worth the price.  Only problem is delivery is LONGGGGG and slow could be over an hour sometimes. .,"I order lucky fortune through yelp more than I'd like to admit lol and I've never had a complaint. Prices are fair, solid food. And what's really cool is the food gets here way quicker than anywhere else.. and there's a few Chinese spots closer to me. Love you old reliable lucky fortune... P.S. we miss your buffet","Used to be the best Chinese in great kills, new owners now. They dumped money into trying to make the inside look swanky, but changes the recipes everything is lower quality now. The wanton used to have nice dark green bok choy in a dark brown broth that was flavorful like it had cooked for a long time. Now they throw 7 scallion rings in some chicken broth. Beef and broccoli comes as broccoli with a little beef.",Lucky Fortune Chinese Restaurant
535,"Chicken salad dressing was not put along with the salad. Pasta fagiole had a ton of cannellini beans and not enough tomatoe. This was my  first time visit, I doubt I will be going back there for a while.10/4/2019. Updating my review to 1 star. 2nd visit to this place to give them the benefit of the doubt. Restaurant did not have order started at eta of completion. On top of that, I spoke to 2 people as soon as I got there, and neither put in the order until a third person came along!!! And on top of that, I waited for 30 minutes after I was told it would be 15. Eta for completion was 6:12, I got there at 6:10 and left at 6:45 (Original Order was placed at 6:42). Talk about finishing up my 12 hour workday with a bang. This was the second time we ordered from this place. First time 2 months ago, they got our order wrong. We had our in laws over for pizza tonight and we wanted to give Johnny Napkins another try..... #fail. And..... they have a sign stating something to the extent of ""of something went wrong to let their team members know"" the team members could have cared less that I waited there for 33 minutes after my order was supposed to be done at 6:12. All the team members there are very cool with each other and saying ""f this and f that"". Maybe if they werent playing around so much, they could have had my order ready at the time it was supposed to be ready. 20 Minutes into my waiting in the restaurant an employee goes to me ""Hey bud what are you waiting for"" i told 3 people already, i dont feel like telling a 4th, and I am not your bud. On top of saying all of this, i will say that the pizza was one of the better pizzas in the area, but the level of unprofessionalism and lack of self awarenes by management to address the foolishness behind the counter, was worthy of a 1 star review.And if you are management from Johny Napkins and you are reading this, i want you to know that i seldomly write reviews, even when i dont like the food at a place. This should tell you how terrible this experience was.","The food at this place is absolutely amazing and deserves 5 stars without a doubt, but the customer service is terrible which is the reason for the 1 star review. If you order something that they do not have, they either send you nothing or they send whatever they choose as a replacement. I once ordered the rice ball parm appetizer and when my delivery arrived, I had mozz sticks instead. The same has happened on numerous occasions with fries, a buffalo roll, and other menu items. Instead of calling and letting you know that they don't have something they just make a decision for you. Also, they apparently ""don't deliver after 830pm"" when they close at 10, even when you're house is less than 5 minutes away. It seems like there is just always an excuse for them to not deliver after 8pm. The ONLY thing that keeps me coming back is the quality of the food, but the customer service is what deserves 1 star.","Bummed. Pizza doesnt look like online photo. Where did red sauce come from? What happened to all the cheese? Not the greatest, wont order again.","I love this place! Their pepperoni rolls and garlic bread are to die for! The reason for 4 stars though is because the food can be inconsistent sometimes. Other than that, it's always a go to for us.  Great place!","I recently moved to NJ and ordered from this place for the first time the night we moved in. Though a little pricey, I can still give it up for Johnny Napkins.  We've since ordered regularly and plan to continue doing so. The food always comes as indicated but more frequently sooner than expected. The hot foods are always hot, but not too hot and my fave is the chicken Cesar salad. The delivery staff are always cheerful and respectful.",I was bummed I couldn't locate the other joint I found last year on my way back to the airport. Found this place in a pinch on Yelp instead. Saw the decent reviews so decided to give it a go. A little pricey but I figured what the heck. I was in a rush.It was a good sandwich. Definitely a legit one. Satisfied my craving for a chicken parm.,Johnny Napkins
536,If I can give this place zero stars I would. Ordered delivery. Ordered veal parmigiana no sauce so just the cheese since my brother has GERD and cannot eat sauce. Instead they send veal parmigiana no cheese.  Called up the place after waiting almost an hour to receive the food and they said they would fix it. I waited a half hour to send me what was supposed to be the corrected order.  I live literally three minutes from the place. Well guess what WRONG AGAIN! This time they sent veal parmigiana with with sauce and cheese. I called to complain about it and the person on the phone was extremely rude basically insisting it had to be us that ordered it wrong. If it was use why would we complain about the sauce the original time? After an hour and 45 minutes of waiting for dinner we just demanded my account be credited. This place is not worth the aggravation. Will never order from here again.,We ordered food and they brought the wrong order not once but both times and took an hour and 45 mins for delivery and acted likeWe were in the wrong when we demanded the money back smh they suck stay away,"Order was supposed to be delivered within 40 minutes. Had to call twice about the order once was an hour after the order was placed and I was told it was ""on it's way"" called 30 minutes after that call and was told that the person shouldn't have told me that as they lost part of the ticket. Why not call at that point? Why did that person lie? When I called them out on that they just said sorry that they said that, did nothing to want to keep me as a customer which is a good job by them because there is no way I will order from them again.","Love this place, best buffalo slice EVER! Also their chicken parm slice is delicious!","Definitely my pizza place . Conveniently located Ordering pizza from here all the time ! I'm not a pizza person , but I have to say my kids are very picky if it comes to food - they love Justinos pizza didn't try much from their menu bc I like to cook but it is a Great place and super fast service !!!

537,"Very simple... I will NEVER give this restaurant another cent of my earned money!It took over an hour to receive my order on a Wednesday night.The food was ice cold.I was charged the ""new"" prices, even though I ordered off their menu on their website.The egg roll was disgusting.The shrimp with lobster sauce was watery and lacking anything other than a few shrimp. No flavor at all. How dare they pawn this off as lobster sauce!!The LoMein had the absolute minimum amount of meat and veggies.When I called to complain, the ""lady boss"" got real testy with me.I would highly recommend you find a different place to eat.Zero stars would be fitting.","Soups, beef & broccoli, too salty. Roast pork egg foo young not really good. Roast pork fried rice tasteless. Noodles soggy. No booths, but a respectable amount of space between the tables. Food was slow in coming out of the kitchen and the restaurant was practically empty. Restaurant is spotless, as is the bathrooms.","Food is decent, at best. Boneless ribs were drowning in sauce. A little too salty, also. The combo comes with pork fried rice. Now since I am ordering boneless PORK ribs, I thought it would make sense to ask for chicken fried rice, instead of pork fried rice. The nasty woman on the phone refused. Said I would have to order chicken fried rice on the side, and obviously pay full price for it.. Don't know why they wouldn't substitute. Also asked for shrimp to be added to the rice, and yep, you guess it.. Absolutely not allowed. I'm done with this sub-par place.","Freshest tasting Chinese food I've had in the area. Oil doesn't taste old and everything tastes like it was made in store, not all from a bag. It might not be the same taste you are used to, but to me that's a good thing.",Local Chinese is delish! Never had a issue in all the years ordering ! Keep upThe good work,Extremely overpriced and the food is just ok. Don't waste your time or money.

Convenient to order through yelp/grub hub and fast to order at the pizzeria for pick up.,The Pizza was good but a little salty.The Chicken Caesar  Salad was fine.,"Tried to order through GrubHub and they cancelled without any explanation. Thought their was an issue with the card I used so I tried again and selected cash. They then proceeded to call me to say they couldn't take my order because I'm too far (3.1 miles to be exact. That's fine with me but then they shouldn't be available to order from through any apps if I'm ""too far"".","Very good thin crust, and you can specify how thin or thick you want your Neopolitan. Their Vodka sauce is delicious and almost everything is, from the huge Spinach Rolls, which were very garlicky just like I like it. Their fried Calimari is always fresh and their Hot Antipasto is a very good portion for the price. They give you 3 large Eggplant Rolatini, 4 jumbo shrimp, several stuffed mushrooms and 4 or 5 baked clams for like $12. I've been ordering from here for years and it's the best pizzeria in Eltingville overall.",Buffalo pizza is so creamy and not so spicy just the way I like it. The dough here is just perfect! I love this pizzeria. My favorite to go to whenever I'm close by,I've been eating here for quite some time.  They have some great pies! Their regular cheese pizza is delish and I love the vodka pie.  Quick and fast delivery.  The garlic knots and zeppoles can be hit or miss.  The chicken rolls and chicken parm heroes are tasty as well.  We enjoy going to Frank and Danny's and will continue to do so :),Frank & Danny's Pizzeria
539,"This place has gone down the tubes, the food is just terrible and overpriced. I ordered the J and B special #2 and added pepperoni to the pizza. I added 2 beef patties, mozzarella sticks, and a rice ball. All for $51.62 which is astronomical for the quality of their food. The garlic knots were stale and burnt, with a hard ass over cooked pizza.The mozzarella sticks were ok and the wings were fine. Stay away.  That is all.","SLOWEST DELIVERY EVER!!!!!!Placed an order online and told 40 minute delivery timeframe from the time the order was placed. My order was placed at 6pm and did not receive until 7:45 damn near 8pm. Called the pizzeria 3 times while waiting for my delivery to be told 5 minutes everytime.  Of course the food is unacceptably cold. Flavor no were near the best and damn sure not worth the unacceptable, unprofessional wait. NEVER AGAIN!!!!","I made an order for delivery through the Slice app for a large (18 inch) pie and 2 liter Pepsi. Upon arrival, I noticed the pie only had six slices. I thought maybe the pie was just cut wrong so I got the tape measure to test the diameter and it turned out they sent me a medium (16 inch) pie instead.I called back and explained the situation. She asked if any of the pizza had been eaten already, which of course it had. It's food, I ordered it because we were hungry. Since a bite was taken out of a slice, she told me there was nothing they could do. She said if none of the pizza was eaten, they would've come to take it back and replaced it with the correct order. Instead of owning up to their mistake and making it right, the staff chose to argue with me about the price I paid for my order. They claimed they only charged me for the medium size, which was a lie. When I asked to speak to a manager they claimed no one in charge was on duty. I had to call a couple of times in order to get the price difference refunded.This place is trash. The customer service is trash.  Never again.","This was pretty good pizza, but the prices are steep.  I went with 4 specialty slices- BBQ, buffalo, penne, and vodka chicken. With 1 soda, it came to $19. Ouch. The deals on the wall said 1 large sicillian, 16 garlic knots and a 2 liter was only $21, so how mine was $19 is a mystery. ANYWAY... the pizza was pretty good. A little floppy at the tip, but they are very generous with the toppings. Every chicken slice I had had a ton of good tasting, fresh chicken. But, I did go in at 11:15am, so I probably got the first slice from the fresh pies. The buffalo slice was SPICY! which I like, but if you aren't ready for that you are in for a surprise. The crust was nice a crunchy and the slices were nice and big. Overall, expensive but solid.",Stopped in for a slice after doing some shopping today... had a salad slice and a rice ball which was delicious!!!,"The best pizza on Staten Island and that is for sure, huge slices great taste and it is hard to find good pizza on Staten Island . Most pizzeria's can' t get it right , but this one sure can . Excellent everytime and the price is great.",J and B Pizzeria Restaurant
540,"Ordered the fried pork chops, they were a little greasy but that is not my biggest issue. My main concern was the condition that they gave me my ceasar salad in, it was absolutely drenched in dressing. I do not usually post photos but I will on this occasion because because I was literally disgusted and I contacted grubhub immediately afterwards.Will not be ordering from here again.",The two stars are for their chicken soup which is flavorfuland fresh. I had to deduct for not so great customer service and their chicken empanadas have a frozen after taste. They do not seem to be made fresh on a daily basis and I've tried them on several occasions. I also think they enforce better sanitary practices they talk over the food and do not wear gloves when serving the food. Don't think I will return for a while.,"I was in the mood for some Spanish food today during lunch so I decided to order from here because my coworker told me about his place and honestly WORSE mistake ever! I was totally disappointed! I thought I was going to enjoy my lunch but I really didn't. I ordered ""Arroz con guandules y pollo al horno"" and the food had no taste at all.
